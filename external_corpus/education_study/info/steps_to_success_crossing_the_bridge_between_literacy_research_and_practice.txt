Foreword

          Kathleen A. Hinchman

My first class roster as a newly minted, suburban middle school reading teacher in the 1970s
was 85% male and 100% White. Kind boys all, they changed my flat tires, gave me their Hal-
loween candy, and apologized when they were naughty. They also missed school for hunt-
ing season, punched each other to resolve disputes, described story characters with racial
slurs, and qualified for free and reduced price lunches. They could not decode multisyllabic
words or discuss main ideas and details with any precision, and they knew it. As a result, they
lacked the wherewithal to complete homework assignments unless we did them together.
Most tested at a third- to fourth grade "reading level," yet they did not qualify as "learning
disabled" because of "reading potential" that was measured as commensurate with "cognitive
ability." They enacted their hopelessness by taking standardized tests stoned on cough syrup
despite my warnings that high school course selections depended on their performance.

   While I was teaching, Kenneth Goodman (1967), Frank Smith (1971), and Richard Anderson
and colleagues (1977) were exploring the role of prior knowledge in reading comprehension.
Scholars like P. David Pearson and Dale Johnson (1978), and my advisor, Harold Herber (1978),
followed with instructional recommendations that incorporated important insights from this
research about attending to students' prior knowledge, work that resonated with me as meth-
ods that could be helpful for my students. I went to graduate school, excited about doing
research in this same vein.

   However, at the same time, Dolores Durkin (1978-1979) and Richard Allington (1984) pub-
lished research that described the limited implementation of such new ideas, and the National
Commission on Excellence in Education (1983) chastised us for not helping all students partic-
ipate in the global economy in a report called, A Nation at Risk: The Imperative for Education
Reform. As a result, my own work also took a turn toward exploring how reading instruction
was situated in schools, and I decided to explore why content area teachers did not support
students' reading despite decades of research suggesting they should do so (Hinchman, 1985).

   Why do I begin this foreword with a brief, biased history of literacy education from my
perspective? Each theoretical and research advance in literacy instruction that I have experi-
enced over the past 30 years has brought new affordances and challenges to educators' ability
to meet the needs of all students. These, too, are contentious times in the educational world:
Common Core State Standards and assessment-tied teacher evaluations have positioned lit-
eracy instruction and assessment at the center of this contention: ironically, the literacy skills
that are the most reliably tested do not reflect the wide array of communicative skills that
the Common Core Standards and others suggest as what is needed by our young people in
today's uber competitive world. The world of literacy research can seem to offer a miasma of
competing ideas about how to proceed with literacy instruction and programs in this context.

   This text, Steps to Success: Crossing the Bridge Between Literacy Research and Practice,
addresses today's practice-driven questions about how to help young people live successful
lives as literate human beings. I am proud to note that its editor and authors were all suc-
cessful Syracuse University literacy education doctoral students. Their research, like mine,
addresses gaps they have observed between classroom reality and what we know about
embracing students' literacy strengths to address their needs. The chapters that follow are
in the same vein, offering practical suggestions based on their research by identifying affor-

                                                                                                                                                Foreword | v
dances and challenges of current approaches to literacy instruction and delineating clear
paths for educators to follow.

   The pluralistic approach to literacy instruction represented by this text means that readers
will brand it a "keeper" after an initial read. The text as a whole provides a needed and useful
overview of how current K-12 literacy instructional approaches are situated in a standards-
driven world. Each chapter includes a nice balance of research-based instructional practices
that address a wide array of students' needs. The practical support offered by Steps to Success:
Crossing the Bridge Between Literacy Research and Practice will be invaluable to educators who
want to provide effective literacy instruction in today's contentious, standards-driven world.

Steps to Success: Crossing the Bridge Between Literacy Research and Practice provides a rich
review of literacy instruction. With an initial focus on literacy research, and chapters span-
ning literacy development to adolescent instruction, it has a wide appeal. Additionally, the
text addresses writing and English Language Learning, two areas commonly omitted from the
conversation.

   One strength of this text is that each chapter follows an accessible structure of stating the
goals for the chapter, presenting a well-crafted image of the current state of research, and
culminating with questions to consider. Each chapter affords the reader an overview of the
aspect of literacy instruction; how it fits within the whole of literacy learning, key viewpoints,
instructional methods and concerns. These considerations make an often daunting subject
much more accessible.

   While this textbook would be a valuable read at any stage in a graduate program, its broad
scope, lends to using various chapters in separate courses such as Foundations of Literacy
Development, Methods and Materials of Elementary Reading, Adolescent Literacy and Action
Research. As an open textbook it provides rich resources for graduate and undergraduate
instruction in education, literacy, and teacher research.

   Sharon M. Peck is an associate Professor of Literacy in the School of Education at SUNY Gene-
seo. She teaches graduate coursework in literacy instruction and runs an urban literacy clinic.
She actually misses teaching action research and strives to empower all teachers to be avid
consumers of research. She enjoys working with in-service teachers, researching language arts,
community place based education, storytelling and puppetry.

As an edited volume, Steps to Success: Crossing the Bridge between Literacy Research and
Practice is unusual in being comprehensive and concise without sliding into shallowness or
superficiality. It addresses many of the most compelling topics being debated among liter-
acy professionals right now, providing a welcoming but not overwhelming introduction to
the field for newcomers. Each contributing author has conducted recent original research
in the area(s) about which he or she writes, lending credibility and currency to each review
of the existing knowledge base (as well as refreshing candor about where that knowledge
base remains incomplete). Authors write invitingly, with accessible examples, and offer well-
crafted questions and activities to cement and extend readers' understandings of the content.

   Each chapter is designed to stand alone, allowing higher-education instructors or school-
based leaders such as principals, curriculum coordinators, or literacy coaches in charge of
professional development to assign one or more selections aligned with a particular topic.
That said, the volume is most powerful in my view when multiple chapters are read in con-
versation with each other, as numerous threads--the importance of high expectations for
all, the need to expand what counts as literacy and for whom, the key role of teachers as
decision makers--cut across various contributions. Although different authors employ differ-
ent theoretical lenses, they share obvious core commitments about literacy, pedagogy, and
equity grounded in their common preparation at Syracuse University as teacher educators
and researchers. This shared background creates coherence across the collection, while the
contributors' wide range of interests and current professional affiliations offers diversity of
perspective. Each author represents a distinctive voice within a predictably structured chap-
ter outline.

   The book would have represented an important contribution to the field in a print-based
volume offered by a traditional academic publisher. That it is available online, via Open SUNY
Textbooks, extends its reach and makes it all the more important.

                                     Abstract

This chapter provides an overview of what literacy is and why it is important, along with
some key questions designed to assess background knowledge related to literacy teaching
and learning. At the end of the chapter, tips are provided to students and teacher educators
for how to get the most from the textbook. A series of activities is also provided to deepen
understanding of literacy and to facilitate planning for becoming an effective teacher of liter-
acy.

   Learning Objectives

        After reading this chapter, readers will be able to

      1. discuss different ways to define literacy and other literacy-related terms, along with rea-
           sons why definitions have evolved;

      2. explain the role of literacy as a gateway to all learning and why strong literacy skills are
           essential for functioning in a contemporary, globalized society;

      3. discuss the scope of literacy knowledge prior to reading the rest of the textbook, and for-
           mulate a plan for how to add to what is known;

      4. summarize ways to use this textbook to gain knowledge about literacy teaching and learn-
           ing.

                                  Introduction

If you took to the streets one day to find out how people define literacy, chances are you
would get a lot of different answers. Literacy is one of those terms that at first seems straight-
forward, but as pointed out by Keefe and Copeland (2011), asking people to define literacy
"deceptively suggests simplicity, but instead opens up a world of complexity" (p. 92).

   Because there are so many different ways people think about literacy, it is worthwhile to
examine some ideas associated with it. For example, the United Nations Educational, Scien-
tific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO, 2009-2014) has discussed literacy not just in refer-
ence to teaching practices in U.S. schools but in reference to the meaning of literacy across
the world. Two key components to their description are that literacy is a "fundamental human
right" and is the "foundation for lifelong learning" (para. 1).

 My Burgeoning Understanding of the Meanings of Literacy

I did not really begin to appreciate literacy as a fundamental human right until I started work-
ing in schools. My first professional career was as a school psychologist, and in this role, I had

                                                                                                                                                                  1
many opportunities to observe children who had developed extraordinarily high levels of lit-
eracy, and also many children who had not. As part of my job, I worked with teams to find out
which students who were struggling had learning disabilities in literacy areas, such as reading,
listening comprehension, oral expression, and written expression. I became perplexed when
I realized that a rather large number of students who were having trouble developing literacy
skills did not necessarily have learning disabilities. So I delved into research on literacy and
discovered that what I observed was common in many schools across the nation.

   As I continued to research literacy, I found many sources of information that included rec-
ommendations for how to teach literacy but comparably fewer sources that featured credible
research on the effectiveness of recommended methods. It seemed like almost everyone had
an opinion about the best ways to teach literacy, but there was not a lot of research to back up
these opinions. Part of the problem was that there were far too many approaches to teaching
literacy for people to research. After all, teachers make hundreds of instructional decisions
per day, and not all of these decisions can be supported by expensive studies that may take
years to conduct. But an additional and bewildering problem was that some sources of infor-
mation continued to include teaching recommendations that high quality research studies
had determined were not effective. Keep in mind that these experiences occurred before the
preoccupation with accountability that now exists in U.S. schools, so the positive or negative
effects of instruction were not as closely monitored.

   One principal I met told me that she believed that many ineffective practices were con-
nected to the "love curriculum." When I asked her what she meant, she told me that some
educators simply cling to teaching what they love, regardless of the effects on students. I also
began to wonder if at least part of the problem was that teachers were not made aware of
quality research findings that could better inform their practices. Many teachers could point
to a citation in a written document as proof that a practice was research-based, but when I
began to track down citation sources, I would often find links to new sources and citations
that never led to credible research backing the original claim. I realized how confusing and
frustrating the research landscape must be for teachers seeking information. If it was taking
me hours to track down and evaluate research evidence for a claim made in a teacher publi-
cation, I could not imagine what it would be like for teachers to try to access this information,
all while managing a full time teaching job.

   As I continued my search for answers for why so many students were struggling with lit-
eracy, I came across a rather dense article by Vellutino et al. (1996) that strongly influenced
my perspective on literacy development, and ultimately influenced my choice of career. Since
I do not have enough space or most readers' attention to describe the study in full detail, I
will just describe the part of the study that shifted my worldview. The researchers evaluated
a large group of kindergarten students across multiple schools to gauge the students' read-
ing levels and cognitive skills (e.g., memory and language processing). Then, in first grade,
half of the children with the lowest reading levels received 30-minute sessions of high quality
tutoring, while the other half received the usual interventions and supports provided by their
schools. What the researchers found was that after only one semester of tutoring, 67% of the
low readers raised their reading scores to be average or above average. The reason why this
study's findings were a game changer for me was that a commonly held belief was that chil-
dren who were having difficulty learning how to read must have something wrong with them,
and that it is part of a school psychologist's job to figure out what was wrong with the child.
What Vellutino and colleagues discovered was that the majority of first grade students who
struggled with reading could learn to read quite well, but the trick was focusing on the kind
of instruction children needed rather than focusing on what was wrong with children.

2 | 1. A Brief Introduction to Literacy
   As a school psychologist, my practice began to shift from seeking explanations of literacy
problems based on fixed factors within the child, to seeking solutions within the instructional
environment. I narrowed my literature searches to prevention and intervention studies, and I
began to attend numerous professional development sessions on these topics. As my exper-
tise grew, there also grew a demand for me to share what I was learning with teachers, school
psychologists, and administrators in surrounding schools. Each year, I was asked to provide
more staff development at local area schools, and I began to realize that what I really wanted
to do was teach others about literacy. Since the study by Vellutino et al., a broad array of infor-
mative studies have been published with credible research findings to inform literacy teach-
ing practices.

   As a result of this chain of events, I ended my 12-year career as a school psychologist and
went back to school to obtain a Ph.D. in Reading Education at Syracuse University. I decided
that I not only wanted to share existing research on literacy, but I also wanted to learn how
to conduct research myself. It was at this point that I began to conceptualize literacy in the
same way that UNESCO discussed it--as a "fundamental human right . . . foundation[al] for
lifelong learning" (para. 1). I began to feel a social obligation to work toward helping students
achieve high levels of literacy. It is this journey that has led me to co-author and edit this text-
book for you, since what you do will have a major influence on what your students know and
can do, not only in your classroom, but for the rest of their lives. This textbook will not only
provide you with access to research information but will also instruct you on how to eval-
uate research claims and how to locate trustworthy information about literacy practices. I
want you to join me in helping students achieve high levels of literacy. Reading and discussing
information within the chapters of this textbook are important steps in our work together.

   In addition to the influence of Vellutino et al. (1996) on my thinking, I have had numerous
other epiphanies that have shaped my future teaching, writing, and research. One notable
moment occurred while I was conducting a research project with a diverse group of students,
in which about a quarter of them spoke a language other than English at home and where
there were six different races/ethnicities represented among them. On a day that I was
observing at a school, a reading teacher was testing a little boy who was African American
and had a medical condition that required numerous visits to the school nurse. Based on the
reading teacher's assessment, it became apparent that the child was experiencing consider-
able difficulties developing his skills in reading and writing. My moment of insight occurred as
I walked with the little boy to the nurse, alongside the reading teacher. I suddenly recognized
how every dimension of this child contributed to his literacy development. These dimensions
included his family, his race and culture, his gender, his feelings, his peers, his teachers, his
physical needs, and so many other identities and experiences that resulted in this little boy
needing to leave his classroom to see the school nurse because he had not gotten enough to
eat at breakfast.

   Other moments of insight arrived to me at similarly unexpected times. I can recall working
with a high school student who was probably one of the most intellectually gifted people I had
ever met. He was an avid reader who understood the world in such unique and sophisticated
ways, given the relatively short time he had existed in it. When I observed him in his classes,
he readily shared his knowledge and insights in class discussions; however, he simply would
not engage in academic writing. Although his verbal reasoning was strong, his writing looked
like it came from a first or second grader. His handwriting was messy, his spelling was jum-
bled, and his ideas were disorderly. The student had been diagnosed with a serious medical
condition. His condition impacted his ability to express his ideas in writing but did not appear
to negatively impact his spoken language. I observed his use of literacy skills in science, math,

                                                                                                               1. A Brief Introduction to Literacy | 3
history, and the arts, and I also observed how difficult it was for teachers to understand and
accommodate the extremes in his literacy capabilities. For students at all grade levels, I began
to see how unique the learning of literacy was, along with how much teachers needed to know
and be able to do to teach literacy to diverse groups of learners.

 Discussion of Key Terms Used Throughout This Textbook

As you read this textbook, you will find that certain key terms, which are described below,
recur throughout many of the chapters. You will notice that some authors use these terms to
reflect broad meanings, whereas other authors use these terms to discuss only one or two
aspects of their meanings. Authors will signal to you what they mean when they use these
terms so that you can understand which aspects apply to each chapter.

Language Comprehension

In this textbook, the meaning of "language comprehension" is represented by a schematic
by Scarborough (2002) featured prominently in Chapters 3 and 4 of this textbook. Language
comprehension consists of the interweaving of language components, including the back-
ground knowledge someone has, along with knowledge of vocabulary, language structures
(e.g., grammar), verbal reasoning abilities, and literary knowledge (e.g., genres). In addition,
language comprehension also includes personal aspects of comprehension, such as the expe-
riences individuals draw upon to construct meaning (Shanahan et al., 2010).

Literacy

The term "literacy" is used in this textbook to refer to a wide range of skills and abilities
related to reading, writing, listening, speaking, viewing, and performing (National Governors
Association & Council of Chief State School Officers [NGA & CCSSO], 2010), along with an
array of perspectives that situate literacy within a sociocultural context. While traditional def-
initions of literacy have centered mostly on the ability to read and write, contemporary def-
initions include social practices, such as those associated with culture and power (Freire &
Macedo, 1987) that are interwoven among all literacy practices, including teaching, learning,
and using literacy. Furthermore, the digital age has brought forth innovative changes in how
people make meaning, so the term literacy also includes making meaning from different
modes of communication, which are described next.

Modes

In this textbook, the term "modes" is consistent with how the term is used in the New
London Group (1996), who defined modes to include traditional expressions of meaning
such as spoken and written language, as well as other forms of expression, including "Visual
Meanings (images, page layouts, screen formats); Audio Meanings (music, sound effects); Ges-
tural Meanings (body language, sensuality); Spatial Meanings (the meanings of environmental
spaces, architectural spaces); and Multimodal Meanings" (p. 80), which involve integration of
the other modes.

Reading Comprehension

The meaning of "reading comprehension" in this textbook is based on a definition by the
RAND Reading Study Group (Snow, 2002) and was also featured in an influential reading com-

4 | 1. A Brief Introduction to Literacy
prehension practice guide released by Institute of Education Sciences (Shanahan et al., 2010).
This definition includes "the process of simultaneously extracting and constructing mean-
ing through interaction and involvement with written language" (Snow, 2002, p. xiii) and the
"capacities, abilities, knowledge, and experiences" one brings to the reading situation (p. 11).

Text

In this textbook, the term "text" refers not only to printed documents but other forms of com-
munication in which a listener, speaker, reader, writer, or viewer can make meaning of a mes-
sage. While many chapter authors refer to texts as printed documents, other authors use the
term to refer to more diverse modes of communication, including:

       The social and cultural linkages among our reading of books, viewing of films and tele-
       vision, screening of videos, surfing the web, playing computer games, seeing advertis-
       ing billboards, and even wearing T-shirts and drinking from coffee mugs that belong
       to multimedia constellations. (Lemke, 2005, p. 4)

     Questions Related to Literacy Research and Practice

Included below are some questions to explore your background knowledge of literacy prior
to reading the rest of this textbook. Thinking about your background knowledge will help you
connect what you are about to learn with the funds of knowledge that you bring to learning
more about literacy research and practice.

 1. How does research contribute to what teachers do in classrooms with their students?
 2. How do young children learn how to recognize words and comprehend texts?
 3. What are some similarities and differences in how writing is taught to young children

      versus adolescents?
 4. What influence has the digital age had on literacy teaching and learning?
 5. What instructional strategies are most beneficial for English language learners?
 6. What do the terms "multimodality" and "new literacies" mean in reference to literacy

      teaching and learning?
 7. How do race, ethnicity, gender, disability, and linguistic factors impact the literacy

      opportunities of students from dominant and traditionally marginalized groups?

If you did not know how to fully answer most of the questions, then this textbook will provide
you with a wealth of information that you will need to know and be able to use to become an
effective teacher of literacy. Even if you have a great deal of background knowledge related to
literacy, this textbook will provide you with helpful examples for how to use that knowledge in
your teaching. See the "Questions and Activities" section at the end of this chapter for ideas
for how to create a learning plan to prioritize what knowledge and experiences you may want
to acquire to become or remain an effective teacher of literacy.

                        Overview of This Textbook

Steps to Success: Crossing the Bridge Between Literacy Research and Practice was written for
preservice and practicing teachers who want to better meet the needs of their students. The
book was written by authors with expertise spanning major topics in literacy. A fundamen-

                                                                                                               1. A Brief Introduction to Literacy | 5
tal goal in the creation of this textbook was to present information on literacy research and
practice in interesting ways. Included in the book are many relevant examples from the field
to facilitate a problem-solving approach to becoming an effective teacher. An important aim
of each chapter is to promote the idea that literacy teaching is a dynamic and complex syn-
thesis of research, theory, and practice, as opposed to silos of difficult-to-apply information.
An important end result of instructional decisions educators make, and practices they use, is
that decisions should bring about benefits to students. This means that individuals prepar-
ing to be effective teachers must not only understand the complexity of literacy but also how
to make informed decisions in spite of this complexity. This textbook does not contain all of
the answers you will need to make these decisions about teaching literacy, but when used in
combination with all of the other experiences you will have in becoming an educator, it will
add to what you know and will be able to do to help students develop their literacy skills.

   This book spans many topics related to literacy teaching and learning. Following the intro-
ductory chapter you are now reading, Chapter 2 provides an overview of literacy research,
followed by Chapter 3 and Chapter 4, which relate to the development of word reading skills
and reading comprehension, based on an important theoretical framework known as the
"Simple View of Reading" (Gough & Tunmer, 1986). Chapter 5 provides background on lit-
eracy assessment, followed by Chapter 6, which addresses approaches to writing instruc-
tion for elementary school children. Chapter 7 provides background on how the digital age
can creatively enhance the teaching of children's literature. Chapter 8 and Chapter 9 address
literacy teaching and learning in relation to two important and often underserved student
groups, including English language learners and students with intellectual disabilities. Chap-
ter 10, Chapter 11, and Chapter 12 focus on adolescent literacy, including 21st century literacy,
teaching adolescent writers, and the use of discipline specific literacy strategies in culturally
responsive ways. Chapter 13 provides an overview of world language and literacy develop-
ment, and Chapter 14 instructs readers how to analyze their use of language to explore both
literacy and identity.

   Similar to this introductory chapter, the other chapters begin with an abstract describing
what the chapter is about, followed by a brief but important set of learning objectives. Next
is an introduction to the main topic(s) covered, followed by the body of the chapter and a set
of questions, resources, websites and/or activities readers can explore to problem-solve case
studies and plan their future teaching. At the end of each chapter is a reference section with
all of the sources authors used to write their chapters. Although readers of textbooks do not
always take the time to look through the references of a body of work, readers are encour-
aged to explore these documents to further fact-check the knowledge and practices they are
being asked to integrate into their teaching, as well as to deepen their knowledge of current
issues within the field of literacy research and practice.

                To Students Who Read This Textbook

To students who are assigned to read chapters from this textbook, please consider the fol-
lowing advice for getting the most from it. This book is intended to provide you with some
of the knowledge you will need to become an effective teacher. It is certainly not the only
source of knowledge you will need but is meant to serve as an important foundation to ease
the learning of content you will encounter in other courses and at your field placements. It
is also meant to inform your future teaching, so it is important to read the information and
think about it in reference to your teaching rather than just reading it to get an assignment
out of the way. Students may also be tempted to think about literacy as being only related

6 | 1. A Brief Introduction to Literacy
to reading and writing, and therefore, only associated with English language arts and English
classes, but as argued previously, literacy is much broader than this and permeates every sin-
gle subject taught in schools. Approaching this book with a broad view of literacy as it relates
to making meaning across all school experiences will help prevent readers who may be plan-
ning to teach subjects within the domains of science, math, physical education, social studies,
and the arts from mistakenly assuming that literacy teaching is not relevant to their practice.

   And remember, if you are planning to become a teacher, preparing to teach is not accom-
plished by simply taking a series of required courses and electives at a college or university.
You are making a career choice, and to be successful in a career, you must develop a commit-
ment to preparing for it, not only by participating meaningfully in your college courses but by
constantly evaluating your progress toward professional goals, and seeking additional expe-
riences in areas where you need to learn more. When you begin working toward becoming a
teacher, rather than just trying to meet course expectations, remember to keep your focus on
how to develop the skills you need to help students learn from what you do.

          To Teacher Educators Who Use This Textbook

To teacher educators who plan to use this book in their classes, please consider the following
advice to get the most from it. You may wish to assign one, many, or all of the chapters
according to your instructional goals and objectives. Each chapter was designed to fit
together with the other chapters but was also written to stand alone on the topics addressed.
Because the book is published as a freely accessible e-book with Open SUNY and a Creative
Commons 4.0 license, you can use chapters freely that will benefit your students, without
worrying about how the cost of the book will impact your selection of other course-related
resources.

   Also note that each chapter has clear objectives, self-assessments, and ideas for activities
that can be completed in or out of the classroom to help students gain further knowledge
about the teaching and learning of literacy. Consider incorporating some of these activities
into your syllabus so that students are actively engaged not only in doing the readings but
also using what is learned to make instructional decisions for the children and adolescents
whom they will encounter in educational field placements and when they enter the field of
education. In addition, links to websites and references included in each of the chapters may
be valuable for your students to explore more fully, depending on your course objectives.

                                    Summary

This introductory chapter was designed to orient you to ways to define and think about liter-
acy, as well as familiarize you with the format and purposes of this textbook. Literacy is com-
plex and requires a great deal of knowledge to appreciate and a great deal of effort to teach.
Included in this chapter was a discussion of literacy in terms of its scope--that it is not limited
to reading and writing but encompasses a diverse set of modalities--such as listening, speak-
ing, viewing, and performing, as well as factors related to sociocultural and digital influences.
Because research continues to provide insights into some of the most enduring questions in
the field, learning how to teach literacy is somewhat of a moving target. It takes high levels
of knowledge, skill, and effort to teach children and adolescents literacy, while continuing to
stay informed of research findings that may help improve your practice.

   Keep in mind that the snapshot of literacy represented in this textbook does not include
your experiences, so there are many things left for you to learn. Also absent from this text-

                                                                                                               1. A Brief Introduction to Literacy | 7
book are the many answers to important literacy questions that will be generated by future
research in the coming decades. What this means is that everyone with an interest in literacy
must be prepared for lifelong study, not only of what literacy is today, but also what literacy
will become.

   Questions and Activities

      1. Find one or two students who have taken college literacy courses, and a few other individ-
           uals (e.g., classmates, friends, family members) who have not taken any literacy courses.
           Ask them to define literacy, and write down what they say. Bring your definitions to class
           and compare what your informants said compared to other students' informants. Discuss
           how the definitions overlap and are different. What assumptions about teaching and learn-
           ing accompany the definitions (e.g., if literacy were narrowly defined as being able to read
           and write, how might teaching and learning a subject like math or art look and sound dif-
           ferent than if literacy were defined more broadly)?

      2. Using an online discussion board, a wiki, or in person, select someone to write a single
           sentence to define literacy. Have that person select a classmate to add to and/or refine the
           definition, with the new person then selecting someone else to continue the process. Add
           to the initial definition until everyone in the class has had an opportunity to contribute (be
           sure each person cites any sources he or she uses before passing the task to the next per-
           son). After reading this textbook and accessing other sources about literacy, revisit your
           definition. Are there aspects you want to stay the same? Are there aspects you want to
           change? Individually refine the class's definition to represent your definition of literacy,
           and write a brief reflection providing justification for your definition. Save your definition
           and reflection for later use for when you write a teaching philosophy that incorporates lit-
           eracy.

      3. In what way is literacy being shaped by the digital age? Discuss ways in which your own lit-
           eracy experiences have broadened through the use of technology. Are there digital tools
           that you find essential to your own literacy learning? What concerns do you have related to
           the affordability and accessibility of digital tools for children in U.S. schools and around the
           world?

      4. What do you think about literacy being defined as a fundamental human right? Is literacy
           like other basic human rights or is it more of a luxury? If certain groups are denied access
           to literacy opportunities, such as in nations where some social norms may discourage
           access to schooling for girls, would you argue that this is a cultural difference, a human
           rights violation, both, or neither? Debate your thinking with a small group of classmates,
           while making sure to include peers who have different cultural backgrounds from your
           own.

      5. Begin to draft a learning plan that can lead to your becoming an effective teacher of liter-
           acy. First, talk to employers, inservice teachers, college instructors, advisors, and class-
           mates about what you will need to know and be able to do when you are hired as a teacher.
           Next, identify goals you have not already attained related to your knowledge and practice
           of teaching. Your goals may be related to content you want to teach, student groups with
           whom you want to work, your own interests in literacy, and any certification tests you may

8 | 1. A Brief Introduction to Literacy
           need to pass. Begin creating a plan incorporating the knowledge and experiences you will
           need to develop. Revisit your plan each semester, and actively monitor your progress
           toward reaching your goals. Finally, be sure to include what you will need to know and be
           able to do after you are hired as a teacher in a school. Becoming an effective teacher is a
           process, not an event, so frequent reflection on what you need to do to remain effective is
           essential.

                                     Abstract

This chapter focuses on key ideas for evaluating scientifically-based literacy research, as well
as ways these ideas can guide educators in making instructional decisions most likely to bring
about benefits to students. The chapter includes an overview of how to recognize which lit-
eracy research is scientifically-based and where to find it, how to recognize other valuable
forms of research, the special role of experimental design in scientific thinking, and a ratio-
nale for monitoring student progress to ensure that literacy approaches promote learning,
not just within the context of research but also when implemented in classrooms.

   Learning Objectives

        After reading this chapter, readers will be able to

      1. describe the difference between empirical and non-empirical research;
      2. explain the role of scientifically-based research in evaluating the effectiveness of literacy-

           based programs and strategies;
      3. describe the role of all forms of literacy research for informing literacy practices, including

           how findings from different types of research build upon one another;
      4. discuss characteristics of experimental and non-experimental research, and evaluate how

           research designs impact the kinds of research questions researchers can address;
      5. discuss the rationale for monitoring the progress of students when a specific instructional

           approach is selected over another, along with how to use this rationale to make educa-
           tional decisions.

                                  Introduction

In 1989, a teacher's manual by Dennison and Dennison was released containing solutions for
improving students' learning. Essentially, teachers were instructed to show students how to
perform certain movements to activate brain regions to promote learning. By following the
manual's instructions, teachers could improve students' "symbolic recognition for the decod-
ing of written language" (p. 5), "spatial awareness and visual discrimination" (p. 6), "binocu-
lar vision" (p. 15), and "creative writing" (p. 29), along with dozens of other skills important to
learning. Perhaps you have heard of this program and may have even experienced it yourself

                                                                                                                                                                 11
when you were a student. It is called Brain Gym (Dennison & Dennison, 1989) and has been
immensely popular with educators in many countries since its release.

   The purpose of the above description is not to decide whether Brain Gym movements are
a good or bad idea. Teaching students various postures or breathing techniques is not likely
to cause much harm and may have some benefits, but the point is that many educators pur-
chased and used the program without questioning the claims made by the authors. What evi-
dence is there that "cross crawl sit-ups" enhance "the mechanics of spelling and writing" (p.
13) or that "brain buttons" promote the "correction of letter and number reversals" (p. 25)?
There is none, yet even today information for teachers featuring these exact claims are eas-
ily located. The most recent edition of the Brain Gym teacher's manual1 (Dennison & Denni-
son, 2010) available at http://www.braingym.com/ is advertised as "now the standard in many
schools around the world and is recommended by tutors & teachers & those looking for a
more functional satisfying lifestyle & sense [of] well-being" (BrainGym.com, n.d.).

   At this juncture, you might be thinking something along the lines, "What is the evidence of
these claims about Brain Gym?" This question serves as a compelling segue to a central point
of this chapter. Effectively evaluating the extent to which literacy approaches are backed by
research is critical in an age of information excess and misleading advertising, as is determin-
ing how different kinds of research can inform literacy instruction. No matter how fervently
program advertisers, educators, researchers, and the media assert that a program is effective
and is backed by research, such claims still require some kind of evaluation of the strength of
the evidence. This chapter provides a framework for teachers, administrators, and other edu-
cational professionals to better understand ways in which different levels of research support
can be used to make decisions about literacy instruction.

                   Research and Scientific Thinking

The teaching profession has become increasingly aligned with the idea that literacy instruc-
tion and literacy materials must be "research-based" or "evidence-based" (No Child Left
Behind Act, 2002). Although this alignment does not require that every decision teachers make
be backed by research evidence, it does mean programs and approaches to literacy instruc-
tion that are linked to credible research findings at least have a strong track record of bene-
fiting students. But locating research on literacy instruction is not always as straightforward
as it seems. At the time of this writing, typing the phrase "research-based literacy instruc-
tion" into the Google search bar yields well over three million hits. Furthermore, since the
terms "researched," "research-based," and "evidence-based" are often used interchangeably,
even using different search terms does not narrow the field very much. In other words, typing
"research-based" into search engines is not an ideal strategy for finding approaches to liter-
acy with a meaningful research base.

   In an attempt to clarify which literacy programs and strategies have a strong research
base, various policy groups2 began using the term "scientifically-based research." This term
does carry a more precise meaning than "research-based"; however, to fully understand its
importance, some background in scientific thinking is required. Although scientific thinking is
important in guiding educational practices, it is not always appreciated or understood, partly
because scientific thinking may be thought to apply only to hard sciences, such as chemistry,
and not to fields like education. In addition, scientific thinking may be underused in educa-
tion for reasons described by Stanovich and Stanovich (2003):

       Educational practice has suffered greatly because its dominant model for resolving

12 | 2. Key Ideas for Evaluating Scientifically-Based Approaches
       or adjudicating disputes has been more political (with its corresponding factions and
       interest groups) than scientific. The field's failure to ground practice in the attitudes
       and values of science has made educators susceptible to the "authority syndrome" as
       well as fads and gimmicks that ignore evidence-based practice. (p. 5)

Based on these concerns, Stanovich and Stanovich recommend providing educators with
background on how to think scientifically about literacy instruction so that the allure of gim-
micks and fads is replaced by an understanding of how scientific thinking contributes to the
selection and use of educational practices that are most likely to be effective.

                      Scientifically-Based Research

Scientifically-based research includes a broad array of research methods to answer questions
about literacy. For evaluating research evidence specifically about the effectiveness of pro-
grams and strategies, it can be helpful to use certain criteria such as those identified in the
No Child Left Behind Act (2002), as well as specified in other educational resources (e.g., IDEA,
2004; Stanovich & Stanovich, 2003). First, scientifically-based research is empirical, which
means that it involves the systematic gathering and analysis of data that have been collected,
often using measures that are reliable (i.e., consistent) and valid (i.e., they test what they
claim). Empirical research includes using observation to address problems in a field rather
than exclusively relying on theories or using only logic. Often when people think of the word
"research," they think of the process of reviewing information in existing documents, like what
is done to write a research paper in high school or college. While scientifically-based research
does involve reviewing existing research, it also involves testing hypotheses using data, and
this is one important way that scientifically-based research differs from the broader term
"research." Second, scientifically-based research uses research design strategies that control
for factors that can interfere with evaluating a program or strategy's effectiveness. Later in
this chapter, this key component of scientifically-based research will be described in more
detail when the characteristics of experimental design are discussed. Third, scientifically-
based research is reported in enough detail so others know exactly what was done, and with
whom. Last, scientifically-based research must undergo a review by independent experts in
the field before being dispersed to research outlets. This scientific review is often called a
"peer-review" and is intended to help maintain quality standards for research that is pub-
lished in outlets such as academic journals. Despite this quality assurance component, stan-
dards for peer-review may be somewhat different among academic journals, and therefore,
scientifically-based research must not only make it through a peer-reviewed process but also
must meet each of the other criteria outlined above.

Where to Find Scientifically-Based Literacy Research

      Panel reports

Fortunately, literacy approaches with a strong scientific research base are relatively easy to
find because major literacy panels and clearinghouses regularly release summaries of find-
ings, using criteria which are comparable to those outlined above. One of the most influen-
tial panel reports to date on school-aged children is the Report of the National Reading Panel
(NRP; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [NICHD], 2000), which
serves as a suitable example for how findings from scientifically-based research studies can

                                                                          2. Key Ideas for Evaluating Scientifically-Based Approaches | 13
be combined and made readily accessible to educators. Panel reports are publicly released
documents created by literacy experts, who synthesize findings from research designed to
evaluate the effectiveness of instruction.

   The NRP provided readers with research evidence regarding the effectiveness of five major
instructional components of reading (i.e., phoneme awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary,
and comprehension). Panel members searched available research on these components and
analyzed the findings of studies that met the strict criteria of being scientifically-based. In a
free summary report, panel members then shared instructional methods and strategies that
were found to be most effective, along with suggestions for future research (NICHD, 2000).

   Literacy panels typically analyze study findings using a process called meta-analysis. While
the particulars of meta-analysis are not needed to understand its value, it is important to
know a little about why it is used and how findings are reported. Meta-analysis involves tak-
ing the findings from many studies and combining them to draw conclusions. In the case of
the NRP, a series of meta-analyses was conducted to draw conclusions about the most effec-
tive approaches to reading instruction. You might wonder how findings across multiple stud-
ies on an approach to reading can be combined when studies differ in so many ways. The
way researchers do this is by converting study findings to a common metric called an "effect
size." When a group who receives an intervention significantly outperforms a group who did
not receive it, an effect size reveals how much better one group did over the other. Pan-
els can average effect sizes across studies and compare them to decide which approaches
have a greater positive effect on learning. This kind of analysis reveals the strengths (or weak-
nesses) of instructional approaches across a large collection of scientifically-based studies,
rather than basing conclusions on findings from a single study.

   Many examples of meta-analyses are featured in the NRP in which effect sizes were com-
pared across multiple studies. The first major finding in the report related to the value of
teaching phonemic awareness3 to young children. Phonemic awareness, as defined in the
NRP is "the ability to focus on and manipulate phonemes in spoken words" (p. 2-1) and typ-
ically involves students being taught how to break apart and/or blend sounds in spoken
words. When considering the collective findings from 52 studies, the panel found that teach-
ing phonemic awareness to young students resulted in a strong, positive effect4 (d = .86) for
improving phonemic awareness outcomes compared to students who were not taught it.

   Larger effect sizes are found when an intervention group outperforms a control group.
When effect sizes are compared across studies to determine which instructional approaches
were most and least effective, teachers are then able to know which approaches brought
about the most benefits to students. See Table 1 for more information about how to interpret
the strength of effect sizes.

Table 1. Interpretation of Intervention
         Effect Sizes (Cohen, 1988)

Effect Size (d)  Qualitative Descriptor

.50              Medium Effect
.80              Large Effect

      In the NRP report, effect sizes are reported for each of the major reading components,
including phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. The infor-
mation is accessible to anyone who is interested in reading more about scientifically-based

literacy practices and represents the most dependable findings available about reading up to
the date of this publication.

   Another panel report worth exploring is Developing Early Literacy: Report of the National
Early Literacy Panel (NELP; National Center for Family Literacy, National Early Literacy Panel,
& National Institute for Literacy, 2008). This report includes findings from scientifically-based
research relevant to children ages birth to five, as well as useful recommendations regarding
approaches to literacy which have strongest and most reliable effects for very young children.

   Sources of scientifically-based literacy research designed to evaluate the effectiveness of
literacy programs and strategies, such as panel reports, are vital documents for educators to
know about and review. Unfortunately, panel reports take a long time to compile, and con-
sequently, are released only intermittently. After a few years, as new research emerges, the
reports can become dated. More current meta-analyses can often be found in academic jour-
nals, which are helpful to mine for scientifically-based findings, though readers must carefully
review the criteria used to include and exclude studies. These criteria may differ from those
used by panel reviewers, and interpretation of meta-analytic findings hinges on the quality
of the studies reviewed. Also, because journal article meta-analyses may be written in more
technical terms than those provided in panel report summaries, readers of these meta-analy-
ses may find it beneficial to consult with someone with expertise in both literacy and statis-
tics.

      Clearinghouse and website outlets

Another way to access scientifically-based research findings is by searching research-based
clearinghouses and websites. Unlike many panel reports, findings on research-based websites
tend to remain more current, since they are easily updated to include findings from the
most recent research in the field. Presently, the What Works Clearinghouse website (WWC;
U.S. Department of Education, Institute of Education Sciences, National Center for Education
Evaluation and Regional Assistance, n.d.) is one of the most widely accessed websites con-
taining scientifically-based literacy research findings. Clearinghouses use similar criteria as
literacy panelists to review available research on the effectiveness of instructional methods
and strategies. WWC provides information about educational programs, policies, and strate-
gies and can be helpful in making instructional decisions. Despite its popularity, some orga-
nizations, such as the National Institute for Direct Instruction (NIFDI, 2015) have criticized
WWC for ignoring intervention programs that should have been reviewed, for ignoring and/
or misinterpreting research findings, and for incorrectly classifying a program's effectiveness.
Other researchers, including Timothy Shanahan (2015), who serves as an advisor to WWC,
continue to advocate for the value of WWC because it "serves as a kind of Good Housekeeping
seal of approval" (para. 3) in that WWC reviewers have no financial stake in programs that
they review. A lack of financial interest is not always true for publishers and some researchers.
Information about how to navigate the WWC website is presented next; however, because
there is not universal agreement across organizations regarding the worth of WWC, it is rec-
ommended that educators seek information from a variety of resources to make decisions
about literacy programs and strategies they use or may consider using.

   For users of the WWC site, topics can be explored by clicking on links to "topics in edu-
cation," "publications and reviews," "find what works," or other links to recent news or events
in education. To "find what works," users click this tab, which takes them to a menu of
options allowing comparisons of interventions frequently used in schools. Users then indi-
cate the domain of interventions of interest to them--in this case--literacy, which is accessed
by clicking the "literacy" box. A general list of interventions appears, sorted by literacy out-

                                                                          2. Key Ideas for Evaluating Scientifically-Based Approaches | 15
comes measured. For example, studies that measured intervention effects for alphabetics (i.e.,
phonemic awareness and phonics) appear, along with an improvement index, an effectiveness
rating (an estimation of the average impact of the intervention), and a descriptor of the extent
of the evidence supporting the intervention (i.e., small, medium, large). By clicking on under-
lined terms, pop-ups appear with explanations of what terms mean and how to use them.
Users can also search for a specific program to see if it has been reviewed or examine lists of
existing programs for which the clearinghouse has created reports.

   A search for Brain Gym on the WWC site does not yield any results. This is due, at least in
part, to the fact that there are no studies that meet the WWC design standards providing evi-
dence for its use, and because the original claims featured in the teacher's manual were likely
not sufficiently credible for researchers to invest time or money to evaluate them. Conversely,
a search for "repeated reading" yields a number of findings of potential interest, including a
report regarding the use of repeated reading with students with learning disabilities. Accord-
ing to WWC, there is a small amount of evidence that using repeated reading with students
with learning disabilities can lead to improvements in reading comprehension. On the other
hand, there is no consistent evidence provided for using repeated reading to improve alpha-
betic knowledge, reading fluency, or general reading achievement.

   Although panel reports and research-based websites can be good options for accessing
findings from scientifically-based research, the design standards required for studies to be
included on some of the sites, such as WWC, are more rigorous than most academic jour-
nal standards, and according to some critics, are too rigorous. Educators will want to keep
this criticism in mind, since studies of potential interest may be excluded from these sources
because of technical, design, or statistical problems. In cases where research is missing from
these sources, it may be useful to search academic journals for additional information about a
program or contact publishers directly for research studies. Academic journals are periodicals
released monthly or four times per year that include articles related to academic disciplines,
such as education. Educational research published in academic journals is typically peer-
reviewed (though not always), and these journals usually contain articles related to specific
themes, such as literacy teaching and learning, language development, intervention, teacher
preparation, educational assessment, and educational policy. College and university libraries
provide students and faculty free access to most education journals, and those to which a
library does not subscribe can be accessed through a library's interlibrary loan system. Exam-
ples of some of the top academic journals related to literacy include Reading Research Quar-
terly and the Journal of Educational Psychology; however, there are numerous other high
quality journals available internationally, as well as journals that focus on specialized areas of
literacy, such as English language learners, reading disabilities, or curriculum.

   When you access academic journal articles or information obtained from publishers to
determine the research base of a literacy program or strategy, it is important to understand
the purpose of the research. For example, if a report or article makes a claim that a program
causes a change for one group over another, it is important to keep in mind criteria for
scientifically-based research. Knowing these criteria will help you be wary of advertisers'
claims based solely on opinions, testimonies, and anecdotes. If a report or article summarizes
research that does not use scientifically-based research, information may still be valuable, as
long as researchers do not overstep the claims that can be made. For instance, if researchers
were interested in whether maternal education and children's vocabulary knowledge were
correlated, conducting a study could potentially help researchers understand relationships
among variables. It would be a problem, however, if the researchers claimed that maternal
education causes children to have different levels of vocabulary knowledge.

   Although the WWC site is known for its focus on literacy research, visitors to the site can
also find reviews on other important topics such as dropout prevention, math and science
instruction, and behavioral interventions. Table 2 provides links to selected clearinghouse
summaries, panel reports and other guiding documents useful for locating the research base
for many literacy approaches currently used in schools. The link titled Reviews of Collections
of Programs, Curricula, Practices, Policies, and Tools: Evaluated According to Evidence, com-
piled by Smith-Davis (2009), is a collection of dozens of meta-analyses at all grade levels and
is particularly beneficial to explore.

   Because this chapter is centered on scientifically-based literacy research, it is this type of
research that gets the most coverage, but there are many other types of literacy research that
inform literacy education. The benefits of a wide variety of literacy research will be discussed
a little later in this chapter, as well as throughout the chapters in this textbook, where a broad
array of research methods are featured.

The Importance of Experimental Design in Literacy Research

A close examination of literacy programs and strategies classified as scientifically-based
shows a heavy reliance on experimental design, when the goal of the research is to investigate
effectiveness. Experimental design5 typically involves researchers randomly assigning partic-
ipants to intervention and control groups. In schools, the word "intervention" often refers to
services provided to students experiencing some sort of academic difficulty, but in experi-
mental education studies, the term intervention is typically used more broadly to signify that
a group of deliberately selected participants, who may or may not be at-risk for literacy-
related difficulties, will receive some new instructional component or strategy to test its
effectiveness.

   In experimental literacy research, participants in an intervention group receive an inter-
vention, while participants in a control (or comparison) group receive another competing
intervention or sometimes no intervention at all. Although the use of random assignment may
sound like technical nonsense, appreciating its importance is critical for understanding dif-
ferences among literacy studies.

   To illustrate the advantage of a researcher using experimental design for evaluating the
effectiveness of an intervention, consider this example. Suppose as a researcher, I want to
determine whether a repeated reading intervention causes students to read more fluently.

2. Key Ideas for Evaluating Scientifically-Based Approaches | 17
To answer this question, I take a group of 100 children, measure their reading fluency, add
a repeated reading intervention to their instructional day, and then assess my outcome. I
find that my participants' reading fluency increased considerably. Can I conclude that my
repeated reading intervention was effective because it caused the improvement? Unfortu-
nately, no. My students were still receiving their regular ELA instruction--maybe this caused
the gains I observed. Maybe the students' reading fluency improved as a result of having more
reading experiences everywhere--not just what they received during my intervention. These
potential competing explanations could easily account for the increases in reading fluency I
detected, and because my design did not have a comparison group that allowed me to rule out
these competing explanations, my study is seriously flawed for assessing the effectiveness of
repeated reading.

   Knowing that I neglected to include a comparison group, I try again. This time, I provide
repeated reading to half of the students, while the other half of the students read with a part-
ner. Now I have two competing interventions, and if I deliver them with the same frequency
and duration, I have definitely improved my design. Then, I test both groups after delivering
the interventions and find the repeated reading group scored significantly higher than the
partner reading group. Can I finally conclude that my repeated reading intervention caused
the differences? Unfortunately, no (again). There is every chance that my groups started out
with unequal reading fluency even before the interventions were delivered (and were proba-
bly unequal in other ways, too). Since I gathered no data on the students prior to intervention,
an important competing explanation simply cannot be ruled out--my repeated reading group
may have started out higher in reading fluency. So, I still cannot conclude much of anything
about the effectiveness of my intervention.

   Finally, I decide to randomly assign my participants to groups--repeated reading and read-
ing with a partner. This time I decide to use experimental design, and if my groups are
sufficiently large, I have likely eliminated all meaningful differences between groups before
delivering my interventions. Although even random assignment does not guarantee with
100% certainty that groups will be equivalent,6 it is the best method available to create equiv-
alent groups from a research design standpoint. By using random assignment, my groups
of students should be statistically equal according to age, gender, preintervention reading
fluency ability, cognitive abilities, and socioeconomic status. This time, if I find statistically
significant differences in favor of the repeated reading group, I may be able to reasonably
conclude that the repeated reading intervention plays a role in causing the differences, if
other scientifically-based criteria are also met.

   It is also recognized that sometimes, intervention studies that do not use random assign-
ment may be of sufficient quality to still be considered scientifically-based. Research that
tests the effects of an intervention but does not include random assignment to groups is
often referred to as "quasi-experimental" research and is used when it may not be possible,
practical, or ethical to randomly assign students to groups. When researchers use quasi-
experimental design to assess the impact of instructional strategies, they must also provide
evidence that the groups are equivalent prior to intervention, or if the groups are not equiv-
alent, that statistical adjustments were made to remove preintervention differences. These
statistical controls are why some quasi-experimental designs may also be classified as scien-
tifically-based. WWC includes some quasi-experimental studies in their reviews but classi-
fies them as meeting design standards "with reservations." This more tentative classification
is used because research that does not include random assignment to groups does not meet
the same standard as experimental design.

18 | 2. Key Ideas for Evaluating Scientifically-Based Approaches
   Another thought to keep in mind when reviewing scientifically-based studies is to whom
the findings actually apply. This decision requires knowledge about the characteristics of the
participants who were included in the studies, since an intervention found to be effective with
one participant sample may or may not carry over (i.e., generalize) to other students. If the
participants in the study were mostly White students from high income neighborhoods, will
this "effective" intervention still result in significant gains with a more diverse population of
students? Analogous to this situation is when in the not-too-distant past, medications that
were tested only on men were commonly prescribed for women and children because it was
assumed that positive effects were universal rather than sample specific. While findings from
studies including only men may generalize to women and children, in reality, we cannot actu-
ally know a drug's effectiveness for these populations until we have actual evidence from
studies that include women and children. This same logic applies when reviewing findings
from scientifically-based literacy approaches as well by making sure to ask, "To whom do
these findings actually apply?"

                      Additional Forms of Research

Unlike findings from experimental studies, results from other types of studies are not usually
used to determine the effectiveness of an instructional approach to literacy, although they
are often a first step in the search for effective approaches. For example, simple correlational
studies, which investigate relationships between variables, can be helpful to researchers who
make decisions about what variables to test for effectiveness, but correlational findings are
especially difficult to interpret when trying to assess cause and effect. For example, although
there is a measurable relationship between owning a passport and not being diagnosed with
diabetes (Wade, 2011), it does not follow that owning a passport prevents diabetes. When other
potential explanations are considered, such as the fact that people with higher incomes are
less likely to be obese, can afford healthier food, can obtain better medical care, and can
afford to travel abroad, it becomes clear that the relationship between passports and diabetes
does not mean that one causes the other. In other words, even though a lack of passport own-
ership and having diabetes are statistically related, they are not causally related. Using this
reasoning, simple correlational research does not do a good job of evaluating cause and effect,
in part, because alternative causes of an effect are not well controlled.

   On the other hand, more sophisticated correlational research where important variables
are controlled can help researchers focus in on possible causes. For example, think about
a researcher who wants to understand the nature of the relationship between the number
of books children have in their home and school achievement. Is the relationship between
books and achievement accounted for by how much families read with their children, or per-
haps the number of books is simply related to family income? Is it possible that families with
higher incomes not only can afford more books but also can afford a host of other learning
opportunities for their children? Perhaps having more books in the home is simply an indica-
tor of learning opportunities that lead to achievement rather than the books being the cause.
What a researcher can do is look at the relationship between books in the home and student
achievement, while removing the effects of income (i.e., controlling for this variable). If the
books are not having any effect, then the relationship (i.e., correlation) between books and
achievement will disappear. The researcher still does not know exactly what is influencing
achievement but may be able to rule out a possible cause. Thus, a campaign to provide lower
income families with lots of books may be valuable for a number of reasons; however, it may
be off track if the goal is to increase student achievement, depending on the findings of the

                                                                          2. Key Ideas for Evaluating Scientifically-Based Approaches | 19
study. This example shows how more sophisticated correlational research can help inform lit-
eracy program and strategy decisions.

   Other research methods, such as qualitative research, are also useful for informing literacy
practices. Qualitative research frequently involves observing and interviewing participants to
obtain detailed accounts of their personal experiences and perspectives. These methods meet
the criteria for being classified as empirical research, since observations are gathered and
analyzed, but they are not necessarily used when the goal is to evaluate the overall effec-
tiveness of programs or strategies. In qualitative studies, researchers do not focus on test-
ing hypotheses and typically do not try to exert strict control in their studies. These less
rigid characteristics of qualitative research are desirable for exploring literacy processes that
are unmeasurable or are very complex (e.g., exploring how students make meaning of texts
based on their own cultural backgrounds and experiences). Like correlational research, qual-
itative research can provide valuable information toward the formation of new theories and
can inform literacy instruction by exploring what may be effective, and additional research
that is more controlled can help determine what is effective.

   It is important to note that some people take issue with classifying research based on more
narrow definitions of scientifically-based research because if research is not recognized as
scientifically based, it may be mistakenly thought of as not being valuable, especially by indi-
viduals who lack background in how different research strategies inform literacy teaching and
learning. For example, some people may assume that quantitative research involving hypoth-
esis testing is always more valuable than other forms of inquiry; however, since all forms of
literacy research build upon the findings from other studies, all forms of research have poten-
tial value when they serve to refine future research to inform literacy practices. To avoid
the trap of demeaning certain types of research, it is best to keep in mind the actual goal
of the research when determining its value. To assess cause and effect, experimental stud-
ies are most useful, whereas to understand complex literacy perspectives and processes, a
wider variety of methods are used. Both the quality and value of research must always be tied
to questions the research was designed to answer, and the extent to which it answers them,
rather than tied to a superficial sorting based solely on the methods used.

Approaches with No Research Base

After gaining an understanding of different types of literacy research, it makes sense to also
reflect on literacy approaches that have no research base. While it may seem unacceptable to
even consider using a literacy program or strategy that has no research supporting it, a lack of
a research base may simply indicate an approach is too new to have allowed anyone to com-
plete a well-designed study, or an approach may be too indistinct or too narrow to capture
any researcher's interests. For example, a scientifically-based research study is not likely to
happen that compares whether reading one storybook versus another one is better to teach
children about penguins. Keep in mind that research designed to evaluate the general effec-
tiveness of literacy programs and strategies is time consuming and expensive, so many deci-
sions teachers make will not have this kind of research base supporting it.

   It is also possible that an approach to literacy instruction is not worth the time and
resources to evaluate because it is so unlikely to have a meaningful effect, based on what
is already known about literacy from other research. In addition, research on certain
approaches to literacy may appear like they have not been researched, but this may be
because the term someone is using to search for the approach may not be the same term used
by researchers. Each of these possibilities is explained in further detail below.

20 | 2. Key Ideas for Evaluating Scientifically-Based Approaches
      Approaches which are too new

An example of literacy instruction that may be too new to have garnered research evidence
might involve a recently released intervention program. When the research base of educa-
tional claims is unclear, it is useful to refer to strategies in Daniel Willingham's work, includ-
ing his brief article Measured Approach or Magic Elixir: How to Tell Good Science from Bad
(2012a), and his book When Can You Trust the Experts: How to Tell Good Science from Bad Sci-
ence in Education? (2012b). In both of these resources, Willingham recommends using a series
of shortcuts to strip down claims and evaluate their credibility.

   Consider this claim: Over half of our children are not achieving literacy goals and need your
help! Research shows that using Program X will not only help your students achieve but also help
you become a more effective teacher. Act now to restore the love of learning to your students.
What Willingham (2012b) recommends first is to strip the claim down. In the above exam-
ple, this involves removing any emotion from it. For example, the terms "help," and "effective
teacher" are used to influence emotions, and emotional reasoning is not a strong foundation
for making educational decisions. Who wants to help children and become a more effective
teacher? All of us, but whether a program can succeed in meeting these goals is a matter of
evidence, not emotion.

   Second, Willingham recommends tracing the claim to the source to see if it is simply an
appeal to an authority or if there is evidence for it. Is the claim associated with someone held
in high status only or is there an actual basis for the claim in terms of credible evidence?
Willingham discusses What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) as an "attempt to solve the problem
of authority in education" (p. 181) by distributing information based on scientific evidence.
Willingham also reinforces the point that the standards used to determine which studies are
included are so strict for WWC that other valuable studies may be overlooked.

   Willingham's third step in evaluating educational claims involves analyzing the quality of
evidence, using criteria related to scientific thinking, as well as the reader's own personal
experiences as reference points. Willingham's fourth step involves bringing all of the evidence
together to make a decision, while using other strategies to keep our personal belief systems
from biasing our views. For example, we may view weak evidence as being strong because
it is consistent with our beliefs, or we may dismiss strong evidence as weak because it goes
against them. In addition to Willingham's work, the publication by Stanovich and Stanovich
(2003) discussed earlier in this chapter titled Using Research and Reason in Education is also
foundational for developing scientific thinking related to research evidence. It may be use-
ful to seek information from multiple sources, and reflect on the different examples and per-
spectives provided in each, to learn more about how to evaluate educational research.

      Approaches which are too narrow

Some approaches to literacy instruction may not have been researched because they are too
narrow to capture a researcher's attention or are an isolated strategy that would be unlikely
to have a detectible effect in itself. An example might be using a particular hand signal to get
students' attention during ELA instruction. This strategy would not necessarily be researched
because it would be difficult to justify a full-blown scientific investigation into an isolated
hand signal compared to the potential value in investigating a new reading intervention. The
lack of formal research does not mean that the hand signal should not be used but simply that
the teacher is tasked with determining whether it helps to meet his or her objectives within
the classroom.

                                                                          2. Key Ideas for Evaluating Scientifically-Based Approaches | 21
      Approaches which lack validity

Still, other approaches may lack research attention because claims attached to them are
highly unlikely to be valid, based on what is known from previously published literacy
research. For example, some of the claims associated with the early edition of Brain Gym fall
into this category. It just does not make sense for researchers to invest time and resources
determining whether movements like "brain buttons" promote the "correction of letter and
number reversals" (Dennison and Dennison, 1989, p. 25), since there is no convincing reason
this might be the case.

      Approaches which use different terms

Finally, a literacy strategy may not appear to have a research base because key search terms
are inconsistent. For example, a search for "whispa phones" (the familiar name used to
describe bent pieces of plastic pipe students can hold up to their ear to hear themselves whis-
per read without disturbing others), yields some hits when entered into the Google search bar
but no hits when entered into the Google Scholar search bar. On the other hand, a search for
"whisper phones" reveals at least three dozen mentions on Google Scholar, though most of
these mentions appear unrelated to any investigation of their effects. When a literacy strategy
or program is just mentioned in academic journal articles, this can sometimes mislead indi-
viduals into thinking they have been researched. Closer inspection may reveal that an article
may include only comment on the use of the strategy rather than evidence of its effects. Many
articles published in academic journals or scholarly books on literacy teaching that are not
empirical may still provide a synthesis of other empirical work or may offer theories that are
valuable to test. Non-empirical articles are often extremely valuable for explaining the logic
behind why an approach to literacy teaching should work, but in the absence of empirical evi-
dence, even well-developed theories provide only limited support for a literacy approach and
would definitely not be classified as a scientific research base.

   When there is no apparent research evidence to a literacy approach, it is important to be
cautious, flexible, and open to modifying or even discontinuing the approach if new and/or
clarifying research emerges. This is a judgment call, and using scientific thinking can increase
the likelihood of making decisions that will benefit students. Making instructional decisions
based on research can be complicated, especially when publishers promote their products
using language designed to provoke trust in claims (e.g., "Mrs. Smith found our program
helped all of her students achieve more! So buy our research-based program today!"). It is
important to be skeptical of any claims that do not have credible evidence to back them up.

   In reality, many commercially available programs do not have peer-reviewed research back-
ing them, and therefore, a search for them in academic journals, on clearinghouse sites, or in
panel reports may not yield any results. For example, there is a much deeper research base
for some areas of literacy teaching and learning compared to others, so educators seeking
information are much more likely to find it on reading programs compared to writing pro-
grams. Even if specific programs have not been directly researched, many of the strategies
found in commercially available programs have been researched and can be found in each
of the sources listed at the beginning of this paragraph. For example, a particular phonemic
awareness intervention program may not have been researched, but its scope, sequence, and
delivery may be nearly identical to other programs that have been found to be highly effective
in scientifically-based studies. In cases like this, findings from the researched program may
also apply to the non-researched program when both programs are used under similar con-
ditions (e.g., similar group sizes, with students in the same grade, etc.).

         The Importance of Monitoring Student Progress

Although teachers and administrators who access panel and clearinghouse reports and who
use criteria in Willingham (2012b) are well-positioned in the selection and/or delivery of sci-
entifically-based literacy instruction, an additional step is still needed to make instructional
decisions. It is essential to make sure that the instruction used is effective in practice--not just
in research studies. To differentiate students who respond well to a literacy approach from
those who do not, progress-monitoring strategies help with decisions related to whether
to continue to use a literacy approach. For detailed information about progress-monitoring
strategies, please see Chapter 5 in this textbook.

   To illustrate the rationale for progress monitoring, consider this analogy. I am not feeling
well, and the doctor I see determines that my blood pressure is elevated to the point where
medical intervention is needed. She prescribes an anti-hypertensive drug, and when I inquire
about research related to its effectiveness, she shares a brochure with me featuring findings
from a number of well-designed scientific studies. The studies clearly demonstrated that not
only did the medication significantly lower participants' blood pressure more than a placebo
(i.e., sugar pill) but even outperformed the two leading anti-hypertensive drugs currently
available. Additionally, the participants in the drug trials were quite similar to me, making it
reasonable to predict that the drug may, in fact, work for me, too.

   The doctor then happily writes me a prescription for a three-month supply of the drug and
lets me know that she will gladly refill the prescription over the phone, as needed. She assures
me that I do not need to come back to check my blood pressure or for a physical examina-
tion, since the medication should be effective, based on the research. Suddenly, I feel uneasy,
and this time, it is not my blood pressure that is causing it. While I understand the logic of
her prescribing the drug, I do not understand her rationale for just letting me take it without
checking in to see if it is actually working for me. Making an assumption that drug trial study
findings automatically apply to me is dangerous.

   Similarly, even if there is a strong, scientific foundation for an approach to literacy, this does
not guarantee that the approach will work for all students. Even if a scientific study shows an
intervention to be effective overall, invariably, some students in the study who received the
"effective" intervention likely did not respond well. These details are not usually reported in
studies, not because the researchers are withholding vital information but simply because the
motivation for an intervention study typically is to evaluate overall effectiveness, not effec-
tiveness for individual students. So predictions about how individual students are likely to
respond to a literacy approach are often rooted in scientific research, whereas determining
how students actually respond to the approach is rooted in school-based progress-monitor-
ing strategies.

                                    Summary

Making decisions about approaches to literacy instruction can be challenging. Which
approaches are effective based on scientifically-based research can often be found by access-
ing documents and websites such as clearinghouse and panel reports. On the other hand,
many programs and strategies have not been formally researched, and therefore, it can be
useful to employ other strategies, such as those offered by Willingham (2012a, 2012b) to
think through claims made by promoters. It is important to understand how different forms
of research can inform literacy instruction, such as when decisions should be grounded in

                                                                         2. Key Ideas for Evaluating Scientifically-Based Approaches | 23
research designed to evaluate effectiveness, such as experimental research, or when they
should be grounded in other types of research, such as correlational or qualitative research.

   Not only are teachers tasked with making decisions about using literacy programs and
strategies, but often these decisions are made by groups of individuals at all levels of the edu-
cational hierarchy. Literacy program decisions are also made by curriculum committees, dis-
trict administrators, and even boards of education, in which members may or may not be
aware of the different levels of research evidence backing the programs they choose to adopt.
When teachers develop background knowledge to evaluate the quality of research evidence,
they not only make better decisions themselves but can also serve as better informed advo-
cates and advisors to these groups.

   Although many educational approaches to literacy have not been well researched, when
scientific support can be found, this can help narrow the field of choices. Decisions still
require attention to the generalizability of study findings based on students who were
included in studies. And even the strongest scientific evidence does not guarantee that an
approach to literacy that should work will work. For this reason, learning must be closely
monitored using procedures such as those described in further detail in Chapter 5 of this
textbook. Monitoring student progress can be especially helpful when trying strategies that
may not fall into policy-based definitions of scientifically-based research, since ultimately,
the most important effect for teachers to measure is how well a strategy or program works
for children in their classrooms. Information presented in this chapter provides a gateway to
future opportunities for learning more about research that can maximize students' literacy
learning.

   Questions and Activities

      1. Describe different ways that literacy topics are researched.
      2. According to the policy-based definition presented at the beginning of this chapter,

           explain what characterizes scientifically-based literacy research, how is it different from
           other forms of research, and why literacy panel reports and What Works Clearinghouse
           privilege studies that use experimental design.
      3. Describe what an effect size is and why is it important in evaluating the effectiveness of an
           intervention.
      4. Describe ways that non-experimental approaches to research, such as correlational and
           qualitative research, inform the field of literacy teaching and learning.
      5. Debate in what instances a qualitative approach to research would be better than using an
           experimental approach. In what instances would using an experimental approach be more
           applicable? When might correlational research be most useful?
      6. Explain what needs to be considered when no research is available on a literacy approach
           carrying the claim of being "highly effective."
      7. Discuss why monitoring students' progress in literacy is important, particularly when a
           new approach to literacy instruction is used.

Two Essential Components of
Reading Comprehension

                                     Abstract

After acknowledging the contributions of recent scientific discoveries in reading that have led
to new understandings of reading processes and reading instruction, this chapter focuses on
word recognition, one of the two essential components in the Simple View of Reading. The
next chapter focuses on the other essential component, language comprehension. The Simple
View of Reading is a model, or a representation, of how skillful reading comprehension devel-
ops. Although the Report of the National Reading Panel (NRP; National Institute of Child Health
and Human Development [NICHD], 2000) concluded that the best reading instruction incor-
porates explicit instruction in five areas (phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary,
and comprehension), its purpose was to review hundreds of research studies to let instructors
know the most effective evidence-based methods for teaching each. These five areas are fea-
tured in the Simple View of Reading in such a way that we can see how the subskills ultimately
contribute to two essential components for skillful reading comprehension. Children require
many skills and elements to gain word recognition (e.g., phoneme awareness, phonics), and
many skills and elements to gain language comprehension (e.g., vocabulary). Ultimately, the
ability to read words (word recognition) and understand those words (language comprehen-
sion) lead to skillful reading comprehension. Both this chapter and the next chapter present
the skills, elements, and components of reading using the framework of the Simple View of
Reading, and in this particular chapter, the focus is on elements that contribute to automatic
word recognition. An explanation of each element's importance is provided, along with rec-
ommendations of research-based instructional activities for each.

   Learning Objectives

        After reading this chapter, readers will be able to

      1. identify the underlying elements of word recognition;
      2. identify research-based instructional activities to teach phonological awareness, decoding,

           and sight recognition of irregular sight words;
      3. discuss how the underlying elements of word recognition lead to successful reading com-

           prehension.

                                  Introduction

Throughout history, many seemingly logical beliefs have been debunked through research
and science. Alchemists once believed lead could be turned into gold. Physicians once
assumed the flushed red skin that occurred during a fever was due to an abundance of blood,
and so the "cure" was to remove the excess using leeches (Worsley, 2011). People believed that
the earth was flat, that the sun orbited the earth, and until the discovery of microorganisms
such as bacteria and viruses, they believed that epidemics and plagues were caused by bad air
(Byrne, 2012). One by one, these misconceptions were dispelled as a result of scientific dis-
covery. The same can be said for misconceptions in education, particularly in how children
learn to read and how they should be taught to read.1

   In just the last few decades there has been a massive shift in what is known about the
processes of learning to read. Hundreds of scientific studies have provided us with valuable
knowledge regarding what occurs in our brains as we read. For example, we now know there
are specific areas in the brain that process the sounds in our spoken words, dispelling prior
beliefs that reading is a visual activity requiring memorization (Rayner, Foorman, Perfetti,
Pesetsky, & Seidenberg, 2001). Also, we now know how the reading processes of students who
learn to read with ease differ from those who find learning to read difficult. For example,
we have learned that irregular eye movements do not cause reading difficulty. Many clever
experiments (see Rayner et al., 2001) have shown that skilled readers' eye movements during
reading are smoother than struggling readers' because they are able to read with such ease
that they do not have to continually stop to figure out letters and words. Perhaps most valu-
able to future teachers is the fact that a multitude of studies have converged, showing us
which instruction is most effective in helping people learn to read. For instance, we now know
that phonics instruction that is systematic (i.e., phonics elements are taught in an organized
sequence that progresses from the simplest patterns to those that are more complex) and
explicit (i.e., the teacher explicitly points out what is being taught as opposed to allowing stu-
dents to figure it out on their own) is most effective for teaching students to read words (NRP,
2000).

   As you will learn, word recognition, or the ability to read words accurately and automati-
cally, is a complex, multifaceted process that teachers must understand in order to provide
effective instruction. Fortunately, we now know a great deal about how to teach word recog-
nition due to important discoveries from current research. In this chapter, you will learn what
research has shown to be the necessary elements for teaching the underlying skills and ele-
ments that lead to accurate and automatic word recognition, which is one of the two essential
components that leads to skillful reading comprehension. In this textbook, reading compre-
hension is defined as "the process of simultaneously extracting and constructing meaning
through interaction and involvement with written language" (Snow, 2002, p. xiii), as well as
the "capacities, abilities, knowledge, and experiences" one brings to the reading situation (p.
11).

          Learning to Read Words Is a Complex Process

It used to be a widely held belief by prominent literacy theorists, such as Goodman (1967),
that learning to read, like learning to talk, is a natural process. It was thought that since chil-
dren learn language and how to speak just by virtue of being spoken to, reading to and with
children should naturally lead to learning to read, or recognize, words. Now we know it is
not natural, even though it seems that some children "pick up reading" like a bird learns to

fly. The human brain is wired from birth for speech, but this is not the case for reading the
printed word. This is because what we read--our alphabetic script--is an invention, only avail-
able to humankind for the last 3,800 years (Dehaene, 2009). As a result, our brains have had to
accommodate a new pathway to translate the squiggles that are our letters into the sounds of
our spoken words that they symbolize. This seemingly simple task is, in actuality, a complex
feat.

   The alphabet is an amazing invention that allows us to represent both old and new words
and ideas with just a few symbols. Despite its efficiency and simplicity, the alphabet is actually
the root cause of reading difficulties for many people. The letters that make up our alpha-
bet represent phonemes--individual speech sounds--or according to Dehaene, "atoms" of spo-
ken words (as opposed to other scripts like Chinese whereby the characters represent larger
units of speech such as syllables or whole words). Individual speech sounds in spoken words
(phonemes) are difficult to notice for approximately 25% to 40% of children (Adams, Foorman,
Lundberg, & Beeler, 1998). In fact, for some children, the ability to notice, or become aware
of the individual sounds in spoken words (phoneme awareness) proves to be one of the most
difficult academic tasks they will ever encounter. If we were to ask, "How many sounds do
you hear when I say `gum'?" some children may answer that they hear only one, because when
we say the word "gum," the sounds of /g/ /u/ and /m/ are seamless. (Note the / / marks
denote the sound made by a letter.) This means that the sounds are coarticulated; they over-
lap and melt into each other, forming an enveloped, single unit--the spoken word "gum." There
are no crisp boundaries between the sounds when we say the word "gum." The /g/ sound
folds into the /u/ sound, which then folds into the /m/ sound, with no breaks in between.

   So why the difficulty and where does much of it begin? Our speech consists of whole words,
but we write those words by breaking them down into their phonemes and representing each
phoneme with letters. To read and write using our alphabetic script, children must first be
able to notice and disconnect each of the sounds in spoken words. They must blend the
individual sounds together to make a whole word (read). And they must segment the indi-
vidual sounds to represent each with alphabetic letters (spell and write). This is the first stum-
bling block for so many in their literacy journeys--a difficulty in phoneme awareness simply
because their brains happen to be wired in such a way as to make the sounds hard to notice.
Research, through the use of brain imaging and various clever experiments, has shown how
the brain must "teach itself" to accommodate this alphabet by creating a pathway between
multiple areas (Dehaene, 2009).

   Instruction incorporating phoneme awareness is likely to facilitate successful reading
(Adams et al., 1998; Snow, Burns, & Griffin, 1998), and it is for this reason that it is a focus
in early school experiences. For some children, phoneme awareness, along with exposure to
additional fundamentals, such as how to hold a book, the concept of a word or sentence,
or knowledge of the alphabet, may be learned before formal schooling begins. In addition to
having such print experiences, oral experiences such as being talked to and read to within
a literacy rich environment help to set the stage for reading. Children lacking these literacy
experiences prior to starting school must rely heavily on their teachers to provide them.

     The Simple View of Reading and the Strands of Early
                           Literacy Development

Teachers of reading share the goal of helping students develop skillful reading comprehen-
sion. As mentioned previously, the Simple View of Reading (Gough & Tunmer, 1986) is a
research-supported representation of how reading comprehension develops. It character-

                                                                                                                       3. Word Recognition Skills | 29
izes skillful reading comprehension as a combination of two separate but equally important
components--word recognition skills and language comprehension ability. In other words, to
unlock comprehension of text, two keys are required--being able to read the words on the
page and understanding what the words and language mean within the texts children are
reading (Davis, 2006). If a student cannot recognize words on the page accurately and auto-
matically, fluency will be affected, and in turn, reading comprehension will suffer. Likewise, if
a student has poor understanding of the meaning of the words, reading comprehension will
suffer. Students who have success with reading comprehension are those who are skilled in
both word recognition and language comprehension.

later reading (dis)abilities: Evidence, theory, and practice, by H. S. Scarborough, in S. B. Newman & D. K.
Dickinson (Eds.), 2002, Handbook of early literacy research, p. 98, Copyright 2002, New York, NY: Guilford
Press. Reprinted with permission.

      These two essential components of the Simple View of Reading are represented by an
illustration by Scarborough (2002). In her illustration, seen in Figure 1, twisting ropes rep-
resent the underlying skills and elements that come together to form two necessary braids
that represent the two essential components of reading comprehension. Although the model
itself is called "simple" because it points out that reading comprehension is comprised of
reading words and understanding the language of the words, in truth the two components
are quite complex. Examination of Scarborough's rope model reveals how multifaceted each
is. For either of the two essential components to develop successfully, students need to be
taught the elements necessary for automatic word recognition (i.e., phonological awareness,
decoding, sight recognition of frequent/familiar words), and strategic language comprehen-
sion (i.e., background knowledge, vocabulary, verbal reasoning, literacy knowledge). The sec-
tions below will describe the importance of the three elements that lead to accurate word
recognition and provide evidence-based instructional methods for each element. Chapter 4
in this textbook will cover the elements leading to strategic language comprehension.

30 | 3. Word Recognition Skills
                              Word Recognition

Word recognition is the act of seeing a word and recognizing its pronunciation immediately
and without any conscious effort. If reading words requires conscious, effortful decoding, lit-
tle attention is left for comprehension of a text to occur. Since reading comprehension is
the ultimate goal in teaching children to read, a critical early objective is to ensure that they
are able to read words with instant, automatic recognition (Garnett, 2011). What does auto-
matic word recognition look like? Consider your own reading as an example. Assuming you
are a skilled reader, it is likely that as you are looking at the words on this page, you cannot
avoid reading them. It is impossible to suppress reading the words that you look at on a page.
Because you have learned to instantly recognize so many words to the point of automaticity, a
mere glance with no conscious effort is all it takes for word recognition to take place. Despite
this word recognition that results from a mere glance at print, it is critical to understand that
you have not simply recognized what the words look like as wholes, or familiar shapes. Even
though we read so many words automatically and instantaneously, our brains still process
every letter in the words subconsciously. This is evident when we spot misspellings. For exam-
ple, when quickly glancing at the words in the familiar sentences, "Jack be nimble, Jack be
quick. Jack jamped over the canbleslick," you likely spotted a problem with a few of the indi-
vidual letters. Yes, you instantly recognized the words, yet at the same time you noticed the
individual letters within the words that are not correct.

   To teach students word recognition so that they can achieve this automaticity, students
require instruction in: phonological awareness, decoding, and sight recognition of high fre-
quency words (e.g., "said," "put"). Each of these elements is defined and their importance is
described below, along with effective methods of instruction for each.

Phonological Awareness

One of the critical requirements for decoding, and ultimately word recognition, is phonolog-
ical awareness (Snow et al., 1998). Phonological awareness is a broad term encompassing an
awareness of various-sized units of sounds in spoken words such as rhymes (whole words),
syllables (large parts of words), and phonemes (individual sounds). Hearing "cat" and "mat,"
and being aware that they rhyme, is a form of phonological awareness, and rhyming is usually
the easiest and earliest form that children acquire. Likewise, being able to break the spoken
word "teacher" into two syllables is a form of phonological awareness that is more sophisti-
cated. Phoneme awareness, as mentioned previously, is an awareness of the smallest individ-
ual units of sound in a spoken word--its phonemes; phoneme awareness is the most advanced
level of phonological awareness. Upon hearing the word "sleigh," children will be aware that
there are three separate speech sounds--/s/ /l/ //--despite the fact that they may have no
idea what the word looks like in its printed form and despite the fact that they would likely
have difficulty reading it.

   Because the terms sound similar, phonological awareness is often confused with phoneme
awareness. Teachers should know the difference because awareness of larger units of
sound--such as rhymes and syllables--develops before awareness of individual phonemes, and
instructional activities meant to develop one awareness may not be suitable for another.
Teachers should also understand and remember that neither phonological awareness nor its
most advanced form--phoneme awareness--has anything whatsoever to do with print or let-
ters. The activities that are used to teach them are entirely auditory. To help remember this,
simply picture that they can be performed by students if their eyes are closed. Adults can

                                                                                                                        3. Word Recognition Skills | 31

told, "Say `cowboy.' Now say `cowboy' without saying `cow.'" Adults can teach phoneme aware-
ness activities as well by asking, "What sound do you hear at the beginning of `sssun,' `sssail,'
and `ssssoup'?" or, "In the word `snack,' how many sounds do you hear?" or by saying, "Tell me
the sounds you hear in `lap.'" Notice that the words would not be printed anywhere; only spo-
ken words are required. Engaging in these game-like tasks with spoken words helps children
develop the awareness of phonemes, which, along with additional instruction, will facilitate
future word recognition.

      Why phonological awareness is important

An abundance of research emerged in the 1970s documenting the importance of phoneme
awareness (the most sophisticated form of phonological awareness) for learning to read
and write (International Reading Association, 1998). Failing to develop this awareness of the
sounds in spoken words leads to difficulties learning the relationship between speech and
print that is necessary for learning to read (Snow et al., 1998). This difficulty can sometimes
be linked to specific underlying causes, such as a lack of instructional experiences to help
children develop phoneme awareness, or neurobiological differences that make developing
an awareness of phonemes more difficult for some children (Rayner et al., 2001). Phoneme
awareness facilitates the essential connection that is "reading": the sequences of individual
sounds in spoken words match up to sequences of printed letters on a page. To illustrate the
connection between phoneme awareness and reading, picture the steps that children must
perform as they are beginning to read and spell words. First, they must accurately sound out
the letters, one at a time, holding them in memory, and then blend them together correctly to
form a word. Conversely, when beginning to spell words, they must segment a spoken word
(even if it is not audible they are still "hearing the word" in their minds) into its phonemes
and then represent each phoneme with its corresponding letter(s). Therefore, both reading
and spelling are dependent on the ability to segment and blend phonemes, as well as match
the sounds to letters, and as stated previously, some students have great difficulty developing
these skills. The good news is that these important skills can be effectively taught, which leads
to a discussion about the most effective ways to teach phonological (and phoneme) aware-
ness.

      Phonological awareness instruction

The National Reading Panel (NRP, 2000) report synthesized 52 experimental studies that fea-
tured instructional activities involving both phonological awareness (e.g., categorizing words
similar in either initial sound or rhyme) and phoneme awareness (e.g., segmenting or blending
phonemes). In this section, both will be discussed.

      A scientifically based study by Bradley and Bryant (1983) featured an activity that teaches
phonological awareness and remains popular today. The activity is sorting or categorizing
pictures by either rhyme or initial sound (Bradley & Bryant, 1983). As shown in Figure 2, sets of
cards are shown to children that feature pictures of words that rhyme or have the same initial

                                                                                                                       3. Word Recognition Skills | 33
sound. Typically one picture does not match the others in the group, and the students must
decide which the "odd" one is. For instance, pictures of a fan, can, man, and pig are identi-
fied to be sure the students know what they are. The teacher slowly pronounces each word to
make sure the students clearly hear the sounds and has them point to the word that does not
rhyme (match the others). This is often referred to as an "oddity task," and it can also be done
with pictures featuring the same initial sound as in key, clock, cat, and scissors (see Blachman,
Ball, Black, & Tangel, 2000 for reproducible examples).

   Evidence-based activities to promote phoneme awareness typically have students segment
spoken words into phonemes or have them blend phonemes together to create words. In
fact, the NRP (2000) identified segmenting and blending activities as the most effective when
teaching phoneme awareness. This makes sense, considering that segmenting and blending
are the very acts performed when spelling (segmenting a word into its individual sounds) and
reading (blending letter sounds together to create a word). The NRP noted that if segmenting
and blending activities eventually incorporate the use of letters, thereby allowing students to
make the connection between sounds in spoken words and their corresponding letters, there
is even greater benefit to reading and spelling. Making connections between sounds and their
corresponding letters is the beginning of phonics instruction, which will be described in more
detail below.

   An activity that incorporates both segmenting and blending was first developed by a Russ-
ian psychologist named Elkonin (1963), and thus, it is often referred to as "Elkonin Boxes."
Children are shown a picture representing a three- or four-phoneme picture (such as "fan" or
"lamp") and told to move a chip for each phoneme into a series of boxes below the picture. For
example, if the word is "fan," they would say /fffff/ while moving a chip into the first box, then
say /aaaaa/ while moving a chip into the second box, and so on. Both Elkonin boxes (see Fig-
ure 3) and a similar activity called "Say It and Move It" are used in the published phonological
awareness training manual, Road to the Code by Blachman et al. (2000). In each activity chil-
dren must listen to a word and move a corresponding chip to indicate the segmented sounds
they hear, and they must also blend the sounds together to say the entire word.

Decoding

Another critical component for word recognition is the ability to decode words. When teach-
ing children to accurately decode words, they must understand the alphabetic principle and
know letter-sound correspondences. When students make the connection that letters signify
the sounds that we say, they are said to understand the purpose of the alphabetic code, or the
"alphabetic principle." Letter-sound correspondences are known when students can provide
the correct sound for letters and letter combinations. Students can then be taught to decode,
which means to blend the letter sounds together to read words. Decoding is a deliberate act
in which readers must "consciously and deliberately apply their knowledge of the mapping
system to produce a plausible pronunciation of a word they do not instantly recognize" (Beck
& Juel, 1995, p. 9). Once a word is accurately decoded a few times, it is likely to become rec-
ognized without conscious deliberation, leading to efficient word recognition.

   The instructional practices teachers use to teach students how letters (e.g., i, r, x) and letter
clusters (e.g., sh, oa, igh) correspond to the sounds of speech in English is called phonics (not
to be confused with phoneme awareness). For example, a teacher may provide a phonics les-
son on how "p" and "h" combine to make /f/ in "phone," and "graph." After all, the alphabet
is a code that symbolizes speech sounds, and once students are taught which sound(s) each

34 | 3. Word Recognition Skills
of the symbols (letters) represents, they can successfully decode written words, or "crack the
code."

      Why decoding is important

Similar to phonological awareness, neither understanding the alphabetic principle nor knowl-
edge of letter-sound correspondences come naturally. Some children are able to gain insights
about the connections between speech and print on their own just from exposure and rich
literacy experiences, while many others require instruction. Such instruction results in dra-
matic improvement in word recognition (Boyer & Ehri, 2011). Students who understand the
alphabetic principle and have been taught letter-sound correspondences, through the use of
phonological awareness and letter-sound instruction, are well-prepared to begin decoding
simple words such as "cat" and "big" accurately and independently. These students will have
high initial accuracy in decoding, which in itself is important since it increases the likelihood
that children will willingly engage in reading, and as a result, word recognition will progress.
Also, providing students effective instruction in letter-sound correspondences and how to
use those correspondences to decode is important because the resulting benefits to word
recognition lead to benefits in reading comprehension (Brady, 2011).

      Decoding instruction

Teaching children letter-sound correspondences and how to decode may seem remarkably
simple and straightforward. Yet teaching them well enough and early enough so that children
can begin to read and comprehend books independently is influenced by the kind of instruc-
tion that is provided. There are many programs and methods available for teaching students
to decode, but extensive evidence exists that instruction that is both systematic and explicit
is more effective than instruction that is not (Brady, 2011; NRP, 2000).

   As mentioned previously, systematic instruction features a logical sequence of letters and
letter combinations beginning with those that are the most common and useful, and ending
with those that are less so. For example, knowing the letter "s" is more useful in reading and
spelling than knowing "j" because it appears in more words. Explicit instruction is direct; the
teacher is straightforward in pointing out the connections between letters and sounds and
how to use them to decode words and does not leave it to the students to figure out the
connections on their own from texts. The notable findings of the NRP (2000) regarding sys-
tematic and explicit phonics instruction include that its influence on reading is most sub-
stantial when it is introduced in kindergarten and first grade, it is effective in both preventing
and remediating reading difficulties, it is effective in improving both the ability to decode
words as well as reading comprehension in younger children, and it is helpful to children
from all socioeconomic levels. It is worth noting here that effective phonics instruction in
the early grades is important so that difficulties with decoding do not persist for students in
later grades. When this happens, it is often noticeable when students in middle school or high
school struggle to decode unfamiliar, multisyllabic words.

   When providing instruction in letter-sound correspondences, we should avoid presenting
them in alphabetical order. Instead, it is more effective to begin with high utility letters such
as "a, m, t, i, s, d, r, f, o, g, l" so that students can begin to decode dozens of words featuring
these common letters (e.g., mat, fit, rag, lot). Another reason to avoid teaching letter-sound
correspondences in alphabetical order is to prevent letter-sound confusion. Letter confusion
occurs in similarly shaped letters (e.g., b/d, p/q, g/p) because in day-to-day life, changing the
direction or orientation of an object such as a purse or a vacuum does not change its iden-
tity--it remains a purse or a vacuum. Some children do not understand that for certain letters,

                                                                                                                       3. Word Recognition Skills | 35
their position in space can change their identity. It may take a while for children to under-
stand that changing the direction of letter b will make it into letter d, and that these symbols
are not only called different things but also have different sounds. Until students gain experi-
ence with print--both reading and writing--confusions are typical and are not due to "seeing
letters backward." Nor are confusions a "sign" of dyslexia, which is a type of reading prob-
lem that causes difficulty with reading and spelling words (International Dyslexia Association,
2015). Students with dyslexia may reverse letters more often when they read or spell because
they have fewer experiences with print--not because they see letters backward. To reduce the
likelihood of confusion, teach the /d/ sound for "d" to the point that the students know it
consistently, before introducing letter "b."

   To introduce the alphabetic principle, the Elkonin Boxes or "Say It and Move It" activities
described above can be adapted to include letters on some of the chips. For example, the let-
ter "n" can be printed on a chip and when students are directed to segment the words "nut,"
"man," or "snap," they can move the "n" chip to represent which sound (e.g., the first, second,
or last) is /n/. As letter-sound correspondences are taught, children should begin to decode
by blending them together to form real words (Blachman & Tangel, 2008).

   For many students, blending letter sounds together is difficult. Some may experience let-
ter-by-letter distortion when sounding out words one letter at a time. For example, they may
read "mat" as muh-a-tuh, adding the "uh" sound to the end of consonant sounds. To prevent
this, letter sounds should be taught in such a way to make sure the student does not add
the "uh" sound (e.g., "m" should be learned as /mmmm/ not /muh/, "r" should be learned as
/rrrr/ not /ruh/). To teach students how to blend letter sounds together to read words, it
is helpful to model (see Blachman & Murray, 2012). Begin with two letter words such as "at."
Write the two letters of the word separated by a long line: a_______t. Point to the "a" and
demonstrate stretching out the short /a/ sound--/aaaa/ as you move your finger to the "t"
to smoothly connect the /a/ to the /t/. Repeat this a few times, decreasing the length of
the line/time between the two sounds until you pronounce it together: /at/. Gradually move
on to three letter words such as "sad" by teaching how to blend the initial consonant with
the vowel sound (/sa/) then adding the final consonant. It is helpful at first to use continu-
ous sounds in the initial position (e.g., /s/, /m/, /l/) because they can be stretched and held
longer than a "stop consonant" (e.g., /b/, /t/, /g/).

   An excellent activity featured in many scientifically-based research studies that teaches
students to decode a word thoroughly and accurately by paying attention to all of the sounds
in words rather than guessing based on the initial sounds is word building using a pocket
chart with letter cards (see examples in Blachman & Tangel). Have students begin by build-
ing a word such as "pan" using letter cards p, a, and n. (These can be made using index
cards cut into four 3 x 1.25 sections. It is helpful to draw attention to the vowels by mak-
ing them red as they are often difficult to remember and easily confused). Next, have them
change just one sound in "pan" to make a new word: "pat." The sequence of words may con-
tinue with just one letter changing at a time: pan--pat--rat--sat--sit--sip--tip--tap--rap. The stu-
dent will begin to understand that they must listen carefully to which sound has changed
(which helps their phoneme awareness) and that all sounds in a word are important. As
new phonics elements are taught, the letter sequences change accordingly. For example,
a sequence featuring consonant blends and silent-e may look like this:
slim--slime--slide--glide--glade--blade--blame--shame--sham. Many decoding programs that
feature strategies based on scientifically-based research include word building and provide
samples ranging from easy, beginning sequences to those that are more advanced (Beck &
Beck, 2013; Blachman & Tangel, 2008).

36 | 3. Word Recognition Skills
   A final important point to mention with regard to decoding is that teachers must consider
what makes words (or texts) decodable in order to allow for adequate practice of new decod-
ing skills. When letters in a word conform to common letter-sound correspondences, the
word is decodable because it can be sounded out, as opposed to words containing "rule
breaker" letters and sounds that are in words like "colonel" and "of." The letter-sound corre-
spondences and phonics elements that have been learned must be considered. For example,
even though the letters in the word "shake" conform to common pronunciations, if a student
has not yet learned the sound that "sh" makes, or the phonics rule for a long vowel when there
is a silent "e," this particular word is not decodable for that child. Teachers should refrain from
giving children texts featuring "ship" or "shut" to practice decoding skills until they have been
taught the sound of /sh/. Children who have only been taught the sounds of /s/ and /h/
may decode "shut" /s/ /h/ /u/ /t/, which would not lead to high initial accuracy and may
lead to confusion.

Sight Word Recognition

The third critical component for successful word recognition is sight word recognition. A
small percentage of words cannot be identified by deliberately sounding them out, yet they
appear frequently in print. They are "exceptions" because some of their letters do not follow
common letter-sound correspondences. Examples of such words are "once," "put," and "does."
(Notice that in the word "put," however, that only the vowel makes an exception sound, unlike
the sound it would make in similar words such as "gut," "rut," or "but.") As a result of the irreg-
ularities, exception words must be memorized; sounding them out will not work.

   Since these exception words must often be memorized as a visual unit (i.e., by sight),
they are frequently called "sight words," and this leads to confusion among teachers. This is
because words that occur frequently in print, even those that are decodable (e.g., "in," "will,"
and "can"), are also often called "sight words." Of course it is important for these decodable,
highly frequent words to be learned early (preferably by attending to their sounds rather than
just by memorization), right along with the others that are not decodable because they appear
so frequently in the texts that will be read. For the purposes of this chapter, sight words are
familiar, high frequency words that must be memorized because they have irregular spellings
and cannot be perfectly decoded.

      Why sight word recognition is important

One third of beginning readers' texts are mostly comprised of familiar, high frequency words
such as "the" and "of," and almost half of the words in print are comprised of the 100 most
common words (Fry, Kress, & Fountoukidis, 2000). It is no wonder that these words need to
be learned to the point of automaticity so that smooth, fluent word recognition and reading
can take place.

   Interestingly, skilled readers who decode well tend to become skilled sight word "recogniz-
ers," meaning that they learn irregular sight words more readily than those who decode with
difficulty (Gough & Walsh, 1991). This reason is because as they begin learning to read, they
are taught to be aware of phonemes, they learn letter-sound correspondences, and they put
it all together to begin decoding while practicing reading books. While reading a lot of books,
they are repeatedly exposed to irregularly spelled, highly frequent sight words, and as a result
of this repetition, they learn sight words to automaticity. Therefore, irregularly spelled sight
words can be learned from wide, independent reading of books. However, children who strug-
gle learning to decode do not spend a lot of time practicing reading books, and therefore, do

                                                                                                                        3. Word Recognition Skills | 37
not encounter irregularly spelled sight words as often. These students will need more delib-
erate instruction and additional practice opportunities.

      Sight word recognition instruction

Teachers should notice that the majority of letters in many irregularly spelled words do in fact
follow regular sound-symbol pronunciations (e.g., in the word "from" only the "o" is irregu-
lar), and as a result attending to the letters and sounds can often lead to correct pronunci-
ation. That is why it is still helpful to teach students to notice all letters in words to anchor
them in memory, rather than to encourage "guess reading" or "looking at the first letter,"
which are both highly unreliable strategies as anyone who has worked with young readers
will attest. Interestingly, Tunmer and Chapman (2002) discovered that beginning readers who
read unknown words by "sounding them out" outperformed children who employed strate-
gies such as guessing, looking at the pictures, rereading the sentence on measures of word
reading and reading comprehension, at the end of their first year in school and at the middle
of their third year in school.

   Other than developing sight word recognition from wide, independent reading of books
or from exposure on classroom word walls, instruction in learning sight words is similar to
instruction used to learn letter-sound correspondences. Sources of irregularly spelled sight
words can vary. For instance, they can be preselected from the text that will be used for that
day's reading instruction. Lists of irregularly spelled sight words can be found in reading pro-
grams or on the Internet (search for Fry lists or Dolch lists). When using such lists, determine
which words are irregularly spelled because they will also feature highly frequent words that
can be decoded, such as "up," and "got." These do not necessarily need deliberate instruc-
tional time because the students will be able to read them using their knowledge of letters
and sounds.

   Regardless of the source, sight words can be practiced using flash cards or word lists, mak-
ing sure to review those that have been previously taught to solidify deep learning. Gradual
introduction of new words into the card piles or lists should include introduction such as
pointing out features that may help learning and memorization (e.g., "where" and "there" both
have a tall letter "h" which can be thought of as an arrow or road sign pointing to where or
there). Sets of words that share patterns can be taught together (e.g., "would," "could," and
"should"). Games such as Go Fish, Bingo, or Concentration featuring cards with these words
can build repetition and exposure, and using peer-based learning, students can do speed
drills with one another and record scores.

   Any activity requiring the students to spell the words aloud is also helpful. I invented an
activity that I call "Can You Match It?" in which peers work together to practice a handful of
sight words. An envelope or flap is taped across the top of a small dry erase board. One stu-
dent chooses a card, tells the partner what the word is, and then places the card inside the
envelope or flap so that it is not visible. The student with the dry erase board writes the word
on the section of board that is not covered by the envelope, then opens the envelope to see
if their spelling matches the word on the card. The ultimate goal in all of these activities is to
provide a lot of repetition and practice so that highly frequent, irregularly spelled sight words
become words students can recognize with just a glance.

Word Recognition Summary

As seen in the above section, in order for students to achieve automatic and effortless word
recognition, three important underlying elements--phonological awareness, letter-sound

38 | 3. Word Recognition Skills
correspondences for decoding, and sight recognition of irregularly spelled familiar
words--must be taught to the point that they too are automatic. Word recognition, the act of
seeing a word and recognizing its pronunciation without conscious effort, is one of the two
critical components in the Simple View of Reading that must be achieved to enable successful
reading comprehension. The other component is language comprehension, which will be dis-
cussed in Chapter 4. Both interact to form the skilled process that is reading comprehension.
Because they are so crucial to reading, reading comprehension is likened to a two-lock box,
with both "key" components needed to open it (Davis, 2006).

   The two essential components in the Simple View of Reading, automatic word recognition
and strategic language comprehension, contribute to the ultimate goal of teaching reading:
skilled reading comprehension. According to Garnett (2011), fluent execution of the under-
lying elements as discussed in this chapter involves "teaching...accompanied by supported
and properly framed interactive practice" (p. 311). When word recognition becomes effortless
and automatic, conscious effort is no longer needed to read the words, and instead it can
be devoted to comprehension of the text. Accuracy and effortlessness, or fluency, in reading
words serves to clear the way for successful reading comprehension.

   It is easy to see how success in the three elements that lead to automatic word recognition
are prerequisite to reading comprehension. Learning to decode and to automatically read
irregularly spelled sight words can prevent the development of reading problems. Students
who are successful in developing effortless word recognition have an easier time reading, and
this serves as a motivator to young readers, who then proceed to read a lot. Students who
struggle with word recognition find reading laborious, and this serves as a barrier to young
readers, who then may be offered fewer opportunities to read connected text or avoid reading
as much as possible because it is difficult. Stanovich (1986) calls this disparity the "Matthew
Effects" of reading, where the rich get richer--good readers read more and become even bet-
ter readers and poor readers lose out. Stanovich (1986) also points out an astonishing quote
from Nagy and Anderson (1984, p. 328): "the least motivated children in the middle grades
might read 100,000 words a year while the average children at this level might read 1,000,000.
The figure for the voracious middle grade reader might be 10,000,000 or even as high as
50,000,000." Imagine the differences in word and world knowledge that result from reading
100,000 words a year versus millions! As teachers, it is worthwhile to keep these numbers in
mind to remind us of the importance of employing evidence-based instructional practices to
ensure that all students learn phoneme awareness, decoding, and sight word recognition--the
elements necessary for learning how to succeed in word recognition.

                                    Summary

In order for students to comprehend text while reading, it is vital that they be able to read
the words on the page. Teachers who are aware of the importance of the essential, funda-
mental elements which lead to successful word recognition--phonological awareness, decod-
ing, and sight recognition of irregular words--are apt to make sure to teach their students
each of these so that their word reading becomes automatic, accurate, and effortless. Today's
teachers are fortunate to have available to them a well-established bank of research and
instructional activities that they can access in order to facilitate word recognition in their
classrooms.

   The Simple View of Reading's two essential components, automatic word recognition and
strategic language comprehension, combine to allow for skilled reading comprehension. Stu-
dents who can both recognize the words on the page and understand the language of the

words and sentences are much more likely to enjoy the resulting advantage of comprehend-
ing the meaning of the texts that they read.

One of Two Essential Components of
Reading Comprehension

                                                      Maria S. Murray

                                     Abstract

After a brief commentary on the overall importance of knowledge to language comprehension
ability, learning, and memory, this chapter then goes on to describe in more detail the ele-
ments that contribute to language comprehension. Language comprehension is one of the
two essential components for learning to read in the Simple View of Reading. The other
is word recognition, which was covered in Chapter 3. Similar to the previous chapter that
emphasized word recognition, this chapter presents the skills, elements, and components
of language comprehension using the framework of the Simple View of Reading. The Sim-
ple View is a representative model explaining that during reading both word recognition and
language comprehension coordinate to produce skillful reading comprehension, and it also
portrays the many elements that combine to build each component. Each element that ulti-
mately contributes to strategic language comprehension is described, and an explanation of
its importance along with suggested instructional activities is provided.

   Learning Objectives

        After reading this chapter, readers will be able to

      1. discuss the importance of knowledge for language comprehension, learning, and memory;
      2. explain the underlying elements of language comprehension;
      3. identify instructional activities to provide and activate background knowledge, teach

           vocabulary, and teach language structures;
      4. discuss how the underlying elements of language comprehension contribute to successful

           reading comprehension.

                                  Introduction

As noted in the previous chapter on word recognition's contribution to reading comprehen-
sion, the Simple View of Reading (Gough & Tunmer, 1986) is a research-supported model of
the reading process. It portrays skillful reading comprehension as a combination of two sepa-
rate but equally important components--word recognition skills and language comprehension
ability. In other words, to unlock comprehension of printed text (as opposed to other modes
such as visual or audio that would not require a person to aim for reading comprehension),

                                                                                                                                                                43
two keys are required: the ability to read the words on the page and the ability to under-
stand the meaning of the words (Davis, 2006). The previous chapter (Chapter 3) discussed the
importance of improving word recognition and methods for doing so. This chapter will cover
the other essential component of successful reading comprehension--language comprehen-
sion. As you will see, the elements required for language comprehension are all related to
gaining meaning from what is being read.

      The two essential components of the Simple View of Reading are represented by an illus-
tration created by Scarborough (2002). In her illustration, seen in Figure 1, the two necessary
braids that contribute to reading comprehension are themselves comprised of underlying
skills and strands. Because the Simple View of Reading represents the progression toward
proficient reading comprehension as requiring two components, it is termed "simple." In
actuality, each of the components is complex due to its underlying elements. In the case
of language comprehension discussed in this chapter, students need to steadily accumulate
a fundamental base of background knowledge, vocabulary, verbal reasoning, and literacy
knowledge (see below for definitions and explanations of each), and the ability to strategically
apply these elements during reading to comprehend texts. To apply strategically means that
during the reading of text, readers must continually monitor how well they comprehend its
meaning, and bring forth any knowledge they have about the topic, words, sayings, and more.
This process is called "metacognition," or thinking about thinking. After a brief commentary
about language comprehension below, the importance of overall knowledge for three ele-
ments that lead to the strategic, metacognitive application of the skills and elements in the
service of language comprehension will be presented, and instructional methods for each will
be provided.

       Language Comprehension and Its Connections to
                                   Knowledge

Davis (2006) wrote that "even the best phonics-based skills program will not transform a child
into a strong reader if the child has limited knowledge of the language, impoverished vocab-
ulary, and little knowledge of key subjects" (p. 15). Language comprehension consists of three
elements that must be taught so that students apply them strategically (as opposed to auto-
matically) during reading. As students interpret the meaning of texts, they must strategically
apply their background knowledge, their knowledge of the vocabulary, and their understand-
ing of the language structures that exist between words and within sentences.

   First consider how reading comprehension is typically developed. Remember that in this
textbook (see Chapter 1), reading comprehension includes "the process of simultaneously
extracting and constructing meaning through interaction and involvement with written lan-
guage" (Snow, 2002, xiii), as well as the "capacities, abilities, knowledge, and experiences"
one brings to the reading situation (p. 11). In line with the first part of this definition, it is
expected that once children have been taught sounds and letters, how to blend them together
to decode so that they read text fluently, along with lessons in vocabulary, they will be on the
way to successful reading comprehension. Reading instruction in schools focuses so heavily
on developing reading comprehension because this ability is the ultimate goal of reading.

   A surface skim through the teachers manuals from published reading programs will reveal
that a multitude of comprehension skills and their corresponding strategies are often taught
at each grade level (e.g., finding main idea, summarizing, using graphic organizers), but ulti-
mately these skills and strategies do not necessarily transition students to successfully com-
prehending texts. Reading comprehension ability is complex and multifaceted; it is comprised
of understanding a text's vocabulary, knowledge of the particular topic, and comprehension
of its language structures (see Cain & Oakhill, 2007). Recall from Chapter 1 that language com-
prehension includes the interaction among someone's background knowledge, vocabulary,
language structures like grammar, verbal reasoning abilities, and literary knowledge (e.g., gen-
res). Language comprehension is a more general term than listening comprehension, which is
the ability to understand and make sense of spoken language.

   One of the many aspects of reading comprehension that is often overlooked during instruc-
tion is students' language comprehension. For example, a student who has general difficulty
with reading comprehension, may, in actuality, comprehend a text about sharks or reefs quite
well if his/her parents are marine biologists because he or she has accumulated experiences
with ocean-related "language"--its words, phrases, and facts. This same student may not com-
prehend the next text about ham radio operation or the Appalachian Trail. Successful reading
comprehension, then, often depends on the language of a text because the more familiar-
ity and knowledge students have with its language, the stronger comprehension will be. Stu-
dents from disadvantaged backgrounds often struggle with reading comprehension, despite
being able to decode accurately and read fluently. They are often believed to have poor read-
ing comprehension ability when in actuality the snag is a lack of language comprehension
stemming from less overall knowledge which in turn stems from fewer experiences aligning
with the language encountered in school and school texts. Reading comprehension strategy
instruction, which involves teaching children how to comprehend or remember written text
using deliberate mental actions, entails instruction in questioning, visualization, and summa-
rizing, for example. However, teaching children how to apply such strategies during reading
simply cannot replace a lack of knowledge.

                                                                                                          4. Language Comprehension Ability | 45
   Not surprisingly, in the earliest grades, an important facilitator of reading comprehension
is automatic word recognition (see Chapter 3), since comprehension of a text cannot take
place if its words cannot be read or recognized. However, once students become more com-
petent at word recognition, the dominant factor driving reading comprehension transforms
to become language comprehension (Foorman, Francis, Shaywitz, Shaywitz, & Fletcher, 1997).
The reason for this boils down to one word--knowledge. Once students can read the words,
they extract meaning from texts using their overall knowledge and experiences (background
knowledge), their knowledge of words (vocabulary), and their knowledge of how words go
together to create meaning (language comprehension). This accumulation of knowledge can
last a lifetime and really never be considered "finished." In fact, knowledge is so important
to consider, that a brief commentary on its contribution to reading comprehension is next,
before going on to discuss the three elements in Scarborough's (2002) braid that lead to lan-
guage comprehension, and ultimately reading comprehension.

   Subtle differences exist between the terms "knowledge" and "background knowledge." In
this chapter, "knowledge" is broadly defined as the total accumulation of facts and infor-
mation a person has gained from previous experiences (it is also called general knowledge).
Knowledge is composed of concepts, ideas and factual information, which eventually come
together to contribute to understanding in various situations. One does need facts and con-
cepts and ideas to perform a procedure (e.g., putting historical events on a timeline, editing a
paper for mechanical errors, reading a map), but they are even more vital when partaking in
situations or conditions that require synthesizing a lot of information (e.g., write a compre-
hensive essay on a topic, comprehend an author's message while reading a book) (Marzano &
Kendall, 2007). "Background knowledge," on the other hand, is a term used in education for a
specific subset of knowledge needed to comprehend a particular situation, lesson, or text (it
is also called "prior knowledge"). When reading a text about dog training, readers are going to
use their background (prior) knowledge of dog behavior, vocabulary related to dogs, aspects
of training, and so on, to comprehend text. They will not need to apply any of their knowl-
edge of outer space, photosynthesis, or baking (any of their general, overall knowledge) in this
particular instance. It is not possible for educators to teach the required background knowl-
edge for every text that students will encounter as they progress through their school years.
They can, however, provide the next best thing--a wide base of general knowledge that can be
drawn upon and applied as background knowledge to problem solve and create meaning.

   General knowledge comes from years of exposure to books, newspapers, knowledge-rich
school curricula, television programs, experiences, and conversations. Its value cannot be
understated. Willingham (2006) summarizes the findings in cognitive science regarding the
significance of knowledge in education this way:

       Those with a rich base of factual knowledge find it easier to learn more--the rich get
       richer. In addition, factual knowledge enhances cognitive processes like problem solv-
       ing and reasoning. The richer the knowledge base, the more smoothly and effectively
       these cognitive processes--the very ones that teachers target--operate. So, the more
       knowledge students accumulate, the smarter they become. (p. 30)

Both the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO, 2013) and the National Research
Council's Committee on Defining Deeper Learning and 21st Century Skills (NRC; 2012) call for
an increase in rigorous content knowledge in order for today's students to achieve college,
career, and citizenship readiness. According to the CCSSO (2013), students must also be able
to demonstrate "their ability to apply that knowledge through higher-order skills includ-

46 | 4. Language Comprehension Ability
ing but not limited to critical thinking and complex problem solving, working collaboratively,
communicating effectively, and learning how to learn" (p. 6).

   Difficulties comprehending complex texts encountered in college and careers have been
attributed to a lack of general knowledge. To illustrate this difficulty, Schweizer (2009), a pro-
fessor who taught freshman composition classes at Duke University, wrote about an eye-
opening incident he experienced during his classes. After assigning both his remedial and
advanced classes a four-page article on climate change from a popular college-level anthol-
ogy of essays (see McKibben, 2006), he realized his students' comprehension of the essay was
"flat, anemic, and literal rather than deep, rich, and associative" (p. 53). Upon questioning his
students on the general knowledge items within the text--general facts, figures, locations,
words, and common expressions--he reached a sobering conclusion. In the remedial class,
just one student could identify Gandhi, none knew Ernest Hemingway, and two knew that Job
was a character in the Bible. In the more advanced class, four out of 15 students recognized
Gandhi or Hemingway, none knew the word "quixotic," and few could comprehend certain
expressions within the text (e.g., "something is in the offing") or its allusions (e.g., "the snows
of Kilimanjaro are set to become the rocks of Kilimanjaro"). Reflecting on the literacy-related
consequences of this lack of word and world knowledge, Schweizer noted that his students
were "not only hampered by a lack of factual knowledge, but that this shortcoming trans-
lates into problems with diction and literacy as well" (p. 52). Interestingly, to have compre-
hended this paragraph alone, you need to be familiar with and comprehend the importance
and meaning of these words and phrases: Duke University, attributed, "eye-opening incident,"
remedial, anthology, "sobering conclusion," and allusions. A lack of language comprehension
related to these words will hamper your reading comprehension indeed!

Background Knowledge

One of the three elements necessary for language comprehension is background knowledge.
As mentioned above, background knowledge is a particular subset of knowledge (e.g., facts
about the world, events, people, sayings and phrases) that is needed to comprehend and learn
from a particular situation, lesson, or text. Young readers learn to strategically apply their
background knowledge in order to interpret a text's meaning. As a small example, consider
the following sentence: "Initially Richard was upset when police told him they found bugs in
his office, but to avoid prosecution he agreed to let them remain until the investigation was
completed." To comprehend this sentence either in isolation or within the context of an entire
text, one will need to have learned that "bugs" are spying devices, to understand that people
might get upset when they discover they are being spied on, and to infer that Richard has
created an arrangement of cooperation with the police. Without background knowledge, the
author's intended meaning may be misconstrued as having to do with insects.

      Why background knowledge is important

Knowledge leads to more knowledge, making learning easier (Willingham, 2006). Consider
another example in which students read a story about a boy who is angry that he was not
selected to play on the football team. The boy insists, "I really didn't want to play football any-
way!" His mother responds, "Sounds like a case of sour grapes to me!" Students familiar with
the Aesop's fable "The Fox and the Grapes" will understand the reference to "sour grapes" in
this particular story and in all subsequent texts, and they will be able to interpret the subtle
nuances of resentment that comes about after rejection. A student with no exposure to the
fable may believe that the boy really did not want to play football and will not understand

                                                                                                          4. Language Comprehension Ability | 47
why the mother is talking about grapes. Meaning will be incomplete. Background knowledge
allows readers to strategically infer the author's meaning with a lot less effort. Drawing infer-
ences from a text is so much easier when a reader is already familiar with what the author is
talking about.

   Willingham (2006) summarized some of the findings in cognitive science regarding how
background knowledge helps students comprehend what they read and remember what they
have learned. Most obvious, and as seen in the sour grapes example, background knowledge
of a text makes it so that fewer instances are necessary of having to stop or reread for clar-
ification. The author's point is comprehended right away. Less obvious, background knowl-
edge allows readers to arrange sequences of events in texts into connected, meaningful units
or sequences that can be more easily analyzed, understood, and remembered. Without back-
ground knowledge, words and sentences in a text easily become disjointed, unrelated, ran-
dom sequences. For instance, imagine a passenger in a small plane who has no background
knowledge of mechanics or technical things. This passenger is asked by the pilot to read off
the items from preflight checklists. Due to lack of background in technical things, the items
seem arbitrary and unrelated. Dozens of unfamiliar words and terms are essentially meaning-
less (e.g., throttle 2000 RPM, magnetos max drop 175 RPM, press-to-test annunciator panel,
electric fuel pump off, fuel pressure check), and if asked after the flight, it is unlikely that
the passenger would be able to remember them. Conversely, if the next traveler possesses
background knowledge related to how mechanical things work and is asked to read the same
checklists, his or her comprehension and recall would be greater because the items on the list
would be familiar and meaningful. It would be understood that some of the items were related
to engine speed, while others had to do with the fuel system and they would be retained in
memory because this passenger would assign them to meaningful categories and sequences.
The background knowledge of the second passenger would not only create better compre-
hension of the experience, it would also enable greater storage and recall of most of the
events. The second passenger would have learned more and would have remembered more.

   A similar phenomenon related to how meaningful categories (or "chunks") are related to
memory and learning is the frequently cited experiments of DeGroot (1946/1978) and Chase
and Simon (1973). Differences in background knowledge (via the experiences) between mas-
ter and novice chess players were examined in both studies, as well as how this knowledge
influenced their memories. Chess masters who had experienced thousands of chess matches,
and thus, had more background knowledge were pitted against novices in a simple experi-
ment. For just a few seconds, chess masters and novices were shown pictures of chessboards
in which the pieces were configured in positions from advanced level matches. The pictured
pieces were not arranged on the boards randomly; their positions were realistic. After
momentarily viewing the pictures, players reconstructed the positions of each piece using a
real board. Masters recreated the positions almost perfectly, while the novices placed about
half of the pieces successfully. The accuracy of recall was attributed to the masters' ability to
categorize and chunk information, or, in the case of chess, to chunk together multiple, mean-
ingful groups of pieces. The novices could only memorize positions of single pieces, whereas
the masters memorized positions of sets of pieces that made sense to them in terms of famil-
iar play-structures. They had background knowledge of similar set-ups.

   A video recreating this experiment with chess grandmaster Patrick Wolff (Simons, 2012)
reveals his strategy in recreating the board placements. Wolff states that he noticed where
the pieces clustered and that he noted the logical connections between the pieces. He rec-
ognized the meaningful chunks. In a book about how practice and effort contribute to talent,
Colvin (2008) comments on chess player experiments, noting that, "instead of seeing twenty-

48 | 4. Language Comprehension Ability
five pieces, they may see just five or six groups of pieces" (p. 100). In any realm, meaningful
chunks can only be formed by those having the knowledge and background experiences to
understand what belongs with what. In the case of chess players, certain pieces defend others
in strategically particular positions. For skilled readers, certain letters chunk together within
long words, enabling them to be read rapidly and accurately, and certain words and ideas
chunk together meaningfully, enabling comprehension of an author's message. An example of
how words and ideas chunk together meaningfully to aid reading comprehension is provided
by Meurer (1991), who wrote about reading schemata. Reading schemata are patterns that
organize knowledge in our minds while we read. Meurer explained that readers have schema
for various concepts, such as when something "breaks." Along with this understanding, they
may possess subcomponents and ideas having to do with "breaks": items that can be broken,
ways that things can cause things to be broken, and what it means for something to be bro-
ken, just to name a few. He then provided an example of a sentence: "The karate champion
broke the cinder block." The author of that sentence does not explicitly tell the reader what
the champion used to break the cinder block. It is the reader's schema for "break" and "karate
champion" that allows him or her to successfully infer that what broke the cinder block was
not a hammer or a chisel, but the karate champion's hand. Without the ability to automatically
chunk together and activate various words and ideas, reading comprehension will suffer.

   In any field, setting, or circumstance, new material that has familiarity is more readily
learned because it is easier to understand and because it is supported by and connected
meaningfully to what is already known. The beauty and value of background knowledge is that
it provides the familiarity that is crucial for connections that both create new learning and
allow for the new learning to be remembered.

      Background knowledge instruction

As educators, we cannot teach the "big umbrella" of background knowledge since it evolves
from a multitude of life experiences. However, we can provide it or activate it, and suggestions
for both are described below.

            Providing background knowledge

Meaningful contexts from a content-rich curriculum spanning a wide variety of content areas
are ideal for providing the background knowledge that will scaffold future learning. Many cur-
ricula are deliberately designed to provide an integrated sequence of rich, engaging, multi-
cultural content spanning history, science, music, visual arts, mathematics, language arts, and
more. Without such a curriculum, knowledge from each of these areas that is likely to appear
in texts in subsequent grades can still be provided. In the earliest grades, before students
can read books independently, the content and concepts that build background knowledge
are usually developed through teacher read-alouds of a wide variety of texts, such as nursery
rhymes, rhyming poems, fairy tales and fables from a variety of cultures, and engaging non-
fiction texts, to name a few.

   Children's books and other written sources of information are an authentic and abundant
source of knowledge about every imaginable subject (see Chapter 7 for further discussion
about children's literature), suitable for building knowledge at all grade levels (Stanovich &
Cunningham, 1993). Children's books feature rich concepts and a high percentage of unique
and sophisticated words (Cunningham & Stanovich, 1998; Hayes & Ahrens, 1988). Reading a
number books or stories to students featuring similar themes or domains (e.g., farms, sea-
sons, culturally diverse folklore, Egypt, music, currency, weather) provides a beneficial rep-
etition of words and concepts that build valuable background knowledge. As students hear

                                                                                                          4. Language Comprehension Ability | 49
multiple versions of a similar theme or receive repeated instruction in a particular domain,
newly developed background knowledge will lead to better comprehension of the material
(Cervetti, Jaynes, & Hiebert, 2009). Davis (2006) recommends twenty to thirty read-alouds per
domain (e.g., from a variety of children's books, chapters, short pieces, poems) for develop-
ing background knowledge; just two short read-alouds a day can cover 10 to 15 domains in a
school year (see also Hirsch, 2006). Although read-alouds are typically done in the elementary
grades, there is likely to be benefit in building background knowledge at the older grades as
well.

            Activating background knowledge

In addition to providing background knowledge, we can also activate existing background
knowledge. Activation of background knowledge that students already possess is frequently a
focus of comprehension instruction. Teachers understand the value of activating background
knowledge and as a result many tend to apply a series of strategies at the expense of providing
knowledge. There is not a lot of research on teaching a multitude of comprehension strategies
prior to third grade, primarily because beginning readers in the early grades are learning how
to decode fluently. Also, too much of an emphasis on teaching strategies for reading com-
prehension may not be effective (Stahl, 2004), particularly if the text is easy to understand.
For young students, particularly when using complex text, comprehension strategies should
still be worked on (see the Institute of Education Sciences' practice guide (Shanahan et al.,
2010) for a summary of recommendations on improving reading comprehension for children
in grades K-3), but the decoding constraint may still stand in the way. In later grades, sim-
ply applying comprehension strategies such as visualizing or predicting will not automatically
enable students to understand science. If we want students to comprehend science texts,
they must know something about science. Students do better if they read and write about
things they know about. While isolated facts are certainly important and necessary, they will
not suffice to enable meaningful comprehension unless background knowledge is developed
within meaningful contexts.

   Activating background knowledge is under scrutiny since the introduction of the Common
Core State Standards for English Language Arts & Literacy in History/Social Studies, Science,
and Technical Subjects (CCSS; National Governors Association & Council of Chief State School
Officers [NGA & CCSSO], 2010) because students are now expected to extract information
from texts by focusing on what the author intended for them to understand, rather than
relying too heavily on their prior knowledge, experiences, or opinions to construct meaning.
Teachers are encouraged to downplay any lengthy, explicit focus on their students' existing
knowledge before reading, and in discussions about the CCSS, some propose that this may
serve to equalize the outcomes for children who have varying degrees of knowledge about
various topics. However, as Shanahan (2014) explains, avoiding discussion altogether of back-
ground knowledge will not serve to allow children to interpret and comprehend texts more
equally, because it would be next to impossible for children who do possess background
knowledge about a topic to avoid using it to construct meaning while they read. Those with-
out the background knowledge will not have this advantage, and will be wrongly viewed
as having poor comprehension, when in fact it is their lack of knowledge that is to blame.
Shanahan (2014) provides some practical instructional suggestions for activating background
knowledge before and during reading. An abridged and modified list appears below:

 1. When introducing texts, avoid lengthy introductions or potentially ineffective pre-read-
      ing strategies such as a "picture walks" and tedious contributions of students' prior

50 | 4. Language Comprehension Ability
      knowledge that could potentially impair comprehension. A simple statement such as
      "We're going to read a story about how animals camouflage themselves" may suffice.
      The goal is to be brief and strategic (e.g., what is the purpose of the text, what will stu-
      dents bring to it, and what information absolutely needs to be provided; note all the
      other suggestions below for more clarification). Otherwise time spent during pre-read-
      ing activities may take time away from the actual reading, become boring or repetitive,
      and possibly steer children to the wrong focus, ruining the entire experience. See an
      additional blog post in which Shanahan (2012) speaks specifically about this topic
      http://www.shanahanonliteracy.com/2012/02/pre-reading-or-not-on-premature-
      demise.html
 2. When introducing a topic or genre that students will be reading, avoid revealing infor-
      mation that you will want them to extract from the text(s) on their own.
 3. Preteach necessary information students will need if it is not in the text (e.g., a text on
      climate change may not have been written for young students, so vital references to
      geography or technology may need explanation).
 4. Do not focus on activating background knowledge about topics in the text that are not
      needed for its comprehension (e.g., a text focusing on how an octopus camouflages itself
      does not require discussion or instruction about oceans).
 5. When using multiple texts to develop background knowledge, introduce them in an
      order that will support and reinforce those that may come before or after. Initial texts
      may cover a particular topic in a general manner, followed up by texts that cover the
      material in the initial texts and delve deeper into the topic.
 6. Attend to the differing background knowledge needs of students from diverse cultures
      by considering information you may need to pre-teach in order for them to comprehend
      particular texts.

Vocabulary

Having just read about background knowledge, it is probably easy for you to imagine how
vocabulary--the knowledge of the meaning of words in a text--adds significantly to the con-
struction of the meaning of texts. Vocabulary knowledge is a prominent predictor of reading
comprehension and is depicted as a central thread in the language comprehension compo-
nent of the Simple View of Reading because of its connections to background knowledge and
language structures (Scarborough, 2002).

   The development of a child's vocabulary begins at infancy, when a baby starts hearing
speech and babbling. Oral language experiences, such as in-person conversations, dialogue
heard on TV, or language heard during the reading of children's books are primary means for
accumulating vocabulary. By the age of two, children usually speak about 200 to 300 words
and understand many more, and once in school, they learn approximately 3,000 words per
year, and can comprehend many more than they can read (Nagy, 2009). To accomplish this
rate of word learning, it is critical to ensure that students are learning new words each day.
This is especially true for many students from less advantaged backgrounds, who are exposed
to millions fewer words in their first three years of life than students who come from more
privileged backgrounds (Hart & Risley, 1995). This disparity results in students from more
affluent households knowing thousands more words upon entering school, which benefits
their ability to understand, participate in, and profit from the language of instruction that is
predominant in U.S. school settings.

                                                                                                           4. Language Comprehension Ability | 51
      Why vocabulary is important

As stated previously, the level of a child's vocabulary knowledge is a strong predictor of read-
ing comprehension (Duncan et al., 2007). This seems obvious since not knowing the meaning
of words in a text makes it quite difficult to comprehend it. As Adams (2010) eloquently points
out, "What makes vocabulary valuable and important is not the words themselves so much as
the understandings they afford. The reason we need to know the meanings of words is that
they point to the knowledge from which we are to construct, interpret, and reflect on the
meaning of text" (p. 8).

      Vocabulary instruction

Instruction in vocabulary should begin with thinking about the different levels of "knowing" a
word. Upon hearing a word, we can say (a) we have never heard of it, (b) that we have heard
of it but we do not know it, (c) that we know it, or (d) that we both know it and can use it
(Nagy, 2009). The more deeply we know a word, the more likely we will be to understand it
when we hear it or read it, and the more likely we will be to use it when we speak or write.
Ideally, instruction makes it so that students reach the level of knowing and using words
when they converse, write, or read. Vocabulary learning occurs either incidentally (words
are learned through exposure and experiences) or intentionally (words are deliberately and
directly taught). The majority of words in our vocabularies are learned incidentally, through
conversations or independent reading (Adams, 2010). This means that most vocabulary learn-
ing will not occur through explicit instructional means but through opportunities available
in the child's environment to encounter and resolve meanings of new words. Children who
have learned to read independently are at an advantage in terms of learning words inciden-
tally because they are able to independently encounter new words and infer their meaning
while reading.

   Incidental vocabulary instruction is enhanced through rich and varied oral language dia-
logue and discourse experiences, and independent reading. Even though "incidental" learning
occurs as a result of some activities that do not involve any deliberate teaching, incidental
learning still often involves a level of intentionality on the part of teachers. Teachers should
consciously fill their everyday classroom language with rich, unique words so that they can be
learned incidentally. A classroom that is rich with words promotes awareness of new vocab-
ulary and a curiosity for learning new words. Rather than simplifying language for students,
conversations should be embedded with sophisticated words: "Jordan, why don't you amble
over here and let me glance at that," "Please shut the door; those third graders are causing
quite a commotion! What a ruckus!" and "Oh my, Jake, the lion on your t-shirt has such sin-
ister eyes! It terrifies me!" A resource for building language rich classrooms to promote oral
language, vocabulary, and comprehension is Dodson's (2011) 50 Nifty Speaking and Listening
Activities. While it is not a scientifically based intervention, it provides a multitude of listen-
ing, speaking, reading, and writing activities that adhere to a sequence of language develop-
ment for students ranging from kindergarten to fifth grade.

   Many words, phrases, and sayings require intentional instruction. Vocabulary words that
should be intentionally taught are those essential for understanding texts, those that are likely
to be encountered across multiple texts, or those that are particularly difficult to understand
(Beck, McKeown, & Kucan, 2002). Activities for directly teaching vocabulary include using
graphic organizers (for a collection of free graphic organizers visit https://www.teachervi-
sion.com/graphic-organizers/printable/6293.html), or analyzing words' semantic features
(i.e., listing their attributes--hard/soft, tall/short, exciting/dull).

52 | 4. Language Comprehension Ability
   Text Talk (Beck & McKeown, 2001) is an evidence-based vocabulary (and comprehension)
building intervention that can be easily built into daily read-alouds. Teachers pre-read the
selected text, choosing three to five vocabulary words that are "Tier 2" words. Tier 2 words
are sophisticated, occur frequently in conversation and print, and are used across multiple
domains and contexts. Examples of Tier 2 words are unique, convenient, remarkable, and mis-
ery (See Beck et al., 2002). Tier 1 words are those that are basic and, for speakers of English,
do not require instruction in school (e.g., wall, water, fun), and Tier 3 words are low-frequency
words that are specific to domains or content areas (e.g., photosynthesis, Constantinople).
During a read-aloud that is done in Text Talk fashion, open-ended comprehension questions
are asked. Open-ended questions require a meaningful interactive response rather than a
one-word reply. Examples of an open-ended question are "How do you think that made the
boy feel?" and "Why did the fox decide to share his food?" To answer each of these questions
requires an extended, multiple-word response. Examples of close-ended questions requiring
only a single word response include "Is the boy mad?" and "Which food did the fox share?"
Interactive extended responses and dialogue promote oral language development and allow
the teacher to monitor students' vocabulary use and comprehension. After the read-aloud or
during a second reading of the story, the preselected Tier 2 vocabulary words are defined by
the teacher using simple, child-friendly definitions (e.g., "To coax someone means to use your
words to get them to do something"). The meanings of the words are discussed within the
context of the story (e.g., "The mother coaxed her daughter to take a bath, meaning she used
words to convince her to get into the bathtub"), and the teacher provides examples of the
words within other contexts ("When my mother got older, I had to coax her to join us on vaca-
tion"). Finally, the students are asked to apply their knowledge and use the words in a personal
context to ensure that they have the correct understanding of their meanings ("Jared, can you
share an example of a time when someone coaxed you to do something?"). Additionally, during
the read-aloud, it is beneficial to read the text before showing the pictures so that the illustra-
tions do not interfere with attention or comprehension. This procedure is effective in getting
students to pay attention to the words being read, and thus, is helpful toward their compre-
hending the language of the story (Beck & McKeown, 2001). It fosters their ability to com-
prehend decontextualized language--language that is "outside the here and now" (p. 10)--and
leads to comprehending the vocabulary and text without relying on pictures. Teachers typi-
cally read children's books aloud on a daily basis. Modifying read-alouds a bit to include the
suggestions here fosters rich Tier 2 vocabulary and language comprehension through open-
ended questions and by drawing attention to the vocabulary and meaning in texts.

Language Structures

The final element contributing to language comprehension is language structure--the rela-
tionships between the words and sentences in a text. Looking back at the model of skilled
reading in Figure 1, it is evident there are many facets to language structures, including
knowledge of grammar, being able to make inferences, and having knowledge of literacy con-
cepts, such as what reading strategies to use for different types of texts (e.g., poems versus
informational texts). To simplify and streamline these for the purpose of this chapter, they
will be categorized as having to do with the major components of language that are intercon-
nected: form, content, and use (see Bloom & Lahey, 1978).

                                                                                                          4. Language Comprehension Ability | 53
      Why language form is important

Language form comprises the rules for how words are structured (see `morphology' described
below) as well as the rules for the arrangement of words within sentences and phrases (see
`syntax' described below). The act of constructing meaning while reading is complex, so it is
not surprising that morphology and syntax also contribute to reading comprehension.

   Morphology is the study of morphemes in a language. Not to be confused with phonemes,
which are the smallest units of sound in spoken words, morphemes are the smallest units
of meaning in words (to remember this, consider that "morphemes" and "meaning" both
begin with the letter "m"). Words contain one or more morphemes, or units of meaning. For
instance, "locate" is a word that is a freestanding morpheme because it has just one unit of
meaning and can stand on its own. By attaching another morpheme, the suffix "-tion," to cre-
ate "location," there are now two units of meaning: "locate" and the action or condition of
locating, "tion." "Tion" is a bound morpheme because its meaning depends on its connection
to other words; it cannot stand on its own. A third morpheme, the prefix "dis," changes the
meaning of the word yet again--"dislocation." In sum, the word "dislocation" is made up of
three morphemes, each of which contributes its own meaning. Similarly, "cat" is a freestand-
ing morpheme (a singular feline animal), but adding the bound morpheme--s--signals a change
in meaning and the reader now pictures more than one cat.

   Another aspect of language form, syntax, is commonly referred to as grammar. It is the
combining and ordering of words in sentences and phrases that enables comprehension
of a text. For example, in English, when the article "a" or "an" appears in a sentence, it is
expected that a noun will follow. Syntax includes sentence construction elements like state-
ments, commands, and combined sentences as well as particular sentence components such
as nouns, adjectives, and prepositional phrases. These are important for future teachers to
know, because effective use of these will allow students to comprehend text more success-
fully, and they will also allow students to demonstrate command of the conventions of the
language in their writing pieces.

      Language form instruction

Typically, rules of morphology and syntax are taught directly. For example, morphology
instruction includes root words, prefixes, and suffixes along with derivations of Greek and
Latin roots (e.g., "chron" is the Greek root for "time" in chronicle, synchronize, and "cred" is
the Latin root for "believe" in creed, incredible, credulous). Morphology charts of root words,
prefixes, and suffixes can be compiled over time and displayed on a wall so that students can
refer to them while reading or writing. Charts could feature a list of suffixes that indicate peo-
ple nouns (e.g., -er, -or, -cian, -ist), suffixes that create verbs (e.g., -ize, ify), or base words
that change spelling and pronunciation (e.g., sign/signature/design, deep/depth). Incidental
exposure to such morphology elements enhances word awareness (the act of noticing and
attending to features of words), vocabulary, and, of course, language comprehension.

      Why language content is important

Language content that is comprised of the meaning of the relationships that exist between
words, phrases, and sentences is known as semantics. Semantics is different from vocabulary
because it extends beyond the individual meaning of words. Note that once again, there is an
"m" in this "semantics," but it is in the middle of the word, which may help you to remember
it has to do with the meaning that ties words (and sentences) together. Understanding the
semantics of language enables comprehension because it clarifies the content--the network

54 | 4. Language Comprehension Ability
of events and relationships that exists in texts. For example, reading a sentence about a jug
breaking and glass being scattered all over the floor might cause confusion, since jugs are
typically not thought of as being made of glass.

      Language content instruction

Semantics requires knowledge of vocabulary (a word's meaning, and perhaps its synonyms
and antonyms), as well as syntax. Just as important is background knowledge in order to form
correct judgments about the context being read. Part of this knowledge includes the mean-
ing of humor, slang, idioms (i.e., combinations of words having a figurative meaning as in "it's
raining cats and dogs" or "he was feeling blue"), metaphors (a comparison of two things as
in "she is my sunshine") and similes (comparisons of two things using "like" or "as" as in "her
laughter is like sunshine"). Languages have thousands of common and often subtle seman-
tic attributes that involve analogy, exaggeration, sarcasm, puns, and parables to convey world
knowledge. Teachers can explicitly teach these attributes so that they are recognized more
readily, explicitly define particular sayings and expressions, and demonstrate examples and
nonexamples. For example, a teacher could demonstrate examples and nonexamples of exag-
geration ("I have a million papers to grade!" vs. "I have three papers to grade"). As soon as
schooling begins, semantic conventions should be taught, such as in the way that "once upon
a time" signals the beginning of a fairy tale. Like vocabulary, the majority of semantic knowl-
edge is derived from previous experiences and background knowledge. Teaching students
phrases through exposure to discussions, reading, and other venues like television, movies,
and online videos does a lot to promote this language comprehension element.

      Why language use is important

Language use is termed pragmatics. Pragmatics are the rules of language that lead to appro-
priate use in assorted settings and contexts. Each setting (e.g., school, home, restaurant, job
interview, playground) or context (e.g., greeting, inquiry, negotiation, explanation) has a par-
ticular purpose. To communicate appropriately, students must learn patterns of conversation
and dialogue that occur in assorted settings. For example, use of language can vary according
to a person's status, so whether talking at home to a parent (a more casual use of language)
or talking to a teacher at school, (a more formal use of language), the setting and the status
differ, and language use must adapt accordingly. Understanding the nuances of pragmatics
contributes to language comprehension, which in turn enables a reader to recognize its uses
in written text, leading to more successful reading comprehension.

      Language use instruction

The pragmatics of language use in school requires students to comprehend academic lan-
guage. Students, especially English language learners and students with social difficulties,
must comprehend the differences between conversation and academic language. Students'
language use in assorted settings (e.g., playground conversations, discussions with teachers)
often requires teachers to provide clarification and elaboration. Students can perform enjoy-
able skits demonstrating the differences in language use in various situations and teachers
can monitor and model language use as students tell stories, describe events, or recount per-
sonal experiences.

                                                                                                          4. Language Comprehension Ability | 55
                                    Summary

To help students develop language comprehension, the underlying meaning-based elements
of reading--background knowledge, vocabulary, and language structures--must be taught and
monitored. Unlike teaching students to recognize words accurately and automatically so that
they become fluent readers, teaching the elements of language comprehension must be done
so that students become increasingly strategic about extracting the meaning from texts they
read. This is an incremental, ongoing, developmental process that lasts a lifetime. With each
new bit of background knowledge, each new vocabulary word, and each new understanding
of language use, students can integrate this knowledge strategically to comprehend text.

   The two essential components of the Simple View of Reading, automatic word recognition
and strategic language comprehension, contribute to the ultimate goal of teaching reading:
skilled reading comprehension. Once students become proficient decoders and can automat-
ically identify words, the role of language comprehension becomes increasingly important as
students shift from paying attention to the words to paying attention to meaning.

   Teachers must be ever mindful of the presence or absence of background knowledge that
students bring to the task. As important as it is for students to monitor their comprehension,
it is equally important for teachers to continually monitor each student's background knowl-
edge and comprehension so that they can step in to build and supply what is missing in their
understanding. The value of the knowledge that students bring to their reading should never
be sacrificed for the sake of comprehension strategy instruction. They must go hand in hand.

   Questions and Activities

      1. What are the three underlying elements of language comprehension? How does each con-
           tribute to successful reading comprehension?

      2. Which instructional activities are helpful for providing and activating background knowl-
           edge, teaching vocabulary, and promoting language use?

      3. Consider a student that you have worked with who has difficulty with reading comprehen-
           sion. Which of the underlying element(s) of language comprehension (i.e., background
           knowledge, vocabulary, language use) do you believe may be at the root of this student's
           difficulties? How might you develop a new instructional plan to address these difficulties?

      4. Select an informational text that you might use with students. Identify the facts, phrases,
           vocabulary or other knowledge items that readers would need in order to comprehend the
           text. Next, consider discussing which facts, phrases, vocabulary, or other knowledge items
           would a reader NOT necessarily need in order for comprehension to still occur.

                                     Abstract

This chapter focuses on key ideas for understanding literacy assessment to assist with educa-
tional decisions. Included is an overview of different literacy assessments, along with common
assessment procedures used in schools and applications of assessment practices to support
effective teaching. Readers of the chapter will gain an understanding of different types of
assessments, how assessment techniques are used in schools, and how assessment results
can inform teaching.

   Learning Objectives

        After reading this chapter, readers will be able to

      1. explain how testing fits into the larger category of assessment;
      2. describe different literacy assessments and how they are commonly used in schools;
      3. discuss why assessment findings are judged based on their validity for answering educa-

           tional questions and making decisions;
      4. explain the importance of reliability and validity of test scores and why psychometric prop-

           erties are important for interpreting certain types of assessment results;
      5. critique literacy assessments in terms of how they can be used or misused.

                                  Introduction

When the topic of educational assessment is brought up, most educators immediately think
of high-stakes tests used to gauge students' progress in meeting a set of educational stan-
dards. It makes sense that much of the dialogue concerning educational assessment centers
on high-stakes testing because it is this kind of assessment that is most controversial in
the American education system, particularly since the vast majority of states have adopted
the Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts & Literacy in History/Social Stud-
ies, Science, and Technical Subjects (CCSS; National Governors Association Center for Best
Practices & Council of Chief State School Officers [NGA & CCSSO], 2010), along with high
stakes tests intended to assess students' proficiency in meeting them. But high-stakes tests
are actually just a fraction of assessment procedures used in schools, and many other assess-
ments are as important in influencing instructional decisions. This chapter discusses a wide

                                                                                                                                                                59
scope of literacy assessments commonly used in kindergarten through twelfth grade class-
rooms, along with ways to use results to make educational decisions.

                            Literacy Assessment

To understand literacy assessment, we first need to think about the term "literacy," which is
discussed throughout the chapters in this textbook. Literacy has traditionally been regarded
as having to do with the ability to read and write. More recently, literacy has evolved to
encompass multidimensional abilities such as listening, speaking, viewing, and performing
(NGA & CCSSO, 2010), along with cultural and societal factors (Snow, 2002) that can facilitate
or constrain literacy development. This multidimensional definition of literacy requires edu-
cators and policy makers to conceptualize literacy in complex ways. Controversies arise when
the richness of literacy is overly simplified by assessments that are not multidimensional or
authentic, such as the overuse of multiple-choice questions. Educators may find the lack of
authenticity of these assessments frustrating when results do not appear to represent what
their students know and can do. On the other hand, more authentic assessment methods,
such as observing students who are deliberating the meaning of texts during group discus-
sions, do not precisely measure literacy skills, which can limit the kinds of decisions that can
be made.

   Even though the assessment of literacy using multiple choice items versus more authentic
procedures seems like opposites, they do have an important feature in common: they both
can provide answers to educational questions. Whether one approach is more valuable than
the other, or whether both are needed, depends entirely on the kind of questions being asked.
So if someone asks you if a multiple choice test is a good test or if observing a student's read-
ing is a better assessment procedure, your answer will depend on many different factors, such
as the purpose of the assessment, along with the quality of the assessment tool, the skills of
the person who is using it, and the educational decisions needing to be made. This chapter
will help you learn more about how to make decisions about using literacy assessments and
how to use them to improve teaching and learning.

                 Taxonomy of Literacy Assessments

To understand the purposes of different types of literacy assessment, it is helpful to catego-
rize them based on their purposes. It should be noted that there is much more research on
the assessment of reading compared to assessment of other literacy skills, making examples
in the chapter somewhat weighted toward reading assessments. Examples of assessments not
limited to reading have also been included, where appropriate, as a reminder that literacy
includes reading, writing, listening, speaking, viewing, and performing, consistent with the
definition of literacy provided in Chapter 1 of this textbook.

Formal Assessments

One way to categorize literacy assessments is whether they are formal or informal. Formal
literacy assessments usually involve the use of some kind of standardized procedures that
require administering and scoring the assessment in the same way for all students. An exam-
ple of formal assessments is state tests, which evaluate proficiency in one or more literacy
domains, such as reading, writing, and listening. During the administration of state tests, stu-
dents are all given the same test at their given grade levels, teachers read the same directions

60 | 5. Types of Literacy Assessment: Principles, Procedures, and Applications
in the same way to all students, the students are given the same amount of time to com-
plete the test (unless the student received test accommodations due to a disability), and the
tests are scored and reported using the same procedures. Standardization allows control over
factors that can unintentionally influence students' scores, such as how directions are given,
how teachers respond to students' questions, and how teachers score students' responses.
Certain state test scores are also usually classified as criterion-referenced because they mea-
sure how students achieve in reference to "a fixed set of predetermined criteria or learning
standards" (edglossary.org, 2014). Each state specifies standards students should meet at each
grade level, and state test scores reflect how well students achieved in relation to these stan-
dards. For example, on a scale of 1 to 4, if a student achieved a score of "2" this score would
typically reflect that the student is not yet meeting the standards for their grade, and he or
she may be eligible for extra help toward meeting them.

   Another example of a criterion-referenced score is the score achieved on a permit test to
drive a car. A predetermined cut score is used to decide who is ready to get behind the wheel
of a car, and it is possible for all test takers to meet the criterion (e.g., 80% items correct
or higher). Criterion-referenced test scores are contrasted with normatively referenced (i.e.,
norm-referenced) test scores, such as an SAT score. How a student does depends on how
other students score who take the test, so there is no criterion score to meet or exceed. To
score high, all a student has to do is do better than most everyone else. Norm-referenced
scores are often associated with diagnostic tests, which will be described in further detail in
the section of this chapter under the heading "Diagnostic Literacy Assessments."

Informal Assessments

Informal literacy assessments are more flexible than formal assessments because they can be
adjusted according to the student being assessed or a particular assessment context. Teach-
ers make decisions regarding with whom informal assessments are used, how the assess-
ments are done, and how to interpret findings. Informal literacy assessments can easily
incorporate all areas of literacy such as speaking, listening, viewing, and performing rather
than focusing more exclusively on reading and writing. For example, a teacher who observes
and records behaviors of a group of students who view and discuss a video is likely engaging
in informal assessment of the student's reading, writing, speaking, listening, and/or perform-
ing behaviors.

   Teachers engage in a multitude of informal assessments each time they interact with their
students. Asking students to write down something they learned during an English language
arts (ELA) class or something they are confused about is a form of informal assessment.
Observing students engaging in cooperative learning group discussions, taking notes while
they plan a project, and even observing the expressions on students' faces during a group
activity are all types of informal assessment. Likewise, observing students' level of engage-
ment during literacy tasks is informal assessment when procedures are flexible and individu-
alized. Informal classroom-based self-assessments and student inventories used to determine
students' attitudes about reading may be useful toward planning and adjusting instruction as
well (Afflerbach & Cho, 2011).

   Methods for assessing literacy that fall somewhere between informal and formal include
reading inventories, such as the Qualitative Reading Inventory-5 (QRI-5; Leslie & Caldwell,
2010). Reading inventories require students to read word lists, passages, and answer ques-
tions, and although there are specific directions for how to administer and score them, they
offer flexibility in observing how students engage in literacy tasks. Reading inventories are

                                                      5. Types of Literacy Assessment: Principles, Procedures, and Applications | 61
often used to record observations of reading behaviors rather than to simply measure reading
achievement.

Formative Assessments

Another useful way to categorize literacy assessments is whether they are formative or sum-
mative. Formative assessments are used to "form" a plan to improve learning. An example of
formative literacy assessment might involve a classroom teacher checking how many letters
and sounds her students know as she plans decoding lessons. Students knowing only a few
letter sounds could be given texts that do not include letters and words they cannot decode
to prevent them from guessing at words. Students who know most of their letter sounds could
be given texts that contain more letters and letter combinations that they can practice sound-
ing out (e.g., the words in their texts might include all the short vowels and some digraphs
they have learned, such as sh, th, ck). In this example, using a formative letter-sound assess-
ment helped the teacher to select what to teach rather than simply evaluate what the student
knows. Formative assessment is intended to provide teachers with information to improve
students' learning, based on what students need.

Summative Assessments

Summative assessments are used to "sum up" if students have met a specified level of pro-
ficiency or learning objective. State tests fall under the category of summative assessments
because they are generally given to see which students have met a critical level of proficiency,
as defined by standards adopted by a particular state. Unit tests are also summative when
they sum up how students did in meeting particular literacy objectives by using their knowl-
edge related to reading, writing, listening, speaking, viewing, and performing. A spelling test
can be both formative and summative. It is formative when the teacher is using the informa-
tion to plan lessons such as what to reteach, and it is summative if used to determine whether
students showed mastery of a spelling rule such as "dropping the `e' and adding `-ing'." So the
goal of formative assessment is mostly to inform teaching, whereas the goal of summative
assessment is to summarize the extent to which students surpass a certain level of proficiency
at an end-point of instruction, such as at the end of an instructional unit or at the end of a
school year.

Literacy Screenings

Another way to categorize assessments is whether they are used for screening or diagnostic
purposes. Literacy screenings share characteristics with medical screenings, such as hearing
and vision checks in the nurse's office or when a patients' blood pressure is checked at the
beginning of a visit to the physician's office. Screenings are typically quick and given to all
members of a population (e.g., all students, all patients) to identify potential problems that
may not be recognized during day-to-day interactions. See Table 1 for examples of commonly
used universal literacy screeners, along with links to information about their use.

      Among the most popular literacy screeners used in schools are the Dynamic Indicators of
Basic Early Literacy Skills--Next Edition (DIBELS Next; Good & Kaminski, 2011) and AIMSweb
(Pearson, 2012). These screeners include sets of items administered to all children at certain
grade levels (which is why they are often called "universal" literacy screeners) to do quick
checks of their literacy development and identify potential problems that may not be visible
using less formal means. Literacy screenings require young children to complete one-minute
tasks such as naming sounds they hear in spoken words (e.g., "cat" has the sounds /c/ /a/
/t/), naming the sounds of letters they see (e.g., letter "p" says /p/), and starting in first
grade, reading words in brief passages. Universal literacy screenings such as DIBELS Next and
AIMSweb are often characterized as "fluency" assessments because they measure both accu-
racy and efficiency in completing tasks. For these assessments, the correct number of sounds,
letters, or words is recorded and compared to a research-established cut point (i.e., bench-
mark) to decide which students are not likely to be successful in developing literacy skills
without extra help. If a student scores below the benchmark, it indicates that the task was too
difficult, and detection of this difficulty can signal a need for intervention to prevent future
academic problems. Intervention typically involves more intensive ways of teaching, such as
extra instruction delivered to small groups of students.

   To learn more about commercially available screenings such as DIBELS Next and AIMSweb,
or to learn about how to create your own personalized screenings, please visit http://inter-
ventioncentral.org. This site enables teachers to create their own individualized screening
probes to assess a variety of basic literacy skills, such as identifying letters and sounds, seg-
menting sounds in spoken words, sounding out nonsense words, reading real words in con-
nected text, and filling in blanks in reading passages (called "maze" procedures). Teachers
can select the letters, words, and passages to be included on these individualized assess-
ments. Probes to assess students' math and writing skills can also be created; however, any
customized screening probes should be used with caution, since they do not share the same
measurement properties as well-researched screenings such as DIBELS Next and AIMSweb.

Diagnostic Literacy Assessments

The purposes of universal literacy screenings can be contrasted with those of diagnostic liter-
acy assessments. Unlike literacy screeners, diagnostic tests are generally not administered to
all students but are reserved for students whose learning needs continue to be unmet, despite
their receiving intensive intervention. Diagnostic literacy assessments typically involve the
use of standardized tests administered individually to students by highly trained educational
specialists, such as reading teachers, special educators, speech and language pathologists,
and school psychologists. Diagnostic literacy assessments include subtests focusing on spe-
cific components of literacy, such as word recognition, decoding, reading comprehension,
and both spoken and written language. Results from diagnostic assessments may be used
formatively to help plan more targeted interventions for students who do not appear to be
responding adequately, or results can be combined with those from other assessments to
determine whether students may have an educational disability requiring special education
services.

5. Types of Literacy Assessment: Principles, Procedures, and Applications | 63
   An example of a widely used diagnostic literacy test is the Wechsler Individual Achievement
Test-Third Edition (WIAT-III; Wechsler, 2009). The WIAT-III is typically used to assess the
achievement of students experiencing academic difficulties who have not responded to
research-based interventions. The WIAT-III includes reading, math, and language items
administered according to the age of the student and his or her current skill level. The number
of items the student gets correct (the raw score) is converted to a standard score, which is
then interpreted according to where the student's score falls on a bell curve (see Figure 1)
among other students the same age and grade level who took the same test (e.g., the norma-
tive or "norm" sample).

                     Figure 1. Bell curve showing the percentage of students who fall above and
                     below the average score of 100 on a diagnostic achievement test.

      Most students will score in the middle of the distribution, but some students will achieve
extreme scores--either higher or lower than most other students. This is why the "tails" at
either side of the bell curve slope downward from the big hump in the middle--this illustrates
the decreasing frequency of scores that are especially low or high. In other words, the more
extreme the score, the fewer students are likely to achieve it. When students achieve at either
extreme, it can signal the need for more specialized instruction related to the individual needs
of the student (e.g., intervention or gifted services).

   Diagnostic achievement tests are frequently referred to as "norm-referenced" (edglos-
sary.org, 2013) because their scores are compared to scores of students from a norm sample.
A norm sample is a group of individuals who were administered the same test items in the
same way (i.e., using standardized procedures) while the test was being developed. Students
who take the test have their performance compared to that of students from the norm sample
to make meaning of the score. For example, if a student were given a diagnostic assessment
and the score fell within the same range as most of the students in the norm sample, then his
or her score would be considered "average." If the student's score fell much higher or lower
than other students in the norm sample, then the score would not be considered average or
typical because most of the other students did not score at either of these extremes.

   Comparing students' scores to a norm sample helps identify strengths and needs. Then
again, just knowing where students' scores fall on a bell curve does nothing to explain why
they scored that way. An extremely low score may indicate a learning problem, or, it may sig-
nal a lack of motivation on the part of the student while taking the test. Perhaps a low score
could even be due to a scoring error made by the tester. Even though a score from a diag-
nostic assessment may be quite precise, understanding why a student scored at a particular

64 | 5. Types of Literacy Assessment: Principles, Procedures, and Applications
level requires additional information. Did observations during testing show that the student
was distracted, uncooperative, or was squinting at items? It is often a combination of assess-
ment information that helps identify why a student may have scored a certain way and is why
testers often use their observations during testing to interpret the meaning of scores.

   Group achievement tests such as The Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS; Hoover Dunbar, & Fris-
bie, 2003) that include literacy subtests have properties that make them function somewhat
like a screening and somewhat like a diagnostic test. Like screeners, they are administered
to all students at a particular grade level, but unlike most screeners, they take more time to
complete and are administered to entire classrooms rather than having at least some sections
administered individually. Like diagnostic tests, they tend to produce scores that are norm-
referenced. Students' performance is compared to a norm group to see how they compare
among peers, but unlike diagnostic tests, the tester is not able to discern how well scores rep-
resent students' abilities because testers are not able to observe all of the students' testing
behaviors that may impact the interpretation of scores (e.g., levels of engagement, motiva-
tion).

   For many diagnostic literacy tests, reviews are available through sources such as the Mental
Measurements Yearbook (MMY). Versions of the MMY are available in hard copy at many
libraries, as well as online for free for students at colleges and universities whose libraries
pay a fee for access. Reviews are typically completed by experts in various fields, including
literacy and measurement experts. Reviews also include complete descriptions of the test or
assessment procedure, who publishes it, how long it takes to administer and score, a review
of psychometric properties, and a critique of the test in reference to decisions people plan
to make based on findings. It is important for teachers and other educators who use tests to
understand the benefits and problems associated with selecting one test over another, and
resources such as the MMY offer reviews that are quick to locate, relatively easy to compre-
hend (when one has some background knowledge in assessment), and are written by people
who do not profit from the publication and sale of the assessment.

Single Point Estimates

Literacy assessments that are completed only one time provide a single point estimate of a
student's abilities. An example of a single point estimate is a student's word identification
score from a diagnostic achievement test. If the student's score is far below what is expected
for his or her age or grade level, then the score signals a need to determine what is at the
root of low performance. Alternatively, a single low score does not necessarily signal a lack of
ability to learn, since with a change in instruction, the student might begin to progress much
faster and eventually catch up to his or her typical age-based peers. To assess a student's rate
of learning, progress-monitoring assessments are needed.

Progress-Monitoring Literacy Assessments

To monitor a student's progress in literacy, assessments are needed that actually measure
growth. Rather than just taking a snapshot of the student's achievement at a single point in
time, progress-monitoring assessments provide a baseline (i.e., the starting point) of a stu-
dent's achievement, along with periodic reassessment as he or she is progressing toward
learning outcomes. Such outcomes might include achieving a benchmark score of correctly
reading 52 words per minute on oral reading fluency passages or a goal of learning to "ask
and answer key details in a text" (CCSS.ELA-Literacy.RL.1.2) when prompted, with 85% accu-
racy. The first outcome of correctly reading 52 words per minute would likely be measured

                                                     5. Types of Literacy Assessment: Principles, Procedures, and Applications | 65
using progress-monitoring assessments, such as DIBELS Next and AIMSweb. These screeners
are not only designed to measure the extent to which students are at risk for future literacy-
related problems at the beginning of the school year but also to monitor changes in progress
over time, sometimes as often as every one or two weeks, depending on individual student
factors. The second outcome of being able to "ask and answer key details in a text" could be
monitored over time using assessments such as state tests or responses on a qualitative read-
ing inventory. Being able to work with key details in a text could also be informally assessed
by observing students engaged in classroom activities where this task is practiced.

   Unlike assessments that are completed only one time, progress-monitoring assessments
such as DIBELS Next and AIMSweb feature multiple, equivalent versions of the same tasks,
such as having 20 oral reading fluency passages that can be used for reassessments. Using
different but equivalent passages prevents artificial increases in scores that would result from
students rereading the same passage. Progress-monitoring assessments can be contrasted
with diagnostic assessments, which are not designed to be administered frequently. Admin-
istering the same subtests repeatedly would not be an effective way to monitor progress.
Some diagnostic tests have two equivalent versions of subtests to monitor progress infre-
quently--perhaps on a yearly basis--but they are simply not designed for frequent reassess-
ments. This limitation of diagnostic assessments is one reason why screeners like DIBELS
Next and AIMSweb are so useful for determining how students respond to intervention and
why diagnostic tests are often reserved for making other educational decisions, such as
whether a student may have an educational disability.

   Progress-monitoring assessments have transformed how schools determine how a student
is responding to intervention. For example, consider the hypothetical example of Jaime's
progress-monitoring assessment results in second grade, shown in Figure 2. Jaime was given
oral reading fluency passages from a universal literacy screener, and then his progress was
monitored to determine his response to a small group literacy intervention started in mid-
October. Data points show the number of words Jaime read correctly on each of the one-
minute reading passages. Notice how at the beginning of the school year, his baseline scores
were extremely low, and when compared to the beginning of the year second grade bench-
mark (Dynamic Measurement Group, 2010) of 521 words per minute (Good & Kaminski, 2011),
they signaled he was "at risk" of not reaching later benchmarks without receiving intensive
intervention. Based on Jaime's baseline scores, intervention team members decided that he
should receive a research-based literacy intervention to help him read words more easily so
that his oral reading fluency would increase at least one word per week. This learning goal is
represented by the "target slope" seen in Figure 2. During the intervention phase, progress-
monitoring data points show that Jaime began making improvements toward this goal, and
the line labeled "slope during intervention" shows that he was gaining at a rate slightly faster
than his one word per week goal.

66 | 5. Types of Literacy Assessment: Principles, Procedures, and Applications
Figure 2. Progress-monitoring graph of response to a reading intervention.

      When looking at Jaime's baseline data, notice how the data points form a plateau. If his
progress continued at this same rate, by the end of the school year, he would be even farther
behind his peers and be at even greater risk for future reading problems. When interpret-
ing the graph in Figure 2, it becomes clear that intensive reading intervention was needed.
Notice after the intervention began how Jaime's growth began to climb steeply. Although he
appeared to be responding positively to intervention, in reality, by the end of second grade,
students whose reading ability progresses adequately should be reading approximately 90
words correctly per minute (Good & Kaminski, 2011). Based on this information, Jaime is not
likely to reach the level of reading 90 words correctly by the end of second grade and will
probably only reach the benchmark expected for a student at the beginning of second grade.
These assessment data suggest that Jaime's intervention should be intensified for the remain-
der of second grade to accelerate his progress further. It is also likely that Jaime will need
to continue receiving intervention into third grade, and progress monitoring can determine,
along with other assessment information, when his oral reading fluency improves to the point
where intervention may be changed, reduced, or even discontinued. You may wonder how the
intervention team would determine whether Jaime is progressing at an adequate pace when
he is in third grade. Team members would continue to monitor Jaime's progress and check to
make sure his growth line shows that he will meet benchmark at the end of third grade (i.e.,
correctly reading approximately 100 words per minute; Good & Kaminski, 2011). If his slope
shows a lack of adequate progress, his teachers can revisit the need for intervention to ensure
that Jaime does not fall behind again.

   Some schools monitor their students' progress using computer-adapted assessments,
which involve students responding to test items delivered on a computer. Computer-adapted
assessments are designed to deliver specific test items to students, and then adapt the num-
ber and difficulty of items administered according to how students respond (Mitchell, Truck-
enmiller, & Petscher, 2015). Computer-adapted assessments are increasing in popularity in

                                                     5. Types of Literacy Assessment: Principles, Procedures, and Applications | 67
schools, in part, because they do not require a lot of time or effort to administer and score,
but they do require schools to have an adequate technology infrastructure. The reasoning
behind using these assessments is similar to other literacy screeners and progress-monitor-
ing assessments--to provide effective instruction and intervention to meet all students' needs
(Mitchell et al., 2014).

   Although many literacy screening and progress-monitoring assessment scores have been
shown to be well-correlated with a variety of measures of reading comprehension (see, for
example, Goffreda & DiPerna, 2010) and serve as reasonably good indicators of which stu-
dents are at risk for reading difficulties, a persistent problem with these assessments is that
they provide little guidance to teachers about what kind of literacy instruction and/or inter-
vention a student actually needs. A student who scores low at baseline and makes inadequate
progress on oral reading fluency tasks may need an intervention designed to increase read-
ing fluency, but there is also a chance that the student lacks the ability to decode words and
really needs a decoding intervention (Murray, Munger, & Clonan, 2012). Or it could be that
the student does not know the meaning of many vocabulary words and needs to build back-
ground knowledge to read fluently (Adams, 2010-2011), which would require the use of dif-
ferent assessment procedures specifically designed to assess and monitor progress related
to these skills. Even more vexing is when low oral reading fluency scores are caused by mul-
tiple, intermingling factors that need to be identified before intervention begins. When the
problem is more complex, more specialized assessments are needed to disentangle the fac-
tors contributing to it.

   A final note related to progress-monitoring procedures is the emergence of studies sug-
gesting that there may be better ways to measure students' progress on instruments such
as DIBELS Next compared to using slope (Good, Powell-Smith, & Dewey, 2015), which was
depicted in the example using Jaime's data. In a recent conference presentation, Good (2015)
argued that the slope of a student's progress may be too inconsistent to monitor and adjust
instruction, and he suggested a new (and somewhat mathematically complex) alternative
using an index called a student growth percentile. A student growth percentile compares the
rate at which a student's achievement is improving in reference to how other students with
the same baseline score are improving. For example, a student reading 10 correct words per
minute on an oral reading fluency measure whose growth is at the 5th percentile is improv-
ing much more slowly compared to the other children who also started out reading only 10
words correctly per minute. In this case, a growth percentile of five means that the student is
progressing only as well as or better than five percent of peers who started at the same score,
and also means that the current instruction is not meeting the student's needs. Preliminary
research shows some promise in using growth percentiles to measure progress as an alterna-
tive to slope, and teachers should be on the lookout for more research related to improving
ways to monitor student progress.

                 Linking Assessment to Intervention

How can teachers figure out the details of what a student needs in terms of intervention?
They would likely use a variety of informal and formal assessment techniques to determine
the student's strengths and needs. The situation might require the use of diagnostic assess-
ments, a reading or writing inventory, the use of observations to determine whether the stu-
dent is engaged during instruction, and/or the use of assessments to better understand the
student's problem-solving and other thinking skills. It may be a combination of assessment
techniques that are needed to match research-based interventions to the student's needs.

68 | 5. Types of Literacy Assessment: Principles, Procedures, and Applications
   You may be starting to recognize some overlap among different types of assessments across
categories. For example, state tests are usually both formal and summative. Literacy screen-
ers and progress-monitoring assessments are often formal and formative. And some assess-
ments, such as portfolio assessments, have many overlapping qualities across the various
assessment categories (e.g., portfolios can be used formatively to guide teaching and used
summatively to determine if students met an academic outcome).

   In bringing up portfolio assessments, this takes us back to points raised at the beginning
of this chapter related to the authenticity of literacy assessments. So why do multiple choice
tests exist if options such as portfolio assessment, which are so much more authentic, are
an option? High-quality multiple choice tests tend to have stronger psychometric proper-
ties (discussed in the next section) than performance assessments like portfolios, which make
multiple choice tests desirable when assessment time is limited and scores need to have
strong measurement properties. Multiple choice test items are often easy to score and do
not require a great deal of inference to interpret (i.e., they are "objective"), which are some of
the reasons why they are popularly used. Portfolio assessments often take longer to do but
also reflect the use of many important literacy skills that multiple choice items simply can-
not assess. Based on this discussion, you may wonder if portfolio assessments are superior to
multiple choice tests, or if the reverse is true. As always, an answer about a preferred format
depends on the purpose of the assessment and what kinds of decisions will be made based on
findings.

        Psychometric Principles of Literacy Assessment

A chapter about literacy assessment would not be complete without some discussion about
psychometric properties of assessment scores, such as reliability and validity (Trochim, 2006).
Reliable assessment means that the information gathered is consistent and dependable--that
the same or similar results would be obtained if the student were assessed on a different
day, by a different person, or using a similar version of the same assessment (Trochim, 2006).
To think about reliability in practice, imagine you were observing a student's reading behav-
iors and determined that the student was struggling with paying attention to punctuation
marks used in a storybook. You rate the student's proficiency as being a one on a one to four
scale, meaning he or she reads as though no punctuation marks were noticed. Your colleague
observed the student reading the same book at the same time you were observing, and he
rated the student's proficiency as a "three," meaning that the student was paying attention
to most of the punctuation in the story, but not all. The difference between your rating and
your colleague's rating signals a lack of reliability among raters using that scale. If these same
inconsistencies in ratings arose across other items on the reading behavior scale or with other
students, you would conclude that the scale has problems. These problems could include that
the scale is poorly constructed, or that there may simply be inter-rater reliability problems
related to a lack of training or experience with the people doing the ratings.

   Reliability of formal assessment instruments, such as tests, inventories, or surveys, is usu-
ally investigated through research that is published in academic journal articles or test man-
uals. This kind of research involves administering the instrument to a sample of individuals,
and findings are reported based on how those individuals scored. These findings provide
"estimates" of the test's reliability, since indexes of reliability will vary to a certain degree,
depending on the sample used in the research. The more stable reliability estimates are across
multiple diverse samples, the more teachers can count on scores or ratings being reliable for
their students. When reliability is unknown, then decisions made based on assessment infor-

                                                     5. Types of Literacy Assessment: Principles, Procedures, and Applications | 69
mation may not be trustworthy. The need for strong reliability versus the need for authentic-
ity (i.e., how well the assessment matches real life literacy situations) is a rivalry that underlies
many testing debates.

   In addition to assessments needing to be reliable, information gathered from assessments
must also be valid for making decisions. A test has evidence of validity when research shows
that it measures what it is supposed to measure (Trochim, 2006). For example, when a test
that is supposed to identify students at risk for writing problems identifies students with
actual writing problems, then this is evidence of the test's validity. A weekly spelling test score
may lack evidence of validity for applied spelling ability because some students may just be
good memorizers and not be able to spell the same words accurately or use the words in their
writing. When assessment information is not reliable, then it cannot be valid, so reliability is a
keystone for the evaluation of assessments.

   Sometimes, a test that seems to test what it is supposed to test will have issues with validity
that are not apparent. For example, if students are tested on math applications problems to
see who may need math intervention, a problem could arise if the children may not be able
to read the words in the problems. In this case, the students may get many items incorrect,
making the math test more like a reading test for these students. It is research on validity and
observations by astute educators that help uncover these sorts of problems and prevent the
delivery of a math intervention when what may actually be needed is a reading intervention.

   The validity issue described above is one reason why some students may receive accom-
modations (e.g., reading a test to students) because accommodations can actually increase
the validity of a test score for certain students. If students with reading disabilities had the
above math test read to them, then their resulting scores would likely be a truer indicator of
math ability because the accommodation ruled out their reading difficulties. This same logic
applies to English language learners (ELLs) who can understand spoken English much better
than they can read it. If a high school exam assessing knowledge of biology is administered
and ELL students are unable to pass it, is it because they do not know biology or is it because
they do not know how to read English? If the goal is to assess their knowledge of biology, then
the test scores may not be valid.

   Another example of a validity issue occurs if a student with visual impairment were assessed
using a reading task featuring print in 12-point font. If the student scored poorly, would you
refer him or her for reading intervention? Hopefully, not. The student might actually need
reading intervention, but there is a validity problem with the assessment results, so that in
reality, you would need more information before making any decisions. Consider that when
you reassess the student's reading using large print that the student's score increases dramat-
ically. You then know that it was a print size problem and not a reading problem that impacted
the student's initial score. On the other hand, if the student still scored low even with appro-
priately enlarged print, you would conclude that the student may have a visual impairment
and a reading problem, in which case providing reading intervention, along with the accom-
modation of large print material, would be needed.

           Some Controversies in Literacy Assessment

While there is little controversy surrounding literacy assessments that are informal and part
of normal classroom practices, formal assessments activate huge controversy in schools, in
research communities, on Internet discussion boards, and in textbooks like this. When con-
sidering the scope of educational assessment, one thing is clear: many school districts give
far too many tests to far too many students and waste far too many hours of instruction gath-

70 | 5. Types of Literacy Assessment: Principles, Procedures, and Applications
ering data that may or may not prove to have any value (Nelson, 2013). The over testing prob-
lem is especially problematic when so much time and effort go into gathering data that do
not even end up being used. Whether a school is overwhelmed with testing is not univer-
sal. School districts have a great deal of influence over the use of assessments, but all too
often when new assessments are adopted, they are added to a collection of previously adopted
assessments, and the district becomes unsure about which assessments are still needed and
which should be eliminated. Assessments also are added based on policy changes at federal
and state levels. For example, the passing of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB, 2002)
expanded state testing to occur in all grades three through eight, compared to previous man-
dates which were much less stringent.

   Some tests are mandated for schools to receive funding, such as state tests; however, the
use of other assessments is largely up to school districts. It is important for educators and
school leaders to periodically inventory procedures being used, discuss the extent to which
they are needed, and make decisions that will provide answers without over testing students.
In other words, the validity of assessments is not only limited to how they are used with indi-
vidual students but must be evaluated at a larger system level in which benefits to the whole
student body are also considered. When assessments provide data that are helpful in making
instructional decisions but also take away weeks of instructional time, educators and school
leaders must work toward solutions that maximize the value of assessments while minimizing
potential negative effects. Not liking test findings is a different issue than test findings not
being valid. For example if a test designed to identify students behind in reading is used to
change instruction, then it may be quite valuable, even if it is unpleasant to find out that many
students are having difficulty.

   As a society, we tend to want indicators of student accountability, such as that a minimum
standard has been met for students to earn a high school diploma. Often, earning a diploma
requires students to pass high-stakes exit exams; however, this seemingly straightforward
use of test scores can easily lead to social injustice, particularly for students from culturally
and linguistically diverse backgrounds. Because high-stakes tests may be inadequate at pro-
viding complete information about what many students know and can do, the International
Reading Association (IRA, 2014) released a position statement that included the following rec-
ommendation:

       High school graduation decisions must be based on a more complete picture of a
       student's literacy performance, obtained from a variety of systematic assessments,
       including informal observations, formative assessments of schoolwork, and consider-
       ation of out-of-school literacies, as well as results on standardized formal measures.
       (p. 2)

The IRA recommends that "teacher professional judgment, results from formative assess-
ments, and student and family input, as well as results from standardized literacy assess-
ments" (p. 5) serve as adequate additions in making graduation decisions. There is no easy
answer for how to use assessments to precisely communicate how well students are prepared
for college, careers, and life, and we are likely many reform movements away from designing
a suitable plan. Nevertheless, the more educators, families, and policy-makers know about
assessments--including the inherent benefits and problems that accompany their use--the
more progress can be made in refining techniques to make informed decisions designed to
enhance students' futures. Literacy assessments can only be used to improve outcomes for
students if educators have deep knowledge of research-based instruction, assessment, and

                                                      5. Types of Literacy Assessment: Principles, Procedures, and Applications | 71
intervention and can use that knowledge in their classrooms. For this reason, information
from this chapter should be combined with other chapters from this book and other texts
outlining the use of effective literacy strategies, including students who are at risk for devel-
oping reading problems or who are English language learners.

                                    Summary

Although literacy assessment is often associated with high-stakes standardized tests, in real-
ity, literacy assessments encompass an array of procedures to help teachers make instruc-
tional decisions. This chapter highlighted how teachers can use literacy assessments to
improve instruction, but in reality, assessment results are frequently used to communicate
about literacy with a variety of individuals, including teams of educators, specialists, and fam-
ily and/or community members. Knowing about the different kinds of assessments and their
purposes will allow you to be a valuable addition to these important conversations.

   Literacy assessments can be informal or formal, formative or summative, screenings or
diagnostic tests. They can provide data at single points in time or to monitor progress over
time. Regardless of their intended purpose, it is important that assessment information be
trustworthy. It is also important that teachers who use assessments understand associated
benefits and difficulties of different procedures. An assessment that is ideal for use in one cir-
cumstance may be inappropriate in another. For this reason, teachers who have background
in assessment will be better equipped to select appropriate assessments which have the
potential to benefit their students, and they also will be able to critique the use of assessments
in ways that can improve assessment practices that are more system-wide. Literacy assess-
ments are an important part of educational decision making, and therefore, it is essential that
teachers gain a thorough understanding of their uses and misuses, gain experience interpret-
ing information obtained through assessment, and actively participate in reform movements
designed not just to eliminate testing but to use assessments in thoughtful and meaningful
ways.

   Questions and Activities

      1. Using some of the terms learned from this chapter, discuss some commonly used high-
           stakes literacy assessments, such as state-mandated tests or other tests used in schools.

      2. Explain ways in which some forms of literacy assessment are more controversial than oth-
           ers and how the more controversial assessments are impacting teachers, students, and the
           education system.

      3. What are the differences between formative and summative assessments? List some exam-
           ples of each and how you currently use, or plan to use these assessments in your teaching.

      4. A colleague of yours decides that she would like to use a diagnostic literacy test to assess
           all students in her middle school to see who has reading, spelling, and/or writing prob-
           lems. The test must be administered individually and will take approximately 45 minutes
           per student. Although there is only one form of the assessment, your colleague would like
           to administer the test three times per year. After listening carefully to your colleague's
           ideas, what other ideas do you have that might help meet your colleague's goal besides the

72 | 5. Types of Literacy Assessment: Principles, Procedures, and Applications
           use of a diagnostic literacy test?

Elementary Classrooms

                                                       Vicki McQuitty

                                     Abstract

This chapter focuses on the different approaches to writing instruction that teachers use
in elementary classrooms. It includes an overview of each approach, a description of how
each is implemented, an explanation of how each has been critiqued, and research evidence
about each approach's effectiveness. It also provides recommendations about how elemen-
tary teachers can incorporate the most promising components of each approach into their
writing instruction.

   Learning Objectives

        After reading this chapter, readers will be able to

      1. describe different approaches to writing instruction;
      2. explain the benefits of each approach to teaching writing;
      3. discuss how educators and researchers have critiqued different ways of teaching writing;
      4. analyze the research conducted on different approaches to writing instruction;
      5. integrate ideas about effective writing instruction in elementary classrooms.

                                  Introduction

Imagine you are a second grader at the beginning of the school year. During writing time
your teacher tells you to write about your summer vacation. What do you do? To an observer,
it looks like you sat down at your desk, took out pencil and paper, wrote your story, and
then drew a picture to accompany it. Yet, was the process really so simple? What happened
inside your mind to get from the blank paper to a story about your summer? What thought
processes and skills did you use to write this "simple" composition?

   Writing is an important skill that is used throughout a person's life for academic, profes-
sional, and personal purposes. If you are a proficient writer, much of the process is automatic
and requires little conscious effort. But consider it from a child's point of view. For a novice
writer, there are many things to think about: forming letters on the page, writing left to right
in a horizontal line, leaving spaces between words, using letters to represent the sounds in
words, capitalizing proper nouns and the beginning of sentences, and placing punctuation in
appropriate places. At the same time, like adult writers, children must also devote attention
to generating and organizing ideas, including elements appropriate for the genre, choosing
vocabulary to communicate the ideas clearly, and monitoring the quality of the text. Thus,

                                                                                                                                                                75
writing places substantial cognitive demands on young children because they must attend to
many things simultaneously in order to produce an effective text.

   Because writing is such a challenging task, children need high quality instruction to develop
their writing skills. Over the years, teachers have taught writing in many different ways, and
components of each approach are still found in classrooms today. To understand current
writing instruction, it is helpful to understand how it has been taught in the past and why
educators have introduced new ways of teaching it over time. This chapter describes the dif-
ferent approaches that have been used, shows how each has been critiqued, and includes
research evidence about the effectiveness of each approach. Each section also includes rec-
ommendations for how teachers can best incorporate the components of each approach into
their classroom practice.

                           Penmanship Approach

In the United States, the earliest approach to writing instruction with young children was
teaching penmanship, a practice that dates back to the colonial era. Penmanship focused
on transcription--the physical act of writing--and it involved producing legible, accurate, and
even beautifully formed letters on the page. Children learned penmanship through imitation
and practice, so they copied models over and over again from printed copybooks. Young chil-
dren began by practicing single letters, followed by words, sentences, and eventually para-
graphs. In some classrooms, the teacher led the entire class to write letters in unison as she
gave verbal commands: "Up, down, left curve, quick" (Thornton, 1996). Sometimes children
even practiced the motions of writing, such as pushing and pulling the pencil on the paper,
without writing actual letters. Regardless of how penmanship was taught, though, "writing"
instruction consisted of copying rather than writing original words.

   The goal of penmanship instruction was to ensure children formed letters correctly so they
could produce neat, readable writing. However, students, and even many teachers, disliked
the boring and mechanical drills. By the 1930s, some educators began to critique penmanship
as an overly narrow approach to writing instruction (Hawkins & Razali, 2012). They suggested
penmanship was not an end in itself, but a tool for communication. This led some teachers
to encourage children to write their own ideas for real purposes, such as making classroom
signs or recording lunch orders. Teachers' manuals began to separate penmanship and writ-
ing instruction, and penmanship was renamed "handwriting."

   Handwriting instruction continued in most classrooms throughout the 20th century, but it
was given less priority as the curriculum began to focus on writing original compositions. At
the same time, some educators began to view handwriting as unimportant because the use
of technology (e.g., computers, tablets) has reduced the need for handwritten texts. Teach-
ers devoted less and less time to formal handwriting drills, though many children still prac-
ticed copying the alphabet in workbooks. Today, handwriting is usually taught in kindergarten
through third grade, but much less frequently in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades (Cutler &
Graham, 2008; Gilbert & Graham, 2010; Puranik, Otaiba, Sidler, & Greulich, 2014).

   Even though handwriting has been taught in U.S. elementary schools for over two cen-
turies, research on its effectiveness is relatively new. Recent studies show that handwriting is
an important part of writing instruction, but for different reasons than educators believed in
the past. The appearance of the writing, which was the focus of the penmanship approach, is
no longer considered important for its own sake. Instead, researchers now know that profi-
cient writers possess fluent handwriting skills, just as strong readers possess fluent decoding
skills1. They form letters quickly and automatically, without much conscious thought, which

76 | 6. Approaches to Writing Instruction in Elementary Classroom
allows them to devote attention to the higher level aspects of writing such as generating ideas
and monitoring the quality of their text (Christensen, 2009). Consider a child who wants to
write, "My dog is brown." Because her mind can remember only a limited amount of informa-
tion at once, if she directs all of her attention to producing the letters M, y, d, o, and g, she
has no way to hold the idea "is brown" in her memory. As a result, she may forget what she
intended to write at the end of the sentence. Thus, the benefit of handwriting instruction is
to help children form letters effortlessly so they can think about their ideas rather than tran-
scription.

   Research shows that the most effective handwriting instruction occurs in short, frequent,
and structured lessons (Christensen, 2009). Lessons should last 10-20 minutes each day and
focus on writing fluently and automatically rather than on forming perfect letters or posi-
tioning the letters precisely between the lines. It is helpful if teachers demonstrate how to
form each letter and then provide time for children to practice writing single letters, indi-
vidual words, and longer texts. Programs exist for both manuscript and cursive writing, and
they often teach the letters in a particular order that has been found to facilitate handwrit-
ing development. However, handwriting instruction should only occur until children can form
letters fluently. As their handwriting becomes automatic, they should spend time writing for
authentic audiences and purposes rather than practicing letter formation.

                          Rules-Based Approach

Teachers in the U.S. have taught children the rules of language and writing since colonial
times. Initially, these lessons occurred in the subject of "grammar" and were considered sep-
arate from "writing" (penmanship) instruction. However, as children began composing origi-
nal sentences, grammar and writing instruction began to merge. By the late 1800s, teachers
viewed rules-based instruction as a way to improve students' writing (Weaver, 1996).

   Rules-based instruction involves teaching children to correctly write words and sentences.
It includes activities like identifying parts of speech, locating sentence elements such as sub-
jects and predicates, learning and applying rules for subject-verb agreement and pronoun
use, and practicing punctuation, capitalization, and spelling. One common exercise is sen-
tence correction. Teachers provide sentences with language errors and ask children to cor-
rect the mistakes. Students may also write original sentences for the purpose of practicing
how to use language. For example, they may be asked to write a sentence that uses certain
adjectives or homonyms appropriately. Other activities include adding prefixes or suffixes to
lists of words, joining sentences by adding conjunctions, and changing fragments into com-
plete sentences.

   Many educators have critiqued the rules-based approach to teaching writing as being
decontextualized and inauthentic. It is decontextualized because children mostly write iso-
lated words or sentences rather than full texts. It is inauthentic because, in the world outside
of school, people do not write in decontextualized ways. They write stories, blogs, emails,
and reports, and those compositions serve meaningful purposes--to entertain, inform, or
persuade their readers. Writers communicate meaning, not just correct sentences, so they
must generate meaningful ideas and organize their thoughts logically. However, rules-based
instruction does not address these higher level aspects of writing. Activities such as correct-
ing sentences and adding prefixes to lists of words bear little resemblance to writing people
use in their everyday lives.

   Because rules-based instruction is decontextualized from writing authentic texts, it does
not improve children's writing skills. As early as 1926, elementary teachers reported that, "the

                                                                     6. Approaches to Writing Instruction in Elementary Classroom | 77
study of grammar did not seem to affect pupils' speech and writing" (Cotner, 1926, p. 525).
Later research provided empirical evidence to support what teachers noticed in their class-
rooms. Many studies synthesized by Myhill and Watson (2013) have shown that teaching chil-
dren rules apart from meaningful writing tasks makes no impact on how they write. Even
when students perform accurately on decontextualized activities, they often do not apply that
knowledge in their own writing. For example, a child who can add punctuation to a sentence
written by the teacher often incorrectly punctuates sentences in his or her original composi-
tion.

   One activity similar to rules-based instruction but that research does support as effective
is sentence combining (Myhill & Watson, 2013). In sentence combining, children merge two
or more short, choppy sentences into one longer, more effective sentence. For example, they
may be asked to combine Tim has a dog. The dog is tall and black into Tim has a tall, black
dog. Practice combining isolated sentences seems to positively impact students' original writ-
ing. Children who become proficient at combining sentences provided by the teacher tend
to write longer, more complex sentences in their own compositions. However, it is important
to recognize that most of the research on sentence combining has been conducted with high
school and university students. Some evidence exists (Saddler, Behforooz, & Asaro, 2008; Sad-
dler & Graham, 2005) that it also positively impacts older elementary students' writing, but
more research is needed to determine how effective sentence combining is for younger stu-
dents.

   While decontextualized rules-based instruction does not improve students' writing, there
is some evidence that teaching grammar within the context of writing is beneficial (Jones,
Myhill, & Bailey, 2013). A contextualized approach looks very different from traditional rules-
based instruction. In a traditional approach, children might learn about adjectives by under-
lining them in sentences printed on a worksheet. In a contextualized approach, they add
adjectives to their stories to describe the characters and the setting. The teacher might intro-
duce adjectives as "describing words" and ask the children to give some examples. She then
will show them how to use adjectives to create a vivid description of a story setting, and the
students will use adjectives to create settings in their own stories. Using adjectives in context,
rather than on a worksheet, provides a meaningful purpose for learning about them. In addi-
tion, because children apply their knowledge of adjectives directly to their writing, the quality
of their writing improves.

                      Process Writing Approaches

Like the name suggests, process writing instruction focuses on the process of composing
texts. In this approach, children learn to brainstorm ideas, write rough drafts, and revise
and edit those drafts. Process writing emerged in the 1970s, sparked by teachers' growing
rejection of a rules-based approach. At the same time, professional authors, such as the
Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Donald Murray (Murray, 1968), began to advocate a "work-
shop" approach to writing instruction that engaged students in the same writing process that
published authors used. Soon thereafter, researchers began to study writers as they com-
posed original texts (Emig, 1971; Hayes & Flower, 1980). The findings of this research provided
models of 1) what writers do as they compose and 2) the composing process that occurs in
writers' minds. Importantly, both this research and the instruction proposed by professional
authors such as Murray were based on the writing processes used by adult writers rather than
those used by children. However, despite this limitation, process writing became increasingly
prevalent in elementary schools.

78 | 6. Approaches to Writing Instruction in Elementary Classroom
   Because process writing began, in part, in response to criticisms of rules-based writing
instruction, it emphasizes what rules-based approaches did not. Rather than teaching rules
for creating sentences, it focuses on writing full texts and meaningful ideas, and it de-empha-
sizes spelling, punctuation, and grammar. Although educators and textbooks often talk about
the process approach to writing instruction, in reality it is many varied approaches that all
share a focus on the writing process. Consider the writing instruction in the following second
grade classrooms. Mr. Johnson assigns a writing topic to his class every Monday morning. One
Monday he asked them to write about this prompt: "If you could be any animal for one day,
what would you be? What would you do all day?" The students brainstormed ideas by creat-
ing a list of different animals and what each of those animals would do on a typical day. On
Tuesday, each child chose an animal and wrote a draft of his or her story. On Wednesday, Mr.
Johnson asked the children to revise by reading over their first drafts and instructing them
to add five more details. He showed them how to draw arrows to blank spaces on the paper
to add words or sentences. On Thursday, Mr. Johnson returned the children's stories for edit-
ing. Each child checked the spelling, capitalization, and punctuation in his or her draft and
made corrections. On Friday, the children copied their final drafts neatly onto clean paper
and turned them in to Mr. Johnson. He graded the stories over the weekend and returned the
papers on Monday.

   In the classroom next door, Ms. Turner began writing time on Monday by telling the chil-
dren they would be writing memoirs. Because the class had read and discussed many memoirs
in the previous two weeks, the children understood that they should write a personal story
about an interesting or important experience in their lives. They brainstormed ideas by listing
memories about fun things they had done, scary times they remembered, and moments they
felt very happy or very sad. Once the children made their lists, Ms. Turner asked them to tell
some of their stories to a partner. After 15 minutes of storytelling, she said, "Some of you told
a story that your partner liked very much. If you think others would enjoy hearing your story,
write it down so you can share it with the class." Some children began writing and others con-
tinued telling their stories to different friends in the class.

   On Tuesday, Ms. Turner encouraged the children to choose another memory from their list
and write about it. Some children wrote new stories, others read their drafts to a friend, and
some began revising. While the children worked, Ms. Turner talked to individual students,
reading their drafts and showing them how to make changes. She showed Marissa how to add
describing words and showed Paul how to write dialogue. She also taught a short "mini-les-
son" to the whole class about how to add details that would help readers visualize the story's
action. At the end of writing time, two or three children volunteered to read their stories
aloud to the class. The audience asked questions and offered suggestions for revising the sto-
ries.

   Writing time continued this way for ten days. Children wrote, revised, and shared their
work, and they received feedback from friends and from Ms. Turner. Some children wrote
and revised several stories, while some wrote only one or two. Each day Ms. Turner taught
a mini-lesson about how to write a good memoir and met with children for writing confer-
ences. After two weeks, she invited students to choose one story that they wanted to publish.
Using speech-to-text software, the children entered their stories into a word processing doc-
ument and began to edit. Ms. Turner taught them to use spellcheck, and they edited their own
and others' work. During writing conferences, she taught some to capitalize the beginning of
sentences and showed others how to use quotation marks. After editing was complete, Ms.
Turner printed the stories and bound them together into a class book. Each child read his or

                                                                    6. Approaches to Writing Instruction in Elementary Classroom | 79
her published story to the class, and the school librarian put the book in the library so other
students could read it.

   Down the hall, in Ms. Harrison's classroom, writing time on Monday began with the teacher
announcing, "It's time to write." The children enthusiastically scattered around the room,
grabbing pencils and notebooks. For the next 25 minutes, they wrote in their journals and
talked to one another. Ms. Harrison allowed them to choose their own topics and write any
type of text, but most children wrote stories about characters from their favorite movies and
television programs. Some wrote an entire story, others wrote a sentence or two, and a few
drew pictures without writing any words. Ms. Harrison sat at her desk while the children
worked and read anything that a child brought to her. "Great job!" she said to each one. Once
a month, she collected the children's journals and put a smiley face at the top of each page.

   Although each of these teachers used a "process writing" approach, many differences
existed in their instruction. In Mr. Johnson's room, the teacher assigned the writing topic,
and everyone moved through the writing process together: brainstorming on Monday, draft-
ing on Tuesday, revising on Wednesday, and editing on Thursday. Students wrote alone and
only the teacher read their work. In Ms. Turner's class, children chose their own topics,
moved through the process at their own pace, got feedback from peers and the teacher, and
shared their writing with classmates. They also received both individual and group instruc-
tion from the teacher. In Ms. Harrison's class, the students chose their own topics and moved
through the writing process at their own pace, but they received no direct instruction from
the teacher.

   People sometimes wonder why these different ways of teaching are all called "process writ-
ing instruction." This happens because teachers, and sometimes researchers, tend to label any
approach in which children draft, revise, and/or edit as "process writing." Research shows
that teachers who use process writing instruction implement it in different ways (Troia, Lin,
Cohen, & Monroe, 2011). As a result, the term "process writing" means many different things.

   Evaluating the benefits of process writing instruction is challenging for two reasons. First,
few high quality experimental studies2 have directly examined this approach (Pritchard &
Honeycutt, 2006). As a result, causal evidence about its effectiveness is limited. Second,
because teachers implement process writing differently, it is difficult to judge this approach
holistically. Consider the three classrooms described above. If a researcher set out to study
process writing, which of the classes would he or she include? The instruction in one class-
room might be much more effective than the instruction in the others, yet each is considered
to be "process writing." Perhaps a more important question than "Is process writing effec-
tive?" is the question, "What specific activities within process writing instruction lead to the
best learning outcomes for children? However, much more research is needed to answer this
question (McQuitty, 2014).

   Despite some of the difficulties of studying process writing, some general conclusions
about the effectiveness of this approach can be drawn from selected studies that have been
done. A meta-analysis3 of 29 individual studies indicates that process writing is moderately
effective at teaching children to write, though it is less effective with students who have writ-
ing disabilities than with students who are average or high achieving writers (Graham & Sand-
mel, 2011). The meta-analysis included only studies that occurred in classrooms with similar
types of process writing instruction. The instruction in each classroom had these features: 1)
extended opportunities for writing; 2) writing for real audiences and purposes; 3) emphasis on
the cyclical nature of writing, including planning, translating, and revising; 4) student owner-
ship of written compositions; 5) interactions around writing between peers as well as teacher
and students; 6) a supportive writing environment; and 7) students' self-reflection and eval-

80 | 6. Approaches to Writing Instruction in Elementary Classroom
uation of their writing and the writing process. So, we can conclude that process writing
instruction with these seven features is moderately effective for average and high achiev-
ing writers but only minimally effective for struggling writers. However, if teachers imple-
ment process writing instruction with other features, those approaches might be more or less
effective for these groups of children.

   While more research is needed about the specific features that make process writing
instruction effective, some educators have critiqued the approach. For example, Lisa Delpit
(2006) has argued that in some classrooms (like Mr. Johnson's and Ms. Harrison's), the focus
on process means there is no instruction about the writing product. This creates difficulties
for students who do not already know the characteristics of good writing. For instance, sto-
ries usually progress in chronological order, while informational reports are organized around
topics and subtopics. Children who have read many stories and informational books will know
these organizational structures, but those with few reading opportunities may not. Because
some students may not have access to as many books as their classmates, they may lack
knowledge of how stories and reports are organized. If their teacher only teaches the writing
process and ignores instruction about how the text should be organized, certain children will
be at a disadvantage.

   Process writing approaches are relatively popular in elementary classrooms and probably
offer some benefits. Writing, by its very nature, is a process, so teaching children how to
engage in that process makes sense; however, teachers must carefully consider the specific
practices they include in their process writing instruction. Research evidence does support
several particular practices that teachers should implement as part of a process approach
(Pritchard & Honeycutt, 2007). First, they must show students specific ways to improve their
writing. For example, they can demonstrate how to add details to a story and provide time
for children to add details to their own stories. This explicit instruction about how to create
a quality text helps students more than simply telling them to draft, revise, and edit. It also
answers Delpit's (2006) concern that some children will not know the features of good writing
or how to produce it.

   Second, children can benefit from interacting with peers during the writing process. They
can learn from one another and help each other improve their writing. However, students
do not automatically know how to help their peers, so teachers must show them how to
give meaningful feedback. One effective practice is to give children criteria for responding
to peers' writing (Pritchard & Honeycutt, 2007). Some teachers give students a protocol
that outlines how to engage in peer response (see Figure 1). When children receive specific
instruction about how to give feedback, they are better able to help one another.

                                                                     6. Approaches to Writing Instruction in Elementary Classroom | 81
Figure 1. How to engage in peer response (Pritchard & Honeycutt, 2007).

      Finally, there is some evidence that children should engage in the writing process flexibly
rather than rigidly (see McQuitty, 2014 for a review). Some children may need more time to
write their first drafts, while others may need more time for revision. Writing conferences,
in which teachers read over children's drafts with them and provide feedback, also allow for
flexibility. The teacher can provide individualized instruction in writing conferences, such as
showing one child how to organize a paragraph logically and showing another how write topic
sentences. Maintaining a flexible approach to process writing allows teachers to meet each
child's specific instructional needs.

                              Genre Approaches

Although process writing provided a much needed response to ineffective, decontextualized
language activities, the focus on process sometimes meant teachers ignored the quality of the
writing itself (Baines, Baines, Stanley, & Kunkel, 1999). In some classrooms, children drafted,
revised, edited, and shared their work, but their writing never improved. Particularly trou-
bling was the fact that some children--usually white, middle class English speakers--seemed
to excel in process writing classrooms while others--usually those from historically marginal-
ized groups--did not. This fact led genre theorists to critique process writing and offer genre
approaches as an alternative.

   Genre approaches to writing instruction focus on how to write different types of texts. The
notion of genre is grounded in the idea that writing is situational, so what counts as "good"
writing depends on the context, purpose, and audience. For example, texting a friend and
composing an essay are two very different writing situations. A "good" text message commu-

82 | 6. Approaches to Writing Instruction in Elementary Classroom
nicates ideas informally and efficiently, and background information is not needed because
the author and reader share common knowledge and experiences. A text which states, "Ok
meet you at 10" suffices. A good essay, however, has very different characteristics than a text
message. An essay author must use a formal tone, fully explain all ideas, provide examples,
and use complete sentences. Thus, the form of the writing is tied to the situation in which it
occurs.

   Teachers who use genre approaches teach about different writing situations and the forms
required in each one. Instruction usually begins with children reading and analyzing a genre
(Dean, 2008). In a unit about informational texts, the teacher will read many informational
books aloud to the class and ask the children to read informational books on their own or
in small groups. After reading, they discuss questions such as, "What's the purpose of infor-
mational texts? When do authors write them? When do readers read them? What do readers
expect when reading this genre? What are the features common to informational writing?"
Once children understand the purposes and features of the genre of informational books,
they would then begin to write their own.

   Genre approaches answer critiques of process writing by emphasizing the text and explic-
itly teaching the features of different text types. However, because teachers often integrate
genre instruction with process writing or strategy approaches (described below), it is difficult
to measure the effectiveness of genre instruction by itself. Research does show that children
need repeated exposure to a variety of genres (Donovan & Smolkin, 2006), so it seems plausi-
ble that genre instruction would benefit students. However, we currently have no confirma-
tion that genre instruction alone improves children's writing.

   Genre approaches may become more common in elementary schools because the Common
Core State Standards for English Language Arts & Literacy in History/Social Studies, Science,
and Technical Subjects (CCSS; National Governors Association Center for Best Practices &
Council of Chief State School Officers [NGA& CCSSO], 2010) for grades kindergarten through
five are organized around three types of texts children should learn: narrative, informational,
and persuasive. Therefore, the CCSS support a genre approach to teaching writing. As genre
instruction becomes more popular, though, there is concern that teachers will focus too
much on the forms and features of the different genres rather than how genres are situational
(Dean, 2008). For example, a teacher might only teach that persuasive texts must state an
opinion, give reasons for the opinion, and group the ideas logically (NGA & CCSSO, 2010).
While it is important children know these features, it is equally important that they under-
stand why people write persuasive texts, how the text features help authors create an effec-
tive argument, and how authors might need to vary the form of their argument to persuade
different audiences. Thus, while genre approaches hold potential as effective ways to teach
writing, it is currently unclear the best way to implement them. More research is needed
to provide further evidence about how teachers should use genre instruction in their class-
rooms.

                            Strategy Approaches

Strategy approaches to writing instruction teach children the planning, drafting, and revision
strategies used by skilled writers. These strategies are specific steps that guide students
through each part of the writing process. For example, children might learn the planning
strategy POW (Harris, Graham, & Mason, 2006): Pick my ideas (decide what to write about),
Organize my notes (organize ideas into a writing plan), and Write and say more (continue
to modify the plan while writing). The teacher would teach this strategy through a series of

                                                                    6. Approaches to Writing Instruction in Elementary Classroom | 83
steps: 1) develop the background knowledge students need to apply the strategy; 2) discuss
the strategy and how it will improve students' writing; 3) demonstrate the thinking processes
used while implementing the strategy; 4) provide support as students use the strategy, such
as working together with a partner; and 5) have students use the strategy independently.

   Strategy instruction typically incorporates elements of both process writing and genre
instruction. After learning the POW strategy, children learn other, genre-specific strategies
for planning and drafting. When learning about persuasive writing, they learn TREE: Tell what
you believe (state topic sentence), provide three or more Reasons (Why do I believe this?),
End it (wrap it up right), and Examine (Do I have all the parts?). This strategy teaches the
features of persuasive writing and guides students through planning, drafting, and evaluating
their texts. After completing their drafts, they might learn the SCAN revision strategy (Harris
& Graham, 1996): Scan each sentence. Does it make Sense? Is it Connected to your belief? Can
you Add more? Note errors. Using POW, TREE, and SCAN together guides students through
the process of writing a persuasive piece and directs them to include features of the persua-
sive genre.

   Strategy instruction is a structured, systematic, explicit approach to teach writing. Teach-
ers thoroughly explain the steps of the writing process and directly demonstrate both the
thinking and the actions required to implement each step. Children practice each strategy,
first with teacher and peer support and then on their own, until they have mastered it. Thus,
while strategy instruction teaches the writing process and genre features, it is more system-
atic, explicit, and mastery-oriented than either process writing or other genre approaches.
These features also seem to make it more effective. Numerous experimental studies have
shown strategy instruction to be more effective than other types of writing instruction (Gra-
ham, 2006). However, strategy instruction is easily broken down into steps, which means that
it is easier to research than other approaches. This may be one reason why more experimen-
tal studies about strategy instruction have accumulated compared to research on other ways
of teaching writing.

   Despite the strong evidence that strategy instruction helps children learn to write well,
it is not widely used in elementary classrooms. This reality may be because teachers view
it as formulaic or because it is more teacher-centered (rather than student-centered) than
other approaches. Of course, teachers who use strategy instruction implement it in different
ways. For instance, some teachers use IMSCI (Read, Landon-Hays, & Martin-Rivas, 2014), a
somewhat less directed method of teaching strategies. This approach begins with Inquiry in
which the teacher and children read various examples of a genre together and create a chart
of the genre's characteristics. This inquiry is more consistent with other genre approaches
than with models of strategy instruction in which the teacher directly describes and explains
the genre features. However, the next step of IMSCI, Model, involves explicit instruction. The
teacher directly demonstrates the thinking and actions required to plan, draft, and revise. The
final steps--Shared writing, Collaborative writing, and Independent writing--are also similar
to other strategy approaches in which students first work closely with peers and the teacher
before writing independently. However, IMSCI is less mastery-oriented and somewhat less
teacher-directed than other strategy instruction approaches.

   Because the level of explicitness and teacher direction can vary depending on how strategy
instruction is implemented, the question for teachers is, Just how direct and explicit must
strategy instruction be in order to be effective? Researchers currently have no clear answer to
this question. Studies do indicate that more explicit instruction particularly benefits strug-
gling writers (Graham, 2006), but some educators think that teacher-directed approaches
lead to shallower learning than approaches in which students take a more active role. Perhaps

84 | 6. Approaches to Writing Instruction in Elementary Classroom
the best advice for teachers is to integrate strategy instruction with less explicit process writ-
ing methods (Danoff, Harris, & Graham, 1993). Such integration might offer the benefits of
both explicit instruction and student-centered approaches to learning.

                    Multimodal Writing Approaches

Multimodal approaches to writing instruction acknowledge that people in the 21st century
write differently than in the past. In addition to composing traditional, linear, paper-based
texts, we also--perhaps more often--compose digitally. Writing digitally is not just a matter of
typing on the computer rather than writing on paper. Digital texts use many different modes
to communicate, and authors can develop proficiency in composing each one. Consider a typ-
ical webpage. In addition to written words, it may also contain photographs, artwork, audio,
video, and text boxes that allow readers to post their own ideas. Designing and coordinating
these various elements requires different skills than writing a words-only story.

   Digital writing also links texts differently than traditional writing. Many traditional stories
are linear; the author expects readers to proceed from the beginning to the end rather than
jump forward and backward through the pages. In contrast, think about how people read dig-
ital texts. A typical sequence might be: Read half of the home page, click on a video link, watch
half the video, click back to the home page, click on a hyperlink, read the first two sentences
of the new page, then click on another hyperlink to yet another page. The options for reading
a website are endless compared to the options for reading a bound book. As a result, authors
of digital texts that include hyperlinks create a set of pages that can be read in almost any
order.

   The word "design" (Cope & Kalantzis, 2009) is often used to describe digital composing
because many elements must be considered beyond the written words. Unlike traditional
books, there are many options for page size and orientation, font style and size, layout of ele-
ments on the page, use of white space, and modes of communication (music, video, pictures,
written words). The author of a digital text employs writing, graphic design, and possibly even
musical, movie making, and visual art skills to design the text. Furthermore, because digital
texts can be interactive, authors must also consider if and how they will provide opportunities
for readers to make comments, participate in polls or surveys, or otherwise add to the text.

   Although digital, multimodal writing is prevalent in our everyday lives, many elementary
students continue to compose traditional pencil-and-paper texts in school. This may occur
because the technology needed to write digital texts is too expensive or because the curricu-
lum focuses on traditional paper-based writing. Still, some teachers are providing opportu-
nities for children to combine traditional and digital writing. For example, Ms. Bogard's third
graders composed digital stories (Bogard & McMackin, 2012). They created graphic organizers
on paper that depicted the story events and used the organizers to tell their stories aloud and
audio record them. Then, with a partner, they listened to the recordings and received feed-
back and suggestions. Based on the feedback, each child created a storyboard on paper by
drawing the pictures that would appear in the story and the narration that would accompany
each image. They also planned how to create the images: take photographs, draw and scan
to the computer, create video clips, or create still images using software. Finally, they put all
of the elements together--images and audio recorded narration--and used software to create
their digital stories.

   While digital texts are the most likely types of multimodal writing, some teachers have
encouraged children to create multimodal texts that are paper-based. For example, while
writing memoir stories, children in a fourth grade class (Bomer, Zoch, David, & Ok, 2010) cre-

                                                                    6. Approaches to Writing Instruction in Elementary Classroom | 85
ated books that contained pop-ups, glued-in photographs, and objects such as ribbons and
stickers. Some students made their books interactive by concealing some of the content with
sticky notes and instructing readers to "lift here." Others attached notecards to the book so
readers could write back. All the children incorporated three-dimensional elements such as
handmade cardboard boxes filled with confetti, fold out maps, or a packet of sequentially
numbered cards that told part of the story. Thus, multimodal writing does not require digital
tools.

   Because schools have only recently begun to include digital and multimodal writing in their
curricula, only a few studies have examined this approach. Qualitative research, such as that
conducted in the classrooms described above, shows that elementary children are capable of
producing multimodal texts. However, because multimodal writing requires writers to cre-
ate and coordinate different media, teachers may need to provide a high level of support
to ensure children's success. For example, Ms. Bogard (described above) engaged her stu-
dents in two cycles of planning and revision for their digital stories. First, they created a
graphic organizer of the story events, told the story orally and listened to their recording of
it, and received feedback from peers. This allowed them to compose and revise the content,
which ensured that the story made sense, contained important details, and followed a logical
sequence. They then created storyboards that allowed them to plan every image and write
the words that would accompany each image. Each step of the process was needed to ensure
the children could coordinate the multiple visual and audio elements of their digital stories.
Simply asking children to write multimodally, without providing a process to support their
writing, would likely be unsuccessful.

                                    Summary

Many different approaches to writing instruction have been used in elementary classrooms.
Some approaches, such as short, structured handwriting lessons and strategy instruction,
have a strong research base to support them. Other approaches, like penmanship and rules-
based instruction are ineffective in improving children's writing skills. Many approaches,
including teaching grammar in context, process writing, teaching genre, and multimodal
writing, are promising practices that need more research to determine the best ways to
implement them. Teachers commonly do, and probably should, combine the best elements
of each approach in order to provide the most effective instruction for their students. They
must also seek out newly published research on writing instruction so they can continue to
make informed decisions about the best ways to teach.

Children's Literature and Its Use in the
Classroom

                                     Abstract

This chapter focuses on historical, social, and political influences on children's literature,
including contemporary influences related to digital and technological advances. One key
aspect of contemporary children's literature is the inclusion of multiple modes, or ways of
communicating. This chapter discusses how teachers can utilize multimodal children's liter-
ature by inviting students to engage in arts-based responses that draw from visual and per-
forming arts that are essential in teaching language arts skills and standards in elementary
classrooms.

   Learning Objectives

        After reading this chapter, readers will be able to

      1. think critically about children's literature, from the 17th century up to the digital age;
      2. analyze ways children's books are culturally produced and how they influence readers;
      3. explain the importance of incorporating literature and literature responses that allow for

           multiple ways of understanding and communicating, including through audio (sound and
           music), gesture and space (drama and dance), and visual messages (visual art);
      4. discuss and plan arts-based responses to children's literature.

                                  Introduction

This chapter explores historical, social, and political influences on children's literature,
including recent trends related to digital and technological influences, such as incorporating
multiple ways of communicating in response to multimedia messages prevalent in digital for-
mats. Children's literature offers insight into the cultural, social, and political history of the
place and time at which it was written. The beliefs, norms, and values of the specific histor-
ical time and place it was written are reflected in the content of the writing, the style, and
genre of the writing, and the audience or market for which the text was written. Placing chil-
dren's literature within these contexts allows readers to recognize and critique the cultural
messages carried within children's books and consider the potential effect of those messages
on readers. While differences in the children's literature from the past may be readily appar-
ent, contemporary books also reflect cultural, social, and political worlds of today, making it

90
equally important for educators to analyze the cultural messages contained within them as
well.

   After developing an understanding of contemporary children's literature, this chapter
focuses on how teachers can take full advantage of children's books in the classroom. In par-
ticular, children's literature incorporating multiple forms of communication, such as audio or
movement, can create broader opportunities for students to respond. These texts lend them-
selves especially well to arts-based responses, which use visual art, music, drama, or dance
activities to enhance understanding of texts. Giving students opportunities to read books that
communicate in multiple ways, and then giving students opportunities to respond to those
books using multiple ways of communicating, prepares them to communicate effectively in
an ever-changing world.

                     History of Children's Literature

There have been many changes related to the publishing of literature for children since the
beginning of the 17th century when the only books published for children were school books
to teach them the alphabet and spelling, as well as morals, manners, and religion. At that time,
the content of school books was influenced by Puritan beliefs that children were inclined
to evil and needed to be taught morals. However, during this time, cheaply published books
called chapbooks containing popular stories and tales also began to be produced and sold.
Since these books did not contain strictly moral stories, they were often criticized for depart-
ing from Puritan beliefs (Gangi, 2004). Puritanical thinking eventually gave way to the Enlight-
enment ideals characterized by the philosophy of John Locke, which marked a shift in the
view of children to that of a "blank slate" that could be written upon. During this time, moral
tales and fables were still published, but more light-hearted books featuring word play, rid-
dles, rhymes, and games began to appear in children's books as well. Children's books also
borrowed stories originally written for adults, such as Gulliver's Travels, Ivanhoe, and Robin-
son Crusoe.

   Before the 17th century, children were seen as small adults; however, during the Enlighten-
ment and Romantic periods, childhood was viewed as a time of innocence that was distinct
from adolescence (young adulthood) and adulthood (Avery & Kinnell, 1995). These changes in
viewpoints created a new market for the writing and publishing of books specifically for chil-
dren, who were seen as innocent and playful beings rather than mini-adults. During the 18th
century, John Newbery, a writer of children's books, greatly influenced children's literature by
starting the first publishing house dedicated to children's stories. He published his own sto-
ries, as well as the works of other children's book authors (Gangi, 2004). The idea of a pub-
lishing house just for children's stories reflected a shift in how society thought of children.
During the 19th century, greater numbers of books were written for children's play and enjoy-
ment, including the first picture book, which was written by Randolph Caldecott.1

   This early history of children's literature illustrates how societal changes influenced writers
and book publishers to create and produce books specifically for children. As a market for
children's literature had become firmly established in the 18th and 19th centuries, changes in
children's literature in the 20th century were related to the content of books. For example,
the period between World War I and World War II showed a proliferation of books depicting
idealism and a pioneering spirit, such as the showcasing of small town life in the Little House
on the Prairie series published between 1932 and 1943 by Laura Ingalls Wilder (1971). How-
ever, stories from this time period still included some serious and realistic writing, such as
the simplicity and down-to-earth style of Margaret Wise Brown's work for young children, or

                                                                                                                   7. Influence of the Digital Age | 91
the realities and hardships of life depicted in stories like Strawberry Girl by Lois Lenski (1945)
that shared the struggles of a poor, working farm girl (Hunt, 1995).2

   The emergence of more realistic stories preceded the onset of a major shift toward realism
that accompanied the social and political revolution of the 1960s and 1970s. Between the 1930s
and 1950s, writers became more willing to address topics related to societal issues and hard-
ships, such as struggles associated with poverty; however, in the 1960s and 1970s, a flood of
children's books emerged centering on realism. Authors such as Beverly Clearly, Judy Blume
and Paul Zindel wrote about growing up, death, obesity, and other issues, which marked a
shift in the boundaries of what was acceptable, and arguably, even necessary for children to
understand. These earlier authors paved the way for the writing of M. E. Kerr, Cynthia Voigt,
and Robert Cormier, who wrote about homelessness, race, and sexuality. The realism of chil-
dren's literature in the 1960s and 1970s represented a radical shift at that time, similar to many
of the other shifts throughout history related to historical, political, and societal influences.

                Recent Trends in Children's Literature

Recent decades have brought additional changes in the publishing of children's literature. The
market for children's literature has been influenced by demand from parents, children with
increased buying power, and a proliferation of serial writing to boost sales. In addition, there
have been changes in the content of children's books related to gender, diversity, and social
class (Ching, 2005; Englehardt, 1991; Gangi, 2004; Hunt, 1995; Larrick, 1965; Taxel, 1997; Zipes,
2001). While each of these areas is a worthwhile topic of study on its own, this chapter does
not focus on them beyond recognizing their influence overall.

   While the impact on children's literature due to cultural influences has been apparent
throughout the decades, current trends center mostly on digital and technological advances
in our society. Technological advances have exerted huge effects on printing and publishing
capabilities. Beyond printing capabilities, authors and illustrators are writing to maintain the
attention of children accustomed to the fast-paced sensory input of digital resources, such
as computer and video games, smartphones, and tablet apps. Publishing companies have
attempted to produce print texts that mimic or resemble digital texts in wording, style, type
of images, or format. Some print texts even borrow concepts about page design from digital
texts.

   Exposure to digital and technological resources and global access to information have
changed the boundaries, topics, and perspectives represented in books for children (Dresang,
1999, 2003). These changes in print texts include the use of non-linear plots that are orga-
nized not by a typical beginning, middle, and end, but tell the story out of order and/or lead
readers in multiple directions through the text (e.g., The End, by David LaRochelle, 2007).
Another change is the use of more interactive formats that invite readers to act or speak back
to the book (e.g., Press Here, by Herve Tullet, 2011). Changes also include shifts in the perspec-
tive from which stories are told, such as authors highlighting normally "unheard" voices by
sharing perspectives of groups or individuals not previously represented in children's litera-
ture or pushing boundaries by focusing on content or topics not previously represented.

   As Anstey and Bull (2006) explained, contemporary books are products of changing times
that require new understandings about text and are well suited for teaching and preparing
students to be multiliterate individuals. Multiliterate individuals are socially responsible,
informed citizens who are flexible and strategic as they engage in literacy practices with a
variety of text types in a diverse world (Anstey & Bull, 2006). Some of the new understandings
required by contemporary books include recognizing that texts represent messages through

92 | 7. Influence of the Digital Age
a variety of ways of communicating. Readers must not only understand written language but
must also learn to understand visual language and other signs and symbols.

   Technological resources have changed the way information is communicated, and teachers
must prepare students to understand information from all types of texts, including digital
texts. While this can be facilitated using digital technology, some schools, classrooms, or
homes have limited access to technology. Fortunately, many flexible literacy skills can be
developed through the use of print books that have the characteristics described above, such
as mimicking digital texts in style and formatting, changing organizational patterns, exploring
interactive formats, and representing messages in a variety of ways. The availability of print
books that can teach students necessary digital skills may narrow a gap that could be perpet-
uated by the disparity between environments rich with technology and those that are lacking
in technology.

   Changes in contemporary children's books are not only related to digital and technological
influences but also the influence of a cultural movement of the late 20th century known as
postmodernism. A useful working definition of postmodernism by Wertheim (n.d.) presented
below helps to highlight important cultural shifts during this period, including the importance
of one's own personal reality in interpreting the world.

       Postmodernism is largely a reaction to the assumed certainty of scientific, or objec-
       tive, efforts to explain reality. In essence, it stems from a recognition that reality is not
       simply mirrored in human understanding of it, but rather, is constructed as the mind
       tries to understand its own particular and personal reality. For this reason, postmod-
       ernism is highly skeptical of explanations which claim to be valid for all groups, cul-
       tures, traditions, or races, and instead focuses on the relative truths of each person. In
       the postmodern understanding, interpretation is everything; reality only comes into
       being through our interpretations of what the world means to us individually. (para. 1)

Postmodernism has resulted in changes in all areas of the arts, including architecture, visual
art, literature, and music. Children's literature scholars have highlighted important character-
istics of children's books connected to postmodernism (Anstey & Bull, 2006; Pantaleo, 2004;
Serafini, 2005). One of the most notable connections is when the illustrations in a picture
book tell a completely different story than the words or show a different perspective or view-
point. Postmodern influences are also seen in terms of how stories are told, including the por-
trayal of multiple versions of a story within the same book, telling the story through multiple
narrators and perspectives, telling stories within stories, or blending genres, such as mixing
fiction and nonfiction elements, or mixing science fiction and history. Authors also may refer
to another text within a story or rely on the reader's understanding of another specific text
for full comprehension. The visibility of the author and illustrator within the story is another
common postmodern feature, such as when authors refer to themselves within a text, speak
directly to readers, or when authors and illustrators share the processes used to create the
book within the text itself (Anstey & Bull, 2006; Pantaleo, 2004; Serafini, 2005).

   Noting the changes in children's literature related to digital and postmodern influences,
teachers are tasked with determining how and when texts should be used in today's class-
rooms. In recent studies, when teachers used texts with postmodern characteristics, it was
discovered that the students developed their ability to interpret visual images, their digital
literacy skills, and their ability to think critically (Pantaleo, 2004). Each of these skills is impor-
tant to prepare students for future encounters with both print and digital texts. Students may
be interested in digital texts and other varieties of text types, but they may not have a full

                                                                                                                   7. Influence of the Digital Age | 93
range of abilities to interpret all the messages contained in these texts. By including con-
temporary books in the curriculum, teachers can better prepare students for a wide range of
experiences in the world.

              Multimodal Texts in Children's Literature

It is easy to envision a classroom that relies on the use of a print textbook and resources
that primarily use printed words and visual images to represent meaning. However, print
resources are changing in ways that are reflective of the multiple ways, or modes, that are
used to communicate within digital contexts. Recall from Chapter 1 that modes of com-
munication encompass all forms of expression, including "Visual Meanings (images, page
layouts, screen formats); Audio Meanings (music, sound effects); Gestural Meanings (body
language, sensuality); Spatial Meanings (the meanings of environmental spaces, architectural
spaces); and Multimodal Meanings" (New London Group, 1996, p. 80). Though children's liter-
ature, especially picture books, rely mainly on print and visual modes (i.e., words combined
with pictures), there are growing numbers of children's books that creatively incorporate
audio, gestural, and spatial modes as well. Multimodal texts are capable of drawing on stu-
dents' strengths and preparing them for a multimodal society where individuals communicate
through audio, gestural, visual, spatial, and print resources, as well as various combinations of
these modes.

   Each mode has its own capacity to communicate, or potential to make meaning, which is
called an affordance (Kress & Jewitt, 2003; Kress & Van Leeuwen, 2001). Basically, this means
that each mode communicates the same idea in a different way than any other mode. For
example, an individual may communicate a story about a cat by telling the story in words,
moving around the room, using sounds, or acting out the story with no words or sounds.
Each version might communicate a particular part of the story especially well, while another
part may not be communicated as well using that mode. The idea that modes have different
affordances, or potential to make meaning, suggests that some modes of communication are
better suited for some tasks than others. When modes are integrated, their combination also
contributes to an overall meaning that could not be achieved by the use of any one mode on
its own. Even within a mode, the materials used or the format of the communicated mes-
sage can contribute differently to the understanding of the message. For example, a written
message carries different meaning if it is written in sand versus carved in stone (Kress & Van
Leeuwen, 2001).

   The meaning-making potential of a mode also depends on how a society or group of indi-
viduals values that particular mode or how that mode is used within that society in different
situations and contexts (Kress & Jewitt, 2003). As individuals understand the potential use-
fulness of a mode of communication within the context of their culture, they can choose the
modes that most appropriately express their message. Thinking back to the example of the
cat story, not only does a particular mode communicate the story differently, the choice of
a mode may be appropriate in some circumstances but not in others. For example, it would
be more appropriate for a small child to act out the story while moving around the room and
meowing than a college professor teaching an English class!

   Discussions such as this related to how humans communicate and value various modes is
grounded in a larger field known as social semiotics. Social semiotics essentially explains how
humans make sense of the world and communicate with each other through all ways that are
socially meaningful, such as by drawing, creating visuals, talking, making gestures, engaging
in dance and movement, creating architecture, and singing and making music (Lemke, 1990).

94 | 7. Influence of the Digital Age
Additionally, as societies or cultural groups adapt over time, they place different value on var-
ious modes people use to make meaning. Schools are important in shaping the value placed
on different modes in a society; their overemphasis on reading and written language systems
marginalizes other valuable forms of expression and, likewise, students who have talents and
abilities in these other forms (Eisner, 1991). Eisner explained that being able to understand
messages communicated through multiple modes is central to three important educational
aims, including increasing the variety and depth of meaning people make in their lives, devel-
oping cognitive potential, and providing educational equity in our schools.

   When teachers and students begin to understand the potential of each mode, more options
become available to understand and create meaning. Students make choices on a daily basis
as far as the mode used to communicate, as well as the medium or format of a message. For
example, students choose a medium when they decide to send an email or a text message,
share a tweet, a picture, or a song, or create a video. The medium chosen often dictates the
format of the message--a text might use shorthand or emoticons while an email would use full
words. If they understand the potential of each of the modes, they can make choices to create
and understand messages more fully. Authors and publishers of children's literature are also
aware of these choices, and the literature they produce is certainly influenced by the knowl-
edge that students' communication preferences are both flexible and dynamic.

   Teachers can facilitate learning in the classroom that allows all of the above to be possible,
such as students having knowledge of modes to make the best choices to express their mes-
sages, students with talents and abilities in areas beyond print and linguistic forms to have a
valued mode to express themselves in the classroom, and students having the ability to fully
understand the messages that are communicated through various modes and their combi-
nations throughout society. An understanding of how modes work together in texts is thus
necessary for those preparing to enter the teaching profession. Children's book authors and
illustrators are able to offer more multimodal experiences for readers that extend beyond
the combination of print and visual modes to include audio, gestural, and spatial modes. As
multimodal texts are viewed, readers make meaning by experiencing integrated and cohe-
sive texts that draw on the potential of multiple modes of meaning. Teachers must therefore
understand how modes work together within texts in order to prepare students to under-
stand and make meaning with a wider variety of texts and communicate through a wider vari-
ety of modes.

             Audio Mode in Children's Literature Texts

Print and visual modes are obvious aspects of children's literature texts and areas that teach-
ers and students have traditionally spent time studying; however, children's literature is
beginning to utilize other modes of meaning, as well, such as audio, gesture, and spatial
modes. In order to understand how these less "obvious" modes work in children's literature
texts, a closer look at the audio mode is presented as an example. The audio mode, which
includes both sound and music, is present in many aspects of daily life, including use in film
and television, as well as content accessed on iPods, tablets, smartphones, and at popular
websites, such as YouTube. This proliferation of sound and music in daily life heightens the
importance of teaching students how to use the audio mode to understand and communicate
messages.

   There are different ways in which picture books might invite the possibility of the reader
to make meaning using the audio mode. For the purposes of this discussion, the audio mode
is not referring to books that talk about music or sound, as these do not necessarily make

                                                                                                                   7. Influence of the Digital Age | 95
meaning using the audio mode. Nor is it referring to audio books (e.g. a CD or audio file in
which someone is reading the book out loud) which consist of spoken text or words that are
primarily a linguistic meaning. Rather, this discussion focuses on the ways that books can rep-
resent meaning through the audio mode using visual and linguistic information, or using other
symbolic representations that allow for the possibility of the reader to use the audio mode
to make meaning and comprehend the message. For example, if, based on the information
represented in a piece of text, a reader makes a sound or sings a song to make meaning of
that information, the audio mode is being used to communicate. Kress (2000) explained that
to determine which mode is being used to communicate a message, one can think about the
sense that is used to make meaning of represented information. Figure 1 provides an example
of how a linguistic (print) message, a visual message, and an audio message might appear in a
children's book.

                      Figure 1. Representation of how the linguistic, visual, and audio modes
                      convey a similar idea in three distinct ways.

      Children's picture books represent audio meaning in different ways. The following exam-
ples show how particular authors have not only represented audio meanings but also how
picture books can invite communication through multiple modes, even when seemingly only
linguistic and visual modes are presented. This same approach can then be used when inter-
preting any piece of children's literature to understand if readers are invited to make mean-
ing though multiple modes of representation. One way authors may include audio meanings
is by incorporating song lyrics into the story. The song lyrics can be read as a strictly print
text; however, if the words are sung as the book is read, this is an example of an audio rep-
resentation. Other texts incorporate sound words, also known as onomatopoeia (e.g., pow),
into texts, with their meaning dependent on the print text surrounding the sound word. In
Max Found Two Sticks by Brian Pinkney (1994), the sounds Max hears and plays are repre-
sented through sound words within the text. For example, "Max responded by patting the
bucket, Tap-tap-tap. Tippy-tip...tat-tat. He created the rhythm of the light rain falling against
the front windows" (Pinkney, 1994). The sound words are integrated within the text and add a
layer of meaning to the story that would not be present if these sound words were absent.

   In other texts, sound words extend the meaning of the text beyond what the print text
accomplishes on its own, such as in This Jazz Man by Karen Erhardt (2006) and What Charlie
Heard by Mordicai Gerstein (2002). In What Charlie Heard, sound words are used as an inte-
gral aspect of the illustrations to show the myriad sounds that Charlie hears. In this story,
sound words are written in different fonts and sizes as part of the illustrations showing the

96 | 7. Influence of the Digital Age
sound made by each object, animal, or person represented in the illustration. The sound
words in this text become part of the illustration and represent the sounds themselves.

   Other children's picture books use the audio mode by including musical notation. For exam-
ple, The Wolf Who Loved Music, by Christopher Gallaz and Marshall Arisman (2003), adds a
staff (i.e., the set of five lines on which musical notes are printed) starting on the second page
of the text as a light gray heading. On each successive page, additional musical symbols and
then notes are added to this staff. The printed music, if decoded, plays the main theme to
Sergei Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf. Using the musical text along with the printed text pro-
vides an additional way to make meaning, offering information which is not included in any
other way in the print or visual information of the text.

   Some texts use a more abstract notation rather than real musical notation. An example of
abstract notation appears in Mysterious Thelonius by Chris Raschka (1997). This book repre-
sents the notes of a song through the placement of words on the page. On the book jacket, a
color scale shows that each color represents a different note in the musical scale. Through-
out the text, the words are written in different colors and heights related to that scale, thus
effectively creating a melody through the placement of the words on the page.

   Another way picture books can represent the audio mode is by including an external audio
CD or a link to an audio file. In The Yellow Umbrella by Jae Soo Liu (2002), the music for this
text was composed solely for the purpose of accompanying the illustrations. The music can
be listened to in two different ways. There is a one-track short version that has about 20 to 30
seconds of music for each page. There is also a long version which provides 1 to 2 minutes of
music for each page, each on a different track. Without the music, a reader might only pause
for a moment on the page to consider the small amount of action they see. With the musical
accompaniment, the mood and spirit of each page changes. In a wordless picture book, the
reader typically uses their own words to form a story related to what is happening in the pic-
tures. The music adds more meaning than the pictures can convey alone to help the reader
construct this story. All of the above examples demonstrate some of the ways authors and
publishers work together to communicate a wider range of messages, using not just print and
visual modes but the audio mode as well.

 Connecting Learning Standards to Arts-Based Responses
                                  to Literature

Children's literature can be used by teachers as instructional materials to meet a variety
of educational goals and objectives. Using children's literature that includes multiple modes
of communication offers more opportunities to invite students to respond using arts-based
forms, such as visual art, drama, music, and dance. Students may be more encouraged to
respond to literature if teachers use more familiar terms, such as music, art or drawing, act-
ing or drama, and dance or movement rather than discussing modes, like gestural, spatial,
or audio, as terms. Arts-based responses allow students to use all their senses as they make
meaning. As an example, an arts-based response might be one in which students act out what
they think might happen in a story, create a rhythmic pattern or tune to symbolize each char-
acter in a book, or move the same way as they believe characters felt or acted in given sit-
uations to help analyze a character's emotions and motivations. Multimodal books are not
required tools for arts-based responses in that teachers can encourage or create arts-based
response activities for any book, but when a text already utilizes audio, gesture, movement,
or space in creative ways, it can offer students a model and set the stage for engaging in arts-
based responses.

                                                                                                                   7. Influence of the Digital Age | 97
   An argument can be made that incorporating arts-based responses is especially important
for students who excel in other modes of communicating besides reading and writing. Never-
theless, in many of my discussions of arts-based responses with teachers, it often is revealed
that they believe arts-based responses are fun extension activities but they may be pushed to
the periphery in light of the increasing pressure of standards and testing. Yet, incorporating
arts-based responses can help teach skills necessitated by the standards. To help ensure that
teaching and learning are directed toward a meaningful outcome, teachers have purposes
for using any strategy, practice, or lesson they teach, including the practice of incorporating
arts-based responses. Teachers' purposes are aligned with their state's standards for student
learning, including the Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts & Literacy in
History/Social Studies, Science, and Technical Subjects (CCSS; National Governors Association
& Council of Chief State School Officers [NGA & CCSSO], 2010), which have been adopted by
most states across the United States.

   I asked pre-service and practicing teachers about their purposes for having students
respond to literature. Table 1 shows a list generated from their responses, including helping
students comprehend or interpret a text, connect to characters or events, and consider new
events or situations. The right column of Table 1 shows how these purposes aligned with stan-
dards, such as CCSS Reading Standards for Literature K-5, CCSS Speaking and Listening Stan-
dards and NYS P-12 Common Core Learning Standards (NYSED, 2011).3 This alignment shows
that asking students to respond to literature in the classroom can help teachers and students
accomplish important learning goals.

      Earlier in the chapter, purposes for asking students to respond to multimodal texts were
established. These included giving students opportunities to make meaning of texts that draw
on multiple modes of meaning and to understand the potential of each mode of communica-
tion in order to make choices that allow them to create and understand messages more fully.
These two purposes align with the CCSS Reading Literature standard, Integration of Knowl-
edge and Ideas regarding how illustrations, words, and, in later grades, multimedia elements
in print, digital, and multimedia texts contribute to the overall effect of the text.

   Siegel (2006) explained how translating information from one mode of communication into
a different mode, called transmediation, generates new understandings of the information.
Since each mode has a different potential to communicate, transmediation furthers students'
meaning making because it requires them to think about content in different ways and is a
clear benefit of arts-based responses. In addition, when teachers generated their lists of the
purposes for responding to literature, there were a small number they listed that did not
match with the standards, including promoting creativity, allowing students to think out of
the box and explore their own thinking, fostering empathy, and giving students a chance to
be actively engaged and gain ownership of learning. These purposes for literature response
were important to teachers with respect to maintaining a positive and productive learning
environment. Arts-based responses offer rich opportunities to fulfill many purposes such as
those included in Table 1, while enhancing understanding of literature and creating lifelong
learners.

   The design of arts-based responses goes beyond thinking of a final product such as a cute
craft to send home, to instead, thinking about the activity as part of a process that will allow
students to engage with the content and literature. Because arts-based responses to chil-
dren's literature are central to achieving teachers' purposes and align with state standards,
the final section of this chapter will feature well-designed arts-based activities that can help
students transmediate between modes and think about making meaning in new ways.

Examples of Arts-Based Responses

The visual and performing arts responses to children's literature featured in this section are
offered as suggestions and to inspire new ideas. Each book and each class offer unique oppor-
tunities to create and innovate. As you consider the use of arts-based responses in your
own classroom, envision each suggestion taking place with students and teachers explor-
ing and experiencing the text and the activity together. Students are not professional actors,
musicians, artists, or dancers, and yet they are fully capable of visual and performing arts
responses. Likewise, teachers do not need to be professional artists or dancers either to
effectively use arts-based responses with students. As pointed out by Berghoff (1998), these
responses are not about teaching the disciplines of art or music in the language arts class-
room but allowing learners to use their knowledge from these disciplines to learn in the lan-
guage arts classroom. These ways of thinking and expression are familiar to young children,
she explains. "From early childhood on, children make sense of the world through dramatic
play, drawing, dancing, singing and other communicative forms" (p. 521). Teachers can foster
an environment where these ways of thinking continue to be valued as students explore the
world in ways that are familiar. Each example in the following section also includes a link to
the standard(s) that the activity addresses as a reminder that offering arts-based responses
accomplishes important curricular goals.

      Music

Music responses explore how all elements of music and audio, including individual sounds,
pitch (high or low), dynamics (loud and soft), rhythm, and tempo (speed) communicate with
listeners.

            Sound translation

The text of This Jazz Man by Karen Erhardt (2006) follows the familiar tune of "This Old Man,"
but the verse on each page introduces a different jazz performer. As part of the verse, there
is a string of sound words that helps readers hear the sound of the instrument performed by
that jazz player. There is also an extended sound word phrase incorporated into the illustra-
tion. For this lesson, read through the book as a class read aloud. Then reread the book and
invite students to sing along with the reading using the tune to "This Old Man." Finally, use
materials available in the classroom to translate the string of sound words back into sound
(hands and feet, pencils, water bottles, books, etc.). Encourage students to be creative as they
find materials to make the sound. Once a sound has been chosen for each song verse, reread
and sing the song one more time. Instead of speaking the sound words, replace them with the
chosen sound to translate the sound words to actual sounds (Robertson, 2008). CCSS.ELA-
LITERACY.RL.K.4-5.4

            Hear your life

What Charlie Heard by Mordicai Gerstein (2002) is a picture book biography of the life of
composer Charles Ives, who is known as a composer whose music was often misunderstood
or regarded as difficult to listen to (recall that this book was discussed previously in refer-
ence to audio modes). Charles Ives heard all the sounds in his life as music, and his compo-
sitions are meant to portray this, however dissonant or cacophonous (i.e., disagreeable; not
harmonious) his compositions ended up being. For example, one of his more famous pieces
is a representation of two different marching bands playing two different pieces in different
keys, marching from opposite directions, crossing in front of the listener, and then moving

100 | 7. Influence of the Digital Age
away. In this picture book biography, sound words are used as part of the illustrations in dif-
ferent colors and fonts next to the object, person, or animal from which the sound originates.
The pages are full of sounds and colors, showing the sounds that permeated Charles Ives' life.
First, share the book with students, guiding them as they interpret the messages communi-
cated through multiple modes. Then, invite students to write and illustrate a scene from their
life using the same style. Figure 2 shows how a class of students represented sounds in an
illustration drawn from a personal memoir writing piece they were working on. In this class-
room, when the teacher then asked students to go back and revise their memoir, the explo-
ration into the sound and visual representation of their story allowed them to add much more
robust sensory detail into their revisions (Robertson, 2008). CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.K.7-5.7;
CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.W.K.3-5.3

Figure 2. Student example of the illustration style in What Charlie Heard by Mordicai Gerstein.

      Drama
Drama responses allow students to explore how elements such as body language, posture,
gesture, voice, and inflection contribute to expressing and understanding meaning.

            Color and emotions
The following activity allows students to explore the relationship between color and emotions
and involves two children's literature books: My Many Colored Days by Dr. Seuss (1996), and
The Way I Feel by Janan Cain (2000). Both of these books relate emotions and moods to dif-
ferent colors. Start the lesson by reading each of the books in a large group format. For the
remainder of the lesson, ask students to work within small groups. Provide each group with
plenty of different colored pieces of paper. To start, ask one person in the group to act out an
emotion for the other members, charade style. Other members of the group will then choose
a piece of paper in a color they think represents the acted-out emotion. The group mem-
bers will then share the emotion they believed was being acted out, as well as why they chose
that particular color to represent it, and the actor can share if the group members guessed
the emotion they were portraying. Repeat the steps in this activity so that each person in

                                                                                                                  7. Influence of the Digital Age | 101
the group has an opportunity to act out an emotion or mood. Younger children still explor-
ing ways to name their emotions can use this activity to further develop their understanding
of emotions. Older children working on incorporating more descriptive words and explaining
and portraying emotions in their writing can use this activity to add further dimensions to
how they and others think about emotions and moods. This activity can be especially enlight-
ening, since students may realize that though they think they are showing one emotion, oth-
ers may perceive it differently. CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.K.7-5.7

            Sound and action story

The following activity invites students to think about the attributes of specific characters in a
text. The idea was adapted from a suggestion by Gelineau (2012) to create "original sound sto-
ries" by determining sounds to match well-defined characters (p. 67). The following activity
extends that idea by asking students to create a sound as well as an action for each character
in a book. While this activity could be applied to many different texts, The boy who cried ninja
by Alex Latimer (2011) is offered as a suggestion to learn how the process works. The book has
a wide variety of diverse characters, including a Mom, Dad, Grampa, ninja, astronaut, giant
squid, pirate, crocodile and monkey. First, read the book, The boy who cried ninja, aloud. Then,
break the class into small groups and have the students decide on a sound and an accompany-
ing action for each character. Each group will then practice reading through the book: every
time a character is mentioned (or shown in a picture) they perform the action and make the
sound for that character. After each group practices, they will perform their action and sound
stories for the class while the teacher reads the story aloud. The process of selecting a sound
and action that matches a character will deepen discussion of the characters, and performing
the story for the class will extend that discussion to the larger group. For older students, this
is a good book to introduce this activity, but then the process can be applied to books where
the characters have more development. CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.5.7

      Dance and movement

Dance and movement responses explore how both dance or body movement can express
messages and communicate with others.

            Walk like a/an...

Every time students need to move around the room, make the most of these transitions by
turning them into a response activity focusing on dance and movement. For example, as stu-
dents move to get in line or to shift activities in the room, connect to a character in a class
read-aloud by asking students to move as if they are feeling one or more of the emotions that
character had experienced. This will help students identify with and understand the actions
of the characters. CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.K.3-5.3

            Find your style (dance and music response)

Often in children's literature, common themes or storylines are repeated. Start this lesson by
creating a story map (WETA Public Broadcasting, 2015)--a graphic organizer that outlines the
elements of story, such as setting, characters, plots and events, problems and solutions--for
the following three stories: 1) The Twelve Dancing Princesses, a classic fairy tale with many
adaptations (though the illustrations in Marianna Mayer's [1989] and Ruth Sanderson's [1990]
versions are particularly beautiful), 2) The Barn Dance by Bill Martin Jr. and John Archambault
(1986), and 3) Brothers of the Knight by Debbie Allen (2001). Each book follows a similar story

102 | 7. Influence of the Digital Age
line but has its own style, tone, and setting. Ask students to explore the illustrations, the lan-
guage use, and the design of the books as they compare and contrast the three stories. Add a
further dimension to the stories by pairing them with musical samples representing the three
styles displayed in the books (a classical piece, such as Bach's "Minuet in G"; an American folk
song, such as "Turkey in the Straw"; and a current, popular, hip hop selection.) With music
selected, let students dance to the styles in the books. Discuss or find examples of costumes,
props, or musical instruments to explore the elements of tone, style and setting in each story.
The decision making process as students choose the music, instruments, or dance moves
that connect with the different styles represented in the books actively engages students in
the process of transmediation, described earlier as a process of translating information from
one mode to another and thus creating new understandings. CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.K.3-5.3;
CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.K.7-5.7

      Visual art

Visual arts responses explore how color, lines, shapes, drawing, painting, and all other ele-
ments of art communicate messages to the viewer.

            Make a match

Illustrators are artists, and their work is based on traditions and styles in art. Share illustra-
tions from a children's picture book and compare them to a matching art style. For example,
pair the illustrations in Marianna Mayer's (1989) Twelve Dancing Princesses with Jean-Honore'
Fragonard's The Swing (students may also be very excited to recognize this particular painting
from Disney's Frozen). Compare Picasso's cubism artwork with the illustrations in D. B. John-
son's (2002) Henry Builds a Cabin or the work of children's book author David Wiesner with
surrealism works of Salvador Dali or Vladimir Kush. Extend the activity by asking students go
on an "art hunt" and make matches between picture book illustrations and pieces of artwork.
For a challenge, ask students to create their own illustrations. Though some of the styles may
seem detailed and difficult for children to replicate, they may still choose one of the harder
styles to explore the process. Or suggest they work with an easier style, such as naïve artwork,
characterized by a childlike nature and represented in picture books such as The Bookshop
Dog by Cynthia Rylant (1996) or Joseph Had a Little Overcoat by Simms Taback (1999). Students
can create illustrations to go with a story they are writing or related to an event in their life.
After matching art and illustrations or illustrating using a certain style, have a discussion with
students about why a style might be used with a certain book. Did the style help tell the story
or set the mood? When they used the style themselves, how did it affect the overall message
they were communicating? CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.3.7

            Pinhole view

Illustrators are becoming much more innovative in the creation of wordless picture books.
The wordless picture book Flashlight by Lizi Boyd (2014) offers many opportunities for discov-
ery. The illustrations show the character exiting a tent in the woods at night. Most of the page
is black with grey line drawings to show the dim background. The character is holding a flash-
light and there is a bright spot of the illustration on each page in the path of the flashlight.
Small holes are cut out of each page giving a glimpse of what is to come or perhaps some-
thing missed on the page before, further drawing visual attention to details in the book. Since
exploring dark spaces may not be conducive to a classroom or school environment, teachers
can extend the reading of this book by using the idea of the cut outs. Have students view the

                                                                                                                 7. Influence of the Digital Age | 103
classroom, other areas in the school, or outdoor areas of the school grounds through a hole
cut in a piece of paper. Have them sketch the new things to which this pinhole view of the
world drew their attention. What do they see differently with different shaped holes? Do they
see things they did not notice without the pinhole view? This artistic response helps students
understand the effect and theme of the book and also helps give them a different perspective

                                    Summary

This chapter began by establishing the historical, social, and political influences on children's
literature beginning in the 17th century and leading to contemporary influences, including
digital and technological advances, postmodernism, and the prevalence of multiple modes
of communicating. The discussion then turned to how teachers can utilize multimodal texts
in classrooms to teach the skills outlined in state standards and aligned with teachers' pur-
poses. Arts-based responses using traditional and multimodal texts were described as a way
for teachers to support all students to fulfill purposes for responding to literature, includ-
ing those that may not have direct correlations to the standards but are still necessary for
establishing a positive classroom learning environment. Examples of drama, music, dance
and movement, and visual arts response activities were presented to specifically show how
contemporary literature, including multimodal literature, can be used in classroom settings.
Teachers are encouraged to explore multimodal children's literature and design meaningful
arts-based response activities that will enhance the learning of every child in their classroom.

   Questions and Activities

      1. Find a book (maybe one you read as a child) that represents the time or place in history in
           which it was written. Find a contemporary book which represents the current time and
           place in history. Imagine you are looking at either book as an outsider to that time and
           place. What social, cultural, or political messages, either purposeful or inadvertent, are
           reflected in that piece of literature?

      2. Browse the children's books at the local library and critically analyze the messages to find
           books that represent a new perspective or voice that is not usually heard, such as a story
           told from the perspective of a character from a diverse population or a unique representa-
           tion of gender roles. What social, cultural, or political messages are reflected in that piece
           of literature?

      3. With a partner or in a small group, communicate something about a particular topic using
           only gestures or movement, then using only sounds (not words), then only pictures, and
           then only words. Then try to communicate using a combination of these modes. Ask your
           audience to share their interpretations of each message.

      4. Make a list of ways you communicate daily using different modes when you experience
           events such as hearing a siren, seeing traffic lights, seeing a friend, communicating with
           someone, and listening to Pandora. Based on this list, what are other modes that could be
           used to communicate in these events? Which seem most effective for you? Do you think
           that others would use all the same modes? Explain your thinking to others.

104 | 7. Influence of the Digital Age
      5. As proposed by this chapter, consider the variety of ways that authors may invite multi-
           modal interpretations and locate a children's book that communicates using audio, gesture,
           or space in addition to print and visual modes. How might you use these books with stu-
           dents who have difficulty communicating through reading and writing?

      6. Select texts and create arts-based response activities in each area (drama, music, dance,
           and visual art) designed to enhance understanding of the texts. Share your idea with two
           other classmates and determine the state standards that connect to the arts-based
           response activities each person designed.

Develop Literacy Skills and Succeed
Academically

                                                     Tess M. Dussling

                                     Abstract

The aim of this chapter is to provide educators with background knowledge on English lan-
guage learners and information on how to better assist culturally and linguistically diverse
students to develop the literacy skills crucial for academic success. Differences in social and
academic language will be addressed, at6s well as theories of language acquisition and lan-
guage learning. Recommendations to educators will be offered to better assist students as
they become proficient in the English language while being exposed to new content in the
classroom. The chapter also will draw upon the importance of including students' previous
experiences, along with embracing students' cultural and linguistic diversity.

   Learning Objectives

        After reading this chapter, readers will be able to

      1. discuss how English language learners' prior experiences influence how they learn;
      2. explain different types of programs available for English language learners in schools;
      3. describe the difference between social language proficiency and academic language profi-

           ciency;
      4. explain the developmental stages of learning a new language;
      5. offer suggestions for helping English language learners succeed academically.

                                  Introduction

Today's classrooms in the United States are filled with children who speak a variety of native
languages and who bring great diversity, culture, and previous experiences with them. As
schools become increasingly diverse, there is an urgent need to prepare all teachers to meet
the challenge of teaching both content and English language skills to students. English lan-
guage learners are the fastest growing population of students in the United States (Calderón,
Slavin, & Sanchez, 2011), raising many concerns over how educators can best meet the needs
of this diverse group of learners. School-aged children considered to be English language
learners (ELLs) rose from 3.54 million in 1998-1999 to 5.3 million in 2008-2009 (National
Clearinghouse for English Language Acquisition, 2011), and it is estimated that one in five stu-
dents has a home language other than English (Gonzalez, Yawkey, & Minaya-Rowe, 2006). As

108
the number of ELLs increases in schools across the country, educators face the challenge of
providing instruction in English to students who are learning English while combatting aca-
demic achievement gaps. While the research cited and strategies discussed in this chapter
are presented in the context of teaching English language learners in schools in the United
States, educators in other countries can also apply what is reviewed when teaching English as
a new language abroad.

                Who are English Language Learners?

The definition of an English language learner is not a simple one as some students may have
relatively no knowledge of the English language when entering the classroom while others
have mastered many English skills and are now focusing on more difficult academic content.
Terms used to describe English language learners do tend to cause some confusion as terms
may overlap and change over time. In order to alleviate any confusion, some common terms
and acronyms will be briefly explained for a better understanding throughout the rest of the
chapter.

   English language learner (ELL) is a term used for a person learning English in addition to
their native language. It is important to keep in mind that English language learners are stu-
dents learning English while learning in English. Throughout the chapter the term English
language learner will be used as a way of emphasizing that the students are learning and pro-
gressing in a new language. This term is often preferred over others, as it highlights the learn-
ing aspect of acquiring a new language instead of suggesting that students with other native
languages are in some way deficient.

   Some schools still use the term English as a second language (ESL), but that term may not
be accurate for students who already have knowledge of more than one language. Often, ESL
refers to the instructional support English language learners receive while in school. You may
hear teachers or students refer to ESL class or ESL time during the school day. Certified ESL
teachers may be "push-in" teachers, meaning they come into general education classrooms
to assist English language learners, or they may pull English language learners out of class for
more intensive English language instruction.

   English as a new language (ENL) is a term gaining popularity over ESL in some schools and
teacher certification programs and is also the term used by the National Board for Profes-
sional Teaching Standards (2010). Similarly, as a way of highlighting that many English lan-
guage learners may have competency of more than two languages, the state of New York
has changed Common Core Learning Standard terminology from English as a Second Lan-
guage Learning Standards to New Language Arts Progressions (EngageNY, 2014). Other com-
mon terms seen in schools include English for speakers of other languages (ESOL), English
as a foreign language (EFL), and English as another language (EAL). Limited English proficient
(LEP) is the term used in legislation and state or federal documents to refer to students who
lack sufficient mastery of the English language; however, it has been suggested by teachers
and researchers that this term has a negative connotation and views the child as "limited,"
when in fact, the child is actually acquiring new language skills. A subpopulation of English
language learners who have experienced little or no formal schooling are referred to as stu-
dents with interrupted formal education (SIFE) or students with limited or interrupted for-
mal education (SLIFE). This group of ELLs has missed educational experiences in their home
country due to a number of factors including the unavailability of school, war, or migration.
It is quite possible that students with limited or interrupted education may not have a strong
grasp of literacy in their native language and face a triple threat when entering schools in the

                                                                     8. Helping English Language Learners Develop Literacy Skills | 109
United States: developing proficiency in the English language, learning grade-level subject
matters, and developing and/or improving literacy skills (DeCapua, Smathers, & Tang, 2007).
It should be noted that it is often much easier for a student to learn to read in English when
they are already literate in their primary language (e.g., August & Shanahan, 2006; Rolstad,
Mahoney, & Glass, 2005; Slavin & Cheung, 2005). Some researchers believe this is because
students who are learning to read for the first time in a new language have to do twice the
work since they are learning the process of reading while learning a new language (Short &
Fitzsimmons, 2007). In a large review of scientific research on English language learners in the
United States, Genesee, Lindholm-Leary, Saunders, and Christian (2005) reported that Eng-
lish literacy development is greatly influenced by literacy knowledge in the learner's first lan-
guage. Additionally, English language learners who are literate in their first language can draw
upon strategies they already know such as making inferences and using prior knowledge to
help gain understanding when reading in a new language.

English Language Learners in Schools

The academic performance of English language learners cannot be fully understood without
considering their social, cultural, and economic characteristics, as well as the institutional
history of U.S. schools (Jensen, 2008). As would be expected, there is a large range of socioe-
conomic status levels and parental education attainment levels among English language
learners. However, English language learners are more likely than native English speaking
students to live in poverty and have parents with limited formal education (García & Jensen,
2006). This is mentioned because it is important to keep in mind that the educational achieve-
ment of English language learners, like native English speaking students, can be impacted
by a variety of background factors including family income, parental educational attainment,
parental language proficiency, and family structure.

   It is imperative for educators to understand that children's prior experiences can impact
how they learn (e.g., Hammer, Lawrence, & Miccio, 2007; Konishi, 2007). There may be a ten-
dency for teachers to lump English language learners into one group, expecting the children
to act and learn in the same way. In reality, like native English speakers, English language
learners come from a variety of backgrounds, cultures, and languages. ELLs are a highly het-
erogeneous group of students with diverse backgrounds, abilities, and needs. These children
bring with them a range of experiences and varying prior knowledge. Children will develop
language skills at different speeds, and teachers should be aware that they cannot expect all
ELLs to learn in the same fashion (Harper & de Jong, 2004). It is also important to consider
a child's prior language experiences. Some children come to school with prior exposure to
English, while others may not be introduced to English until they begin school. Children's
outcomes may differ depending on when they were first exposed to English (Hammer et al.,
2007). Understanding students' linguistic and cultural knowledge both at school and beyond
school (e.g., first language literacy, oral proficiency levels, language(s) spoken at home, and
prior experiences) can help teachers link new material and vocabulary words to things stu-
dents may already know (Cummins et al., 2005; de Jong, Harper, & Coady, 2013).

   The amount of cultural and linguistic diversity in a classroom may vary depending on its
location. In a metropolitan area there may be students from a great number of countries, rep-
resenting many different languages, or a group of students that share the same native lan-
guage if it is a location where many immigrants come to work in a specific industry or in a
community that has recently welcomed a large refugee population. Each of these situations
offers its own unique advantages and challenges. In a classroom full of cultural and linguistic

110 | 8. Helping English Language Learners Develop Literacy Skills
diversity, English will be the only possible method of communication between a teacher and
students. This will inevitably create a situation where students have no choice but to practice
English often. On the other hand, if many of the students speak the same language, a teacher
can embrace this by having the class note similarities and differences between the languages.
Additionally, students can offer support for one another in their native language. Regardless
of the composition of a class, it is important to remember that English language learners are
not a homogenous group. As a reminder, even in a class where most of the students speak
the same native language, they could have a variety of socioeconomic status backgrounds,
may have lived in radically different parts of the same country, and could have vastly differ-
ent experiences with formal schooling. For example, an English language learner in your class
may have come from a country where students attend school for eight hours a day, five or six
days a week, and prepare for competitive exams. Another student may have attended school
in a refugee camp where classes with 70 to 80 peers took place in temporary shelters with
little furniture.

      Educational programs for English language learners

There is quite a bit of controversy about how to best ensure the success of English language
learners. Policy makers, researchers, and educators alike have been trying to figure out what
is the appropriate role of a child's native language when learning English. A landmark legal
case, Lau v. Nichols (1974), brought the issue of educational practices regarding English lan-
guage learners into the limelight. Chinese American students challenged the school board
in San Francisco, saying that they were not receiving appropriate educational opportunities
because of their limited English proficiency. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the stu-
dents, acknowledging the need to better serve English language learners. While the outcome
of the case was an important legal event for bilingual education, it did not establish any spe-
cific bilingual policy.

   When referring to different types of educational programs for English language learners, it
should be noted that there is a wide variety of both bilingual programs and English-only pro-
grams. Bilingual programs can encompass anything from dual language to early exit programs;
while English-only programs may differ in the amount of help from the primary language they
allow (Krashen & McField, 2005). In dual language programs, children are taught content in
two languages throughout the school day, whereas early exit programs begin instruction in a
child's native language and then gradually transition to completely English instruction.

   In immersion programs, a child's native language plays virtually no role. While teachers may
use supportive strategies to help English language learners, a common feature is the exclu-
sive use of English text. English immersion programs are being encouraged in several states
due to adoption of English-only legislation. These laws require that all children be taught
English by using solely English, with claims that children can reach English proficiency in
one year's time (MacSwan & Pray, 2005). For example, California, Arizona, and Massachusetts
have passed laws with the intention to bar the use of primary language instruction for Eng-
lish language learners. These states have replaced bilingual programs with Structured Eng-
lish Immersion programs, which aim to expedite the English learning process by using simple
English in the classroom with little to no attention on the students' native languages (Gándara
et al., 2010). All three states aim to have students in Structured English Immersion programs
for no more than one year before they are moved to regular classes. However, evidence from
research suggests that students need three to five years to achieve advanced English profi-
ciency (Genesee, Lindholm-Leary, Saunders, & Christian, 2006). In their study on acquisition
of English, MacSwan, and Pray (2005) found that only about two percent of children attained

                                                                      8. Helping English Language Learners Develop Literacy Skills | 111
English language proficiency in one year. It has been suggested that since the United States
has made an effort to maintain the dominance of the English language in schools, a culture
has developed that defines students by English proficiency (Gándara et al., 2010). An example
of this can be found in terms used in government documents and schools, such as Limited
English Proficient, that focus exclusively on how well a student has acquired the English lan-
guage.

   In contrast to English-only programs, bilingual education programs involve both the native
language and English when addressing academic content. Bilingual education can refer to a
wide range of instructional programs for children whose native language is not English with
the goal of helping students acquire English so they can succeed in mainstream classes. In the
United States, the most common bilingual programs offer instruction in English and Span-
ish, as approximately 80% of ELLs in U.S. schools are from Spanish-language backgrounds
(Loeffer, 2007). Proponents of bilingual education believe that effective bilingual programs
should strive to instill proficiency in both English and the student's native language. In two-
way bilingual programs, half of the students are native English speakers and half are consid-
ered English language learners. These programs aim to teach children more about language
and culture and rest on the premise that diversity is a valuable resource. According to Krashen
and McField (2005), "when it comes to English acquisition, native-language instruction is part
of the solution, not part of the problem" (p. 10).

   A benefit of bilingual education programs is that children are able to further their language
abilities in their home language while learning a new language. Studies conducted by Willig
(1985) and Wong-Fillmore and Valadez (1986) found that benefits of bilingual education
included improved reading and other academic skills, plus a recent meta-analysis by Rolstad
et al. (2005) showed that bilingual education is superior to English-only programs by showing
that bilingual education does promote academic achievement. Coppola (2005) stressed that
knowledge gained in one language is available for use in the second language and that some
language abilities can be transferred. A fear of English-only programs is that children will
begin to lose skill in their native language. It is not a stretch to say that if children lose pro-
ficiency in their home language, they lose a piece of their identity. If students begin to lose
their home language, communication with family members can become difficult, causing ten-
sion and disruption of family dynamics. Sadly, children may even begin to view their native
language as inferior to English. Still, the hope is that bilingual programs will be adding a new
language instead of replacing the native language with English. It should be noted that while
benefits of bilingual education have a strong research base, a common argument against bilin-
gual education is that many people have succeeded in acquiring a new language without such
programs, fueling restrictive language policies in some states as mentioned previously.

            Academic and Social Language Proficiency

Historically, literature has noted a divide between the development of social language abilities
in English language learners and the development of academic language (Hawkins, 2004).
Cummins (1979) coined the acronyms BICS (Basic Interpersonal Communicative Skills) and
CALP (Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency) to help explain students' language abilities
to teachers. This distinction helps highlight that many English language learners may quickly
develop proficiency in casual spoken English but may continue to struggle with academic
language and writing. Awareness of the differences between social language and academic
language can help teachers assist students in all domains of language--listening, speaking,
reading, and writing. When making the distinction between conversational or social language

and academic language, Cummins drew upon work by Skutnabb-Kangas and Toukomaa (1976),
who had been studying Finnish children living in Sweden. While the children were seemingly
fluent in both Finnish and Swedish, they were falling behind academically and not meeting
grade level expectations. Cummins (1979) hypothesized that there were two elements of
language proficiency, one reflecting the ability to carry on conversations about everyday
events, and another that was needed to comprehend school subjects. In one study testing
this hypothesis, Cummins (1984) examined four hundred teacher referral forms and psycho-
logical assessments of English language learners from a large school district in Canada. Sim-
ilar to what was found with Finnish children in Sweden, the forms prepared by teachers and
psychologists noted that the children had no difficulty understanding English, yet they were
performing poorly on English tasks in the classroom and on the verbal portions of cognitive
ability tests. Since the English language learners appeared to speak English well, the teach-
ers and psychologists assumed difficulties in class were due to cognitive abilities rather than
linguistic factors and placed many of the children in special education. Cummins argued that
English language learners may not necessarily have difficulties learning, but that there was
the possibility that they had not developed the appropriate type of language proficiency to be
successful in an academic setting. He believed that these ELLs had developed the ability to
converse casually, but had not developed academic language proficiency.

   Basic Interpersonal Communicative Skills (BICS), which are typically acquired first when
learning a new language, refers to language skills often needed in social settings. Social lan-
guage is the type of language students need for mingling in the lunchroom, on the playground,
and in school hallways. Students may pick up on classroom routines quickly and learn essen-
tial vocabulary words such as water and bathroom. This is the type of language that is learned
when there are many clues to aid comprehension. Background knowledge on the topic and
clues such as facial expressions provide a context to understand this type of language; how-
ever, it can be easy to mistake the social ability that English language learners first develop
for the type of proficiency and fluency necessary to succeed in the classroom.

   Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency (CALP) refers to the formal academic language
that is needed for success in school. In the literature surrounding the education of English
language learners, academic language is thought of as the focus of the curriculum, textbooks,
and formal instruction. This type of language is not part of a student's typical vocabulary,
yet is often required for lectures, reports, and other academic situations. When faced with
academic language, students must be able to rely on the actual language, not clues, to make
meaning. Introducing key terms before a lesson, utilizing pictures with new vocabulary words,
and assessing background knowledge are all ways teachers can help engage English language
learners with academic language.

   Cummins (1980) stated that BICS, language used in informal and face-to-face interactions,
can be acquired by English language learners quite quickly and easily, while the more cog-
nitively challenging CALP takes longer to acquire. Teachers are confused often when English
language learners, who seem to converse with great fluency, struggle in academic areas. It is
likely that this confusion is due to the fact that it takes much longer to develop proficiency
in content material because it is much more demanding cognitively. The distinction between
BICS and CALP is often shown using a picture of an iceberg (see Figure 1). The tip of the
iceberg that we can see represents BICS, the conversational fluency that can often lead to
mistaken assumptions about a student's academic work abilities. However, the much larger
portion of the iceberg is beneath the water, representing CALP, the academic language nec-
essary for success in the classroom.

                                   conversational fluency may lead to assumptions about

                                   classroom.

         Language Acquisition Theories and Application

For teachers to effectively meet the needs of English language learners, it is important to
have an understanding about the process of acquiring a new language. Research has long sup-
ported the idea that similar language and thinking processes are at play between acquiring
a first language and acquiring another language (e.g., Dulay & Burt, 1974; Ervin-Tripp, 1974;
Ravem, 1968). English language learners, like monolingual learners, acquire language through
a series of developmental stages that form a continuum. This continuum is divided into levels
signifying the proficiency level of the language learner. It is important to understand that
while all English language learners typically acquire English by passing through the same
series of stages, the pace of acquisition varies greatly. Students who are literate in their native
language or who have had continuous schooling are much more likely to move through the
stages at a faster pace than someone who is not literate in their native language or who has
had limited or interrupted formal education. Understanding a student's English proficiency
level can help teachers plan appropriate lessons and assessments to meet the individual needs
of the English language learner.

   Generally, English language learners have stronger receptive language skills (listening and
reading) than productive language skills (speaking and writing), and their vocabulary will be
stronger in whichever language they are exposed to the most often. An English language
learner may know the name for a word in one language but not in the other language. For
example, a child may know words for microwave and refrigerator only in Spanish because all
prior experience with those objects occurred in the home with parents who speak Spanish.
Conversely, the same child may know the names of school objects only in English because that
is where they are exposed to them. Given appropriate exposure and opportunities to develop
both languages, children can gain comparable abilities in each language.

   Theories about how people learn a new language are often derived from theories about
how people learn a first language. Since first language acquisition is accomplished by children
worldwide, researchers and educators interested in second (or third or fourth) language
acquisition have often used first language acquisition theories as a model. Linguist Stephen
Krashen believes that there is no fundamental difference between how people acquire their
first language and how they acquire subsequent languages. However, Krashen (1982) does

114 | 8. Helping English Language Learners Develop Literacy Skills
make a distinction between language acquisition and language learning. He notes that lan-
guage acquisition is a natural process in that young children typically acquire their native lan-
guage at home with no formal teaching. Acquiring a language is simply "picking it up" and
being able to use the language in natural situations. When people have acquired a language,
they do not need to think about the formal rules of the language. Instead, there is a subcon-
scious feeling that sentences "sound right" or "sound wrong." On the other hand, learning a
new language includes understanding things such as grammar and the formal rules of the lan-
guage.

   Krashen's theories about how a child acquires a new language have been influential in pro-
moting instructional practices that encourage teachers to focus on communication with stu-
dents and that allow students to develop at a pace that is appropriate for their developmental
stage. In their classic book The Natural Approach (1983), Krashen and Terrell first explored
the stages of language acquisition and explained ways teachers could help with the process
in the classroom. These naturally occurring stages, often referred to in literature surround-
ing the education of English language learners, are 1) pre-production, 2) early production, 3)
speech emergence, 4) intermediate fluency, and 5) advanced fluency. An adapted summary of
these five stages follows, along with approximate time frames, characteristics of each stage,
and suggested instructional strategies for teachers. More information and summaries of these
stages can be found on pages of websites such as ¡Colorín Colorado!, Everything ESL, ESL Base,
and Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development.

   The pre-production stage is generally thought to last anywhere from a few hours to the
first six months when learning a new language. Often referred to as the silent or receptive
stage, English language learners are beginning to understand the new language but typically
do not engage in conversations. Students at this first stage may just be starting to feel com-
fortable in a new setting and may use nonverbal communication to respond to comments.
It is important to keep in mind that silence does not necessarily mean that the student is
not learning. The English language learner may be taking in a lot of information, but is just
not yet ready to speak. Helpful instructional strategies include using real objects to illus-
trate concepts, role playing or pantomiming, pointing to pictures, and employing total phys-
ical response (TPR). The total physical response method, developed by psychologist James
Asher (1977), coordinates language with physical movement to help students learn the tar-
get language. In early TPR lessons, students may learn simple commands such as stand up
or clap your hands (taught while the teacher is standing up or clapping his or her hands). As
students begin to develop a greater grasp of the language, the commands can become more
complex and students can even give out commands for their teacher and peers to follow. TPR
does not have to be limited to students at the earliest stage of language acquisition. Includ-
ing body movements can help children of all language levels and in a variety of subject areas
(Segal, 1983; Zwiers, 2007). It is quite likely that a student would gain a deeper understanding
of vocabulary and concepts, such as how planets rotate around the sun by actually moving
objects around a model of a sun. The same could be true for acting out an important event
being taught in a history or social studies class.

   Early production, the second stage, thought to last six months to a year, is characterized
by limited comprehension and the initiation of short sentences. Students at this phase are
likely to grasp the main idea of topics but not every word spoken. During early production
students may respond with one to three word groupings and begin to produce words that
are frequently used. Teachers can help students at this stage by asking them yes or no ques-
tions during class. Granted, teachers are usually encouraged to ask open-ended questions to
elicit more information from students; however, asking an English language learner yes-no

                                                                      8. Helping English Language Learners Develop Literacy Skills | 115
questions during this phase may help create a low anxiety environment, help them feel more
included in the classroom activities, and keep them engaged in the lessons. It may also be
beneficial for teachers to rephrase statements using simpler vocabulary to boost comprehen-
sion.

   Speech emergence, lasting anywhere from one to three years, is thought of as a time of
experimentation as students begin to learn more about vocabulary and sentence structure.
Students at this stage often engage in trial and error as they initiate simple sentences. Teach-
ers can help by providing language models for students to use in response to questions and
by expanding the question format to include how and why questions.

   Students in the intermediate fluency stage begin to use longer and more complex sen-
tences. At this time, students have typically been immersed in the new language for three to
five years. Teachers can foster development at this stage by asking students to compare ele-
ments of language and focus on the similarities and differences between English and their
native language. Many languages have cognates, which are words with shared meanings from
common roots (e.g., curious/curioso, geography/geographía). Pointing out simple cognates
can help increase students' vocabularies and comprehension. This may also be a good time to
point out false cognates which can be the root of some trouble in conversations for students.
Examples of false cognates include rope and ropa, with ropa meaning clothes, and an even
more troubling one includes embarrassed and embarazada (pregnant). During the intermedi-
ate fluency stage, teachers can also help students identify words they overuse, such as nice
and good and build their vocabularies with more sophisticated terms.

   The last stage in Krashen and Terrell (1983) is advanced fluency, which usually happens
between years five and seven of learning a new language. At this point students are beginning
to converse and write in much the same way as native speakers of English. It is also during
this time that students truly begin to grasp the academic language used in formal schooling,
which allows teachers to focus more on abstract terminology and concepts.

   Knowing about stages of language acquisition helps educators understand that language
learning is a gradual process and helps move some teachers away from the idea of avoiding
presentation of academic content until students have a strong grasp on the language. Under-
standing the stages of language learning and where a student falls on the language learning
continuum can help teachers tailor their lessons to meet the various needs of the students.
Furthermore, when teachers understand an English language learner's oral English profi-
ciency, they can ask questions in a variety of appropriate forms, such as requiring a one word
answer or a lengthy response (de Jong et al., 2013). Appropriately scaffolding instruction helps
students feel challenged in the classroom, but not overwhelmed. Recognizing the strengths
and weaknesses of all learners in the classroom involves targeting instruction at each stu-
dent's zone of proximal development (Vygotsky, 1978). The zone of proximal development
(ZPD) is a theory proposed by psychologist Lev Vygotsky explaining what a child can accom-
plish with support (e.g., scaffolding), compared to what he or she can accomplish indepen-
dently. It may be helpful for teachers to think of this area as the area between what a student
can do right now on their own and the point you want them to reach next. Teachers can help
students reach that next area by providing support, guidance, modeling, and feedback to help
them progress.

           Building upon Cultural and Linguistic Capital

The rapidly changing demographics of the U.S. have posed extraordinary challenges for edu-
cators to accommodate the various needs of English language learners, including ways to

116 | 8. Helping English Language Learners Develop Literacy Skills
promote the sociolinguistic, sociocultural, and socioemotional development of such a diverse
student population (Li & Wang, 2008), in addition to teaching reading and content knowl-
edge. To successfully address the needs of English language learners and to ensure their
academic success, it is important for teachers to develop instructional practices that are cul-
turally responsive and that build upon students' linguistic and cultural backgrounds (Gay,
2000; Li, 2008). For teachers to implement culturally responsive instructional practices, they
must learn who their students are, where their students are from, factors that influence stu-
dent learning both inside and outside of school, the types of resources available to the stu-
dents, and appropriate strategies to facilitate student learning.

   Culturally responsive teaching is built on the notion that culture is central to student learn-
ing. According to Nieto (2000), culturally responsive teaching creates optimal learning envi-
ronments by recognizing, respecting, and using students' identities and previous experiences
as meaningful sources of information. Language learning is complex and can be affected by
many interrelated factors. How can teachers build upon the rich cultural and linguistic cap-
ital of their students? How can we expect English language learners to succeed in the class-
room without bearing in mind how their cultures, languages, and previous experiences have
shaped their background knowledge? Making connections to students' backgrounds is one
of the most important aspects of culturally responsive teaching. While building background
knowledge is essential for all learners, it is especially important for English language learn-
ers who are learning content and language simultaneously. Whenever possible, programs for
ELLs should support the child's native language. This helps show value in the English language
learner's native language and ensures that learning English is an additive process and not one
that results in losing the native language.

   Teachers must be able to understand the linguistic needs of English language learners and
implement lessons that effectively meet those needs. Many teachers find it helpful to gain
specific information regarding how much English their students use, when they use English,
and with whom they speak English. Often, teachers may be working with children who may
not yet have a strong foundation in their home language, making acquisition of English even
more difficult. Young children in particular may not have completely developed many aspects
of their first language.

   Additionally, it is important for teachers to know about students' levels of literacy in their
first language, levels of oral proficiency in English, and educational background. A case study
by Rubinstein-Avila (2004) of Miguel, an adolescent English language learner who was strug-
gling with literacy development, was able to show that even "students who do not neces-
sarily conform to teachers' notions of `academic applied pupils' may possess a great deal of
awareness about their own learning and be highly motivated" (p. 300). Although Miguel was
a struggling reader at school, his literacy skills were crucial for life at home. He helped his
mother with legal documents and by scouring weekly sale advertisements to find the best
deals. Miguel also served as a translator, both written and oral, for his mother. Studies such
as this one are crucial to the field to show educators that English language learners bring a
variety of skills with them to the classroom and have a lot to offer. This study showed that the
ways in which an individual uses literacy may not necessarily conform to traditional school
views of literacy. It is important for both researchers and educators to be aware of the various
contexts in which students use literacy.

   As English language learners are being enrolled in American schools in record numbers,
educators must strive to provide effective learning environments that are developmentally
and linguistically appropriate for all learners. Given that increasing numbers of students are
coming from non-English speaking households, there is a need for educators to know about

                                                                      8. Helping English Language Learners Develop Literacy Skills | 117
the needs of diverse students and to have an understanding of cultural and linguistic diversity
(Coppola, 2005; Fernandez, 2000).

Helping English Language Learners Develop Literacy Skills
                        and Succeed Academically

Research has shown that the process of learning to read is lengthy. It is recommended that
all children, especially those at risk of experiencing reading difficulties, be exposed to print-
rich environments that promote language and literacy growth (Snow, Burns, & Griffin, 1998).
Components of appropriate language environments for students include engaging them in
conversations to foster oral communication and cognitive abilities. English language learners
benefit from exposure to language modeling and may need specific developmentally appro-
priate strategies to assist the development of language skills (Oades-Sese, Esquivel, Kaliski, &
Maniatis, 2011).

   Six years after the publication of the Report of the National Reading Panel (NRP; National
Institute of Child Health and Human Development [NICHD], 2000), which excluded studies
with English language learners, a large research review on educating English language learn-
ers was published. The National Literacy Panel (NLP) examined research on literacy develop-
ment of English language learners ages 3 to 18 and included studies from around the world
(August & Shanahan, 2006). The NLP found that English language learners who are learning to
read in English, just like native English speakers learning to read in English, benefit from early
and explicit instruction in the crucial components of literacy identified by the National Read-
ing Panel--phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension (NICHD,
2000). According to Linan-Thompson, Cirino, and Vaughn (2007), there is growing evidence
suggesting that many early reading intervention strategies that have been shown to be effec-
tive with native English speaking students can also be effective with English language learn-
ers. With the majority of English language learners receiving reading instruction solely in
English (August, 2006; Goldenberg, 2008), it is important to continue to identify interventions
that have been effective with English speaking struggling readers that are also effective for
English language learners who are struggling to learn to read.

   Some adolescent English language learners may have reasonably developed language abil-
ities, but still struggle learning to read. August and Shanahan (2006) suggest that it may be
necessary, particularly for adolescent ELLs who cannot read or write in any language, to
explicitly teach the basic components of reading, beginning with phonemic awareness and
phonics. After adolescent ELLs have acquired the basic skills necessary for reading words,
instruction can focus on comprehension strategies, fluency building exercises, and foster-
ing greater vocabulary understanding through explicit instruction of words, word parts, and
word relationships.

   In addition to knowledge related to language and reading skills, teachers working with
diverse learners also need a collection of strategies and techniques to help meet the diverse
cultural and linguistic needs of students. Students who are at the early stages of English lan-
guage proficiency benefit from linguistic, graphic, and visual supports (Facella, Rampino, &
Shea, 2005; Herrel & Jordan, 2012). For example, linguistic supports could include things such
as opportunities to interact and engage in conversations, providing students with language
models, and modification of sentence patterns. Examples of graphic supports would be pro-
viding tables or graphic organizers to assist learners. Graphic organizers, such as idea webs
or story pyramids, are greatly beneficial to ELLs because they can facilitate an understanding
of challenging concepts and ideas without the use of long explanations that may be confus-

118 | 8. Helping English Language Learners Develop Literacy Skills
ing. Cummins, Mirza, and Stille (2012) advocate for the use of visual aids and graphic orga-
nizers as a way to scaffold academic language for English language learners, noting that this
can enhance literacy engagement. See Table 1 at the end of this chapter for websites offering
graphic organizers that can be downloaded. As a way of providing visual supports, teachers
can use pictures or illustrations, manipulatives, and multimedia. Effective teaching strategies
for ELLs as described by Facella and colleagues (2005) include the use of gestures and visual
cues, repetition, and the use of real objects. Other useful strategies for teachers may include
grouping ELLs with students who have strong English abilities, exposing ELLs to rich oral
language, and incorporating their home language whenever possible. It is important to note
that these groups and tasks should be purposefully designed and monitored by the teacher
to ensure comfort and inclusion. While cooperative learning activities can be extremely help-
ful for English language learners, it is imperative that teachers scaffold these activities so
that English language learners of all proficiency levels can benefit (Zwiers & Crawford, 2011).
Teachers should also encourage parents to read with their children, even if that is only possi-
ble in their home language. As mentioned before, language skills can transfer and skills in one
language can support language and literacy building in the other language.

   Many schools across the country use a framework known as sheltered instruction that
incorporates techniques and strategies such as the use of graphic organizers and cooperative
learning, as a way to help English language learners access the curriculum while emphasizing
the development of academic language (Echevarria, 2006). The Sheltered Instruction Obser-
vation Protocol (SIOP) Model was developed through a federally funded research project
(Center for Applied Linguistics, 2015) to help educators design and teach lessons aimed at
improving the literacy abilities of English language learners. Additional research is still needed
to specifically explore the effectiveness of the SIOP Model, since to date, no well controlled
studies have been done to evaluate the model in comparisons to other approaches using evi-
dence standards of research outlined in Chapter 2 of this textbook.

                                    Summary

With the population of English language learners in U.S. schools continuing to rise, more
and more teachers will be responsible for educating culturally and linguistically diverse stu-
dents. English language learners come to the classroom with varying levels of English profi-
ciency, various life and school experiences, as well as different learning needs. This chapter
was designed to move through theory and into practice to help teachers engage all learners
and design effective instructional opportunities for English language learners. A brief back-
ground of English language learners was presented, with an emphasis on language acquisi-
tion and learning theories. Information in this chapter provides educators with background
knowledge and strategies to best meet the needs of English language learners to promote
language acquisition and help them succeed academically.

9. Literacy Instruction for Students with
Intellectual and Developmental
Disabilities

                                                     Michelle A. Duffy

                                     Abstract

This chapter addresses research-based literacy instruction for students with intellectual and
developmental disabilities. It begins with a discussion of these disabilities, highlighting some
common impairments that exist across such disability labels which can make literacy learning
a challenge. Examples are provided that outline ways to address literacy skills, specifically in
the area of reading. In addition, this chapter invites teachers to consider the ways in which
traditional forms of literacy instruction can result in barriers to some students' participation
in literacy learning and encourages finding ways to remove such barriers so that all students,
including those with more significant forms of disability, can benefit.

   Learning Objectives

        After reading this chapter, readers will be able to

      1. define what it means to presume competence in the learning potential of students with
           intellectual and developmental disabilities, and discuss the significance in doing so;

      2. identify common barriers to literacy learning that often exist in classroom settings for stu-
           dents with intellectual and developmental disabilities and describe ways to remove these
           barriers;

      3. discuss evidence-based ways to instruct students with intellectual and developmental dis-
           abilities in phonemic awareness, phonics, comprehension, vocabulary, and fluency;

      4. design instructional reading activities and experiences for students with intellectual and
           developmental disabilities that effectively meet their needs in skill development while also
           maintaining their meaningful participation in the inclusive literacy classroom.

                                  Introduction

Students with intellectual and developmental disabilities have generally been taught literacy
using a curriculum focusing on functional life skills (Katims, 2000). Through functional skills
curricula, students are frequently taught to recognize and write a limited number of the sight
words to support their participation in the community or at work (Mosley, Flynt, & Morton,
1997). For example, a student might be taught to recognize the words danger and exit for
safety purposes and the days of the week to read a work schedule. Although learning such

                                                                                                                                                               125
words would be beneficial, a functional skills approach to literacy instruction does not equip
students with the skills needed to identify words beyond the specific sight words they have
been taught. This inhibits their abilities to read and write for other purposes, and therefore,
limits their opportunities to take part more fully in their communities (Copeland & Keefe,
2007). Students with intellectual and developmental disabilities may not be afforded other
types of literacy instruction because it is often believed that they are incapable of learning
other, more sophisticated aspects of literacy (Kluth & Chandler-Olcott, 2008).

   According to Joseph and Seery (2004), "The potential for individuals with [intellectual dis-
abilities] to grasp and generalize literacy skills has been underestimated by many educators
and researchers" (p. 93). Although research is still limited in the area of higher-level literacy
instruction (i.e., literacy instruction that extends beyond a functional skills approach) for stu-
dents with intellectual disabilities and developmental disabilities, a number of studies have
shown that students with such disabilities have learned to decode words, comprehend nar-
rative and expository texts, and write for expression (e.g., Allor, Mathes, Roberts, Jones, &
Champlin, 2010; Conners, Rosenquist, Sligh, Atwell, & Kiser, 2006; Pennington, Stenhoff, Gib-
son, & Ballou, 2012).

   Up until quite recently, it has been difficult to determine what constitutes good evidence-
based literacy instruction for students with intellectual disabilities and developmental disabil-
ities (Lemons, Mrachko, Kostewicz, & Paterra, 2012). This difficulty is largely because much of
the research done on best reading practices has not included this population of students. Fur-
ther, conventional wisdom once suggested that students with intellectual and developmental
disabilities might need qualitatively different instruction than their peers without disability
labels. It makes sense though, that on some level, the same type of high-quality instruction
that works with other struggling students should be beneficial to any student, despite disabil-
ity label. Researchers have recently begun to test this premise, and the results are promising.
In this chapter, you will learn more about literacy instruction for students with intellectual
and developmental disabilities and how to devise lessons to meet their individual needs in
reading.

                 Defining Intellectual Disabilities (ID)

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5; American
Psychiatric Association, 2013) defines an intellectual disability as "a disorder with onset during
the developmental period that includes both intellectual and adaptive functioning deficits in
conceptual, social, and practical domains" (p. 33). In other words, it is a disorder that forms
before age 18 that affects a person's intellectual development and ability to effectively use life
skills. The term intellectual disability has replaced the term mental retardation in this edition
of the DSM-5. Intellectual disabilities may occur alone or as a part of genetic syndromes or
other developmental disabilities (see below) such as Down syndrome, Prader-Willi Syndrome,
or autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

              Defining Developmental Disabilities (DD)

According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2013), developmental dis-
abilities "are a group of conditions due to an impairment in physical, learning, language, or
behavior areas. These conditions begin during the developmental period, may impact day-to-
day functioning, and usually last throughout a person's lifetime" (para. 1).

126 | 9. Students with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities
   In some schools these terms are used interchangeably; however, there is a difference
between them. Developmental disabilities encompass intellectual disabilities. That is, intellec-
tual disabilities are considered a type of developmental disability, but developmental disabili-
ties also include other disabilities that are fundamentally physical in nature, such as cerebral
palsy (American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities [AAIDD], 2013).

   Although these common definitions are used in diagnosing ID and DD, it is important to
use these definitions with caution, as they provide only one perspective on such disabilities,
mostly in line with a medical model perspective which tends to have its focus on impairments
and treatment of the individual (Thomas, 2002). Although the medical model perspective has
much to offer toward the health and well-being of individuals with disabilities, there is a push
from a number of educational researchers to shift thinking about disability from a medical
model to a social model. A social model of disability recognizes that while individuals may
have impairments, it is society that needs to change, as society "creates" disability by deny-
ing those with disabilities equal participation in their communities (Couser, 2002). Kluth and
Chandler-Olcott (2008) explain this notion in relation to individuals with autism:

       Although many individuals with autism share that "it" is real--that they do experience
       things in different ways, that their bodies are uncooperative or that they have sensory
       or communication problems--many of these same individuals indicated that autism
       is, at least in moments, "created" by an inflexible society. Therefore, people may feel
       more or less challenged on any given day based on whether appropriate supports are
       provided for them or whether they are expected to communicate, behave, move, or
       interact in a conventional way. (p. 4)

Another point to consider is that there is wide variation among individuals with ID and DD.
No label is ever sufficient to describe the intricacies, needs, abilities, or potentials of a human
being. In fact, society has been wrong many times in its understanding of individuals with dis-
abilities and assumptions about what they might be able to accomplish. As teachers, disability
labels can help us consider some of the different needs our students may have; however, we
should always take our understanding of our students from what they show us about them-
selves and what we are able to figure out from careful and flexible assessment of their needs,
not just from textbook definitions of their disabilities.

                          Changing Perspectives

There is no doubt about the importance of literacy in our society. Among other things, being
literate increases one's ability to learn independently, to gain and maintain employment, and
to care for oneself. Access to literacy instruction, therefore, is imperative. Too often, however,
educators and other adults in the lives of students with ID and DD have assumed that these
students would not be able to benefit from literacy instruction because they view the tasks
involved to be too complicated or unnecessary for students with ID and DD to understand or
perform. This view has led many educators to forego literacy instruction for the children or
to address it in superficial ways.

Presuming Competence

The first step in helping a child with ID or DD to become literate is to presume competence
(Biklen & Burke, 2006) in his or her abilities to gain such knowledge and skills. This means to

                                                                       9. Students with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities | 127
put aside doubts and preconceived notions about what a student may be able to accomplish
based on a student's label of disability, estimates of IQ, or assumed limitations and instead,
teach as if the child will learn. Put another way, to presume competence in students is to act
on the belief "that all individuals can acquire valued skills if given appropriate structures and
supports" (Copeland & Keefe, 2007, p. 2).

Literacy Initiations and Access to Instruction

While many students with ID and DD interact with texts in traditional ways, some students
with such disabilities may interact with texts in ways that seem unusual or different than how
students without such disabilities interact with texts. For example, some students, particu-
larly those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), may be interested in a book's texture or fas-
cinated by how a book looks when it is spun around. Other students may be interested in and
insist on reading books on one specific topic for a substantial period of time. Take for example
the ways in which Steven, a boy with ASD and an intellectual disability, reads for information:

       He had with him, as always, several different public library books, all related to but-
       terflies and insects. He laid three of the books, opened, on the floor, then centered
       himself among them, glancing at each of the exposed pages. He then flipped to the
       next page of each book and repeated the process. (Kliewer & Biklen, 2001, p. 5)

Students like Steven are sometimes dismissed as readers because their teachers misinterpret
their unique ways of interacting with texts as indications that they are not attending to and/
or are not ready for instruction involving the written word. Others feel compelled to restrict
students' access to texts that they worry might be topics of overfocus, insisting that the stu-
dent read something other than books about their favorite subjects. However, students' inter-
actions with texts should be welcomed despite differences. A child's spinning of a book or
investigation of the book's texture should never be taken as a sign that the child is not ready
for literacy instruction. Nor should we avoid inviting them to use texts in more conventional
ways. On the contrary, students will benefit from learning to use texts in the intended fash-
ion. An important understanding, though, is that there is nothing wrong with interacting with
texts in unusual ways. As long as a child is interested in texts, teachers should use the child's
interactions as a starting point for further invitations to literacy growth and also encourage
the child to interact with texts in ways that are pleasing to them.

   Students with ID and DD can learn literacy skills, but a pitfall of many educators in helping
the students attain literacy is to focus only on early or basic literacy skills in the absence
of other more meaningful, generative, and socially-based forms of literacy. For example, a
student who has not mastered the alphabet might not be invited to respond to read-alouds
through discussion, drama, or art, and may be excluded from story time altogether. This is
because it is often thought that students will not be able to benefit from other literacy activ-
ities until early skills are mastered. This assumption is incorrect, however, and can be detri-
mental to student learning. One does not need to be able to read words or even identify
letters to be able to take part in classroom read-alouds and response activities, and much
can be learned about literacy through taking part in such activities. Through read-alouds, for
instance, students are provided with a model of fluent reading, how a story is structured, and
what the purposes are for various kinds of texts. While the teaching of skills is important and
should not be denied to students with disabilities, reading must also not be construed as a lin-

128 | 9. Students with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities
ear and rigid process for which only some students are able to participate (Kliewer & Biklen,
2001).

Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)

Many students who have ID or DD also have complex communication needs (CCN). Some
students may not use speech to communicate. Others may not have reliable speech, that is,
speech that consistently and accurately reflects the message the speaker wishes to convey
(Broderick & Kasa-Hendrickson, 2001). Some students may have reliable speech, but their
speech may be difficult for others to understand. Teaching literacy skills to a student who
is not verbal or who has unreliable speech can seem daunting. As teachers, we often expect
students to communicate their knowledge through speaking, particularly as students learn to
read. Think about how you would work with a typically-developing kindergartener on letter
sounds. You would likely show the child a letter on the chalkboard or on a flashcard and ask
the child to respond orally with the sound of the letter. Similarly, when meeting with a student
to assess his or her reading ability, you would likely want to hear the child read a passage so
you could make note of his or her strengths and struggles during oral reading. How then, can
a teacher approach such important learning activities and assessments when working with
a child who does not speak? How could the child show a teacher his or her competence in
reading? How can a teacher determine a child's understanding as new skills are taught?

   Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) refers to the techniques and supports
used by individuals with limitations in spoken language to enhance their ability to commu-
nicate. While these supports are often bundled under the term AAC, there are important
differences in augmentative versus alternative communication. Augmentative communication
refers to the techniques and supports used in addition to speech, spoken sounds, or gestures,
while alternative communication refers to techniques or supports used in place of speech
and gestures (Copeland & Keefe, 2007). Numerous options for AAC exist, including "manual
sign language, as well as non-electronic and electronic communication devices and software
options" (p. 132), which vary in complexity (e.g., high-tech, low-tech) and expense. A common
high-tech AAC device used by students is the Dynavox, which is a computerized touchscreen
that allows users to select words and symbols indicating what they would like to commu-
nicate. The device, in turn, speaks out these choices digitally. Lower-tech supports might
include teacher-created boards with letters, numbers, and/or pictures made with clip art to
which students can point to communicate their needs and responses.

   Students with ID and DD can often benefit from AAC in literacy learning. In deciding which
AAC supports to use, a teacher must consider the particular needs of each student. Not
all supports or devices will be appropriate for all students with disabilities. It would not be
appropriate, for example, to require a student to use a particular support simply because
it is less expensive or already on hand. In addition, some students with limited speech may
already be making use of certain AAC devices in their daily lives. If this is the case for a par-
ticular student, finding a way to incorporate that device into the child's literacy learning will
be of utmost importance. For students who have difficulty with reliable speech or producing
speech that is readily understood by others, finding a way for the students to communicate
their knowledge without the need to speak can be beneficial. The ways in which AAC can be
used to supplement and enhance a student's literacy learning are innumerable. Several exam-
ples will be given throughout the next section on comprehensive literacy instruction for stu-
dents with ID and DD.

                                                                       9. Students with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities | 129
  Comprehensive Reading Instruction for Students with ID
                                      and DD

This section will provide ways to instruct students with ID and DD on particular skills that are
important for growth in reading. The skills have been presented separately by area so that you
can both understand the main processes of reading and learn ways to teach the skills effec-
tively when working with students. However, it is important to recognize that reading should
not be treated and taught as a set of unrelated sub-skills, nor do students need to master skills
in one area to take part in instruction in another area. Students must have the opportunity to
experience literacy in its cohesive sense in conjunction with opportunities to work on needed
skills. Students of all needs and abilities need time to experience hearing and responding to
good literature, to play with language, and to take risks with new ideas and conventions. They
must also be given appropriate instruction and supports on their way to learning the conven-
tions of literacy so that they too can interact with it meaningfully.

   In 1997, Congress asked the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
(NICHD) to work in conjunction with the Department of Education to assemble a panel whose
task would be to review all of the available research on teaching children to read and make
recommendations for effective practices.1 This panel summarized the findings in what is
known as the Report of the National Reading Panel (NRP; National Institute of Child Health
and Human Development [NICHD], 2000), which outlined the five areas as crucial for stu-
dents to develop to become good readers: phonemic awareness, phonics, comprehension,
vocabulary, and fluency. Although the NRP did not focus on students with ID and DD, other
researchers have begun to investigate these areas in relation to students with ID and DD and
have determined that these same areas should be addressed when teaching reading to stu-
dents with more significant forms of disability as well (Allor, Mathes, Roberts, Cheatham, &
Al Otaiba, 2014; Beecher & Childre, 2012). Sometimes it can be difficult to know how to teach
these important aspects of reading, given a student's difference in memory, mobility, and/or
speech. This section will give you some ideas for approaching these topics using research-
supported strategies.

Phonemic Awareness

Phonemic awareness is the understanding that spoken words can be broken down into indi-
vidual sounds. Words are spoken as a single pulse of sound. When we say the word cat, for
instance, we do not break the word into its individual sounds. To read words, however, a stu-
dent must understand that the letters in words represent individual sounds. Before that can
happen, a student must be aware that there are individual sounds in words. These individ-
ual sounds are called phonemes. In the case of cat, the phonemes are /c/, /a/, and /t/. We
must help a child become aware of phonemes so that letter-sound correspondences will make
sense to the child. Developing this awareness may seem simple to an adult with good literacy
skills, but for a child learning to break apart sounds in spoken words for the first time, it can
be surprisingly challenging (see Chapter 3 for coverage of this topic in more depth).

      Phonemic awareness instruction for students with ID and DD

Recent research has shown that students with ID and DD can benefit from similar types of
explicit (i.e., direct and structured) instruction in phonemic awareness used with other stu-
dents who need extra support in developing this skill. However, to be beneficial, the instruc-
tion may need to be modified to be more concrete, such as using objects as a visual cue, or

130 | 9. Students with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities
providing more than one mode of learning, such as incorporating sign language in addition to
verbal instruction (Beecher & Childre, 2012). For example, when bringing students' attention
to the initial sounds of words beginning with /p/, it might be helpful to set out a small toy
pig or make the sign for pig to give the student a concrete visual reminder of the sound being
learned. It has also been found that students with ID and DD may need a longer amount of
time to acquire phonemic awareness skills (Allor, Mathes, Roberts, Jones, & Champlin, 2010).

   In the case of a child who does not have reliable speech and/or bodily control, more cre-
ative ways are needed to help the student demonstrate his or her knowledge and understand-
ing. Imagine for a moment working with a child who has limited reliable speech. The student
can sometimes communicate a sound verbally; however, he often cannot produce the sound
he is thinking of accurately enough for us to be certain that he understands. Instead of requir-
ing the child to speak his responses aloud, one can create response boards to allow the child
to point out his answers (Light & McNaughton, 2012).

   Imagine that you would like your student to be able to blend three phonemes (individual
sounds) together to blend a word. Since the student has difficulty producing speech, you will
want to use pictures to which the student can point. It is easy to create your own set of pic-
ture words on card stock or you can find cards that are commercially available. Next, use the
picture cards to model how phonemes can be blended into words. To begin, show the child a
picture, for example, of a pig. Start by saying, "Here is a picture of a pig. Listen to me say the
sounds in this word. /p/ /i/ /g/... pig. Do you hear the sounds I am saying? /p/ /i/ /g/...
pig. I can break apart the sounds in the word pig, like this /p/ /i/ /g/. Then I can put them
back together. /p/ /i/ /g/ is pig!" You would continue this using several, clear examples. You
could also cut the picture of the pig into three pieces, moving each to present a sound.

   Next, you would introduce an activity to determine if the child can identify a word given
its phonemes. To do this, you can set out three picture cards in front of the child (see Figure
1). First make sure the child knows what each picture represents by pointing to each and nam-
ing it: "Here is a dog, cat, and pig." This is an important step so that the child knows that
the picture of the cat, for example, is indeed a cat and not a kitten. You may need to repeat
the words, depending on the student's memory needs. Next, you tell the student that you are
going to give him three sounds that when put together will make a word. Ask him to point
to the word you are making. You would then say, "/p/ /i/ /g/" and determine whether the
child can select the appropriate response.

Figure 1. Picture cards for phonemic awareness activity.

      As the child progresses in the ability to blend phonemes, you can make the work more
challenging by requiring attention to similar phonemes rather than the very different
phonemes featured in the previous example (Light & McNaughton, 2012). For example, you
may wish to have a student work on attending to differences in medial (middle) vowel sounds

                                                                        9. Students with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities | 131
in words. In this case, you would use three words that have the same letter sounds except
for the middle sound, such as bug, big, and bag. Notice how each of these words has /b/
as the initial phoneme and /g/ as the final phoneme. Your modeling in this situation would
deliberately draw the child's attention to the change in vowel sound between such similar
words. To assess the student's understanding, you would again give the student three pic-
tures from which to choose that correspond with our words and follow the same process
described above. If you say /b/ /a/ /g/, but the child points to the bug, it indicates that the
student may have trouble attending to the middle sound in the words and would require fur-
ther instruction and practice in this area.

   Students with unique needs may need modifications to the above suggestions. For example,
a student showing considerable difficulties with fine or gross motor skills or vision may need
larger cards with which to work. If a child is having difficulty with the process, be sure that
it is not the physical aspect of the task that is getting in the way. If there are barriers to the
student's participation, think creatively about or consult with others regarding how the task
could be modified so that the child could successfully (but still meaningfully) take part.

   There are numerous other phonemic awareness lessons and activities that can be done to
help students acquire this important literacy skill. Above is just one example of a way in which
to teach and assess phoneme blending. See Table 1 for some other activities that are likely
to be helpful when teaching phonemic awareness. Given the example above, consider how
these activities, too, could be modified so that students with speech and/or motor differ-
ences could participate.

                     Table 1. Phonemic Awareness Activities and Examples

Activities           Examples

Note. If a student does not seem to be able to attend to the phonemes in the words despite
instruction, you may need to start with earlier skills. Provide the student with many opportunities to
play and experiment with more general sounds in language, such as rhymes, syllables, and
alliteration.

Phonics

Phonics is the study and instruction of how letters and combinations of letters represent the
individual sounds (phonemes) in words and how these sounds are blended together to make

132 | 9. Students with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities
words. In the English language, we have 26 letters that are used in various combinations to
represent approximately 44 phonemes. Studies have shown that for students who have dif-
ficulty learning letter-sound correspondences, explicit and systematic phonics instruction is
necessary (NRP, 2000). These studies have mostly been conducted with students who have
learning disabilities; however, the same outcomes have been found in newer research includ-
ing students with ID and DD as well (e.g., Riepl, Marchand-Martella, & Martella, 2008; Lemons,
et al., 2012). Explicit and systematic instruction in phonics means that students are taught
specifically about letter-sound correspondences through carefully planned instruction. The
instruction also includes modeling, along with opportunities for teacher-guided practice,
beginning with those letter-sound correspondences that are most common and useful in
beginning words (e.g., a, s, ch) and proceeding to those that are more complex (e.g., ow, ur, ey,
-tch). Students are not expected to figure out these patterns on their own. To become adept
at using letter-sound correspondences to decode, students must have many opportunities to
practice using letters and letter combinations to represent the sounds of language. There are
many games and activities that can be used with students to help them practice these skills in
an engaging fashion (see Chapter 3 of this textbook for more examples).

      Phonics instruction for students with ID and DD

To decode an unknown word, a child must be able to identify the correct phonemes for each
of its letters, hold the phonemes in memory in the correct order, and then blend the sounds
together to make a word. This can be a challenging task for any beginner but can be partic-
ularly difficult for students with ID and DD because they may have difficulty with short-term
memory and/or initiation of spoken language or movement. For students with short-term
memory difficulties, decoding can be very challenging because the students may have diffi-
culty holding on to the sounds in order while decoding. By the time the students reach the
ends of the words they are trying to figure out, it is common for them to have forgotten
the beginning sounds (WETA Washington, DC, 2007). Additionally, many new learners find it
helpful to sound out words aloud while simultaneously pointing to each letter; however, if a
student cannot produce sounds or point to the letters on a page, decoding can prove quite
a challenge for these reasons as well. These are only some of the issues that may arise that
complicate the decoding process for students with ID and DD, but with creative means, bar-
riers to students' participation in phonics instruction can be reduced.

   For a child who has significant short-term memory difficulties, it is necessary to reduce the
memory load for certain tasks (Allor et al., 2010). For example, when teaching phonics, it is
helpful to begin with simple two-phoneme words, such as at, up, and it. As the child becomes
more adept at decoding these and has practice holding phonemes in his memory, the ability to
decode longer words will likely increase. Further, as time goes on, many students will be able
to "chunk" information that they have learned into retrievable pieces that will lessen the bur-
den on their memories. For example, the blend st in words such as stop and past will become
easily recognizable with practice over time so that a student will not have to deliberately think
about each phoneme (/s/ and /t/) each time it is encountered in a word. That is, the stu-
dent's recognition of the word part will become automatic, and thus allow more attention to
be paid to decoding newer or more difficult letter combinations.

   A method for helping students with short-term memory problems learn to decode is Addi-
tive Sound-by-Sound Blending (Moats & Hall, 2010). In this technique, instead of sounding out
all of the letters in a word in sequential order from left to right, and then blending them
together, which is a typical blending strategy (e.g., /c/ /a/ /t/  /cat/), the letters are
blended one by one as a student moves through the word. The teacher writes the first two

                                                                       9. Students with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities | 133
letters of a given word for the student to see and models how to blend those first two sounds.
The teacher then writes the third letter of the word and demonstrates how to blend the first
two sounds with the third sound. This continues until the last sound is blended and the word
is identified. For example, in the word stop, the teacher would demonstrate how to blend
the word, sound-by-sound, as follows: /s/, /st/, /st/, /stop/. Each time a new letter is
added, the reader starts at the beginning so that he or she has the opportunity to rehearse the
previously blended phonemes as a unit, increasing the likelihood that the phonemes will be
retained in memory when the end of the word is reached. With time, students can be guided
to use this strategy independently.

   For students who have difficulty with speech or movement, it may be necessary to change
instructional materials or the way we ask students to interact with the materials we use for
decoding instruction. It is helpful to increase the font size of traditional print materials if the
fine motor skills required to move from one letter to the next when finger pointing is a chal-
lenge. It may also be helpful to assist students in pointing to each subsequent letter in a word
by gently guiding their hands; however, it is important to make sure that a student is com-
fortable with this approach before attempting it, as some students may be extremely uncom-
fortable with physical touch, and creating discomfort will defeat the purpose of the activity.
If a student has trouble with speech while decoding, we can say the sounds for the student.
As the student points (or you guide the pointing), say each sound as you move through each
grapheme in the printed word. Even though the student is not doing the physical process
independently, with practice, he or she can still learn the concepts necessary to decode words
silently to themselves while reading.

   Students who experience difficulty with short-term memory, speech, and movement may
also benefit from working with various computer programs and tablet/smart phone applica-
tions to practice decoding skills. Numerous programs and applications exist that guide stu-
dents in learning to segment and blend phonemes (e.g. L'Escapadou's Montessori Crosswords,
an application for iPhone/iPad) or that will read unknown words in online stories for stu-
dents, sometimes even breaking up words into their individual phonemes, to demonstrate
how letters represent the sounds of language (e.g., Starfall Education's Starfall-Learn to Read).
The extent to which students can use these programs independently will vary; however, again,
students can interact with the programs with a teacher when guidance is needed. See Table 2
for a list of selected iPhone/iPad applications that specifically target decoding skills.

            Overreliance on memorization

Because students with ID and DD have so often been taught to read by being asked to mem-
orize words, you may encounter students who rely exclusively on this method of word iden-

134 | 9. Students with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities
tification. Although some students have been successful in learning to read to a degree with
this approach, problems arise as students attempt to read more challenging texts. As text dif-
ficulty increases, complicated, unique, and multisyllabic words become more common, and
one needs a reliable decoding strategy to know how to read unknown words (Copeland &
Keefe, 2007). We cannot expect children to simply memorize every word that they may one
day encounter, or we run the risk of relegating them to a minimum level of reading ability.

   When students are used to reading solely or almost solely through the recognition of sight
words, it can be difficult to teach them to rely on letter-sound correspondences to decode
words. This author once worked with a student who had memorized so many words, she
could read nearly fluently at the fourth-grade level. However, the student had no strategy
for identifying unknown words beyond looking at the first letter of a word and guessing.
Despite this student's ability to recognize certain lengthy words by sight, she could not
decode unknown words with more than two letters. Interestingly, she could not practice
newly learned letter patterns with simple words such as bat or hug, as she had memorized all
of them, and therefore did not have to use her new decoding skills to read them. To encour-
age the student to use phonics knowledge to decode words, the student had to be instructed
with non-words (or nonsense words) such as lig or rup. These words had not been memorized
so she had to make use of her knowledge of phonics to figure them out. With this information,
the student could eventually be taught to use the decoding strategies to figure out longer,
unknown real words such as ex/pect or mis/trust.

Comprehension and Vocabulary

The main purpose of reading is to comprehend a text's message or meaning. It is not enough
to be able to decode the words on a page if those words do not mean anything to the reader.
Decoding is an important aspect of learning to read because to independently read text, we
must first be able to identify the words on a page before we can understand them; however,
there is much more to reading than word identification.

   When strong readers read, they think about what they are reading (Harvey & Goudvis, 2000;
Snow, 2002). They pay attention to the message of the text. When reading fiction, strong
readers consider the actions of the characters, they relate those actions to their experiences,
they weigh those actions against their own values, and they make predictions about what
might happen next. Strong readers do not do this consciously; it just seems to happen, and
is a part of the enjoyment of the reading process. However, interacting with the text in such
a way is also an imperative part of making sense of the story. When weighing a character's
choices, we develop understandings of that character, including understandings that may not
be specifically outlined in the text. For example, from attending to a character's choices, we
can determine whether the character is good or evil, or careful or impulsive. So much of
what we understand from the text comes from thinking deeply about the reading (Pressley &
Afflerbach, 1995). Strong readers also pay attention to whether or not what they are reading
makes sense. When strong readers come across a sentence they do not understand, they may
track back, wondering if something was misread. They may take note of vocabulary they do
not know and make a decision about how to proceed (e.g., look up the word, use context to
define the word, skip the word having gotten the gist of the idea).

   It is sometimes thought that readers will automatically comprehend a text's meaning once
they have learned to decode words, but this is not always the case for students with or with-
out disabilities (Donin, 2004). Many students need instruction in learning how to think about
what they read and how to monitor their own thinking. That is, they must learn how to

                                                                       9. Students with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities | 135
become metacognitive about their reading and reading processes. Much research has been
conducted and many activities created to address this learning need with students (see Chap-
ter 4 for more discussion on this topic).

      Comprehension and vocabulary instruction for students with ID and DD

Students with ID and DD bring some extra challenges when learning to comprehend text. For
example, students who have difficulty with working memory, which is the ability to mentally
hold and manipulate information, will often have trouble remembering what they have read,
so giving them strategies to maintain information in memory is important. Students with lan-
guage delays and language processing difficulties might have trouble understanding certain
vocabulary. In addition, a number of students, particularly those with ASD, may have trouble
making inferences if they interpret language at a literal level (Kluth & Chandler-Olcott, 2008).
In addressing these skills, students should have the opportunity to read, listen to, and work
with quality literature and other texts that are age-appropriate, though it may be necessary
to modify some aspects of the texts based on student need (Browder, Trela, & Jiminez, 2007).
It is also important to note that students with ID and DD might have trouble expressing or
demonstrating their understanding, which can be misinterpreted as lack of comprehension
(Kluth & Chandler-Olcott, 2008).

   Recent research suggests that teaching students with ID and DD strategies to monitor
their own comprehension (i.e., to become metacognitive) can be helpful (Hudson & Test, 2011;
Whalon & Hanline, 2008). One way to achieve this is to conduct frequent think-alouds when
reading aloud to your students (Harvey & Goudvis, 2000; Doanay Bilgi & Özmen, 2014). Dur-
ing think-alouds, teachers stop reading at certain points to explain their own thinking and
how they are figuring out what is going on or how they are responding to the story. For exam-
ple, during a fiction read-aloud, teachers might stop to make a prediction about what might
happen next. They would be explicit in talking about what was noticed in the story that has
caused them to make the prediction. Similarly, for students who have difficulty with making
inferences, teachers can stop at predetermined points in the text, draw students' attention
to certain clues (e.g., a character's described expression or behavior), and specifically explain
how such clues can help tell us about the characters. Students can be asked to actively par-
ticipate during think-alouds as well. For example, you might ask the students, "What kind of
face might someone make if he or she is up to something sneaky?" The students could then
be encouraged to make a "sneaky" face, and then you could bring their attention to where the
text refers to a "sly smile" or "shifty eyes."

   Think-alouds are also helpful ways to guide students in understanding new vocabulary. You
can stop after reading a sentence containing a challenging word and describe to the students
how you use context to figure out the word's meaning. You can also just stop and discuss
an interesting word and encourage students to use it throughout the day. Notice how think-
alouds do not require any reading to be done by the students. This is a perfect example of how
to get students who are currently non-readers to interact meaningfully in literacy and work
on higher-level skills.

   Another way to work with students on comprehension is to get students actively involved
in conversations around text that they have read. One way to do this is through Reciprocal
Teaching (Palincsar & Brown, 1984). In Reciprocal Teaching, students read and then in groups
take part in discussion by predicting what will happen next, generating questions about the
text, clarifying difficult parts, and summarizing what they have read. Students in such groups
take one of these strategies and become the groups' "clarifier," "summarizer," or other role. For
example, the clarifier might explain the meaning of a challenging vocabulary word identified

136 | 9. Students with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities
by the questioner and share strategies for figuring it out. Students with ID and DD may ben-
efit from a modified form of Reciprocal Teaching (Lundberg & Reichenberg, 2013) where texts
are broken into smaller portions and where students work together on one strategy at a time.
Teachers can scaffold the students' strategy usage by teaching them to begin questions with
question words (e.g., who, what, where) or begin summarizing sentences with a simple set of
sequencing words (e.g., first, then, last). When providing instruction in inclusive groups, such
modifications can be provided as well for any students who need them.

   Students with ID and DD may also need explicit instruction around concepts and vocabu-
lary terms to increase their comprehension (Knight, Spooner, Browder, Smith, & Wood, 2013).
To teach concepts and vocabulary explicitly, Knight et al. suggest beginning with a topic (e.g.,
photosynthesis, civil rights, deforestation) and then choosing a set of words needed for com-
prehension of the given topic. Each of these words would then be taught individually, mak-
ing definitions concrete by offering pictures or other visuals in the explanation and providing
the students with both examples and non-examples of the terms. For instance, in teach-
ing the term precipitation, Knight et al. incorporated pictures of clouds with rain and clouds
alone. They specifically explained how only the clouds with the rain "counted" as precipita-
tion. These authors also used graphic organizers to show the relationships between the set of
words being taught, for example, placing the words precipitation, condensation, and evapora-
tion on simple drawings of scenes with clouds and rain or snow, and using arrows to describe
how one term led to the next. Students were then guided in their own completion of the
graphic organizers.

Fluency

Another important aspect in improving comprehension is to attain fluency in reading. When
a person reads with fluency, he or she can recognize words automatically, read at an appro-
priate pace, attend to punctuation so that reading sounds like speech, known as prosody
(Rasinski, 2012), and maintain these skills throughout the length of a text, known as endurance
(Deeney, 2010). Being able to read fluently allows for greater comprehension because less
effort is needed in decoding the text, and therefore, more attention can be directed toward
making sense of the text (Griffith & Rasinski, 2004; NRP, 2000). A common way to assess stu-
dents' fluency is to measure their oral reading fluency (ORF), which involves counting the
number of words a student can correctly read in a minute. There are general guidelines for
expected oral reading rates of student by instructional grade level. For example, the average
fluency score for students in the middle of first grade is reading 23 words correct per minute
(WCPM). This increases to about 53 for average readers by the end of first grade (Hasbrouck
& Tindal, 2006).

      Fluency instruction for students with ID and DD

Measures of ORF have been used to assess the fluency rate and fluency growth of students
with ID and ASD, and such measures are appropriate when students' disabilities do not inter-
fere with fluent speech. For students who do not have reliable speech or for whom the
physical act of speaking creates difficulty, ORF is not likely to be the best measure of these
students' reading fluency. Remember, the purpose of achieving fluency in reading is not to be
a great oral reader, per se, but to read easily enough that there is thorough comprehension of
the text. A student may not be able to read fluently aloud, but this does not mean that he or
she cannot process text fluently in her mind. How do we know if students are reading fluently
during silent reading if we cannot hear them read? Certainly determining this can be tricky,

                                                                       9. Students with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities | 137
but it can be done. The Qualitative Reading Inventory-5 (Leslie & Caldwell, 2011) provides pas-
sages for which both ORF and silent reading fluency (SRF) can be determined. In giving an SRF
assessment, a student's reading is timed, and the evaluator asks the student to indicate when
he or she is finished, and the number of words per minute can be calculated. To be sure that
the student has actually processed the text, you can ask the student to respond (through AAC
or other means) to a quick literal comprehension question or two.

   The downside to using SRF measures is that you will not get the same information about the
types of struggles the student is having in decoding words or in phrasing that an oral reading
fluency measure would provide, since you cannot hear the student read. Therefore, deciding
which measures to use will be a matter of thinking critically about the students' needs and
what precisely it is you are trying to assess. For example, for a student with some reliable
speech, it might make sense to have the student do a short read aloud for which you can do
an analysis of her mistakes, and then provide the silent reading task to assess silent reading
fluency.

   There is, of course, more to fluency than assessment. Once we have determined students'
reading rates, we will need to provide appropriate instruction. If a student's rate is low, he or
she may need more instruction in identifying words accurately and automatically. Therefore,
interventions in decoding and recognition of irregularly spelled words will likely be beneficial.
However, as discussed, fluency encompasses more than accurate decoding. For any student,
with or without disabilities, providing a model of fluent reading is important (Griffith & Rasin-
ski, 2004). Students must be given the opportunity to hear books and other texts read aloud
by expert readers to begin to understand how fluent reading should sound.

   Another way to provide instruction in fluency to students with ID and DD is to have stu-
dents reread texts after providing corrective feedback on areas in need of growth (Hua et al.,
2012). Begin by having students read a text at their highest instructional reading levels (i.e.,
the highest reading level at which they can read without frustration and where errors do not
have a strong negative impact on the students' comprehension), taking note of word errors
and timing them. Next, correct the word errors making sure they can correctly identify the
words. Discuss with them what you noticed about their reading. Do they read word by word
or in few-word phrases? Do they attend to punctuation and read with expression? Choose
an area to bring to their attention and explain the adjustment you would like made. Model
the adjustment if necessary. Next, have them reread the same text with the new skill in mind
twice, again making note of word errors and timing them. This method will allow you to keep
track of their WCPM over readings and provide direct instruction related to any particular
areas of need.

   For students who have substantial issues in developing reading fluency or who need to
access texts above their individual reading levels, AAC can be used to provide accommoda-
tions. For example, if a student needs to read a text for a science class that is too difficult for
him or her to read fluently and independently, text-to-speech software can be used to help
that student gain access to the text.

                                    Summary

Until quite recently, students with ID and DD have been taught literacy skills through a func-
tional skills curriculum, and have often not been offered access to instruction to help them
learn to decode words, read with fluency, and comprehend texts. However, recent research
has shown that students with ID and DD can benefit from similar types of research-based
reading instruction that is recommended for students without ID and DD.

138 | 9. Students with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities
   Planning beneficial, appropriately balanced literacy instruction for students with ID and DD
is not easy, but is possible. Educators must be sure not to reduce student learning to only a
basic skills approach, but instead, find a way to incorporate skills into comprehensive liter-
acy learning that includes, among other important aspects, access to quality literature, stu-
dent discussion, and active participation. In addition, educators must be able to think about
all of the needs and abilities their students bring to the table and orchestrate the learning of
each individual child through careful planning and creativity. Educators must also find ways
to break down barriers to students' participation in literacy learning through modifications to
materials and teaching approaches and through the use of AAC as appropriate.

   Questions and Activities

      1. A student with autism is going to join your second grade class. You find out that he does
           not speak and when he is given books, he often tears the pages. Explain why it is important
           to presume competence in his literacy learning abilities, and describe some ways to
           remove barriers from this student's participation in literacy learning.

      2. Create a lesson on early phonemic awareness for a student with short-term memory
           deficits and low vision. Be sure to structure your lesson so that she will get the most out of
           the instruction.

      3. You have a student in your class who reads fluently at grade level; however, when you ask
           her a question about the reading, she seems unable to answer. What are some reasons that
           might explain the student's difficulty in answering? What might you do to determine
           whether her difficulty is due to an issue with reading comprehension, other reasons, or a
           combination of both?

      4. Given the situation in question 3, let's say that you determine that the student is having
           trouble comprehending what she has read. Discuss some ways you can help improve her
           reading comprehension.

on Adolescent Literacy and Instruction

                                                    Elizabeth C. Lewis

                                     Abstract

Using a framework that includes the theories of multiliteracies (The New London Group,
1996), new literacies (Lankshear & Knobel, 2011), and multimodality (Jewitt, 2009; Kress, 2010),
this chapter draws upon findings from qualitative research to provide 1) an examination of
literacy skills and practices commonly associated with adolescence, as well as 2) approaches
to effective literacy instruction for diverse learners at the middle and high school levels. In
addition, this chapter explores the complex nature of defining the term literacy, particularly
as it relates to teaching adolescents essential 21st century skills (e.g., collaborative problem-
solving, multimodal composition) across content areas. Readers will consider how identifying
and valuing the range of literacy practices in which adolescents engage--both within and out-
side of school--can optimize their personal literacy development and academic achievement.
Examples provided throughout this chapter model and invite analysis of the benefits and lim-
itations of incorporating these theories into pedagogy.

   Learning Objectives

        After reading this chapter, readers will be able to

      1. describe the theories of multiliteracies, new literacies, and multimodality as they relate to
           adolescent literacy;

      2. identify the range of diverse literacy skills and practices of adolescent students;
      3. discuss the benefits of and drawbacks to incorporating multiliteracies, new literacies, and

           multimodality into literacy instruction for diverse populations of adolescents;
      4. design learning activities that support and enhance the development of adolescent stu-

           dents' literacy skills through multiple modes and genres.

                                  Introduction

We live in a multimodal world--one in which individuals must have the skills to identify, inter-
pret, analyze, and communicate through a range of modes, media, and symbols. The ways
individuals communicate at home, in school, at work, as well as other public and private places
require them to possess "skills, strategies, and dispositions necessary to successfully use and
adapt to the rapidly changing information and communication technologies and contexts that
continuously emerge in our world and influence all areas of our personal and professional
lives" (Leu, Kinzer, Coiro, & Cammack, 2004, p. 1572). In light of these rapid, constant advance-
ments that require us to adapt our existing skills or adopt new communicative skills, liter-

                                                                                                                                                               143
acy as the ability to read and write traditional, print-based texts needs to be redefined (see
Chapter 1 in this textbook). Street (1995) proposed expanding the term "literacy" from singular
to plural: literacies. This change signifies that literacy is more extensive because the socially
constructed systems of communication found in different cultures are broader than mere
printed language.

   Adolescents exhibit a broad and diverse range of abilities, exceptionalities, backgrounds
and experiences. Increasingly, they are immersed in layered, multimodal experiences through
which they make sense of their lives and the world around them. They negotiate information
and forms of communication--many of which are Internet-based (e.g., newsfeeds, online
social networks)--that will continue to grow in variety and number. These youth engage a
repertoire of new literacy practices to represent identity (e.g., post personal photos on Insta-
gram), develop social connections (e.g., text message with friends), achieve status with others
(e.g., accumulate numerous "friends" on Facebook), and consider their future personal and
professional goals (e.g., follow businesses and other organizations on Twitter). Adolescents
are learning, exercising, and strengthening these skills mostly on their own or with peers, and
not necessarily in school. This suggests they experiment with technology more on their own
than learn about technology from the expertise of others, since adolescents are not neces-
sarily provided with opportunities to engage in these new literacy practices or demonstrate
their levels of proficiency with them in academic settings.

   The ways adolescents use digital tools (e.g., smartphones, computers) are examples of how
more multimodal, out-of-school literacies differ from the more dominant, academic literacies
that students use in school. Moreover, the variety of multimedia sources (the technological
forms that deliver information or entertainment such as film, video, and music) that many
students engage with outside of school may have significant effects on how and what they
learn while in school. Research exploring how youths' out-of-school literacies coexist with
more traditional academic literacies (i.e., print-based reading and writing activities) has been
on the rise (Compton-Lilly, 2012; Hull & Schultz, 2002; Moje & Tysvaer, 2010). Findings suggest
that integrating adolescents' new literacy practices into instruction may align their in- and
out-of-school literacies. Doing so would also enhance teachers' abilities to better 1) address
diverse learning needs and styles, and 2) prepare adolescents for social, academic and profes-
sional success.

   Three theories in particular are helpful to the process of integrating secondary students' in-
and out-of-school literacy practices into instruction. They include multiliteracies, new litera-
cies, and multimodality. In the sections following this introduction, these theories are defined.
Examples drawn from qualitative research studies examining how the theories can be used to
design instruction that supports and enhances literacy development are provided.

                            Multiliteracies Theory

The term multiliteracies was devised by The New London Group (1996), an international group
of scholars from various English-speaking countries who met in New London, New Hamp-
shire in 1994 to discuss the state of literacy teaching. Their ground-breaking work contin-
ues to challenge educators to broaden their perspectives on literacy. Members of this group
argued that more traditional approaches to literacy instruction (those grounded in teaching
students to read and write using print-based texts) do not accommodate the ever-growing
cultural and linguistic diversity that exists world-wide.

   The New London Group asserted it is necessary to develop multiple literacies; individuals
must be able to make meaning from and through the variety of modes (defined by the Group

144 | 10. Twenty-First Century Perspectives
as forms of communication) that continuously appear and shape every aspect of their lives,
every day. Multiple literacies, a cornerstone of multiliteracies theory, include the ability to
communicate through specific forms outlined as visual, aural, gestural, spatial, linguistic,
and numerical (Cope & Kalantzis, 2000). Various national learning standards and guidelines
include goals that reflect multiliteracies theory, for example the National Coalition for Core
Arts Standards (2014); National Council of Teachers of English/International Reading Associ-
ation (2012); Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts & Literacy in History/
Social Studies, Science, and Technical Subjects ([CCSS]; National Governors Association Cen-
ter for Best Practices & Council of Chief State School Officers [NGA & CCSSO], 2010), and
Center of Applied Special Technology, Universal Design for Learning Guidelines (2011).

                           New Literacies Theory

As stated previously, the continued emergence of powerful digital technologies and new
media has led to fundamental shifts in how people read, write, and communicate. New media
often relate to information communication technologies (ICTs). Some examples of new media
include web-based applications for designing presentations such as Prezi and Haiku Deck,
interactive video games like Minecraft, and online social platforms like Twitter and Face-
book. Each new ICT requires new literacy skills for its effective use. The Internet, for example,
requires an increasing skill set related to reading information found on websites, writing email
messages, and posting to blogs (Coiro & Dobler, 2007). Many adolescents spend considerable
time in online social spaces and using multimedia applications on digital devices. These activ-
ities generate an expanding number of new literacies, such as creating and sharing personal
videos using applications like Vine and Vimeo.

   Other definitions of new literacies are even broader and involve reading, interpreting, and
creating a variety of print and non-print texts, including modes often associated with the arts
(Albers & Harste, 2007). Examples of these include photo essays, graphic novels, and spoken
word poetry (see Chapter 7 of this textbook for additional examples). After-school and com-
munity-based programs are growing in popularity and provide students with opportunities to
develop new literacies related to this broader definition (Chappell, 2009; Lewis, 2013; Vasude-
van, Kerr, Hibbert, Fernandez & Park, 2014). Students who participate in such programs may
publish neighborhood newsletters, create sidewalk art, or write for and perform in a local
theater group for youth.

                            Multimodality Theory

Multimodality theory is informed by social semiotics--the field of study related to under-
standing how people construct meaning from signs and symbols in ways that reflect socially-
and culturally-ascribed meanings and practices (Halliday, 1978). Examples of different modes
include photography, dance, computer-based communications, painting, and written lan-
guage. Multimodality specifies that communicating the meaning of an idea so that others will
understand it clearly may not be possible through a single mode alone (Jewitt & Kress, 2003).

   A simple example of constructing meaning from a multimodal text is a television commer-
cial. For a person to understand what a company is promoting about its product through this
medium, he or she must be able to "read" the multiple modes comprising it. These modes may
include written and spoken language, gestures made by actors, music, the spatial design of
the setting and/or graphics included in the commercial. It is the interplay between the modes

                                                                                                     10. Twenty-First Century Perspectives | 145
and how one processes their meanings that helps him or her understand the commercial's
sales pitch.

   Consider another example from the academic realm: even a hard-bound textbook, a more
traditional form of printed text, may be multimodal if it contains visuals such as photographs,
drawings, or other forms of illustrations. This same textbook may likely have been printed to
meet certain standards of page layout, adding to the visual quality of the text. Thus, even a
textbook can demonstrate the significance of multimodality as it pertains to communicating
information.

   Why These Theories Matter in the Design of Adolescent
                             Literacy Instruction

New technologies and forms of communication promote multimodality; adolescents' out-of-
school literacy practices are increasingly varied, digitally-based, and multimodal. In light of
this reality, "important changes will be needed in schooling, in teachers, and, especially, in
educational beliefs about the status/design of non-print modes as ways of understanding
knowledge and representing meaning" (Miller, Thompson, Lauricella, Boyd & McVee, 2012, p.
116). This statement implies that in the formal school setting, students are often restricted
to engaging in literacy practices centered on traditional print-based texts rather than a vari-
ety that would fortify their multiple literacies. Yet, the dominance of the book as the central
medium of communication is becoming replaced by the governance of the screen in schools
and beyond (Kress, 2010). Educators cannot discount this shift in modality. Instead, the the-
ories discussed in this chapter provide a way for teachers to consider how new technologies
and multimodal texts may be included in adolescents' academic learning experiences in ways
to meet their diverse learning needs, styles, and abilities effectively.

        Implementing Multiliteracies, New Literacies, and
         Multimodality in Adolescent Literacy Instruction

In this section, you will learn how the theories of multiliteracies, new literacies, and multi-
modality can be incorporated into designing instruction that supports and enhances the lit-
eracy skills and practices of secondary students. Examples from a variety of subject areas are
provided in order to show the multi- and inter-disciplinary possibilities of this approach.

   As a way of framing each case included in this chapter, here is a list of general considera-
tions teachers should keep in mind prior to and while planning lessons:

  · Outline content and skills students will learn.
  · Identify curricular goals and learning objectives to be addressed and assessed.
  · Accommodate students' diverse cultural, linguistic, and ability-related competencies--as

      well as their learning needs--when choosing resources and designing activities/assign-
      ments.
  · Collect information about students' out-of-school literacy practices and integrate them
      into learning activities, assignments, and assessments.
  · Consider which resources and materials are available (e.g., technology, art supplies) for
      use and which might be necessary to borrow or purchase.

                      Literacies, and Multimodality

Alvermann (2012) asserts that the line between "high culture" (e.g., reading canonical works
like Shakespearean plays, attending an opera) and "low culture"--a term representing "popular
culture" (e.g., reading comic books, listening to pop music on the radio) has blurred (p. 214).
She proposes reconsidering the idea that a clear-cut division between formal and informal
learning exists. As such, research findings suggest that out-of- and in-school literacy prac-
tices co-exist within classroom settings (Sefton-Green, 2013). Instruction that connects aca-
demic content to multimodal forms of popular culture--those in which students are likely
familiar--has the potential to increase their content knowledge learning. In turn, this instruc-
tional alignment with learning standards enhances students' college and career readiness by
supporting their ability to acquire and share knowledge across varied forms of communica-
tion necessary to succeed in both the classroom and workplace (NGA & CCSSO, 2010).

   An approach to supporting adolescents' development of literacy skills while attending to
their learning needs can take many forms. One is to integrate video excerpts (e.g., television
shows, documentaries) into instruction as a way of tapping into students' prior knowledge
when introducing new concepts. A second is to have students make connections between
academic content and popular music by having them listen to songs and analyze how song
lyrics relate to what they are learning. A third is for students to learn concepts or skills
through multiple modes such as visual arts, performance, or poetry. Yet another is to have
students view and analyze the distinctive style of a TED Talk, the presentation format used
by individuals affiliated with the organization Technology, Entertainment, Design (TED;
www.ted.com). The following examples of secondary educators' classroom experiences illus-
trate these methods (all teachers' names are pseudonyms).

English Language Arts

This first example comes from an eleventh grade English language arts class taught by a
teacher named Alicia Dowling. Part of Alicia's curriculum for this class is an instructional unit
on memoir and oral storytelling. To introduce this unit to her students, Alicia first discusses
elements of the personal narrative genre with them. Then, in addition to reading and ana-
lyzing written pieces by authors Sherman Alexie, Maya Angelou, and Elie Wiesel, students
study the genre of oral storytelling. The aim of this two-fold approach is to provide stu-
dents with the opportunity to share their own personal narratives in both written and spoken
form. To provide structure for helping them accomplish the latter, Alicia uses videos found
on YouTube.com to show a variety of oral storytelling methods individuals employ to share
personal narratives. While watching each video, students independently complete a work-
sheet designed to help them evaluate the degree to which the clip reflects elements of the
personal narrative genre (e.g., focuses on a significant event, includes vivid description). They
then participate in a whole-class discussion about all of the clips viewed and their assess-
ments of them.

   In the next phase of this unit, students compose their own personal narratives to be shared
in both written and oral form. Several drafts of each student's work undergo both peer- and
teacher-review. While they complete their final, type-written drafts, Alicia prepares students
for the oral storytelling of their narrative in two ways. First, for one class period students par-
ticipate in improvisational exercises co-led by Alicia's colleague who teaches drama classes
at the school. This instructional strategy draws upon multiliteracies theory in that it helps
students develop critical gestural, spatial, viewing, speaking and listening skills. Second, stu-

                                                                                                     10. Twenty-First Century Perspectives | 147
dents video record themselves reading their personal narratives, review the recording, and
complete a formal written self-assessment of their performance. To fulfill this requirement,
students can use their own devices (e.g., smartphone, computer) or borrow a digital camera
provided by the school. They transfer the video recording to a flash drive or DVD--both are
provided to students if needed--and submit it along with their self-assessment.

   Once Alicia provides students with feedback on their recording and self-evaluation, the
instructional unit concludes with students performing their personal narratives in class
through oral storytelling. In the spirit of using methods traditional to this form, Alicia encour-
ages them to memorize their work so they can focus on elements of performance, but memo-
rization is not a requirement; students are permitted to use note cards or read from a printed
copy of their story. This consideration is grounded in Alicia's recognition that her students'
levels of ability and comfort with speaking publicly, particularly about their personal experi-
ences, vary widely.

   From Alicia's perspective, incorporating multimedia texts into her unit on memoir and sto-
rytelling is essential to enhancing her ability to teach these concepts to students, as well as
their ability to learn them. The use of video clips from YouTube.com provides students with
the opportunity to view, assess, and discuss elements of personal narrative and oral story-
telling in ways that reading print-based examples alone may not provide. Moreover, using
visual texts like these supports the literacy skill development of diverse students, such as stu-
dents who are resistant but otherwise able readers, and those identified as having an educa-
tional disability (e.g., learning disability).

   In addition, requiring students to video record themselves reading their personal narra-
tives, and then evaluate their recordings, is critical to their development of literacy skills
in two key ways. First, students must engage in new literacy practices using digital tools.
Whether they are familiar with these kinds of technology or not, possessing skills related to
them is (and will increasingly be) necessary for personal, academic, and professional pur-
poses. Second, in consideration of all three theories underpinning this chapter, having stu-
dents analyze a visual text of their own creation serves to enhance literacy skills related to
reading, viewing, listening, speaking, and spatiality.

Art

This second curricular example is from a seventh grade art class taught by David Pelham.
David teaches an eight-week instructional unit centered on the essential question: How
can we represent who we are through art? Essential questions "aim to stimulate thought, to
provoke inquiry, and to spark more questions" and therefore promote the development of
evaluative and critical thought (Wiggins & McTighe, 2005, p. 106). David firmly asserts that
providing opportunities for students to make connections between their lives and art helps
them acquire content knowledge in his and other subject areas to greater depth and breadth.
Over the course of the eight weeks his students learn about key elements of art and design
(i.e., color, shape, texture) while producing what he calls an "identity collage" which serves as
a final project. The goal of the identity collage is for students to create a visual text that rep-
resents who they are to those who view it.

   Traditionally, collage is an art form derived from the French verb coller meaning to paste
or glue. Collages are created by fastening any variety of different materials onto a canvas
in a free-form artistic expression of a theme, idea, person, and/or experience. Because the
process of designing a collage does not have a formal, rigid set of rules to which one must
adhere, it thereby "lends itself to a freeing sense of experimentation and play" (Hafeli, 2015, p.

148 | 10. Twenty-First Century Perspectives
148). David's choice of this form for the project stems from the rich opportunity to experiment
with the artistic elements it provides his students. As such, they choose from a wide assort-
ment of supplies to create their identity collages using poster board as the canvas. Materials
include words and images cut or torn out from magazines, newspapers, and brochures; pic-
tures downloaded and printed from websites; stickers; photographs; self-created sketches,
paintings, and/or drawings; fabric; and glitter and sequins.

   In the first phase of the unit, David has students write informal, short-length responses
to a series of prompts aimed at helping them brainstorm specific aspects of their identity.
They write about their personality traits, memorable experiences, cultural background, family
history, likes/dislikes, talents, hopes, dreams, fears, values, and beliefs. Though it may seem
unconventional to introduce the genre of personal writing into art instruction, David views
this series of responses as a blueprint to help students design their collages; these written
responses guide the process of choosing which aspects of their identity they wish to repre-
sent, as well as the materials they feel will do so most effectively.

   In his next phase of instruction, David shows students segments of Internet videos that
highlight collage art and artists. For example, David provides an overview of this art form
by having students watch a brief introductory video entitled Amazing Collage Art by Derek
Gores. In the video, artist Derek Gores describes to viewers the basic approach he takes
to create collages and demonstrates techniques that others can use in their own design
processes. At the video's conclusion, David asks his students to summarize verbally the main
ideas related to collage as an art form presented by Gores. David then shows excerpts of other
online videos (Start to Finish: Collage Art Journal Page Process Video, Art Journal Page: Collage
with Magazine Cutouts, and Collage Perspectives at Swarthmore College) that model the free-
dom in and variety of creating pieces in this art form.

   To help students decide on the different techniques they will use to create their collages,
David facilitates a shared inquiry activity based on the series of videos they viewed. The
method of shared inquiry promotes interpretive and critical thinking skills through the posing
of three distinct types of questions about a text: factual, interpretive, and evaluative. Follow-
ing this model of instruction's basic framework, David first asks questions requiring students
to recall the attributes of collage that they learned about (factual). Next, he poses questions
that invite students to infer the meaning behind what the artists state about the art form in
general as well as their own artistic creations, specifically (interpretive). Finally, David asks his
students higher-level, probing questions that require them to assess artists' points compara-
tively through their own beliefs and perspectives (evaluative).

   As his students move into the hands-on phase of the unit, David engages them in small
group and whole class discussions about how characteristics of different materials convey a
variety of ideas, experiences, moods, and feelings. For instance, David asks his class to share
points of view about what the color "blue" in all its different shades might be used to com-
municate or symbolize. Contributions nearly always include "the sky," "the ocean," "sadness,"
and feeling "peaceful." This kind of collaborative learning experience provides students with
the opportunity to develop and exercise key decision-making strategies related to the design
process like choosing materials based on colors, textures, and images.

   When the identity collages are complete, students share their work with each other
through a variation of the cooperative learning strategy known as a gallery walk. Students
take turns presenting their artwork to small groups of their classmates who travel around
the classroom to view and talk about their pieces with each other. David explains that this
approach fosters students' development of several essential literacy skills including the ability
to interpret, analyze, and discuss a variety of texts. Furthermore, his focus on providing stu-

                                                                                                     10. Twenty-First Century Perspectives | 149
dents with opportunities to develop explicit literacy skills is complemented by his attention to
ensuring they meet national core arts standards. Accordingly, David expects his students will
be able to "synthesize and relate knowledge and personal experience to make art" (National
Coalition for Core Arts Standards, 2014, p. 13) by the end of the instructional unit on collage.

Social Studies

The next examples are from an eighth grade U.S. History class. Social studies educator Marie
Simon finds that it can be difficult for students to comprehensively understand the impor-
tance of historical events and the individuals involved in them. She attributes this to the
feelings of detachment often exhibited by students who perceive the content information to
be static and disconnected from their lives. To enhance her students' learning, Marie often
includes multimodal resources such as video "vignettes" and songs in her lessons. In one case,
to help her students understand the impact that several noteworthy figures had on the Indus-
trial Period in the United States, she shows them several short excerpts from the History
Channel's series, The Men Who Built America. Marie notes that her students gain a clearer
understanding of the influences people like Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, and Henry
Ford had on the United States' emergence as a global manufacturing giant from watching the
series. By comparing summative assessment results (e.g., end-of-unit tests), she concludes
that learning content through a variety of multimodal, multimedia texts and strategies opti-
mizes students' enduring understanding more than traditional textbook-based learning alone.

   In another example, Marie implements two key strategies to enhance her students' literacy
skills and content knowledge acquisition while learning about Westward Expansion in the U.S.
in the 1800s. First, students participate in a simulation pertaining to the Transcontinental
Railroad. Dividing her class into two teams, Marie has students "build" the railroad themselves
using paper, scissors, tape and other materials. Each team starts from opposite ends of the
expansive hallway outside of the classroom to lay "tracks" across the floor in order to achieve
the objective of joining its half of the railway with that of the other team. To experience how
difficult it was to engineer the construction of the Railroad across such an expanse of land
given the severely limited means of communication at that time in history, students are only
permitted to speak to those on their own team; they are not allowed to communicate or work
with members of the opposite team. Marie explains that this activity requires students to
employ essential skills related to reading, speaking, listening, problem-solving, and collabora-
tion consistent with multiliteracies.

   Marie's second instructional strategy facilitates students' development of critical literacy
(McLaren, 1994). Briefly, critical literacy relates to one's ability to analyze texts from varied
perspectives in order to recognize whose experiences and points-of-view are included within
them, whose are excluded, and what the social, historical, and political implications of such
inclusions and exclusions are. To illustrate, in order to complement what they have learned
about the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad, students listen to the American folk
song, I've Been Working on the Railroad. Next, they read its lyrics and analyze how the song
illuminates both positive and controversial aspects of this historical time period in the U.S.
Specifically, students analyze how the lyrics 1) represent the day-to-day exhausting work that
comprised the experience of building the extensive railway system but also 2) signify racism
toward African American laborers working to construct it.

   Marie's attention to students' multiple literacies and incorporation of multimodal texts into
her teaching further demonstrates how doing so can support adolescents' development of
literacy skills essential to their learning. Infusing video excerpts, simulations, and songs into

150 | 10. Twenty-First Century Perspectives
instruction can enhance students' content knowledge acquisition more deeply than using
only traditional, print-based texts and materials (e.g., textbooks, worksheets). In turn, this
approach serves to augment literacy skill development of students for whom learning through
traditional texts and materials presents significant difficulties like, for example, English lan-
guage learners or individuals with a sensory impairment (e.g., low vision or blindness).

Science

Evan Roberts, a high school physics teacher, often begins his lessons with a short one- to
two-minute excerpt from popular television series such as the Discovery Channel's Myth
Busters and the History Channel's Top Gear. In his perspective, having students view a
physics-related concept in a real world situation like those demonstrated in episodes from
these and similar series provides them with the opportunity to develop literacy skills critical
to their learning. Evan chooses excerpts that illustrate concepts such as mechanical energy
and Newton's Laws of Motion. After watching these excerpts, Evan's students participate in a
range of learning activities related to the content presented in the video clips.

   For example, to introduce the concept of velocity Evan uses a Myth Busters excerpt that
presents a scenario addressing the question: Which will drop faster, a bullet fired or a bullet
dropped? Students complete a Think-Pair-Share activity immediately after watching the video
excerpt. Initially, students individually think of answers to a short set of questions prompting
them to describe what they viewed. Then, in pairs, students use their answers and knowledge
of physics to brainstorm hypotheses about the scenario presented in the clip. Finally, a whole
class discussion in which each pair shares its hypothesis provides students with the opportu-
nity to hone essential skills related to listening, speaking, and thinking analytically while con-
sidering the plausibility of each.

   Evan capitalizes on his students' interests in popular television shows by incorporating
them into his teaching. He finds that students are more highly engaged when concepts are
introduced through a short video segment and that the visual representation itself also pro-
vides an important scaffold for what is usually the next phase of his lessons: a hands-on
experiment conducted by the students. Working in small groups, Evan's students design and
carry out an experiment to investigate the hypotheses devised during the Think-Pair-Share
activity. Groups use materials including construction paper, duct tape, markers, and yard-
sticks to create ramps down which ball bearings can be rolled and their speed/distance
measured. Utilizing technology provided by the school, students record and analyze their
experiments with GoPro digital cameras. In the final stage of this lesson, Evan and his class
debrief about the experiment and its results.

   This example demonstrates how incorporating multimedia texts can support the develop-
ment of literacy skills critical to adolescents' learning processes. Specifically, consider how
having students 1) view a video excerpt of a real world example of a physics concept, 2) col-
laborate with classmates to devise hypotheses about it, 3) evaluate the hypotheses collec-
tively, then 4) design experiments and debrief on the tested hypotheses provides a chance
to apply content knowledge authentically, demonstrate higher engagement, and synthesize
ideas arguably more significantly than textbook-based instruction alone.

                            Final Considerations

The instructional decisions and inclusions that Alicia, David, Marie, and Evan made while
designing their lessons exemplify how the theories of multiliteracies, new literacies, and mul-

                                                                                                      10. Twenty-First Century Perspectives | 151
timodality can support the literacy skill development of adolescents who have a diverse range
of learning needs, styles, and abilities. In addition, it is important to note that teachers should
consider several factors if they plan on implementing this framework in their own instruc-
tional design processes. Some are discussed below.

   First, it is critical to have knowledge of the degree to which students have access to digital
tools and technology outside of school. A common false assumption is that all students in
classes have access to computers at home or own smart devices (e.g., cell phones, electronic
tablets). Closely related to the first consideration, teachers must also understand their stu-
dents' levels of access to, as well as familiarity and competence with, the kinds of technol-
ogy they wish to incorporate into their pedagogy. In the English language arts example, Alicia
made sure that all of her students were capable of using the device of their choice to record
themselves reading their personal narratives. In addition, she ensured all students knew the
process they needed to follow in order to transfer the recording to flash drive or DVD; those
who were unsure met with her after school or during a free class period so she could teach
them how to do so. Also, it is essential that educators provide uniform access to technological
tools and resources--and, therefore, the means with which to gain experience and skills using
them--to all students. These opportunities are all the more critical for students who have lim-
ited or no access to such resources, and the school setting may be the only place they gain
such exposure and experience.

   Another consideration essential for teachers is to consider their own levels of comfort and
competence with digital tools and technology. All four teachers described in this chapter
were familiar with and felt confident using a variety of technology including computers, dig-
ital cameras, and web-based resources. Not all educators may feel as self-assured or capable
with these kinds of multimodal/media resources; however, instead of excluding instructional
strategies, activities, and assignments that require related skills and materials, deciding to
incorporate them can provide a valuable opportunity to connect with students through their
out-of-school literacy practices. Inviting students to share their knowledge of and expertise
with new and digital technologies provides them with a chance to share the authoritative role
in the classroom and cultivates an authentic community of learners.

   With regard to resources available through schools, addressing multiliteracies, new litera-
cies, and multimodality in instructional design need not require abundant and the most up-
to-date technological advancements. In Evan's case, his school district was able to provide
GoPro cameras, an example of state-of-the-art technology, for classroom use; however, in
David's case, though he used video excerpts of artists discussing and demonstrating collage to
model this art form for his students, their final projects were nearly exclusively comprised of
art-based materials. These examples emphasize that when educators incorporate these the-
oretical constructs into their instruction using a variety of strategies and materials--including
those that require no technology--the potential to enhance literacy instruction for adoles-
cents is significant. Teaching and learning objectives should drive educators' decisions about
which materials and resources are most appropriate to implement. Additional examples of
modifications illustrating how these three theories can be incorporated into instruction are
included in Table 1.

                                    Summary

This chapter explored adolescent literacy and literacy instruction from a 21st century per-
spective. The three theories of multiliteracies, new literacies, and multimodality underpinned
the information and analyses presented. The point that nearly all aspects of life--personal,

152 | 10. Twenty-First Century Perspectives
social, academic and professional--will be increasingly influenced by new technologies and
literacy skills related to them is clear, and therefore, educators must consider instructional
practices that will best prepare students for present and future success.

   In combination, the three theories described in this chapter are a useful framework with
which to design effective literacy instruction for adolescents. Multiliteracies theory offers the
perspective that as new technologies and literacy practices emerge, they require a growing
variety of skills--many of which have yet to be considered. The theory of new literacies pro-
vides a complementary lens through which students' out-of-school literacy practices--partic-
ularly ones related to forms of popular culture--should be examined. Consequently, educators
should find relevant ways to include them in the teaching and learning that occurs in their
classrooms. Multimodality theory provides a context that represents day-to-day life as an on-
going process of comprehending and communicating through the countless, prevalent modes
we encounter. Finally, teachers should consider the range of strategies and resources avail-
able to them to incorporate into their literacy instruction.

Note. The learning standards listed for each example have specific title indicators that range in
complexity of what they signify. The standard for physical education is the simplest in that it is
stated as "Standard 3" and "3.7," respectively. The standard for family and consumer sciences
(FSDN1.c.18.h) is more complex and designates the following information: FS = the discipline
addressed (i.e., Foundation Standard), DN = the content area (i.e., Diagnostic Services), 1 = the
specific standard indicating the knowledge or skill students are expected to acquire, c = a
restatement of the specific standard in terminology more applicable to instructional planning, 1 =
performance indicator to measure the degree the standard has been met, and h = the grade band
(high school).
a School district policies on students' use of Internet-based instructional resources and digital
platforms (like those listed here) should be consulted during the process of choosing one for this
kind of project.

Questions and Activities

1. Create a personal inventory of (a) your learning needs/styles, and (b) the multimodality and
    new literacies you encounter in your daily life. Over the course of a day, keep a list of what
    you read, write, view, say, hear, and do that can be categorized as multimodal as you
    understand the term after reading this chapter. Examples could include websites you visit,
    advertisements you read, and even meetings you attend. After you have completed the list,
    read it and do the following:

154 | 10. Twenty-First Century Perspectives
              Identify patterns of multimodality across texts, actions, words, images, etc.
              Analyze the literacy skills and practices you employed in order to understand and

                 communicate information across contexts (e.g., social, academic, professional).
              Reflect on where you learned the skills and practices you enacted related to the previ-

                 ous bullet point. Was it in school, at home, in the workplace? In addition, from whom
                 or what did you learn them--family members, friends, teachers, popular culture (e.g.,
                 movies, celebrities, music videos)?
              Finally, which of your literacy skills and practices would you categorize to be your
                 strongest and/or those you engage in most frequently over the course of a day (and
                 weakest/engage in least)? Which ones would be privileged--and which discounted--in
                 the traditional school setting? For any or all of your answers here, is this fair practice?
                 Why or why not?

      2. Conduct an interview with an adolescent to learn about his or her (a) learning needs/
           styles, and (b) in- and out-of-school literacy practices/skills. This could be a friend, relative
           in your family, or even a student in a school setting in which you work or study. Devise six
           to eight questions that you believe will generate discussion about the reading, writing, lis-
           tening, speaking, viewing and representing he or she does in daily life. If appropriate, try
           having him or her use some of the analyzing and categorizing strategies outlined in the
           previous activity. Write up a summary of the interview, and then compare what you have
           learned about adolescent literacy skills/practices to the personal inventory you created.

      3. Choose a concept from your content area to plan a lesson you could implement in a middle
           or high school level class. Use the two criteria below to incorporate elements of multilit-
           eracies, new literacies, and multimodality into the instructional design:

              Choose one to two multimodal texts that could support/enhance students' content
                 knowledge acquisition and development of literacy skills while considering a diverse
                 range of abilities, exceptionalities, and backgrounds. Consider videos, songs, Internet-
                 based resources, and artwork.

              Design a learning activity that draws upon students' out-of-school literacy practices in
                 ways that will enhance their understanding of content information and increase their
                 levels of engagement, motivation, and participation (e.g., translating an excerpt from a
                 classic piece of literature into text message form or a Facebook post).

              Create an assignment that requires students to employ multiple literacy skills to com-
                 plete it, such as reading an article about a topic, conducting an Internet search to find
                 and write up supplemental information about it, and create an artistic representation
                 of what he or she learned to be shared with the class.

as a Reader

                                                 Bryan Ripley Crandall

                                     Abstract

The chapter addresses effective practices for teaching writing in middle and secondary
schools and offers a framework for thinking about writing assignments through content,
design, and language conventions, with emphasis on purpose, audience, and idea develop-
ment. The chapter will enable readers to understand school-based writing assignments by
asking, "In what ways do people in my content area write, and how can in-school writing
assignments best provide real-world opportunities?" The chapter makes an argument that for
students to attain meaningful outcomes related to writing, they need to develop their skills
within a community of writers.

   Learning Objectives

        After reading this chapter, readers will be able to

      1. establish language used by educators for discussing the teaching of writing;
      2. describe ways that written genres make communication possible;
      3. highlight the importance of purpose, audience, and idea development when teaching writ-

           ing;
      4. discuss writing as an activity requiring students to be motivated to reach specific out-

           comes through tools, rules, division of labor, and community;
      5. identify several effective practices for writing instruction.

                                  Introduction

A wise writing teacher in Syracuse, New York, Mark Austin, tells students, "Writing is a foreign
language to everyone" (personal communication). Mr. Austin teaches in a diverse high school
where multiple languages are spoken. Many young people arrive to his class with varied com-
munication skills, and more often than not, they are not the traditional language skills val-
ued in standard curricula or assessments. Although most people are born with the potential
to communicate and to express their ideas, writing is indeed a foreign language to every-
one because it is not instinctive and must be learned. This is especially true for the ability to
write in school settings, which serves as an important gateway to achievement in the Western
world.

   In the words of cultural critic and historian Henry Louis Gates (1986/2006), writing has
"stood alone among the fine arts as the most salient repository of `genius,' the visible sign of
reason itself. In this subordinate role, however, writing, although secondary to reason, is nev-

158
ertheless the medium of reason's expression" (p. 217). In other words, those who write have
the power to influence others, including employers, supervisors, teachers, business leaders,
politicians, and financial agents. Being able to write well is a form of empowerment. Teaching
written communication, then, helps young people to participate in a world of divergent opin-
ions, varying interpretations, conflicting viewpoints, and multiple perspectives. It may be said
that he or she who writes effectively is also he or she who "rights" and "wrongs" the world.

   Students in middle and high school classrooms are not born journalists, novelists, histori-
ans, scientists, poets, bloggers, tweeters, or musicians. They are, however, born within social,
historical, political, and cultural traditions that help shape an innate desire to communicate
with others (Prior, 2006). Another way to look at this is that writers arrive at who they are
because of their lived experiences, and because of the ways writers before them have written
about the world.

   All of us who read learn from texts. All of us who write texts gain entry into the communities
in which we hope to belong. As discussed in Chapter 1, texts include diverse modes of com-
munication such as books, videos, billboards, and clothing. The term "texts" in this chapter
is also used broadly to include essays, novels, news articles, poetry, movies, scripts, reports,
proofs, or even instant messaging. Reading and writing texts are interconnected like yin
and yang--the Chinese philosophy--complimenting one another fluidly. We become writers
through the experiences we have as readers. Similarly, we gain authority when writing effec-
tively for others to learn what we have to say. The written word is documented definitively
because it is a commitment and testimony to the page.

   As Mr. Austin (personal communication) noted, none of us is born a writer, even if we
are born to express our needs to others. Babies begin life by making basic sounds and per-
forming simple gestures that are rewarded and celebrated by doting adults. Thus, particular
forms of communication are encouraged, and the language-acquisition process begins. Soon,
the sounds a child utters become conditioned to represent words that are recognizable and
have meaning to others. The child begins to associate words with wants, needs, and ideas. In
Western cultures, the oral language may eventually move to marks on paper. Children mark-
ing their world with crayons and doodles in the United States is a progression toward more
sophisticated acts of writing. Scribbles that seem random to an adult are often a first step in
a child's development as a writer.

   Once in school, children's language advances through learning vocabulary and sentence
structures. Their innate need to communicate is met with formal rules. Over time, the rules
become more aligned with traditions that are valued by particular cultures such as acade-
mic essays, editorials, on-demand responses, formal emails, and personal narratives. Beyond
school, individuals write in the ways of their fields. The lawyer learns to write as a lawyer,
the accountant learns to write as an accountant, the novelist learns to write as a novelist, and
ultimately, a citizen learns to write as a civic participant. To participate and gain authority,
one must write in the ways that are valued by his or her communities.

   The National Writing Project is one of the nation's most celebrated writing networks for
teachers and promotes written communication as being essential for learning and democra-
tic participation (Whitney, 2008). A core principle promoted by the organization is, "There
is no single right approach to teaching writing; however, some practices prove to be more
effective than others. A reflective and informed community of practice is in the best position
to design and develop comprehensive writing programs" (National Writing Project, 2015, Core
Principle #4). Teachers of writing can become more effective by reflecting on their own writ-
ing processes, as well as by becoming active readers, listeners, and consumers of knowledge.
They should participate in professional communities and design lessons that help students

                                                                                        11. Teaching as a Writer - Assigning as a Reader | 159
write for college and career readiness, and support the ways individuals write to learn (Shana-
han, 2004).

   Readers of this chapter should understand what it means to be a teacher who instructs stu-
dents in the traditions of specific academic communities. Such teachers encourage readers to
think about assignments that are "real world" and audience-driven so that students have the
opportunity to see themselves as apprentices working toward mastery in a particular subject
area.

       A Shared Language for Teaching Writing in School

Kelly Gallagher (2011), a teacher and author of several practitioner texts, states that writing
"can be used as a vehicle to express ourselves as we negotiate the journey through our lives"
(p. 24). Because numbers of ideas are infinite, so are the ways humans express their ideas
in writing. In everyday conversation we say random things, shout out opinions, ask silly and
profound questions, gossip, and declare information in the form of statements and affirma-
tions. Committing ideas to a laptop or paper, however, can be more anxiety-provoking. Yet
composing for others in written forms is important because it makes the ideas we have more
permanent, even if the process feels more intimidating. Writing records history, demands
action, and shares stories. It is a negotiation of how we think, and as will be highlighted in this
chapter, usually has a purpose, an audience, the development of thought, support for claims,
awareness of genre, and knowledge of language conventions (Lunsford, Ede, Moss, Clark, &
Walters, 2012). In other words, what is written depends on what it is we want to say, who it is
we want to say it to, where it is we want it to be said, when it is we want it to be read, and why
it is we feel it is important. A shared language for teaching writing is provided in this chapter.
Such language allows educators to communicate effectively with one another by providing
the vocabulary for discussing classroom objectives and goals and for conferencing with stu-
dents about their own writing development.

   In the section that follows, the terms for teaching writing--content, design, and language
conventions--are discussed in depth to provide an overarching framework for the language
commonly used by teachers. Within each frame, additional terms are provided.

Content

Within any school day, a tremendous amount of content instruction occurs. In a Physical Edu-
cation class, students might learn the intricacies of playing badminton while thinking of ways
to strategize against their opponents. In an English class, a teacher might highlight the Greek
suffix meaning "fear" in the words agoraphobia, claustrophobia, and omphalophobia, in antic-
ipation of a quiz on Friday. Down the hall, a World Civilization teacher might create a com-
plicated web to demonstrate the entangled politics that led to World War I. Meanwhile, a
math class might graph slopes and intercepts on calculators, while a science class is midway
through a lab that involves making homemade yogurt during a study of bacteria. Knowledge
(and there is much of it to be covered!) is content. In the simplest sense, content is the mate-
rial and information instructors provide.

   Content is often learned through what we read and write. For readers, content is the infor-
mation that is gathered from reading new information. For writers, content is what is com-
posed and shared with others--a distribution of the knowledge that a writer knows. Without
content--specific knowledge and details within any field--there is no reason for reading or

160 | 11. Teaching as a Writer - Assigning as a Reader
writing. Content is a necessity, and for a writer, it is the specific knowledge to be used to
establish a purpose for communicating with an audience through the development of ideas.

      Purpose

A lament heard in classrooms all across the country is, "Why are we doing this?" Although
many teachers cringe when hearing these five words, the inquiry is natural and spot on. If
students do not understand the purpose of an assignment, teachers stand a chance of losing
their engagement. Therefore, it is necessary to explain to students exactly why a lesson is
taught and help them to see the relevance it. Writing needs to have a purpose. Students need
to know what is expected of them and why they are engaging in writing before they set out to
compose.

   Purposes vary, but all writing has at least one. For example, the purpose for writing this
particular chapter is to provide a shared language for teaching writing for beginning teachers
and to provide a heuristic or model for looking at writing assigned in classrooms. Even short
pieces of writing have purpose. For example, my niece, who was graduating high school last
spring, tweeted an inquiry regarding when I would be traveling to attend her party. The prose
was short but fulfilled her purpose. Through a tweet she prompted me to pinpoint an exact
date and time for my arrival. This initiated me, however, to also purchase a gift for the cel-
ebration and to call my sister to see what else I needed to bring for the party. At only 140
characters long, my niece's written text accomplished its purpose, and even motivated me to
arrange my travel, check my bank account, and let my sister know my willingness to help.

   Of course, most purposes for writing in school are more substantial than a simple tweet.
As previously stated, writing assignments require teachers to be clear about why they are
given. One purpose for writing is to communicate information quickly, such as asking stu-
dents to write responses on an exit slip, compose a short notebook entry, or complete a quick
quiz. Another may be to help students think through or show what they know. Such a pur-
pose might be featured in assignments or activities such as taking specific notes, writing a lab
report to synthesize findings from an experiment, or writing freely about pet peeves. Addi-
tional writing assignments with the purpose of showcasing what a student knows and/or has
learned include writing a biography of a historical figure with references to primary sources,
or drafting an editorial to highlight findings from a statistical survey. Teachers can readily
prepare young people to become better writers by helping them understand the purposes for
which they write.

      Audience

Another word important to the language of writing is "audience." In addition to having a
purpose for writing, students should be asked to consider an audience for whom they are
composing (Lunsford, et. al, 2012). Envisioning potential readers helps a writer to anticipate
the kinds of questions a reader might have. For example, when authors composed chapters
for this textbook, we imagined a demographic for our readers--individuals thinking about a
career in teaching--so we could better shape the researched practices we desired to share.
Versatility in communicating to a variety of audiences in school better prepares students for
the work they will do as adults in a diverse society. Typically, students write just to get a grade
and writing becomes a guessing game of "what does this teacher want me to say?" A more
effective practice, however, is to have students write for larger audiences beyond school.

   One way to highlight the importance of writing for different audiences is to ask students
to write down a basic sentence that makes a request. They may write, "Can you pick me up
after work?" "Go get the mail," or "Would you let me borrow your pen?" After, a teacher shares

                                                                                         11. Teaching as a Writer - Assigning as a Reader | 161
images on a large screen that depict a variety of characters such as a nun, a punk rocker, a
child, an elderly man, a police officer, and a wounded soldier. Students are then asked, "How
does your request differ depending on the audience it is intended for?" Students then turn to
one another and make their requests as if they are delivering them to each character.

   Another activity to sensitize students to the importance of audience is to have them think
about something they are passionate about. Next, have them think about this passion and how
they would write about it for a variety of audiences, such as elders in a nursing home, an irate
crowd with rocks in their hands, or a congressional representative. Although their passion
stays the same, what they write and how they write it depends on who it is they imagine as
recipients of their words. Discuss other examples, such as writing a comic performance for an
audience who wants to laugh, or creating a TedTalk for an audience who desires inspiration,
or a speech to persuade peers to take action. Helping young people to realize the importance
of audience can influence how they use language in specific ways to communicate with them
(Lunsford et al., 2012).

      Idea development/supporting claims

Once students have a purpose for writing and an audience in mind, they then need to develop
ideas to support claims they will make. This is the task of choosing which content is suited
for communicating their purpose to their chosen audience. Brainstorming, or the act of list-
ing possible ideas to fulfill a particular purpose, is an effective practice for choosing content
(Lassonda & Richards, 2013), and modeling this for students is also important. The teacher
should introduce a writing topic to his or her students and then demonstrate how to struc-
ture a response through modeling the act of brainstorming with them. The ways ideas are
generated will vary depending on the purpose and the audience, yet effective teachers model
their thinking in front of students (Lassonda & Richards, 2013). Students can contribute to a
list of ideas, create an outline, or even draw thought bubbles above a stick figure.

   Most school-based writing requires young people to make claims that can be defended
through the knowledge students acquire, often with content from classroom instruction,
notes, assigned reading, and independent research. Teachers play an important role in help-
ing students develop ideas based on content as they coach students to formulate their think-
ing. Posing questions is one way to help students to elicit ideas to support their claims. What
do you think right now? Why do you think this way? Where else can you go to find support for
this thinking? What have others said? What evidence is there that your thinking is on track?
What other sources might you consider for helping your thinking? Such questions help young
writers to develop good ideas and to support claims.

Design

Like content, design offers teachers a framework for discussing writing practices. In writing,
designs arrive as genres, which are specific writing forms and features unique to disciplines.
Genres allow a writer to communicate in particular ways because they provide structures
commonly used in a field. Herrington and Moran (2005) describe genres "as social knowledge"
(p. 247) and Beach (2000) refers to them as "social glue" (p. 17) because they situate and bind
knowledge within communities. The spoken word artist communicates in a genre of oral
poetry and performance, while the journalist writes in the genre of a news article. A scientist
shares through lab reports, while the mathematician showcases knowledge through proofs.
Genres unite people within communities--ones that are entwined with their own history, tra-

162 | 11. Teaching as a Writer - Assigning as a Reader
ditions, and structures. Each content area has its own genres for writing, and a teacher should
reflect often on what those genres are.

   A genre (see Table 1) is organized with familiar patterns to bring unity among readers
through customary sentence structures and uses of media (Freedman, 1993). The genre
becomes the design that allows an individual to communicate with others according to spe-
cific traditions and disciplines. For example, a restaurant menu is a written genre that is used
to offer prices and descriptions of food selections to customers. A person who composes a
restaurant menu must understand the purpose of a menu, as well as reasons for using it.
Likewise, a family who eats at the restaurant must understand what a menu does in order to
effectively use it for selecting food. Thus, something as simple as a menu accomplishes the
complex task of creating a relationship between writers and readers. The same principle holds
true for genres used in school and within specific fields of study.

 Note. Genres can span multiple categories.

      Organization

Every genre has its tradition of how language communicates specific ideas to others and
offers hints at how writers are to organize their thinking. For schools in the United States,
teachers commonly introduce the 5-paragraph essay, which includes an introduction, a body
of three paragraphs, and a conclusion. Although the 5-paragraph essay provides an organi-
zational structure that can be helpful to new writers, some argue it is not helpful for writing
in the real world (Campbell & Latimer, 2012) because real-world writing is rarely organized in
a 5-paragraph manner. For example, an English teacher might highlight personal narratives
or short stories that require more development of thought, and a history teacher might dis-
cuss biographies or opinion pieces written for a local newspaper that have their own format
unlike the 5-paragraph essay. No matter the genre, the teacher should ask, "How is informa-
tion organized? What are the patterns of the genre? How can awareness of these patterns
allow us to write in the traditions of such work?" Paying attention to such design will benefit
student writers when they set out to write on their own.

                                    11. Teaching as a Writer - Assigning as a Reader | 163
      Coherence and unity

Equally important to the ways writers organize thoughts within a genre is how coherent their
ideas are so that they make sense to readers. Coherence in writing typically refers to the flow
of sentences and paragraphs with one another to create internal consistency in the writing,
whereas unity means the ability to stay focused on a particular purpose for a sustained time
to create a sense of wholeness to the writing piece. Given the fast-paced, highly stimulating
nature of 21st century information, assisting young people to write with unity can be a monu-
mental task, especially since the opposite of unity is disconnectedness, and our technological,
ever-changing culture too often rewards the unpredictable. Even so, successful writers main-
tain a focus that brings readers with them. Genres can bring coherence and unity to readers
by offering familiar patterns and forms, and teachers who assign writing should share models
with students to point out qualities of effective writing, especially in reference to unity. For
example, teachers could highlight the use of transition words such as "first" or "in addition to"
and discuss with students how such words help keep the reader focused and move informa-
tion forward in an organized way.

      Sentence structure

Quality writing instruction requires students to read like writers and write with specific read-
ers in mind. In other words, a teacher asks students to think about the style of writing as
they are reading and then has them use similar techniques in their own writing. Composing in
this way requires drawing attention to the various ways sentences are constructed (Hillocks,
2005). Research demonstrates that teachers who spend time analyzing sentence structures of
various published writers are able to better assist young writers with learning how to effec-
tively structure their own sentences (Applebee & Langer, 2009; Graham & Perin, 2007). A
method for teaching students about structure is to offer them a set of tools for varying sen-
tences. As an illustration, if a writer uses colons proficiently, a teacher might highlight this
and state, "Notice how the author used a colon here before listing important items. This could
be an effective style to use in our own writing." Another practice teachers can model is how
to effectively combine several short sentences into a more complex (and more interesting)
sentence. For example, the sentences, "The United States is diverse. The United States is a
democracy. The United States is heterogeneous. The United States is always changing." can be
combined to read, "The diverse and heterogeneous United States is a democracy that is always
changing." Another combination might be, "The United States, a diverse and heterogeneous
democracy, is always changing." Sentence combining exercises demonstrate how writers use
language in a variety of ways and that varying sentences lead to effective writing.

      Media

Also important to design is the use of media when writing in particular genres. Using media
has long been part of the composing processes (cave drawings, a form of media, were some
of the earliest pictographs used to communicate with others). For additional examples and
discussion on media, please see Chapter 10 of this textbook. Current technologies allow a
writer to embed illustrations, videos, photographs, and tables in written documents. Highly
advanced uses of media allow writers, such as those who create and manage blogs, to include
recorded audio from a cellphone, to link websites that influence the ideas of what they are
communicating, to upload videos, and to utilize hyperlinks to enhance what they intend oth-
ers to know. Media includes everything from tables and graphs to embedded videos and
referenced resources. The use of media is often genre-specific, too, and sharing models of

164 | 11. Teaching as a Writer - Assigning as a Reader
genre-specific media will help young people use multimedia to share information and further
develop claims they want to support. Programs like Prezi, Glogster, and PowerPoint, which
are all digital tools, can help visually organize content in colorful and animated ways that
enhance written and spoken communication.

   Teachers in all content areas must pay attention to the characteristics of genres in their
field so they can effectively work with students on writing within such designs. The curricu-
lum should help students create unity in their writing, vary sentence lengths and structure for
effect, and use media to enhance communication. Teachers should make themselves aware of
the ways that genres in their particular discipline communicate information to specific audi-
ences. The more familiarity students have with how professionals communicate in real world
ways, the better prepared they will be to write within such communities as they move beyond
school.

Language Conventions

Weaver and Bush (2008) write, "Grammar can be a way to enrich student writing--a way to
make writing better, more complex, more exciting, and overall, more rich and interesting" (p.
xi). Grammatical conventions for language, which are the standard rules, methods, and prac-
tices, can also be fodder for debates, insecurities, and frustrations. Rules for how to properly
use language conventions were once a primary concern of teachers (see Chapter 6 for more
discussion and critique about teaching decontextualized language conventions in writing).
Even today, national assessments like the SAT place much importance on language usage, yet
the use of emoticons and other abbreviated semiotics (i.e., the study of signs and symbols) has
become a concern among teachers who find "text" in their students' classroom writing. The
mere red-penning of incorrect usage, however, is an exercise in editing rather than establish-
ing dialogue about the various conventions of written expression, and where and when they
are acceptable (Hillocks, 1984). Teaching a student to write takes more than correcting a stu-
dent's errors.

   Today, adolescent writing instruction focuses more heavily on content and design over the
emphasis of conventional rules (Applebee & Langer, 2013; Graham & Perin, 2007). Grammar,
usage, and documentation are best taught in context of the writing students produce, and
although language conventions traditionally fall within the jurisdiction of English and for-
eign language teachers, writing instruction belongs to all content areas (McKenna & Robin-
son, 2014). Content area-teachers should feel comfortable hosting mini-lessons on grammar,
usage and correctness, especially in the context of their field.

      Grammar and usage

At the most basic level, grammar is the systemic and structured system for using language,
arranging words and phrases, and creating meaning in recognizable forms. Grammar provides
rules to effectively communicate with others. Similarly, usage is how individuals typically
use words and phrases. More whimsically, UrbanDictionary.com--an online site popular with
youth that offers alternative definitions--defines grammar and usage as "a form of writing or
speaking which is hard to learn and hence is ignored by the general populous [sic]" (Severian,
2006). Rules for written language are often debated. Even so, a common goal for teachers who
teach writing is to teach and model the use of Standard American English, that is, the Eng-
lish language used in professional communication in the U.S. and taught in American schools.
Thus, it is the responsibility of teachers to know these (and perhaps other) language conven-

                                                                                        11. Teaching as a Writer - Assigning as a Reader | 165
tions, and if they have a question about language use, they should model for students how to
resolve it.

      Correctness

In addition to having adequate knowledge of language conventions to write well, students
need to know the meanings of a lot of words, they need to spell words correctly, and they need
to understand how and when to cite references consistent within academic disciplines (e.g.,
the Modern Language Association for English and American Psychological Association for
Psychology). Such protocol allows young writers to join in professional communities beyond
school. A lack of knowledge for how to write well may cause individuals to be rejected by par-
ticular communities. Rightly or wrongly, a student runs the risk of a rejection from profes-
sional writing communities if his or her writing strays too far from what academic institutions
value. Teaching conventions is important because it assists writers with the most effective
ways to communicate, given the purposes of their communication both within and beyond
school (Freeman & Freeman, 2009). Language conventions, like design and content, are part
of the package for instructing young writers in school, and all three together provide a frame-
work for how teachers talk about and assess writing (Calfee & Miller, 2007).

   In this section of the chapter, I offered shared language for teaching writing in middle and
secondary schools, including content, design, and language conventions. No matter the con-
tent area, students need a purpose for what they write and an audience with whom to com-
municate. Teachers should be familiar with the genres used in their field and teach young
writers so they, too, design through recognizable traditions. This includes how writers orga-
nize thinking, bring unity to their work, and vary sentences. Students should be mentored
to use proper language conventions as well, including grammar, usage, word choice, spelling,
and documentation. To accomplish these important goals, teachers need a shared language
for teaching writing, and effective practice requires teachers to be aware of their own writing
processes including genre-specific designs that enhance communication within a discipline.
In the next section, I provide a heuristic, or model, to assist how teachers might help students
achieve written outcomes desired in specific disciplines.

               Writing as Activity Within a Classroom

It is 7:50 a.m. and the buzzer sounds, signaling that students have exactly four minutes to get
themselves to where they are scheduled to be. Imagine yourself as a teacher, in the hallway
sipping coffee from a Styrofoam cup, making sure your backpack is on your shoulder, your
keys are in your pocket, and you remembered to grab the cellphone from the front seat of
your car. You did not sleep well last night because you forgot to plan for your elective class,
administrators said they needed to see you during your preparation period, and you stayed
up a little too late reading a book. Grogginess is still in the corner of your eyes as you reach
your classroom, the gymnasium, the band room, or a lab or studio. You unlock the door for 32
sleepy, active, enthused, unenthused, anxious, apathetic, studious, rebellious, whimsical, con-
fused, and frustrated learners assigned to your first period class. Today begins a new unit for
you to help them develop written communication through an assignment important to your
content area. You turn on the lights knowing that what happens in this room today will be
essential to the outcome of what students produce tomorrow. There is not a second to waste,
and every activity matters. Yikes. Teaching is a lot of responsibility.

   Teachers are extremely busy, yet know that to teach writing effectively they need to be
attentive to all of the components discussed throughout this chapter: content, design, and

166 | 11. Teaching as a Writer - Assigning as a Reader
language conventions. Still, teachers also think about how a classroom environment influ-
ences the writing students do. They wonder what their role should be, what instructional
tools they should provide, and which rules they should emphasize for students to follow.

Understanding Writing as an Activity To Reach a Written Outcome

Writing activity genre research (Russell, 2010) and activity theory (Engeström, 2015) provide
a helpful model, or heuristic, for thinking about the delivery of writing instruction. Scholar-
ship in this area situates learning as an activity within a classroom system that is enhanced
by teachers thinking aloud about their own practices (Smagorinsky, 2002). It is important for
teachers to pay attention to the classroom system, or the environment provided that helps a
student to learn (see Figure 1). Seeing a classroom as an activity system helps a teacher to map
out pedagogical choices to enhance student learning, including how they communicate in
writing. Classrooms are complex and contain individuals with varying opinions, experiences,
and histories that may or may not be in line with local, state, and national standards required
of teachers to teach.

Figure 1. The structure of human activity. Adapted from Learning by Expanding: An Activity-Theoretical
Approach to Development Research (2nd ed.), by Y. Engeström, p. 63, 2015, New York, NY: Cambridge
University Press. Copyright 2015 by Yrjö Engeström.

      Thinking of a classroom as an activity system can benefit the choices a teacher makes,
especially when paying attention to students (subjects), the purposes a student has (motives),
and the products (outcomes) a student produces. Also important are the tools provided to a
learner, the rules they are expected to follow, how labor is divided in a classroom, and how
a community is established for all. Together, subjects, motives, outcomes, tools, rules, divi-
sion of labor, and community encompass a writing activity system (Engeström, 2015 & Rus-
sell, 2010). Thinking about our classrooms as a system for activity can also help us to think
about the complexities of teaching writing. To enhance the outcomes of what students in our

                                                                                         11. Teaching as a Writer - Assigning as a Reader | 167
classrooms write, it is important to pay attention to every part of the system. This includes,
of course, the language for discussing writing with students (as discussed in the previous
section): purpose, audience awareness, idea development, support, genre, organization, and
unity.

      Subjects

Many experienced teachers are first to declare how there is no learning without building rela-
tionships with students (Moje, Overby, Tysvaer, & Morris, 2008). Before a child can learn in a
classroom, trust needs to be established, as well as recognition of student individuality. In a
writing activity system, it is important to know each student (subject) as an individual. Early
in the year, a teacher should inventory students' interests, talents, ambitions, and fears to
help guide the instruction of the classroom. Teachers should also get to know who their stu-
dents are both inside and outside the classroom. Although effective teaching requires strong
content knowledge, it is also paramount for teachers to see their students as people first.
Knowing each student as an individual will assist supporting their purposes and motivations
as writers.

      Motives

Most books published on the teaching of writing promote a six-letter word that is extremely
important to the writing classroom: choice. Choice is important because it is the foundation
of what motivates a student to want to write. If you think about your own history as a learner,
you probably recall that you put more time and effort into projects that interested you.
Assignments that offer choices to learners provide flexibility, and flexibility allows individuals
to find a motive (purpose) to participate in writing activities. When students are motivated
to write, they naturally become more invested in the outcomes they produce. For example, a
teacher may wish to help students gain a deeper understanding of the Civil Rights movement
from 1954-1968. As content is gained through notes, discussions, assigned readings, and doc-
umentaries, students may be given a choice to explore a humanitarian issue that is important
to them. While they explore that particular era in U.S. history, they might also be assigned to
write their own OpEds (i.e., opinion editorials) where they argue for or against a cause and/or
take a stance on an issue they care about. In essence, effective writing teachers harness the
motives of students to produce stronger writing by providing choice in writing assignments
that are aligned with the content they also wish to deliver.

      Tools

To facilitate a written outcome within a writing activity system, a teacher must also provide
numerous tools for students to reach their goals. Tools might include the lessons provided,
the models used, the notes shared, and the materials read. Tools can also be conversations,
homework, visits to the library, and adhering to writing processes such as brainstorming,
drafting, conferencing, rewriting, editing, and revision. Other tools include watching movies,
building vocabulary, and even taking tests and quizzes. Writing activity systems that offer
writers a variety of tools effectively help writers reach important written language outcomes.
These tools can be material (e.g., a dictionary, a model of the genre being taught), mental (e.g.,
guiding questions, opportunities to brainstorm), and social (e.g., discussions, performance).
The more tools teachers have, the better suited they are to provide instruction that can work
for students.

168 | 11. Teaching as a Writer - Assigning as a Reader
      Rules

Because classrooms are social environments where many personalities are brought together
within the same space, it is important to establish rules within this activity system. In addition
to establishing normal procedures and day-to-day routines (rules), as discussed previously, it
is also helpful to work with young writers to establish how to communicate in particular gen-
res (see the previous section on designs), which are also rules. Featuring models of writing can
help young people learn to understand the rules of a genre. Rules establish traditions and pro-
vide frameworks for others to follow. Rules, too, are meant to be broken, but before this can
occur, an understanding is needed of why rules were created in the first place. As rules are
established, conversations about them will help students to think about what they are writing
and when breaking a given rule makes sense. When looking at a genre, for example, students
can point out characteristics they notice, and these characteristics can serve as guidelines or
rules they follow in their own writing.

      Division of labor

Although students spend much time writing alone, writing is rarely a solo act. A teacher
who instructs students about what writing is supposed to be, without allowing them time
to develop writing skills, is less likely to receive quality writing from students. Instead, the
labor of writing requires roles within classrooms and should be viewed as a social activity
where everyone participates. As a class, students can brainstorm ideas together, or teachers
can model their thinking in front of students. The next day, students might share their drafts
with classmates. Although the labor for writing typically falls on students, many others share
in helping students compose a written piece. Encouraging students to think about writing
together, allowing them time to write on their own, and providing space to share writing with
one another can have a positive effect on the outcomes they produce. For example, I wrote
this chapter alone, but through sharing drafts of the chapter with friends, colleagues, and the
editors, it was shaped to what you read today. Writing may look like a solo act, but outcomes
are a result of collaboration, including this volume of work. All writing is a community act.

      Community

In addition to building relationships, creating community among young people enhances the
written outcomes in an activity system. Communication and community both begin with
"com," the prefix meaning together and with. A teacher's job is to help students come together
as a community of writers who are willing to communicate with one another. Further, writing
in genres used by professionals provides a location for young people to practice writing in the
ways of a professional community. If adolescents view themselves as young scientists, they
will more likely write like young scientists. If they view themselves as artists, they will fash-
ion writing in artistic ways. If they learn their opinions are valued and supported, they will be
more confident to share their opinions with others. A teacher who promotes effective writing
practices creates an environment where students are willing to take risks and try new things.
As a community, they share ideas, ask questions, and feel safe to explore thinking together.
They do this by discussing models of writing unique to particular communities.

      Outcome

The outcome in a writing activity system is the product created by the student. Outcomes
arrive when teachers pay attention to all parts of the activity system rather than simply
assigning writing tasks to students. If school is an arena for apprenticeship, then assigning

                                                                                        11. Teaching as a Writer - Assigning as a Reader | 169
real-world writing and providing mentoring are essential. Sharing examples of writing from
students, published authors, and teachers better prepares students to reach important out-
comes. Offering models and discussing them can enhance the quality of writing students turn
in. The outcome is the result of all the parts in the activity working together, including the
coordination of subjects, tools, rules, divisions of labor, and motives that create a writing
activity system.

   An example of a well-coordinated writing activity I once observed involved a teacher who
spent a week teaching students how to approach writing the college essay. On the first day,
she asked students to highlight personal achievements and interests. She used this informa-
tion to first learn about her students as individuals (subjects) and as a way to assist them
on narrowing a topic from which to write. The students were motivated to write the essays
because they wanted to attend college and needed to be successful to achieve acceptance.
On the second day, the teacher shared models of college essays (tools), and her students dis-
cussed the ones they thought were more effective. The teacher highlighted what experts have
to say about college essays, and after reading the models they listed effective characteristics
of the genre (rules). The teacher did not dictate what was best; instead, she worked with her
students and listened to their contributions (division of labor). The classroom walls were cov-
ered with posters of several colleges and universities, and as a senior English class, materials
supported the work of the room. The classroom, on the whole, was geared toward the suc-
cess of all students (community). By the third day, students read first drafts with one another
and made suggestions. On the fourth day, the teacher brought students to a computer lab to
revise and edit their work. By the fifth day, they had a college essay to submit for a grade and
also for a real-world audience--the college of their choice (outcome).

   By viewing classrooms as activity systems involving subjects, motives, tools, rules, divisions
of labor, and community, teachers can help students learn to write and apply their writing
skills to accomplish important life tasks, such as getting into college. This can be accom-
plished by exploring content, design, and conventions used by writers in each of our disci-
plines as we prepare students for college and career readiness.

                                    Summary

An aim of this chapter was to provide a common language to discuss the teaching of writing.
Through a frame of content, design, and language conventions, the chapter highlighted the
importance of purpose, audience, and idea development, with specific emphasis placed on
genre. Writing is an activity requiring a subject to be motivated to reach a specific outcome
through tools, rules, division of labor, and community. Effective teachers of writing assign
writing that apprentices students into the genres of their field and involves well-coordinated
activity systems where students can learn to communicate effectively using the written word.

   Questions and Activities

      1. What do you read in your discipline, and how do you write about what you read?
      2. For what purposes and for what audiences have you had to write? Explain how you learned

           to develop your ideas in reference to purpose and audience.

      3. Where did you learn about language conventions, and how have they been used to influ-
           ence your own writing processes?

      4. Think about a piece of specific writing you have done. Why did you write it, and what does
           it say about you as a writer? Describe the tools and rules that helped you accomplish your
           writing goal(s). What role did community play in reference to this writing?

      5. What genres do writers in your field use to communicate knowledge? Discuss the conven-
           tions of writing associated with these genres. How do these conventions help establish a
           community of writers?

      6. What genres of writing do you think you would assign your students? Describe the proce-
           dures and rules for writing your plan to teach your students.

Literacy Strategies Instruction

                                     Abstract

This chapter focuses on different approaches to disciplinary literacy strategies instruction
that content area teachers can use to maximize students' understanding of content in aca-
demic disciplines. Although teaching literacy strategies is often associated with English lan-
guage arts, in reality, these strategies are integral to learning in all academic subjects. This
chapter includes a brief description of the evolution of literacy theory and research, followed
by a model grounding disciplinary literacy within different academic disciplines such as
mathematics, social studies, science, and the arts. Descriptions and examples of discipline
specific strategies are provided, followed by a discussion of the importance of students'
cultural and linguistic backgrounds in planning and using disciplinary literacy strategies.
Instruction that incorporates components of culture designed to facilitate learning is known
as culturally responsive teaching, which also serves as a foundation by which to critique
socially unjust power structures in society.

   Learning Objectives

        After reading this chapter, readers will be able to

      1. sequence the history of reading eras in reference to what has been valued about literacy;
      2. explain differences between generalizable literacy strategies instruction and disciplinary-

           literacy strategies instruction, along with the benefits of each;
      3. explain similarities and differences in literacy demands among different types of texts;
      4. discuss ways that the valuing and use of students' background knowledge and experiences

           can facilitate learning;
      5. synthesize ways in which discipline specific literacy strategies can be used by content area

           teachers in culturally responsive ways.

                                  Introduction

Think back to your experiences in content area high school classes such as algebra, history,
biology, and art. How did you learn the content from these classes? You might recall writing
definitions of key terms, copying notes from the board, listening to teachers lecture, working
in small groups engaged in problem-solving, and viewing completed models of class projects.
You also may recall being assigned to read textbooks or other documents and then complete
assignments or projects related to readings. As you think about the texts you read in each
subject, how were they different from one another? Were ideas presented in sentences and

                                                                                                                                                               173
paragraphs, or did texts include symbols, graphs, charts, videos, and/or applications? Did you
use the same or different strategies to comprehend texts in different classes?

   Whether or not you noticed, the texts used in your classes differed in important ways.
Chances are, texts that were used in algebra likely contained many symbols, figures, and
examples but few photographs. Texts that were used in history probably contained many
photographs, along with sections featuring timelines and excerpts of historical documents.
Texts that were used in biology were probably structured according to biological systems
such as circulatory, endocrine, and respiratory. Texts that were used in art may have con-
sisted mostly of photographs, paintings, drawings, or sculpture, depending on the art class
you took. In effect, the texts used in your classes likely did not differ arbitrarily but differed in
predictable ways directly related to the systems, traditions, and content of each academic dis-
cipline. Based on differences among texts, research has shown that different discipline spe-
cific literacy strategies can be used by teachers to help students improve their understanding
of course content.

            Evolution of Literacy Theory and Research

To understand the recent focus of literacy research across academic disciplines, a brief jour-
ney through the evolution of reading theory and research over the past six decades is needed
(see Table 1). As noted in Chapter 1 of this textbook, notions of literacy have expanded beyond
reading and writing to include listening, speaking, viewing, and performing, and the eras
reflect the recognition of the importance of taking this wider view of literacy.

Table 1. Historical Perspective on Reading Research (Alexander & Fox, 2004)

"Era of Information            1996-?     Using cognitive processes to make meaning
Processing" (p. 41)
"Era of Sociocultural                     Incorporating cultural factors to make meaning
Learning" (p. 45)                         Integrating literacy across the lifespan and within
"Era of Engaged Learning" (p.             multiple contexts
50)

      According to Alexander and Fox (2004), a heightened interest in reading research and
practice occurred in the 1950s and 1960s, beginning with the Era of Conditioned Learning
when learning theories were largely based on the study of behavior. What resulted was an
instructional model that involved teaching students how to read using discrete skills (letter
sounds and phonics). Next, theories emerged that children learn to read "naturally" simi-
larly to how spoken language is acquired by being exposed to language opportunities. During
this Era of Natural Learning, reading and language rich experiences created by adults were
thought to best help children make meaning of what was read. Then the focus of theory and
research shifted to include cognitive processes involved in reading. During this Era of Infor-
mation Processing, factors such as attention, thinking strategies, and knowledge organiza-
tion were recognized as important to make meaning of what is read. Also during this time

174 | 12. Culturally Responsive Disciplinary Literacy Strategies Instruction
the social and cultural aspects of learning became a focus. This Era of Sociocultural Learn-
ing became particularly informative to culturally responsive teaching practices (Gay, 2010;
Moje, 2007; Moje & Hinchman, 2004) discussed later in this chapter. More recently, the Era
of Engaged Learning has emerged, based on the use of digital literacies (e.g., websites, audio,
video, and other forms of technology-based communication).

   Notice how the last era in Table 1 does not include an end date. This means that we are
likely in a new era--perhaps an Era of Accountability (Schoen & Fusarelli, 2008), given the
focus on high stakes testing and most states' adoption of the Common Core State Standards
for English Language Arts & Literacy in History/Social Studies, Science, and Technical Sub-
jects (CCSS; National Governors Association Center for Best Practices & Council of Chief State
School Officers [NGA & CCSSO], 2010). The CCSS reflect literacy standards that students
must meet in English language arts and other academic disciplines, such as social studies and
science. Each of the eras is valuable for teachers to draw upon because associated theories
and research have offered valuable knowledge toward informing literacy practices.

                    Basic and Intermediate Literacy

Increased literacy demands in content area classes reflect the need to explore new teaching
strategies to assist students with navigating these demands. Certain literacy related abilities,
such as being able to read and comprehend printed material, are required across all content
area classes; however, as the complexity of content area learning increases, more specialized
strategies are needed to comprehend texts and learn from them. A useful framework for
showing the differences between these types of literacy strategies was introduced in Shana-
han and Shanahan (2008). This framework features three components, including basic literacy
(e.g., reading and writing), intermediate literacy that enables learning across all disciplines
(e.g., using graphic organizers, visualizing, predicting, asking questions), and disciplinary lit-
eracy, which involves "technical uses of literacy" (p. 45) within the academic disciplines. Dis-
ciplinary literacy strategies are discussed in more detail after a brief discussion about basic
and intermediate literacy strategies.

   To be successful at learning in content area classes, students need to master foundational
literacy skills, such as being able to read. As word recognition accuracy develops, children
begin to read words and sentences more automatically, which facilitates reading comprehen-
sion (Perfetti, 1985). But even though the development of basic literacy skills is required to
develop more advanced literacy skills, mastery of basic literacy does not guarantee that stu-
dents will be able to comprehend what they read.

   Basic literacy skills mostly involve the application of automatic cognitive processes such
as recognizing words and reading fluently; however, intermediate literacy skills involve the
application of comprehension strategies that require deliberate cognitive effort (see Chapter
4 of this textbook for more information on strategy use). For example, when a student
encounters a phrase such as, "the worker's expression darkened as she considered the poten-
tially devastating impact of the decision she was about to make," students may read the
words automatically; however, to understand the meaning behind the worker's face darkening
requires thinking about what the author means rather than only what the words mean.

   An example of intermediate literacy strategies includes the use of graphic organizers to
provide a visual structure to show relationships among concepts, terms, and ideas (Strang-
man, Vue, Hall, & Meyer, 2003). There are many types of graphic organizers (see examples
under Web Resources at the end of this chapter) that can be used to facilitate comprehension.
A helpful website that shows the process of defining key terms using graphic organizers is

                                                           12. Culturally Responsive Disciplinary Literacy Strategies Instruction | 175
from Vanderbilt University (The IRIS Center, 2015). One featured organizer is called the Frayer
Model (The IRIS Center, 2015) and requires students to write a word in the center of a page
and then record defining information in a surrounding quadrant. The quadrant includes a
space to write a definition, characteristics of the term and provides both examples and non-
examples. Exploring vocabulary in this way helps students know how to make meaning of
terms within the context of their reading, as well as in decontextualized situations.

   Early research on the effects of teaching intermediate literacy strategies that can be
generalized across the disciplines has shown positive results for improving students' com-
prehension. There is an especially strong research base for the use of a specific kind of
comprehension strategy instruction, which includes activating prior knowledge, predicting,
visualizing, summarizing, and asking questions (Pressley, 2000). To date, findings from scien-
tifically-based research evaluating the effects of comprehension strategy instruction can be
readily found in the National Reading Panel Report (NRP; National Institute of Child Health
and Human Development [NICHD], 2000), as well as in a research synthesis containing many
studies published since the NRP (Butler, Urrutia, Buenger, & Hunt, 2010). As outlined in
Chapter 2 of this textbook, scientifically-based research is especially valuable for informing
teaching practices because it isolates the effects of instruction (e.g., comprehension strate-
gies) from other factors that can also influence achievement (e.g., IQ, socioeconomic status,
maternal education). Taken together, scientifically-based studies on comprehension strategy
instruction show positive results and provide strong evidence for informing current teaching
practices.

   Despite evidence that teaching students to use these more generalizable comprehension
strategies is beneficial, many content area teachers have been reluctant to teach the strate-
gies or even cue students to use them (O'Brien, Stewart, & Moje, 1995). According to O'Brien
et al., many content area teachers do not believe that teaching reading strategies is part of
their role and that this sort of teaching is better left to English language arts or English teach-
ers. Additionally, some teachers have communicated that practicing these strategies will take
time away from content area instruction, and to them, the trade-off is not worth it (O'Brien et
al., 1995). According to Shanahan and Shanahan (2012) content area teachers' lack of enthusi-
asm for using generalizable literacy strategies may be understandable, since learning acade-
mic content likely requires the use of both generalizable and more specialized strategies.

                            Disciplinary Literacy

According to McConachie and Petrosky (2010), disciplinary literacy refers to "the use of read-
ing, reasoning, investigating, speaking, and writing required to learn and form complex con-
tent knowledge appropriate to a particular discipline" (p. 16). Research has recently been
conducted within the area of disciplinary literacy which holds the potential to inform content
area teaching. An account of this research will be presented next, followed by a discussion of
the application of content area instruction.

Disciplinary Literacy Research

Current research has begun to focus on the use of discipline specific literacy strategies to
improve both literacy and content area learning (Jetton & Shanahan, 2012; Moje, 2007, 2008;
Shanahan & Shanahan, 2008, 2012; Shanahan, Shanahan, & Misischia, 2011). Discipline specific
strategies can be added to the use of more generalizable comprehension strategies to reflect

176 | 12. Culturally Responsive Disciplinary Literacy Strategies Instruction
how disciplinary experts actually navigate and learn from reading texts in various disciplines
(Shanahan et al., 2011).

   Shanahan and Shanahan (2008) described the need for secondary teachers to teach the
use of disciplinary literacy strategies to students, based on a two-year literacy initiative they
undertook to explore the reading demands of various content area disciplines. Shanahan and
Shanahan described preliminary findings of a study involving the analysis of how disciplinary
experts read texts in their fields. For instance, based on observations of the experts thinking
aloud as they read texts, Shanahan and Shanahan described how much intensive rereading
mattered when mathematicians read texts in their field. An example provided is how words
such as "the," "a," and "of," which are normally not very meaningful, take on great signifi-
cance when reading mathematics texts (see Table 2). Comprehension of mathematical texts
also required being solution-focused and vigilant to detect and fix any comprehension prob-
lems.

   Observations of chemistry experts' reading showed the need to divide attention among
many different representations of information, including charts, graphs, symbols, and words
written in texts. Alternatively, historians appeared more contextually-focused. Knowing who
an author was and the nature of the source material were observed to be essential for inter-
preting information read in historical documents. Unlike mathematicians and chemists, his-
torians did not focus as much on facts or solutions but on making judgments and assessing
credibility.

   When Shanahan and Shanahan (2008) discussed teaching generalizable comprehension
strategies in content areas, they found that individuals in their participant sample were not
interested in teaching students how to "read," which was similar to findings in the study by
O'Brien et al. (1995). As a result of discussions with content area experts, Shanahan and Shana-
han (2008) identified strategies that were more discipline specific, to which content area
experts reacted more positively.

   Table 2 summarizes ways that reading and writing across the disciplines are unique, and
by analyzing how literacy happens within disciplines, more specialized strategies and
approaches to learning can be created. Notice how in Table 2 the literacy features and
demands of mathematics and science appear to overlap more with each other than with his-
tory, English, and the arts. In spite of certain similarities, the ways that mathematics, history,
science, and arts texts are accessed, viewed, read, discussed, debated, critiqued, and written
about often require the use of specialized strategies that differ from strategies used to com-
prehend narrative fiction. The strategies used depend, at least in part, on the nature of the
texts and knowledge traditions associated with the various disciplines.

      Differences in literacy-related knowledge traditions become most obvious when consid-
ering violations of these traditions. For example, what if the following sentence were encoun-
tered in a chemistry textbook:

       The despondent chemist tenuously grasped the test tube and lifted it feebly over the
       dancing blue flame of the Bunsen burner, fluttering the cylinder back and forth like a
       tiny flag signaling his surrender to the very science he was studying.

Why is this funny? Because it reflects a clear violation of disciplinary communication style
associated with chemistry. This same feeling of awkwardness can happen when someone
tries to use a strategy that supports comprehension in one discipline but not in another. For
example, if an author began a chapter on disciplinary literacy with the phrase, "This chap-
ter focuses on different approaches to disciplinary literacy strategies instruction that content
area teachers can use to maximize students' understanding of content in academic disci-

                                  12. Culturally Responsive Disciplinary Literacy Strategies Instruction | 179
plines," students would likely appreciate the explicit guidance of what will be discussed. Con-
versely, if an author started a novel with the sentence, "This is a story about a boy whose
dog dies after being bitten by a rabid wolf," no one would want to read it because the ending
is revealed before the story even begins--a clear violation of novel writing conventions. And
finally, consider the physics textbook beginning with the phrase, "Once upon a time." It is not
that the sentences and phrases used above are technically incorrect; they just do not conform
to the communication traditions associated with the corresponding discipline.

Incorporating Disciplinary Literacy Strategies into Content Areas

This chapter will now turn to providing examples of disciplinary literacy teaching and learning
in action. The examples are not meant to encompass all of the dimensions featured in Table
2 or represent all content areas but are intended to contextualize selected specialized strate-
gies relevant to mathematics, science, history, and the arts. Examples related to English are
also provided in Table 2 as a comparison to other disciplines.

      Mathematics

How do mathematicians learn about their discipline? They do a lot of reading and writing
(Siebert & Draper, 2012). Recall from Table 2 that what makes learning mathematics and com-
prehending mathematics texts challenging is the fact that they are concept and idea dense,
and they also require attention to many unique features within the texts. Mathematics texts
do not just involve reading word problems but require translation and decoding of innumer-
able symbols that take up very little space but still carry a great deal of meaning. In addi-
tion, students must constantly use visual literacy strategies to make meaning of charts and
graphs that are also dense. Given some of the differences in both text features and the ways
that mathematics is discussed and written about, it makes sense why using only generalizable
comprehension strategies such as graphic organizers and making predictions would not be
sufficient to make meaning of mathematics texts.

   When a mathematics teacher asks students to read a text to learn how to graph (x,y) coor-
dinates, the text the students read would likely span very few pages. The ratio of words to
symbols would be different than texts in most other disciplines, and unlike when reading Eng-
lish, history, or arts texts, reading about graphing (x,y) coordinates does not require the same
type of thinking about the author's purpose. The mathematics text probably contains a head-
ing that summarizes what that section is about--perhaps something not very surprising like,
"Graphing (x,y) Coordinates." Not all students pay attention to text features such as chapter
titles or headings because they may not realize these features reveal the big picture of what
is coming. Their lack of attention may stem from being used to seeing chapter numbers in
narrative texts with no title or vague titles such as, "Chapter 6: Fading Away." Students may
mistakenly believe that titles are not that important in revealing what a text is about, but in
many disciplines, including mathematics, chapter titles and section headings are essential for
directing attention and self-monitoring comprehension.

   Across disciplines, titles and headings will likely differ, but what they have in common is
that they give the reader a preview of what is coming. Ignoring text features can leave read-
ers without a needed foundation to organize their thinking. Consider the following example.
Suppose students are asked to examine two sets of numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 and 1, 4, 9, 16, 25.
Students begin to notice that each set contains five numbers, they are all 25 or less, and most
of them are odd. But if they notice the heading preceding the number sets--Prime Numbers

180 | 12. Culturally Responsive Disciplinary Literacy Strategies Instruction
and Squares--the students will be immediately oriented to the meaning of the number sets
(provided they know or are taught what prime numbers and squares are).

   Teachers who model how to read headings in mathematics texts and discuss the impor-
tance of this reading behavior are preparing their students to comprehend complex texts.
In addition, teachers who model mathematics specific literacy strategies require students to
do some reconceptualizing of what a "text" actually is (Siebert & Draper, 2012). Recall that in
Chapter 1, text was defined quite broadly as including not only printed documents like sto-
ries and articles but also diverse modes of communication, which in this case, include math-
ematical symbols, graphs, charts, equations, questions, and exercises. Because text features
in mathematics may be different from text features in other disciplines, reminding students
to "read every word" in a math text may not be good advice if texts do not contain very many
words. Students who approach reading mathematics texts like they approach reading a novel
will miss many important features designed to direct their attention and ease their learning.
Perhaps the reminder to "read and interpret every feature of texts" is better advice.

   Because students may not understand the role of all of the text features they encounter in
reading within specific disciplines, teachers can explicitly show students how to make mean-
ing of these features. Students may need to look at an example problem many times before
they understand how to transfer the learning to a new problem. Looking back and forth at
components until comprehension is solid is a great strategy to use in this situation, whereas,
looking back at the same paragraph in a novel 20 times would probably not be a good strat-
egy to apply. This is why teachers must teach disciplinary literacy strategies according to the
processes and procedures that make sense, based on the conventions and content of their
disciplines (Moje, 2007).

   It should be noted that strategies such as the ones described above are not limited to tradi-
tional texts such as textbooks but lend themselves well to digital texts, which may also include
applications (apps) and videos (Draper, Broomhead, Jensen, Nokes, & Siebert, 2010). Students
may require different types of modeling to know how to access and interpret text features
found in these media. An example includes showing students how to display a figure and its
companion explanation using a split computer screen so looking back and forth is easier.

      History

How do historians learn about their discipline? They do a lot of reading and writing
(VanSledright, 2012). Reading historical texts is central to gaining an understanding of the past
and its implications for the future. To some, it may seem as if historical documents largely
resemble texts students encounter in English, but readers must approach some history texts
in markedly different ways (see Table 2). Texts read in a history class may include sentences
and paragraphs but also may include many visuals, such as charts, figures, and even pho-
tographs of clothing (Campbell, 1996), since meaning can be made of each of these visual rep-
resentations. Historical texts reveal the author's perspective and context, with more emphasis
on these attributes than occurs in most other disciplines. A person who writes history also
shares his or her attitudes, culture, biases, political and/or religious beliefs. Similarly, a per-
son who reads history filters what is read according to his or her own attitudes, culture,
biases, political and/or religious beliefs. So reading history without connecting the "who,
what, where, and when" of the information to the person who created it, and to the person
reading it, is like finding a bottle of soda on the ground and just opening it up and drinking
it. Historians are especially reluctant to consume things when they do not know where those
things came from.

                                                           12. Culturally Responsive Disciplinary Literacy Strategies Instruction | 181
   Like mathematicians, historians use specialized strategies to make meaning of texts they
read (VanSledright, 2012). Think for a moment about a history teacher handing students a
copy of a document discussing Prohibition, for the purpose of generating debate about the
legalization of marijuana in the United States. Prior to reading the document, the teacher
would likely direct students to determine who wrote it, as well as to note the year the doc-
ument was written to contextualize it within the attitudes, beliefs, and customs of that time
period. Next, the teacher might ask students to read the document to get the gist of what is
communicated, and then reread the document while analyzing the information from varying
perspectives. Each idea would be carefully considered in reference to the author, the time of
the writing, the issue, and through the lens of today. In effect, literacy instruction in history
involves a great deal of contextualization of every fact, opinion, word used, and perspective of
those who lived before and after an event that took place.

      Science

How do scientists learn about their discipline? They, like mathematicians and historians, do
a lot of reading and writing (Shanahan, 2012). Mathematics and science actually share some
important characteristics in reference to strategies students can use to understand what they
read, write, and discuss in science classes, so it is useful to borrow from the mathematics
strategies previously discussed (see Table 2). For example, science also uses many symbols,
graphics, and charts that require focused processing of visual information, as well as words,
sentences, and paragraphs. For subjects which are more classification oriented, there are
additional strategies worth discussing to help students make meaning of what they read.

   Just as in the section of this chapter discussing mathematics and history where ideas of
what a text is needed to be broadened, with science, ideas about what a text is need to be
extended even further. Visual literacy strategies are needed for looking through a microscope
at a cell and labeling the mitochondria and are also needed during the dissection of a frog,
while students try to find, label (and spell!) the pancreas. Are magnified cells and frogs "texts"?
If students are asked to make meaning of them, then arguably they are. What is more, stu-
dents may be required to view many of these texts concurrently, so rather than just look-
ing back and forth between words and figures in a text, biology students may be required to
divide their attention across a textbook, a frog body, a microscope, a lab packet, and more.

   One troubling aspect raised by Shanahan (2012) about the way science is taught in some
schools is when teachers completely avoid the use of science texts because teachers believe
that the texts are too difficult for students to understand. As an alternative, teachers may
choose to present content using other means, such as orally or by facilitating discussions. A
danger to this approach is that students may never become skilled at reading and interpreting
science texts if they do not have opportunities to engage in reading about science. Further-
more, avoiding the use of science texts limits students' ability to learn more about science
outside of these contexts (i.e., college and career settings).

   An alternative to avoiding the use of science texts was teaching students how to read and
understand them, using some of the same disciplinary literacy strategies experts use. Science
texts often contain unique features, such as dense classification charts based on nominalized
terms. Nominalization is when words such as "dissolve" become more abstract by the addi-
tion of endings which turn verbs into nouns (dissolution; Shanahan, 2012). Similar to mathe-
matics texts, readers of science texts must switch strategies when going from sentences and
paragraphs to viewing formulas or graphics to reading paragraphs again. Differences in the
density of idea units (sometimes referred to as "lexical density"; Shanahan & Shanahan, 2008)

182 | 12. Culturally Responsive Disciplinary Literacy Strategies Instruction
can make scientific texts especially challenging for students to read and remain motivated to
understand.

   An example of this difficulty with reading dense science texts is discussed by Moje (2007),
who described a student's reaction to such an encounter. The student shared, "You read the
whole section [of a biology book] and you're like, okay, you gotta read it four times just to
understand it a little bit" (p. 34). The student then remarked, "It's just written the way adults
read it.... And they have the knowledge to do that.... And they write it in their own language that
only them can understand" (emphases in original; p. 34). The student continued to describe
how all of the big words and adult language made the texts inaccessible to her to the point
that "it gets you brain dead" (p. 34). This student's reaction to the challenges of reading texts
in the disciplines provides support for the need for explicit instruction related to how to nav-
igate disciplinary texts.

      The Arts

How do artists, musicians, and dancers learn about their discipline? They engage in reading
and writing like other content area experts; however, many specialists in the arts also spend
considerable time engaging in and viewing creative expressions of their disciplines (Moxley,
2012), perhaps in slightly different ways than what has been described so far. In the arts, the
idea of what constitutes texts needs to be broadened once again to include even more diverse
modes of communication such as paintings, drawings, photographs, sculptures, dance move-
ments, and musical performances. Teaching a student to play a musical instrument would
likely not involve poring over textbooks and articles and then writing a research paper about
playing the instrument. Instead, the student would likely view a model of someone playing the
instrument so that he or she could carefully observe body movements, postures, and the cre-
ation of music. Reading about how to place a violin under the chin, versus viewing a picture or
even experiencing an expert placing the violin under a student's chin, provide vastly different
information to a novice musician. In addition to modeling, teachers of music observe a stu-
dent practicing the instrument and provide frequent feedback to help the student progress in
learning. When considering examples such as these, it is easy to see how important certain
aspects of literacy are to the arts, such as viewing and performing.

   Disciplinary literacy in the arts makes unique demands on teachers and students, with
examples included in Table 2. Specialized materials do not include supplies such as Bunsen
burners or graphing calculators but include materials like paints, sheet music, and color
wheels. As in many other disciplines, learning in the arts requires focused processing of visual
and/or auditory information, as well as the integration of that information with other print-
based modes of communication, such as articles, books, reviews, and concert programs. An
important aspect of musical and performing arts is engagement in rehearsals, which involve
repeated practice that culminates in performances that eventually meet standards to be more
formally shared with others. Just as the work of a student learning science may reach a cer-
tain standard to be presented at a science fair or conference, the work of individuals in the
arts often culminates in the creation of portfolios, exhibitions, or stage performances.

   The specialized nature of literacy in the arts can again be understood by considering vio-
lations of conventions within the discipline. Recall our despondent chemist who was waving
his test tube in surrender. Imagine if he decided to express the findings of his experiment by
engaging in interpretive dance or by breaking into song! Likewise, imagine an audience's reac-
tion if a performance artist approached a podium to give a long speech describing a series of
dance movements. Teaching students about various modes of expression in the arts and other

                                                           12. Culturally Responsive Disciplinary Literacy Strategies Instruction | 183
disciplines does not mean unnecessarily restricting their response patterns but involves help-
ing them understand what their response patterns mean within each discipline.

   Teachers in the arts can guide students in using literacy strategies to learn within their
discipline. For example, a text feature in theater might include the placement of masking
tape on a stage to signal location of movement. While some students may be able to deduce
the meaning of this cue, other students may need more direct teaching to comprehend the
meanings of arts-based terms and symbols, such as stage tape. For this type of instruction to
occur, it may be helpful for theater teachers to think about a stage as a text and how stage
tape acts as a text feature that has specialized meaning that can be taught. Likewise, think-
ing about other arts-based texts such as photographs, color wheels, and musical scores can
help prompt teachers to explain the meaning of discipline specific text features such as color,
space, texture, and movement (Moxley, 2012).

   In summary, texts in mathematics, history, science, and the arts have many unique features
that potentially pose challenges for students trying to gain understanding of the discipline
specific content these texts contain. It is for this reason that teachers need to address the
challenges these texts pose through the teaching of literacy strategies, including disciplinary
literacy strategies, to scaffold learning. Although it is not realistic to expect secondary stu-
dents to become disciplinary experts (Heller, 2010), it is realistic for students to engage "in the
kinds of knowledge production and representation, on a limited scale, of course, that mem-
bers of the various disciplines enact on a regular basis" (Moje, 2010, p. 275). Both teachers and
secondary students need to think about, learn, and try out specialized literacy strategies to
communicate and learn within and across the disciplines.

                    Culturally Responsive Teaching

Up to this point, what has been discussed in this chapter has emphasized the importance of
teaching students how to use literacy strategies to improve learning in content area classes.
In addition to this approach to teaching, it is also important to develop skills and strategies to
support students related to cultural factors that also play a role in facilitating learning. One
approach involves using teaching that is "culturally responsive" (Gay 2010), which includes
thinking beyond teaching content to thinking about teaching students. Culturally responsive
teaching involves ways of educating students based on principles of social justice. A key pur-
pose of culturally responsive teaching is to provide all students with learning opportuni-
ties, regardless of their gender, race, ethnicity, or first language. (Ladson-Billings, 1994). Moje
(2007) has characterized this trait as teaching with social justice. An equally important pur-
pose discussed by Moje is the idea of teaching for social justice. Teaching with social justice,
referred to by Moje as teaching in socially just ways, focuses on the process of teaching that
includes providing access to learning opportunities. Teaching for social justice leads to more
socially just outcomes designed to address and correct unjustified power differences in soci-
ety. Each of these concepts will be discussed more in the next section as they have bearing on
culturally responsive teaching.

Culturally Responsive Teaching with Social Justice

Culturally responsive teaching with social justice brings cultural and linguistic strengths of
students into the classroom. This approach requires being deliberate about getting to know
and understand the knowledge and experiences students have acquired outside of school,
along with respecting, valuing, and using these "funds of knowledge" (Moll, Amanti, Neff, &

184 | 12. Culturally Responsive Disciplinary Literacy Strategies Instruction
Gonzalez, 1992) when teaching. A primary goal of culturally responsive teaching is to ensure
that students from diverse backgrounds have meaningful opportunities to experience quality
instruction that consistently incorporates cultural components to support learning.

   Culturally responsive teachers support students by seeking out knowledge about different
cultures. Teachers may do this by asking students direct questions, asking students to com-
plete interest inventories, meeting with families, attending cultural events in communities,
and seeking out information about cultural traditions through reading, viewing, and traveling.
Culturally responsive teachers also seek to understand how their own backgrounds, experi-
ences, and biases may influence their teaching, such as having different expectations for var-
ious student groups based on stereotypes.

   One way that researchers have learned about culturally responsive teaching is by exploring
and deconstructing examples of what happens in classrooms. For example, research by Moje
and Hinchman (2004) highlighted the culturally responsive practices that a seventh grade sci-
ence teacher named Ms. Hall enacted. Ms. Hall was observed teaching a unit related to com-
municable diseases in a classroom that included a group of mostly African American students.
Moje and Hinchman observed that Ms. Hall appeared to have gotten to know her students well
and used that knowledge to help students connect their everyday language and experiences
to new concepts being taught. Ms. Hall made curriculum changes to bring students' interests
into the classroom, as well as encouraged her students to communicate using language most
familiar to them, rather than demand that discussions use only Standard American English.
Ms. Hall also decided to change texts from ones that had little to do with her students' lives
to texts that her students would be able to relate to more easily. She strove to meet lesson
objectives using resources that better matched her students' backgrounds and interests.

   Research on culturally responsive teaching has mostly included the use of qualitative meth-
ods, such as observing and interviewing small samples of teachers and students (Epstein,
Mayorga, & Nelson, 2011; Ladson-Billings, 1994; Moje & Hinchman, 2004). These research
methods have been most useful for exploring culturally responsive teaching because to date,
there are no standardized prescriptions for how to enact culturally responsive teaching.
Engaging in this kind of teaching depends on characteristics of students in specific class-
rooms, as well as characteristics of their families and communities. Culturally responsive
teaching is complex and requires flexibility, which is why culturally responsive teaching has
been mostly studied using qualitative forms of inquiry. Based on what has been learned
through research, culturally-based theories of teaching continue to be refined to better
inform teaching practices.

Culturally Responsive Teaching for Social Justice

Culturally responsive teaching for social justice goes beyond providing access to learning
opportunities and focusing on how to effectively help students learn and apply content
knowledge, to answering the question of how students can "question, challenge, and recon-
struct knowledge" (Moje, 2007; p. 4). In other words, rather than the primary focus being on
bridging what students know with what they need to learn, culturally responsive teaching
for social justice includes a focus on how what is learned can be used to address power and
oppression in society. Some researchers have used the term "culturally-relevant teaching" to
describe this additional focus (Ladson-Billings, 1994), while other researchers have included
these components within the framework of culturally responsive teaching (Moje, 2007).

   A book chapter by Moje (2007) entitled Developing Socially Just Subject Matter Instruction:
A Review of the Literature on Disciplinary Literacy Teaching represents a unique effort to syn-

                                                           12. Culturally Responsive Disciplinary Literacy Strategies Instruction | 185
thesize culturally responsive teaching with disciplinary literacy, which is not an easy task.
Recall that teaching students to use disciplinary literacy strategies requires initiation into
established traditions of academic disciplines, which Moje describes as students needing
"access to knowledge deemed valuable by the content domains" (p. 1). While this purpose may
seem in opposition to the ideas of using and valuing students' knowledge and experiences, it
actually is not. Culturally responsive disciplinary literacy instruction involves respecting what
students know and can do, creating bridges between out-of-school knowledge and discipli-
nary knowledge, and teaching students to critique ways in which knowledge traditions can
transmit or transcend oppression in society. Unfortunately, there are some barriers that may
exist to becoming a more culturally responsive teacher; however, becoming aware of these
barriers can be a helpful step toward learning to overcome them.

The Influence of Apprenticeship of Observation

One possible barrier to becoming a culturally responsive teacher is based on a theory by Lor-
tie (1975) known as "the apprenticeship of observation" (p. 61). This theory cautions that pre-
service teachers may believe that because they observed so much teaching happen when they
were in school that teaching merely involves replicating what they experienced (Lortie, 1975).
This belief is especially problematic when preservice teachers who attended mostly suburban
and rural schools rely on approaches they observed as the basis to teach students from cul-
turally- and linguistically-diverse backgrounds.

   I once saw an example of this kind of incompatibility while observing a young White pre-
service teacher who was trying to make a point to a group of mostly Black students about
the influence of wealth on a person's life. During the lesson, the preservice teacher provided
an example of wealth by referring to Bill and Melinda Gates, who are wealthy White business
people in the U.S. Some students began nodding their heads at the reference, whereas other
students just looked puzzled. Finally, a student raised her hand to generate a more familiar
reference point for wealthy people and asked, "You mean like Jay Z?" When the teacher nod-
ded hesitantly (he did not seem certain who Jay Z was), an audible, "Ohhhhh," rippled through
the classroom. Essentially, the inquiring student created a culturally responsive reference
point for the rest of the students rather than the teacher creating it.

   When I debriefed with the preservice teacher after his lesson, I recounted with him what I
had observed. He said that he thought his reference to the Gates couple was a good example
and faulted the students for not understanding it. He had not even considered the idea of
asking his students to generate examples of people who are wealthy, and he did not seem to
appreciate the benefits that accompany using students' funds of knowledge in teaching. Per-
haps it had not occurred to him that there are people of color who are wealthy as well. My
impression was that the preservice teacher planned examples that helped him make connec-
tions but had not yet developed the insight to realize why his example failed to work within
this context. The example illustrates the importance of teaching in ways that go beyond a sin-
gle perspective.

   Disciplinary literacy and culturally responsive teaching rely on teachers being open to per-
spectives outside of their own, being flexible in how they teach content, and situating teach-
ing and learning within a social justice framework. When content area teachers incorporate
disciplinary literacy strategies into their teaching, their students' understanding of the con-
tent can be extended. When content area teachers teach in culturally responsive ways, they
can help students better leverage discipline specific knowledge to negotiate a world that priv-
ileges some at the expense of others.

                                    Summary

Teaching literacy strategies is often associated with English language arts; however, this
chapter has stressed the importance of literacy as being fundamental to learning in all
academic disciplines. While teaching basic literacy skills and generalizable comprehension
strategies have a strong research base for promoting comprehension, disciplinary literacy
strategies are conditional and require deep understanding of the knowledge traditions and
communication styles used within and across disciplines. Texts used in mathematics, history,
science, and the arts differ in important ways that require content area teachers to know how
to use the most effective literacy strategies. Because an emphasis on the use of disciplinary
literacy strategies is so new, more research is needed to determine the degree to which stu-
dents actually benefit from the instruction.

   In addition to teaching disciplinary literacy strategies, teachers can adjust what they teach
and how they teach according to the cultural characteristics and funds of knowledge of their
students. Learning about the knowledge and experiences that students bring into school is
consistent with culturally responsive teaching and socially just educational practices. Stu-
dents can also be taught to use discipline specific knowledge to negotiate a complex, and at
times, unjust world. Work by Moje (2007) has affirmed the importance of not only teaching
with socially just methods but teaching for social justice. Using both culturally responsive
teaching practices and disciplinary literacy strategies is essential to address the needs of an
increasingly diverse population of students who are expected to achieve high levels of literacy
and content knowledge across all academic disciplines.

   Questions and Activities

      1. How are generalizable literacy strategies and disciplinary literacy strategies different?
           Describe why and how they can be explicitly taught in content area classes.

      2. Do you believe that content area teachers should be teaching literacy strategies? Discuss
           your beliefs about teaching literacy strategies in content area classes.

      3. Identify examples of texts you have encountered in different disciplines and discuss the
           different strategies you have applied to comprehend and learn from them.

      4. What is culturally responsive teaching, and why is it important to serving the needs of a
           diverse student population?

      5. Discuss ways that disciplinary literacy strategies can be used along with culturally-
           responsive teaching methods. What are some of the challenges teachers face when trying
           to meet the needs of all students in content area classes?

                                     Abstract

World language education in the U.S. has been conceived of in myriad ways since its formal
introduction in the 19th century, with more and less attention to students' literacy develop-
ment along the way. This chapter provides an overview of the shifts within the field histori-
cally and into the current time, explains why these shifts occurred, and identifies their impact
on literacy development in the secondary world language classroom. It also delves into recent
influences on the field of English language literacy education that have informed and influ-
enced world language education, and it models how current standards-based world language
educational practices can and do promote secondary students' literacy development.

   Learning Objectives

     After reading this chapter, readers will be able to

       · identify methods and approaches to world language education over time and their atten-
           tion to literacy development;

       · discover multiple ways that literacy is embedded into current concepts, practices, and
           guiding documents of world language education;

       · design standards-based instruction for the world language classroom that promotes sec-
           ondary students' literacy development.

                                  Introduction

Whether the field is referred to as world language, modern language, foreign language, lan-
guage other than English (LOTE), or second language education, each of its many labels show-
cases the same word: language. If you ask middle- and high-school students in this field what
they want to be able to do with the new language they are learning, they will likely respond
that they want to be able to speak it. Invisible in these labels and the minds of most world lan-
guage students are additional concepts of literacy. In today's world language classroom, liter-
acy refers to the capacity to communicate, or perform, in the interconnected ways and for the
varied purposes that real-world contexts demand through listening, reading, viewing, writ-
ing, and speaking. Those real-world contexts--for world language learners--typically embody
the perspectives of the culture studied, thus adding an additional layer of complexity to the
task of becoming literate in the new language. This definition of literacy is at the heart of the
current learning standards, the World-Readiness Standards for Learning Languages (National
Standards in Foreign Language Education Project [NSFLEP], 2015), that will be discussed more

                                                                                                                                                               191
fully later in this chapter. Note that this definition of literacy, as well as some other definitions
used in this chapter, vary slightly from those stated in Chapter 1 of this textbook, since world
language education is a distinct field with its own unique, yet related, definitions.

   The view of literacy in the world language classroom defined above is relatively new. This
chapter provides an overview of how world language educators have thought about literacy
over time, how early literacy practices in world language education align to the current defin-
ition, and what events and influences have led to the current definition and related practices.
The chapter also identifies multiple ways in which literacy is addressed in current concepts
and practices of world language education, and it includes teaching strategies for promoting
standards-based literacy development within the secondary world language classroom.

 Historical Perspectives on World Language Education and
                                     Literacy

Eight major methods and approaches to world language education have been implemented in
the U.S. since the 19th century. A method is a fixed set of procedures that teachers and stu-
dents must follow, while an approach is more flexible in practice (Omaggio Hadley, 2001). Each
of these eight methods and approaches is described below and represented in Table 1 to the
extent that its attention to literacy is made visible. The purpose for this section is to show the
reader how literacy has been addressed in varying ways and to varying degrees in the world
language education classroom over time. The methods and approaches are presented in the
order they were introduced. As they are all still used to some degree in the U.S. and elsewhere,
they are written about in the present tense.

Nineteenth to 20th Century: First Methods and Approaches

      Grammar-translation method

Although humans have learned languages of other lands and peoples for millennia, formal
world language education traces its roots to the Renaissance and the teaching of Latin and
Greek. In the 19th century, the method used to teach these two classical languages took on a
new name and a new role. The Grammar-Translation Method, as it is now known, was adopted
for use in the teaching of modern world languages. What gives the method its name is its
attention to the memorization of grammar rules and the line-by-line translation of authen-
tic target language literary texts into the native language. The word authentic means that the
literature was written by native speakers for native speakers of the language in which it was
written. Target language refers to the language being studied, while native language is the first
or home language of the students (Shrum & Glisan, 2010).

   Grammar-Translation focuses on print literacy as students closely read texts and then write
translations and answers to comprehension questions and grammar exercises. The close way
in which the literature is read and translated can be particularly effective in helping advanced
students understand precise meanings (Horwitz, 2008), and reading authentic literature can
deepen students' understandings of the perspectives of the target culture. Target culture
refers to the culture associated with the language, and in this case, literature being studied.

   Although Grammar-Translation had a significant impact on how modern world language
education practices were established, it limits what students learn to do with the target lan-
guage. As a result, alternative methods and approaches began to appear in the early 20th cen-
tury.

      Direct method

The Direct Method--unlike Grammar-Translation--exclusively engages students with the tar-
get language with an emphasis on oral language. Students listen to teacher-delivered target
language conversations and simultaneously view accompanying gestures and visuals to make
meaning of what is being said, to acquire vocabulary, and to determine rules of language.
What students discover through listening and viewing is then reinforced as they read texts
that contain the same words and concepts. Students apply what they have learned in guided
spoken interactions with others. With everyday topics being the focus of both oral and writ-
ten texts, the Direct Method is intended to prepare students for real-world communication.

      Reading approach

The Reading Approach emerged to fill a gap when there were too few U.S. teachers proficient
enough in the target language to deliver the conversational instruction required by the Direct
Method (Celce-Murcia, 2001). This approach returned to the text-based study of language
without specific requirements for target- or native-language use by the teacher or students.
As the name implies, the Reading Approach has a singular focus: for students to be able to
read target language texts. The study of vocabulary and grammar is emphasized only to the
degree that it facilitates students' ability to comprehend increasingly more complex texts. Lit-
tle to no attention is paid to oral language.

                                                                                                13. World Language and Literacy Learning | 193
Mid- to Late-20th Century: Theoretically-Based Methods and
Approaches

As the 20th century progressed, the field of world language education became increasingly
integrated with the fields of psychology and linguistics. Psychology is the study of the human
mind and behaviors, and linguistics is the study of language and its structure. These were
appealing partners as they provided systematic ways to think about language learning, and
relatedly, language teaching. As a result, methods and approaches to world language educa-
tion introduced in the mid- to late-20th century were built on theories, research, and princi-
ples from these and other closely related fields.

      Audiolingual method

The Audiolingual Method introduced in the mid-20th century is based on two key assump-
tions: 1) learning a second language is similar to learning a first language, which is based on
a theory of linguistics, and 2) language learning is habit formation, which is based on a the-
ory from behaviorist psychology. In line with these ideas, the Audiolingual Method prescribes
strict procedures that begin with students listening to a target language dialogue and orally
imitating what they hear. Oral repetition and drills of dialogue content are used to help stu-
dents build the "habit" of spoken language. Reading and writing are introduced later to rein-
force concepts initially learned through oral language. Although students engage in listening,
speaking, reading, and writing, the Audiolingual Method does not prepare students for com-
munication in real-world contexts.

      Cognitive code method

The Cognitive Code Method was developed as a response to the limitations of the Audiolingual
Method and incorporated newer theories of linguistics and cognitive psychology. Cognitive
Code starts with what students already know about language and then gradually builds their
capacity to speak, listen, read, and write in the target language from the starting point of that
prior knowledge. During this process, students are expected to generate their own meanings,
acquire the rules for language use, build communicative competence, and be able to perform
in the target language. In cognitive psychology, rule acquisition is the subconscious process
of "picking up" how language works, competence refers to a learner's instinctive knowledge of
the language system, and performance is the learner's ability to produce the language (Shrum
& Glisan, 2010).

      Affective-humanistic approaches

From the 1970s to 1980s, humanistic psychology influenced world language education by
introducing a variety of approaches that primarily plan for comfortable, low-anxiety learning
environments. For example, the Community Language Learning approach borrowed tech-
niques from the field of counseling to build students' confidence to speak the target language,
first with the teacher, and then with other students. Although the Affective-Humanistic
approaches are varied in their influences and strategies, what they share is the focus on
building students' comfort and confidence more than any particular literacy skills.

      Input methods

Input--or Comprehension-based--methods were introduced at around the same time as Affec-
tive-Humanistic approaches. Input methods are based on understandings from linguistics

194 | 13. World Language and Literacy Learning
and cognitive psychology that children require time and large quantities of comprehensible
input to acquire a language. Input in this context refers to the language children hear. A well-
known Input method known as Total Physical Response (TPR) requires students to respond
physically rather than verbally as they listen to commands given in the target language.
Listening is primary and is considered to be the first literacy-related skill that precedes
all others. Speaking then emerges when students feel ready. Limitations of Total Physical
Response to promote students' target language reading and writing motivated the creation of
an enhanced Input method in the 1990s, known as Total Physical Response Storytelling (TPRS).
With its increased emphasis on reading, TPRS later came to stand for Teaching Proficiency
through Reading and Storytelling.

      Communicative language teaching

Communicative Language Teaching (CLT), which also emerged in the 1970s and 1980s, pro-
motes students' target language learning through engagement with meaningful tasks, con-
tent, or texts that gradually increase in complexity. Tasks refer to target language interactions
that simulate or prepare students for real-world activities. Auditory and written target lan-
guage input is typically authentic in nature and prepares students to engage in contextualized
and culturally-appropriate products, such as conversations and role plays. Communicative
Language Teaching in particular emphasizes the development of communicative competence,
which is the ability to use the words and rules of a language in ways appropriate to the given
culture through a set of communication strategies.

   Returning to the world language definition of literacy presented at the beginning of this
chapter, it is evident that the methods and approaches introduced over the last two centuries
have varied in the ways and degrees to which they promoted students' literacy in the world
language classroom. While attention has been paid to greater and lesser extents to the four
traditional skill areas of reading, writing, speaking, and listening, only more recently have
methods and approaches become intentional in connecting language learning to real-world
purposes, and interconnecting the various skills and modes of communication used to carry
out real-world purposes.

  Preparations for 21st Century World Language Education
                                  and Literacy

Toward the end of the 20th century, the development and publication of language proficiency
guidelines and national language learning standards introduced a new and consistent vision
for what students should know and be able to do in the world language classroom. The follow-
ing section of this chapter describes the proficiency guidelines and learning standards and
explains how they inform both world language teaching and learning.

Introducing Proficiency

Nearing the end of the 20th century, the field of world language education had developed a
number of methods and approaches but was without an "organizing principle" that could cre-
ate consistency and withstand shifts in theories and philosophies (Omaggio Hadley, 2001, p.
88). It was in 1979 that a U.S. presidential commission on language and international studies
determined that proficiency would serve as that organizing principle. Proficiency refers to
what a person can and cannot do with language--with an emphasis on its spontaneous and

                                                                                                13. World Language and Literacy Learning | 195
real-world application--across four skill areas of speaking, writing, reading, and listening,
which are four key elements of this chapter's definition of literacy.

   In 1982, the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) published
the first proficiency guidelines for academic purposes, which they developed from existing
governmental proficiency guidelines. The current ACTFL Proficiency Guidelines 2012 (ACTFL,
2012a) describe reading, writing, speaking, and listening proficiency for five ranges (i.e.,
Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, Superior, and Distinguished) and three sub-levels (low, mid,
and high) found within each of the first three ranges. Proficiency guidelines serve to help
world language educators plan, instruct, and carry out assessments in ways that both target
their students' current level(s) of proficiency and promote students' proficiency development
irrespective of the method or approach to instruction they use.

   Unlike first language literacy instruction that typically takes place at every grade level from
kindergarten to 12th grade (K-12), world language instruction has varied implementation from
state to state and district to district. As a result, an elementary student in a K-12 world lan-
guage program may demonstrate the same level of proficiency in one or more areas (e.g.,
speaking) as a middle or high-school student in a grades 7-12 program. That said, older learn-
ers are likely to advance in proficiency more quickly due to their native language literacy and
cognitive development (Lightbown & Spada, 2013). Ultimately, proficiency in speaking, listen-
ing, reading, and writing is best developed through long sequences of uninterrupted language
study and regular and meaningful use of the target language by the teacher and students
(ACTFL, 2012a).

   With proficiency development not tied to grade or age, it is critical to understand what can
realistically be expected in speaking, listening, reading, and writing at the various proficiency
ranges. Table 2 summarizes key indicators of the first three ranges of the ACTFL Proficiency
Guidelines 2012.

   Notice that the Novice-range user of a language is one whose communication and com-
prehension is most successful in highly familiar and predictable contexts, using words and
memorized expressions. Someone with Intermediate-range proficiency effectively uses sen-
tences and strings of sentences to communicate and comprehend for practical purposes and
in familiar contexts. The Advanced-range language user communicates and comprehends in
paragraphs in more and less familiar contexts in past, present, and future time frames. The
more advanced proficiency ranges--Superior and Distinguished--are not discussed here, as
these are not considered to be achievable within the context of a K-12 program (NSFLEP,
2015). Descriptions of the Novice, Intermediate, and Advanced proficiency levels clearly
describe target language literacy development. Yet, it is important to keep in mind that the
differences in how world and home language education programs are implemented prohibit
any close comparison between students' target and native language literacy development.

Introducing Learning Standards

The second organizing principle introduced to world language education at the approach of
the 21st century was a focus on content learning standards. In 1996, the National Standards
in Foreign Language Education Project (NSFLEP) published Standards for Foreign Language
Learning: Preparing for the 21st Century, which is a document that identified five major goal
areas--Communication, Cultures, Connections, Comparisons, and Communities (5Cs)--and 11
learning standards. These learning standards served to further inform the profession regard-
ing what students in world language classrooms should know and be able to do. The standards
made a clear statement that world language education should promote students' ability to
communicate in multiple interconnected ways for real-world purposes, which are key ideas
found in the definition of literacy presented at the beginning of this chapter. That assertion
was accompanied by the idea that vocabulary and grammar are tools for supporting commu-
nication, which is a stance that seemed to critique the practices of some existing methods
and approaches.

   The following is an overview of the five goal areas and 11 learning standards laid out in the
initial standards document. As will be discussed later in this chapter, these learning standards
were revised and renamed the World-Readiness Standards for Learning Languages in 2015.
The overview below reflects only content that is still accurate and reflective of both the orig-
inal and revised standards.

                                                          13. World Language and Literacy Learning | 197
      Goal area 1: Communication

The first goal area, Communication, is composed of three standards: Interpersonal (1.1), Inter-
pretive (1.2), and Presentational (1.3) Communication. More typically referred to as modes,
each encompasses a purpose for communication, directionality of that communication (i.e.,
one- or two-way), and language skills that can be used to carry it out. The Interpersonal
mode--the exchange and negotiation of spontaneous, two-way messages--occurs in speaking
(e.g., phone conversation, class discussion) as well as in writing (e.g., text message, note to
friend). The Interpretive mode--comprehension and interpretation of oral, print, and visual
messages--takes place through listening (e.g., song, lecture), reading (e.g., short story, graffiti
written on a wall), and viewing (e.g., music video, photographs). The Presentational mode--the
one-way, rehearsed message to a particular audience--is carried out in speaking (e.g., lines in
a play, newscast) and writing (e.g., poem, letter to the editor). When the three Communication
standards or modes are used in integrated or interconnected ways, they collectively embody
all elements of this chapter's literacy definition. The final portion of this chapter provides spe-
cific examples to illustrate the concept of integrated modes of Communication. It is through
the three Communication modes and their embedded language skills that the remaining eight
standards are intended to be carried out. How speaking, listening, reading, and writing are
used across all 11 learning standards is illustrated in Table 3.

198 | 13. World Language and Literacy Learning
      Goal area 2: Cultures

The second goal area, Cultures, includes two standards that together promote students'
understanding of the cultural perspectives that underlie target culture practices (2.1) and tar-
get culture products (2.2). Perspectives refer to the "meanings, attitudes, values, and ideas" of
a given culture, practices are the culture's "patterns of social interaction," and products are the
culture's tangible (e.g., literature) and intangible (e.g., laws) outcomes (NSFLEP, 2006, p. 47). It
is through the modes of Communication that students can directly access and engage with
the "3Ps" of culture, and it is students' understandings of culture that allow them to deeply
carry out the modes of Communication. In other words, the integrated study of language and
culture gives students "the powerful key to successful communication: knowing how, when,
and why, to say what to whom" (NSFLEP, 2006, p. 11).

      Goal area 3: Connections

The Connections goal area, with two standards, aims to reinforce and advance students' con-
tent knowledge through interdisciplinary learning (3.1) and access to information and view-
points only available through the target language (3.2). Interdisciplinary learning integrates
what students learn in other content areas (e.g., science, mathematics) with the language and
culture content of the world language classroom. The acquisition of information and distinct
viewpoints is facilitated when students engage with the people (e.g., email exchange, face-
to-face conversation) and products (e.g., newspaper article, photographs) of a target culture,
engagement that is carried out through the modes of Communication.

      Goal area 4: Comparisons

The two standards of the Comparisons goal area encourage students' contrastive analysis of
language (4.1) and culture (4.2). By learning and reflecting on the words, sounds, structure,
and other characteristics of the target language, students can become more aware of their
native language and language systems in general. By comparing the practices, products, and
perspectives of the target culture with their home culture, students can become more aware
of their own culture and the nature of cultures in general. Language comparisons are inex-
tricably linked to literacy practices as it is only through literacy practices that students carry
them out. Cross-cultural comparisons are facilitated when students engage in the compari-
son using one or more of the modes of Communication.

      Goal area 5: Communities

The final goal area, Communities, also includes two standards. The first calls for students to
use the target language within and outside of the school setting (5.1), and the second for its
use for personal benefit (5.2). Essentially, the Communities standards motivate students to
employ all Communication modes widely in their daily lives.

   The Standards for Foreign Language Learning did not push aside the first organizing princi-
ple of proficiency. Rather, the standards and concepts of proficiency work hand in hand. The
skill areas of speaking, writing, reading, and listening found in the ACTFL Proficiency Guide-
lines 2012 are embedded within the three modes of Communication and serve as a means
to measure students' communicative performances. With Communication as the vehicle for
achieving all the standards, students are continuously developing not only their proficiency
but also their literacy.

                                                                                                13. World Language and Literacy Learning | 199
            A New Standards Era and World Languages

The beginning of the 21st century brought changes to the educational landscape that seemed
to overlook the role of world language education. This section of the chapter discusses what
these changes were and how world language education leadership was proactive in making
the work of the field visible, particularly in relationship to its focus on literacy development.

Common Core and World Languages

A new era in the educational standards movement began when the National Governors Asso-
ciation and the Council of Chief State School Officers published the Common Core State Stan-
dards for English Language Arts (ELA) and Literacy in History/Social Studies, Science, and
Technical Subjects (CCSS; National Governors Association Center for Best Practices & Council
of Chief State School Officers [NGA & CCSSO], 2010). Assertions about what students need
to know and be able to do to be successful in college shaped the initial College- and Career-
Readiness Anchor Standards and the subsequent K-12 standards. Acknowledgement that stu-
dents' college- and career-readiness relied on their ability to enact literacies in a digital age
meant that research and media literacy skills were blended into the four major skill-based
strands of the new standards. Despite organizing around strands of Reading, Writing, Speak-
ing and Listening, and Language, the Common Core ELA Standards are described as "an inte-
grated model of literacy" in which all processes of communication are connected (NGA &
CCSSO, 2010, p. 4). To a large extent, the skill integration and connected processes of com-
munication mirror the recently-forged relationship in world language education between the
ACTFL Proficiency Guidelines and the Standards for Foreign Language Learning. Yet, the Com-
mon Core ELA Standards document did not explicitly name or identify the place of world
languages among the disciplines to which it said the standards applied. In response, ACTFL
crafted the Alignment of the National Standards for Learning Languages with Common Core
State Standards (ACTFL, 2012b), to make visible the strong alignment of the Standards for For-
eign Language Learning to the Common Core ELA Standards, to perhaps claim its place rel-
ative to literacy development, as well as to assert an important difference. ACTFL illustrated
the alignment of the four skills and three modes of Communication and noted similarities
in expectations regarding a balance of text types and purposes for writing. The difference,
ACTFL pointed out, was that world language education must draw on proficiency benchmarks
rather than the grade-level benchmarks of the Common Core ELA Standards, thus situating
the field with the College- and Career-Readiness Anchor Standards rather than the K-12 stan-
dards.

Further Alignments of World Language Education and Literacy

More than a decade into the 21st century, world language education continues to follow the
trajectory of aligning itself closer and more explicitly to the field of literacy education. Two
major initiatives provide evidence of this. First, a multi-year study of the first decade of the
Standards for Foreign Languages (Phillips & Abbott, 2011) resulted in the decision to revise the
standards to more closely reflect the current educational landscape. The resulting World-
Readiness Standards for Learning Languages were published in 2015. These new standards
retained the structure of the original five Goal areas and 11 standards, while providing greater
specificity in regard to literacy development and real-world applications, as represented in
the Common Core ELA Standards, College- and Career-Readiness Anchor Standards, and 21st
Century Skills (NSFLEP, 2013; see Table 4).

      Second, a nationwide movement to promote biliteracy, or college- and career-ready pro-
ficiency in two languages, has resulted in several state governments' adoption of the Seal of
Biliteracy, which is a designation attached to qualifying students' high school diplomas and
transcripts. After seeing this California-based initiative take hold across the U.S., ACTFL part-
nered with the National Association of Bilingual Education (NABE), the National Council of
State Supervisors for Languages (NCSSFL), and TESOL International Association to develop
and publish the Guidelines for Implementing the Seal of Biliteracy (2015). In these guidelines,
ACTFL et al. propose that consistency of meaning across contexts is key and can only be
achieved through proficiency-based implementation. The Seal of Biliteracy Guidelines, there-
fore, identify the level of proficiency that students should be required to demonstrate across
all modes of Communication and suggest acceptable forms of evidence. While world language
education seemed to have had little direction or goal orientation regarding literacy develop-
ment in its early years, the last few decades have brought it closer and more deeply commit-
ted to all students' literacy development.

       Standards-Based Planning in the World Language
                                   Classroom

Planning for literacy learning in the world language classroom requires understanding the
Communication standards individually and in relationship to one another. It means knowing
how to select or design tasks appropriate to the mode of Communication and students' pro-
ficiency levels. It means planning for students' deep and meaningful learning and perfor-
mances. This final portion of the chapter breaks down and explains these concepts with
illustrations and examples at two levels of proficiency.

Planning for Integrated Modes of Communication

As defined earlier in this chapter, literacy in the world language classroom involves the capac-
ity to communicate in interconnected or integrated ways. What must be integrated are the
three modes of Communication, which as discussed earlier, include Interpersonal, Interpre-
tive, and Presentational Communication. To understand this idea, it is helpful to think of these
three modes as interconnected cogs on a wheel. When one is engaged, it sets the others
into motion. Any cog can turn first, engaging those beside it. To plan for students' integrated
Communication, the teacher starts by selecting the mode most appropriate for the instruc-
tional goal, text, or task and then plans for the mode that allows students to elaborate on
what they have learned. Texts are works that are interpreted through listening, reading, or
viewing. Tasks refer to communicative endeavors that students are expected to carry out. For
example, students might listen to a target language song (text) about the environment and
write down words they think contribute to the song's message (Interpretive mode task). Stu-
dents subsequently have a conversation in small groups to try to persuade others of the song's
message by sharing the evidence they collected (Interpersonal mode task). Once small groups
have selected what they believe to be the song's message, they create a written and illustrated
poster to present the message to others (Presentational mode task). Despite this well-ordered
example that moves students across all three modes of Communication, it is not always nec-
essary to plan for each of the three modes' successive use before returning to a given mode.
For example, the teacher in this case might want to build students' background knowledge
about environmental issues in the country from which the song came by showing students
a video prior to having them listen to the song. In other words, this might be a case where
engaging students with interpreting two texts first might better build their capacity to carry
out the related Interpersonal and Presentational tasks.

Planning with Proficiency in Mind

As seen in the summary of the ACTFL Proficiency Descriptors 2012 in Table 2, what students
can be expected to do with the target language is directly related to their proficiency level.
Therefore, both text and task selection should take proficiency into account. A document
that can simplify teachers' proficiency-based planning across modes of Communication is the
NCSSFL-ACTFL Can-Do Statements (NCSFFL-ACTFL, 2013). Concise first-person statements
or benchmarks of performance are presented for all proficiency sub-levels for Interpersonal
Communication, Presentational Speaking, Presentational Writing, Interpretive Listening, and
Interpretive Reading (pp. 4-5). Using the NCSSFL-ACTFL Can-Do Statements, it can be seen
that the text and tasks described in the previous section would be particularly appropriate
for Novice High level learners, which would be students in perhaps the third year of a typical
7-12 language program. The Novice High benchmark for Interpretive Listening states, "I can
often understand words, phrases, and simple sentences related to everyday life. I can recog-
nize pieces of information and sometimes understand the main topic of what is being said" (p.
4). This benchmark is clearly reflected in the Interpretive task of listening to a song to extract
key words with the goal of identifying its message. The Novice High benchmark for Interper-
sonal Speaking states, "I can communicate and exchange information about familiar topics
using phrases and simple sentences, sometimes supported by memorized language (p. 4). This
is visible when students use information collected from the song to try to persuade others of
its message. Finally, the Novice High benchmark for Presentational Writing states, "I can write
short messages...on familiar topics related to everyday life" (p. 4). These short messages are
made evident in the writing and illustration on posters that students create.

                                                                                               13. World Language and Literacy Learning | 203
Aligning with the Common Core

As previously discussed in this chapter, integrated literacy is not only the intention and
domain of the World-Readiness Standards for Learning Languages but also of the Common
Core ELA Standards. As each mode of Communication in the World-Readiness Standards for
Learning Languages embodies more than one language skill, and the Common Core ELA Stan-
dards are organized by language skill, alignment requires a two-step task analysis that begins
with identifying the language skill and then the purpose for which that language skill is to
be used. Using the examples from above, when students listen to a song for the purpose of
interpreting its message through evidence (Interpretive Communication), they also address
Common Core Speaking and Listening (SL) Anchor Standard 3: "Evaluate a speaker's point of
view, reasoning, and use of evidence and rhetoric" (NGA & CCSSO, 2010, p. 48). When stu-
dents have a conversation in small groups to try to persuade others using evidence (Inter-
personal Communication), they additionally address elements of Common Core Speaking and
Listening (SL) Anchor Standard 1: "Prepare for and participate effectively in a range of con-
versations and collaborations with diverse partners, building on others' ideas and express-
ing their own clearly and persuasively" (p. 48). When students create a written and illustrated
poster that presents a message (Presentational Communication), they simultaneously address
elements of Common Core Writing (W) Anchor Standard 2: "Write informative/explanatory
texts to examine and convey complex ideas and information clearly and accurately through
the effective selection, organization, and analysis of content" (p. 41). As previously explained,
proficiency levels rather than grade levels must serve as benchmarks in the field of world
language education. Additional examples of integrated modes of communication and literacy
aligned to both sets of standards and at two proficiency levels can be found in Table 5.

Planning for Deep Learning

The integrated communicative tasks described above clearly come together to build and rein-
force students' conceptual understandings and their knowledge, capacity, and confidence
with multiple elements of target language literacy. Yet, a single pass through the integrated
modes of Communication is not sufficient to build depth, and depth matters when the goals
are to build students' proficiency and literacy in the target language. Depth is best accom-
plished through multiple well-planned passes that allow students to not only explore and
expand conceptual understandings and language but also to revisit, re-examine, and reinforce
their learning.

   Interdisciplinary themes and core texts are two planning approaches that facilitate deep
learning. An interdisciplinary theme refers to a unifying concept or topic around which
instruction is designed. It can incorporate multiple and varied texts, multiple entry points,
and multiple perspectives. A core text is a multi-part text in which each part interconnects
with other parts and subsequent parts build on concepts and language from earlier ones
(Clementi & Terrill, 2013). One potential model for interdisciplinary thematic planning was
proposed by Clementi and Terrill (2013), who suggested that thematic instruction should
begin with "the personal level (Knowing Myself), to where the learner lives locally, regionally,
nationally (Exploring Communities), and globally (Engaging with the World)" (p. 3). Using this
model in a unit on the environment at the Novice High level of proficiency, Knowing Myself
might involve students surveying classmates about what they currently do to help the envi-
ronment in their home and school (Interpersonal), view an on-line video about what young
people can do at home and school to help their environment (Interpretive), and write a list
of actions to take to better maintain their home and school environment (Presentational).
Exploring Communities might involve students reading a U.S. government multilingual web-
page with advice on protecting the environment (Interpretive), discuss which of their cur-
rent and planned environmental behaviors align with the advice (Interpersonal), and create an
infographic of environmentally-friendly practices (Presentational). Engaging the World might
have students view photographs that reflect environmental issues and solutions in parts of
the world where the target language is spoken (Interpretive), interview an environmentalist in
the U.S. and in a target language-speaking country via Skype about environmental issues and
solutions (Interpersonal), and create a chart to compare environmental issues and/or solu-
tions of the U.S. and the target language-speaking country (Presentational). Note that the pre-
ceding examples were written to illustrate the model; therefore, not all tasks or steps within
them were made fully visible or were fully described.

Planning for Quality Tasks

It is through the communication tasks students carry out that texts are made meaningful
to them. Using an example from above, photographs of environmental issues and solutions,
visual texts, might catch students' attention and fleeting interest; however, tasks such as writ-

                                                  13. World Language and Literacy Learning | 205
ing questions about observations from the photographs, interviewing environmentalists, and
creating a cross-cultural comparison chart promote students' deep meaning-making, espe-
cially as it relates to the goals of instruction.

   Designing a quality task means planning for all students' active engagement in a given
mode of Communication. Active engagement within the context of Communication means
that every student is producing or interpreting the target language throughout the duration
of the task. Tasks used early in instruction should incorporate sufficient support to allow all
students to meaningfully communicate before having fully acquired the necessary vocabulary
or grammar. For example, when having the students carry out the task described above of
surveying classmates about what they do to help the environment at home and school, the
teacher might provide them a survey form that includes the interview question and possible
responses in the target language. Other forms of support include sentence starters or fill-ins,
interview guides, charts, visual clues, and more. The use of planned supports can bolster stu-
dents' early ability and confidence to communicate with new content and/or new language.
Over time, and with practice, students should be able to perform similar tasks with less and
less external support.

Selecting Task Design

Task design should match the expectations of the given mode of Communication. As Inter-
personal Communication requires students to interact and negotiate meaning spontaneously
with others orally, in writing, or digitally, interpersonal tasks must be designed to facilitate
such interactions. Interviews, surveys, conversations, discussions, peer problem-solving,
spontaneous role plays, emails, and texts, are all tasks that, by design, promote Interpersonal
Communication.

   Interpretive Communication requires students to comprehend, interpret, and analyze what
they hear, read, or view in the target language. Comprehension, the first expectation of this
standard, refers to students' literal understandings based on perspectives of their home cul-
ture. Tasks well designed to elicit comprehension include, but are not limited to, answering
questions; completing sentences, charts, or graphic organizers; showing response cards;
manipulating objects or visuals; illustrating; and physically performing actions. Interpretation
and analysis, the additional expectations of the Interpretive Communication standard, require
students to engage in higher-order thinking and demonstrate understandings of target cul-
ture perspectives. Tasks that facilitate these elements include discussion, debate, role play,
hypothesizing, predicting, linguistic and cross-cultural analyses, most or all of which may
have limited application at the Novice level.

   Presentational communication requires students to present information and ideas for var-
ious purposes to audiences who may be listening, reading, and/or viewing what they have
prepared, edited, and rehearsed in oral, written, and/or digital formats. Presentational task
possibilities are endless and are best conceived of in relationship to real-life performances or
products related to the interdisciplinary theme, core text, or other organizing principle. For
example, returning to the theme of environment, students might write a list of rules, deliver a
speech, or record a song or public service announcement about what teens can do to protect
the environment.

Assessing Communication

Whether the tasks address Interpersonal, Interpretive, or Presentational Communication,
they are all performances. Therefore, the same criteria that informed task design are those

206 | 13. World Language and Literacy Learning
that should be used by teachers to assess students' performances relative to the standards
and relative to their given level of proficiency. The first-person nature of the aforementioned
NCSSFL-ACTFL Can-Do Statements global benchmarks (e.g., "I can write short messages...on
familiar topics related to everyday life" [p. 4]), also promotes students' self-assessment, which
can lead to increased awareness of their developing proficiency and setting realistic goals.
While tasks across the three modes of Communication can be assessed individually, the opti-
mal assessment is actually the one that is complex and looks at students' performances across
all modes of communication. It is the one that takes into account real-life demands that stu-
dents be able to carry out communication and literacy using all modes and all skills in inter-
connected ways (Adair-Hauck, Glisan, & Troyan, 2013).

                                    Summary

The definition of literacy put forth at the beginning of this chapter states that students of
world languages should be able to communicate in the interconnected ways and for the varied
purposes that real world contexts demand through listening, reading, viewing, writing, and
speaking. Since the inception of modern world language education in the 19th century, there
have been ebbs and flows in regard to how well and to what degree methods and approaches
to teaching world languages have addressed this definition. The late 20th century introduc-
tions of the two organizing principles of proficiency and learning standards formalized expec-
tations for the field and have since provided teachers guidance to design the instruction
envisioned in the definition.

   Swift and significant changes in the recent educational landscape have largely ignored
world language education, which has caused organizations and individuals in the field to make
even more explicit the role of world languages in literacy education. With the American Coun-
cil on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) taking the lead, multiple guiding and elu-
cidating documents have been published since 2010 to illustrate and explain to those within
and outside of the field the many ways in which world language education is a key partner in
students' literacy development. It is with the guidance of these and previous documents that
world language educators themselves have additional support and clarity for selecting texts
and designing tasks and assessments that prepare students to enact literacy in the integrated
ways that the real world demands.

   Questions and Activities

      1. Which methods, approaches, or elements described in this chapter reflect your language
           learning experiences? What impact did these experiences have on your target language
           learning and literacy development? What concepts, practices, and documents described in
           this chapter could have further promoted your language and literacy development?

      2. The World-Readiness Standards for Learning Languages were written to add clarity regard-
           ing what language learners should be able to demonstrate. Analyze the Communication
           standards in the Table 4 comparison chart to note specific ways in which this new clarity
           addresses literacy. Look at the standards in the other four goal areas (Culture, Connec-
           tions, Comparisons, and Communities). In what ways is literacy integrated into these stan-

                                                                                                13. World Language and Literacy Learning | 207
           dards as well?
      3. Visit the website http://sealof biliteracy.org/ and engage in further reading on the Seal of

           Biliteracy. Find out if your state has adopted it, and if so, where the implementation stands.
           What do you see as the advantages to this initiative? Who benefits and why?
      4. Using the Integrated Modes of Communication with Texts and Tasks model (Table 5),
           design a sequence of texts and tasks for the Novice and Intermediate ranges of proficiency
           for the target language you may be preparing to teach or that you studied. Consult relevant
           guiding documents such as the NCSSFL-ACTFL Can-Do Statements and align your
           sequences to the Common Core ELA Standards.

Understanding Your Teaching Self

                                                  Elizabeth Y. Stevens

                                     Abstract

This chapter discusses theories and methods for thinking about how language works in the
world, with an emphasis on teachers' discourses and identities. It includes definitions of dis-
course, Discourse, and identity drawing on the work of James Paul Gee, as well as a review
of two studies on preservice and inservice teachers' discourses and identities. It also intro-
duces critical discourse analysis as a theory and method for analyzing discourse. Further, it
provides ways for preservice teachers to engage in critical identity work through the study of
discourses.

   Learning Objectives

        After reading this chapter, readers will be able to

      1. define discourse and Discourse;
      2. identify how Discourses relate to identities;
      3. consider the Discourses they enact, or act as;
      4. discuss some research findings on teachers' discourses and identities;
      5. define critical discourse analysis as a theory and research method;
      6. consider ways to study their own discourses and identities;
      7. engage in critical identity work.

                                  Introduction

In the most literal sense, James Paul Gee, a Mary Lou Fulton Presidential Professor of Literacy
Studies, defined discourse, with a little d, as stretches of oral or written language-in-use.
He defined Discourse, with a big D, as distinctive ways of using discourse, that is, speaking/
listening and/or reading/writing coupled with ways of acting, interacting, valuing, feeling,
dressing, thinking, and believing (Gee, 2011). Gee's definition of Discourse is a theory that
explains how language works in society. His theory of Discourse is grounded in social and cul-
tural views of literacy. Social and cultural views of literacy suggest that context, history, cul-
ture, discourse, power, and beliefs influence teachers, literacy, and instruction.

   You may be wondering why such seemingly complex terms such as discourse and Discourse
are important for teachers to understand. Research suggests that teachers' discourses, or lan-
guage, can contribute to uneven expectations for students in schools, such as when teachers
use language that favors students more like themselves. It also suggests that when teachers
examine their own discourses, they may better understand who they are as teachers and how

210
their Discourses (ways of speaking, listening, reading, and/or writing integrated with ways of
acting, interacting, valuing, feeling, dressing, thinking, and believing), might lead to inequity
in the classroom. As teachers think about and work against such Discourses, they can provide
fair learning opportunities for all students in schools (Comber & Kamler, 2004; Hall, John-
son, Juzwik, Wortham, & Mosley, 2010). Gee (2012) also asserted that as individuals become
knowledgeable about theories of Discourses, individuals have an "obligation" to reflect on Dis-
courses (p. 216). Thus, as you prepare to assume roles in schools, it is important to understand
how your Discourses influence interactions with students and colleagues, as well as influence
your instructional decisions. In this chapter, you will be provided with ways to consider the
Discourses that you bring to your teaching self.

                        Understanding Discourses

All individuals use "little d" discourses, or language-in-use, to be recognized, or identified,
by others as certain kinds of people (e.g., teacher, bird watcher, doctor). Gee (2000) defined
identity as, "The `kind of person' one is recognized as `being' at a given time and place" (p. 99).
People enact, or act as, multiple identities and Discourses, ways of speaking, listening, read-
ing, and/or writing coupled with ways of acting, interacting, valuing, feeling, dressing, think-
ing, and believing, that depend on the context that they are in at any given time and place.
For example, one can be a teacher and bird watcher, but the language that person uses to be
identified as a teacher may be different than the language the person uses as a bird watcher.

   Individuals also enact identities through language by comparing or contrasting others'
identities to the identities they wish to enact. For example, as you think about yourself as a
teacher, you may compare or contrast yourself to "good" and "bad" teachers you had during
your academic career. When you think of good teachers who taught you in the past, you might
even think of them as influential to your identity as a teacher, and you may hope to emulate
their positive attributes. Teachers sometimes even compare and contrast themselves to stu-
dents. Gee (2011) said, "For example the `Special Ed' teacher needs `Special Ed' (`SPED') stu-
dents and talks about and acts in regard to students in such a way as to create and sustain this
identity as well" (p. 109). So all individuals need other people to enact their identities because
they measure their identities against others (e.g., good and bad teachers and students).

   In addition, there can be conflicts among individuals' multiple Discourses and identities
because they do not always represent consistent and compatible values. Gee (2012) referred
to competing Discourses as "tension" or "conflict" (p. 175). Tensions or conflicts among com-
peting Discourses can be the source of struggle and resistance when individuals bring other
Discourses to their day-to-day interactions. For instance, he suggested that the values of
many school-based Discourses treat certain students as "other," which means students are
sometimes treated differently because of their race, class, gender, or sexuality (Gee, 2012, p.
4).

   An example of tensions or conflicts of competing Discourses was presented in a study by
Hyland (2009) that I will first introduce and then describe in more detail in the next section of
this chapter. Hyland's (2009) study illuminated the challenges one White, female, fourth grade
teacher faced while attempting to build relationships across culture and race with her African
American students. The teacher's Discourses suggested she wanted students to feel impor-
tant, capable, valued, and empowered, and she structured learning tasks in her classroom
accordingly. The teacher's Discourses, however, conflicted with the dominant Discourses of
others in the school. Other teachers were reported to attribute their "dysfunctional" class-
rooms to negative assumptions about students and their families (Hyland, 2009, p. 105). Such

                                                      14. Teacher Discourses and Identities: Understanding Your Teaching Self | 211
competing Discourses made it hard for the teacher to reconcile dominant messages about
her students' African American culture.

   Typically, individuals do not consider their Discourses. It is almost as if Discourses are
unconscious. For this reason, people are not always critical about what counts as "normal"
ways to think, feel, and behave as teachers, bird watchers, or doctors, for example. In this
regard, Discourses can be dangerous because they relate to who has power in society and
have ways of valuing what is "normal" or "good" in ways that "stack the deck" in favor of certain
"kinds of people" (Gee, 2012, p. 165). In spite of creating a classroom environment where stu-
dents were valued and empowered, Hyland (2009) found that the Discourses of the teacher
discussed above hindered her relationships with her students' families because she positioned
students' lives as abnormal compared to her own.

   It is important for individuals, particularly if you are or will be a teacher, to become aware
of your many Discourses because they will influence your interactions with others, students
and colleagues alike. Going forward, consider the Discourses you enact so others recognize
you as a certain kind of person. You may consider yourself a child, a parent, a student, a kind
of professional, and so forth. How do you speak, listen, read, write, act, interact, value, feel,
dress, think, and believe according to these identities? For example, this author's Discourses
differ depending on whether I am with my children at story time at the local library or at the
university asserting myself as a professor. Depending on the context, I enact different Dis-
courses so others recognize me as a certain kind of person (e.g., mother, professor) or to indi-
cate my belonging to various social groups.

                                   Discourses

Some of the research on teachers' discourses shows that teachers draw on what is called
"deficit" Discourses. Deficit Discourses are ways of using language that suggest some indi-
viduals or certain groups in society are failing or deficient, and these are the Discourses that
are important to think about and work against in order to provide more equitable opportu-
nities for all students in schools. A good example of deficit thinking in action is presented by
Hyland (2009), who followed the early career of a fourth grade, White, female teacher intro-
duced earlier. Hyland gathered data over a two-year period, from sources such as observa-
tions, interviews, notes from informal conversations (sometimes in the form of emails), and
entries from the teacher's journal. Hyland studied these data sources for evidence of cultur-
ally relevant pedagogy. Culturally relevant pedagogy is a practice of teaching that embraces
students' backgrounds and makes connections between students' home and school lives while
being aware of and critiquing the oppressive relationships between students' backgrounds
and dominant culture (Beauboeuf-Lafontant, 1999). For more discussion about culturally-
based pedagogies, please see Chapter 12.

   Recall that in Hyland (2009), the White fourth grade teacher's language suggested she val-
ued her students' culture, but she struggled to recognize differences between her life and her
students' lives. The teacher talked about students' families and lives as if they were deficient.
For instance, the teacher suggested that students' language use was deficient and that par-
ents did not read to their children at home. Viewing students and their families in this way
made it difficult for the teacher to make connections to the community. Hyland concluded
that it is important for teachers to be able to recognize and critique deficit Discourses that
are present in schools and society in order to be culturally relevant teachers.

                                Teacher Identity

Studies on preservice teachers' identities show that teachers experience conflicts between
the Discourses they bring to their work and their teacher identities. Preservice denotes the
time before teachers have finished their education and have started teaching. Such studies
show that teachers bring multiple Discourses to their work with students and colleagues,
and that exploring their Discourses can provide them with a greater understanding about
who they are as teachers in ways that may keep them from giving up during their career. In
one study, Alsup (2006) examined the narratives, or stories, of six White, female, preservice
English teachers for five semesters. Alsup's data sources included interviews during which
the preservice teachers told stories about experiences, memories, and tensions they felt as
they were becoming teachers. Her other data sources included the preservice teachers' les-
son plans, philosophy statements, and literacy autobiographies. Alsup studied the teachers'
discourses, focusing on their ideas, issues, experiences, and feelings. She observed tension in
their narratives between their "student" and "teacher" selves, between their personal beliefs
and what they were learning about their future work, and between ways of thinking about
teaching at the university versus practical applications. Alsup noticed teachers were often
expected to conform to a narrowly defined identity corresponding to what they observed and
understood as characteristics of good teachers. As one example, good teachers know how to
engage and manage students. Managing students, as a primary goal, can be associated with
deficit Discourses that suggest students are not capable of thinking critically, participating
in a classroom community, or managing themselves. Alsup found, however, that those who
allowed themselves to experience tensions between the personal and professional were more
likely to pursue jobs as teachers and remain teachers. These teachers remained true to their
personal ideals, and they enacted politically active teacher identities. Alsup concluded that in
order for preservice teachers to be successful in transitioning into their careers, they require
guidance and support from their teacher educators to explore their identities and discourses.

                        Critical Discourse Analysis

As you read in the previous sections, Gee's views of discourse and Discourse are theories
about how language works in the world. All people use discourses, or language-in-use, to
enact their identities and indicate their belonging to social groups. What individuals say and
write, or the discourses they use, shape and are shaped by their ways of seeing themselves
and how they want to be recognized by others as certain kinds of people. Gee (2012) pro-
vided an example of an encounter of contrasting identities that shows what individuals say
and do is how they will be recognized as certain kinds of people. Gee asked us to imagine him,
a professor, driving his motorcycle to a "biker bar." Picture the professor as he enters the bar
and sits next to a burly, leather-jacket wearing man with many tattoos. He says to the man,
"May I please have a match for my cigarette?" Even though Gee's (2012) language is gram-
matically correct, he described his words as "wrong" (p. 2). He suggested it might have been
more appropriate to say something like, "Gotta match?" Gee (2012) asked us to imagine he
used the right words, but picture him carefully wiping off the bar stool with a napkin as to not
get his neatly ironed designer jeans dirty. This shows that individuals enact identities not only
through language, what they say and how they say it, but also through what they do. In Gee's
case, his words and ways of being marked his belonging (or not) to certain social groups. Ideas
about how language works in the world are important to understand as this chapter moves to
another theory and method for analyzing discourses called critical discourse analysis.

                                                     14. Teacher Discourses and Identities: Understanding Your Teaching Self | 213
   Critical discourse analysis is, again, a theory about language that helps explain how lan-
guage works in society, and its roots date back to a French scholar named Michel Foucault.
Foucault proposed that language is not simply words, rather it represents knowledge and
power (Rogers, Malancharuvil-Berkes, Mosley, Hui, & Joseph, 2005). His ideas about language
were important because they were among the first to help people think about how discourses
contribute to social inequality, and more specifically, about who does and does not have
power in society. Scholars such as Chouliaraki and Fairclough (1999), Gee (1999), and Rogers
(2004) continue to develop theories about language and power. While scholars' theories may
vary a bit, those that draw on critical discourse analysis in their work, and are referred to as
critical discourse analysts, generally share some ideas about how language works. Critical dis-
course analysts assume that history, power, and context influence the language that individ-
uals use. This means that words are deeper than the surface of the text. Language is rooted in
history, laden with power, and influenced by the context in which it is used. Critical discourse
analysts also agree that some people are more privileged than others (Rogers et al., 2005).You
may notice critical discourse analysis and big "D" Discourse, discussed earlier, are both theo-
ries that contribute insights about how language works in the world.

   Critical discourse analysis is not only a theory but also a method used in research to analyze
people's language. Data consist of everyday oral and/or written language and is sometimes
referred to as text. As discussed in Chapter 1, texts include a wide range of ways people com-
municate that are not limited to only printed documents. Researchers use many different
approaches to critical discourse analysis in such disciplines as social policy, social work, lin-
guistics, and education to study how language works. There is not a right or wrong way to
do discourse analysis. With a number of approaches of critical discourse analysis at scholars'
dispense, some debate on whether there should be a more standardized approach to critical
discourse analysis. A standardized approach may offer greater consistency across research;
however, the cost is that it may take away researchers' abilities to make decisions about what
approach to critical discourse analysis may best address their research questions.

   Approaches to critical discourse analysis vary in their use of text and content analysis. Some
approaches focus more on text analysis. These approaches require a close focus on the study
of word selection and use of grammar. Text analysis may include noticing word choice, tone,
turn-taking, and body language. A researcher may pay close attention to certain words that
a speaker or writer chooses, to the ways a speaker emphasizes words in his or her talk, or to
how a speaker situates his or her body (e.g., arms crossed, eye rolling, etc.). Other approaches
may focus less on the details of the text and more on the content, which involves the study
of the larger ideas, issues, and themes in individuals' discourses brought about by their back-
grounds beliefs, values, and ideas thought to be true. A researcher may pay close attention
to the content of a speaker or writer's discourse that may reveal his or her ideas about race,
class, and gender. For example, when teachers at urban schools use language that reveals the
belief that parents do not care about their children's education, this content would be noted
by the researcher. An important part of content analysis, then, is finding the links between
individuals' discourses and the larger societal context in order to make connections to the
history and power that language represents.

   Critical discourse analysis attempts to move beyond a description and interpretation of lan-
guage to an explanation of how language works in the world (Rogers et al., 2005). Scholars
purposely choose to use this research method to study identity because it allows them to
examine how individuals make sense of themselves and their world. It ties together individ-
uals' language to what they meant, intended, or sought to accomplish (Gee, 2011). Together,

214 | 14. Teacher Discourses and Identities: Understanding Your Teaching Self
text and content analysis can guide the study of the ways individuals enact socially recogniz-
able Discourses and identities.

   If you find yourself intrigued by the theories and methods discussed in this chapter, you
may want to read How to do Discourse Analysis: A Toolkit. In this text, Gee (2011) provides 27
tools for analyzing discourse. Gee's methods help teachers and researchers to build layers of
meaning about context by asking questions that relate to the text and content or meanings
"hidden" in discourses. Using a sampling of Gee's tools for discourse analysis in Table 1, review
the snippet of transcribed data in Table 2.

   What can you discern from the individual's discourse, or language-in-use? What do these
tools help you to figure out about how this person identifies and the Discourses this person
draws on in doing so? Also note, it will be helpful to review the transcription coding system in
Table 3. This system of recording is helpful because it attempts to capture all of the details in
text as indications of how people see themselves and their ideas.

              Exploring Your Discourses and Identities

One way to explore your discourses and identities is through critical identity work. Critical
identity work uses critical discourse analysis to examine relationships among teachers, stu-
dents, and power and privilege in schools. As outlined by Vetter, Schieble, and Meacham
(2012), the first step is to video record five- to 10-minute segments of your teaching (e.g.,
mini-lessons, small group work with students, or your facilitation of a discussion). You may
repeat this process a few times throughout a semester. Next, transcribe the recording, which
means listen to and watch the recording and make a written (typed) copy of what you hear
and see. With your transcription in hand, use the set of guiding questions in Table 4 to
engage in discourse analysis. To conclude, write a reflection that describes how your class-
room interactions did or did not relate to the kind of teacher you hoped to be. This kind of

216 | 14. Teacher Discourses and Identities: Understanding Your Teaching Self
critical identity work may guide you to align your teacher identity and your classroom prac-
tice because it will bring attention to how your identity influences your practice.

              Table 4. Critical Identity Work Guiding Questions (Adapted from Vetter et al., 2012)

 Guiding Questions

   · Who does most of the talking?
   · What kinds of questions are posed? What kinds of answers are facilitated?
   · How do you talk to students? What is your tone? Do you use directives? Questions? Praises?

       Criticisms?
   · How do you think your words positioned your students as readers and writers? How do you

       think your students positioned you as a teacher? How did you position yourself as a teacher?
   · How might these positionings be shaped by how you were taught? By the kind of school you

       attended? By your race, class, gender, and/or sexuality?
   · What are the students doing?
   · Are students engaged in the lesson?
   · How do students communicate with each other?
   · How do students position each other as readers and writers?
   · What are the strengths? What will you do different?
   · How do these practices match up with the kind of teacher you want to become? How do they

       contradict?

      Another exercise to try is to create an identity discourse map (Alsup, 2006). With your
peers, list aspects of popular culture and historical events that have been important in your
lifetime. Think about the messages you received from society during these events that relate
to race, class, gender, and sexuality. For instance, the shooting of Michael Brown by Darren
Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri was a significant event from which many have taken away mes-
sages about race ("Tracking the Events," 2014). Then, independently, write about messages you
may have taken from personal, family, or home discourses related to religion, ethnicity, race,
geography, family, class, and sexuality. Conclude by writing about how all of these things may
affect your views on teaching and learning. Your instructor may decide whether you will share
all or parts of your conclusions with your peers.

   The identity discourse map could be a useful resource as you study your discourses, iden-
tities, and literacy autobiography through a critical lens. Literacy teacher educators often use
a literacy autobiography assignment to prompt you to examine your own history and learning
experiences. If you have not done so already, write a literacy autobiography using the set of
guiding questions in Table 5.

   Upon writing your literacy autobiography, revisit it and read it more critically. Reflect on
how your literacy autobiography is shaped by political, cultural, racial, economical, and his-
torical times. Perhaps you noted some of these on your identity map above. Further, respond
to the questions, "In what ways do our literate autobiographies shape the types of literacy
environments we construct for the students we work with? What connections can you make
between your narrative and the narratives of the children you work with?" (Rogers & Wetzel,
2014, p. 53).

   Alsup (2006) also suggested an activity entitled "What is your pedagogy?" First, brainstorm
definitions to the words "personal" and "pedagogy." Then answer the following questions:
What are their definitions? How do they intersect? How do they conflict? Write a one- to
two-page statement about personal pedagogy and how the personal and professional may be
integrated. The activity may help you disrupt the divisions of public and private or personal
and professional often associated with teaching. As noted in a previous section of this chapter,
Alsup (2006) found that the teachers who grappled with personal and professional aspects of

                                                      14. Teacher Discourses and Identities: Understanding Your Teaching Self | 217
their identities were more likely to pursue and maintain jobs as teachers. This activity should
also guide you to be able to explain your background and what aspects of your Discourses you
bring to your work as a teacher.

                   Table 5. Literacy Autobiography Guiding Questions

Guiding Questions

· Reflect on your early years.
· What was your home culture like?
· How did literacy play a role in your past?
· How could a young person use literacy to express his or her identity? How did you?
· How did teachers promote or inhibit your literacy practices?
· How do you define literacy?
· Recall a negative literacy experience, if you can.
· How does your background and or culture influence your learning?
· How do your past literacy experiences affect your present?
· Did you ever feel held back in your literacy experiences?
· What are your beliefs about the power of literacy?
· How did you overcome setbacks in literacy?
· How did political leadership or historical movements influence education when you were

   growing up?

                                    Summary

It is important to understand theories about language as a teacher because language can
contribute to uneven expectations for students in schools. The social and cultural views of
language and literacy presented in this chapter help explain that context, history, culture, dis-
course, power, and beliefs influence teachers' interactions and inform decisions. Researchers
suggested that sometimes teachers use deficit Discourses that position others that do not
share their Discourses as deficient or lacking. Researchers also recognized that teachers
bring multiple Discourses to their work that sometimes cause conflicts or tensions. Examin-
ing your discourses may lead you to provide more equitable opportunities in schools because
such examination can bring attention to deficit Discourses that you may have otherwise never
considered. In addition, understanding who you are and what Discourses you enact may help
you align your identities and practices in ways that may serve you well throughout your
career. Critical discourse analysis is a theory and method that can help you to study the text
and content of your discourses to learn more about how your language is made up of knowl-
edge and power. A number of other activities such as critical identity work, identity discourse
mapping, and applying a critical lens to your work may also prove to be useful.

   Questions and Activities

1. Define discourse and Discourse. Explain how these definitions differ and why these differ-
     ences are important to teaching.

2. What does the theory of Discourse suggest about how language works?
3. Explain how Discourses have to do with belonging or fitting in. How do they relate to iden-

           tities?
      4. Consider the Discourses you enact so others recognize you as a certain kind of person.

           Discuss ways in which the way your Discourses might reflect your belonging to certain
           groups and not to others.
      5. What do research studies suggest about teachers' Discourses and identities? Explain how
           findings from these studies provide insight into issues related to language and power.
      6. Define critical discourse analysis and discuss why teachers should be concerned about
           their own discourses.
      7. How can you go about studying your own discourses? How can this kind of study benefit
           you and your students?
