NADIA PROKOPCHUK

To complete the course ECUR 415.3: Current Issues in EAL, students
are required to submit a final paper that reflects their growing
knowledge about English as an Additional Language (EAL). EAL is
the term used in Saskatchewan to describe students who speak
languages other than English and require adequate levels of
English to be successful with the school curriculum.

   Most students enrolled in the online course ECUR 415 are
practicing teachers who are working toward a Post-Degree
Certificate in EAL Education (PDCEAL), while continuing to live and
work in various locations both within and outside of the province.
The certificate program, offered through the College of Education,
University of Saskatchewan, is recognized by provincial education
authorities as being equivalent to one full year of post-degree
study. As such, the certificate equips teachers with the knowledge
and expertise to be considered teacher-specialists of EAL
Education. The course ECUR 415 also attracts some pre-service
teachers who are pursuing a Bachelor of Education degree and
have an interest in EAL Education.

   At the end of a term, the instructor informs students that their
final papers may be considered for inclusion in an OER essay
collection. Essay selection has no bearing on student marks as this
is done after course completion. Students must give permission for

                                                                1

their papers to be published prior to inclusion in the collection. The
overall goal of the OER collection is to provide PreK-12 educators
(classroom teachers, administrators, EAL coordinators, language
consultants, specialists, and others) with a source of current best
practices and research. An added advantage is that the collection
provides pre-service teachers with insights into the cultures and
languages represented in schools today, as preparation for their
future employment.

   All users of this OER collection are reminded that essays are the
work of student authors and not academic experts in the field of
EAL or second language education.

   This online resource carries the Creative Commons License CC-
BY. This license allows others to use, modify, or share the work of
each author freely. Students who have given permission for their
essays to appear in this collection are considered the authors of
each piece of writing. Other users are required to give credit to
each author as the creator of the work. This kind of open online
resource allows educators in Saskatchewan and other locations to
adapt the work and align it with local needs.

   Each author of an OER essay may add this work to a professional
CV and reference it as required to support future academic goals.
This contribution is part of a living and growing learning resource
that educators anywhere can access and use. Each author also
retains the right to request removal of the essay from the collection
at any time.

   OER makes it possible for the College of Education at the
University of Saskatchewan to build and expand the selection of
readings available for EAL education. More information about open
pedagogy is available at https://teaching.usask.ca/curriculum/
open-educational-practices.php .

   I would like to express my sincere thanks to all student authors
who gave permission to have their writing published in this OER
collection. It is very rewarding to be able to share not only the
enhanced knowledge of the authors, but also the views and

perspectives of different voices in our province: rural and urban,
Saskatchewan-born and new Canadians, experienced teachers and
recent graduates. It is my hope that as you read the essays, you
will gain new insights into current issues in EAL Education.

Students' Education

HASSAN CHATHA

Diversity and multiculturalism are on the rise in Canada. Because of
the economic and academic opportunities offered by communities
across Canada, the foreign-born population in Canada has
increased dramatically during the past few decades. Economic and
academic factors are not the only reasons that encourage people
to leave their homeland and move to Canada. Thousands of people
come to Canada as refugees, seeking asylum against oppressive
states.

   After overcoming the immigration barrier, the next stop for most
newcomers with children is the local school. This is the challenge
that newcomers cannot get past by simply signing a few
documents. Immigrant and/or refugee students, most of whom
have a first language that is not English, must spend years
mastering academic English and learning to navigate the Canadian
education system. Newcomers to Canada are not the only group
of people to face the problem of learning a foreign language in an
unfamiliar school setting. Indigenous students, whose numbers in
Canadian school are also rising, are faced with a similar problem.

   Though diversity ultimately benefits Canadian society in the form
of cultural richness, increased genetic pool, and a multitude of skills

                                                               11
12  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

and abilities, EAL students must overcome many initial challenges
to produce those benefits. Some of the major challenges faced
by EAL students stem from cultural differences. Their teachers are
also challenged by this cultural diversity. Teachers must develop
the skills and abilities to teach students from different cultures.

   This paper discusses the impact of cultural rules, norms, and
philosophies on EAL students' learning. The paper also provides
suggestions for ways that administrators and teachers can help EAL
learners to succeed with their academic pursuits, by using cultural
diversity as a source of learning.

   Culture is often linked to the image of an iceberg. The small
visible portion of the iceberg represent the easily noticeable
characteristics of a culture, including language, food, art, and
clothing. The much bigger and hidden portion of the iceberg
represents characteristics that are not visible. These include, but
are not limited to, different values and beliefs that govern
everything from human interactions to standards of beauty to
notions of class and gender equality (Helmer and Eddy, 2012).
These virtually hidden characteristics of a culture are difficult to
perceive and are the cause of many misunderstandings that might
take root in a classroom.

   When newcomers first arrive, they are in a honeymoon stage, but
this does not last long. According to Helmer and Eddy (2012), once
the enjoyment phase of being in a new country is over, the new
students are hit with culture shock. "Culture shock encompasses
a constellation of feelings and events that occur when we are
plunged into an unfamiliar environment" (pg. 16). Culture shock
results once the students realize the challenges of adjusting to the
new school environment. The unfamiliarity with the cultural values
and belief systems of their school prohibits the EAL students from
fully expressing their academic skills and abilities.

   Language and culture share an intimate and inseparable bond.
According to Kuo and Lai (2006), "language stands for the whole
culture because language represents culture in the mind of its
EAL2019-ESSAY1-CHATHA  13

speakers. Conversely, culture also symbolizes language and is
summed in the economic, religions, and philosophical systems of
a country" (pg. 5). Language is used to share thoughts, ideas, and
perceptions. These concepts are rooted in the culture of the group
and may change as the culture evolves. Thus, as Kuo and Lai (2006)
argue, for EAL learners to be experts in the new language they,
must first familiarize themselves with the culture that surrounds
the language.

   Perceptions about the background cultures of EAL learners and
their families can be the cause of some discomfort in the
classroom. A teacher's preconceived notions about students from a
particular culture may have a negative impact on student learning.
Cong (2012) comments that many American teachers associate
Chinese students with high academic achievement. Though
Chinese students score higher on standardized tests, when
compared to other minorities, these "immigrant students have
limited English proficiency, no parental support at home for school
work, and need to make tremendous adjustments emotionally,
socially, culturally, and academically in their new lives in America"
(Cong, 2012, pg. 172). The Middle Eastern students, on the other
hand, are judged harshly because of the negative stereotypes
associated with some Middle Eastern cultures. This results in
racism and discrimination (Cong, 2012, pg. 172).

   Based on common misconceptions, teachers' responses to a
student who needs extra academic support may vary, particularly
if the teacher mistakenly perceives a student to be gifted because
of the teacher's stereotypical thinking. Just as not offering academic
support to students perceived as gifted, a system may lose a
student because the teachers believe that academic learning is not
a part of the student's culture. Thus, the misconceptions that arise
because of cultural stereotypes are dangerous as they prohibit the
EAL learners from fully reaching their academic potential.

   Another common but faulty assumption is that students of the
same culture or from the same country should be grouped
14  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

together. Students' behaviours, their likes and dislikes, may be
influenced by elements of different cultures. Helmer and Eddy
(2012) give the example of Matthew, a student of Germen descent,
who is a member of several different cultural groups. Limiting
students to a single culture, based on geographical, linguistic, or
physical characteristics, is risky as it can limit a student's
possibilities for academic achievement. In the case of Matthew, the
first impression a teacher might have is that Matthew is from a well-
to-do family. As a result of this perception, the teacher may not
focus on providing Matthew with access to necessary educational
resources, e.g., printing services. In reality, Matthew belongs to
the working class, and has limited financial resources (Helmer and
Eddy, 2012). Therefore, a teacher's first impression of a student,
based mostly on appearance, is not always the complete picture.
As evidenced through Matthew's example, a student may belong to
several cultural and societal groups.

   Moreover, a major aspect of culture is its role in dictating
classroom interactions. A student's behaviour is guided by the rules
and norms defined by his/her culture. If a student is made to
step outside his/her comfort zone, foregoing the cultural rules and
norms, he/she may not be able to perform academically. One of the
areas where cultural rules play a big part is defining gender roles.
Most school divisions across North America promote a gender-
free environment where gender equality is the norm. Teachers
in these schools do not think of gender as a contributing factor
when it comes to classroom interactions (Helmer and Eddy, 2012).
Though gender equality is of the utmost importance in Canada
and every student, be it boy or girl, must have access to quality
education, Helmer and Eddy argue that "in treating all students
equally and encouraging them to do likewise with each other, we
may be denying a reality that all the students already know as a
result of their cultural leaning outside the classroom and in the
home" (Helmer and Eddy, 2012, pg. 37).

   Teachers in schools are not the only people responsible for a
EAL2019-ESSAY1-CHATHA  15

student's learning. When is comes to cultural teachings, a student's
family and community play a big role. Even before a student starts
school, he/she begins learning cultural rules and norms by
observing his/her parents, elder siblings, and other members of
the extended family. The North American culture promotes
interactions between students of the opposite gender, but many
EAL learners belong to cultures where interactions with the
opposite gender are not the standard. When teachers, in pursuit
of gender equality, create mixed-gender groups, the EAL students
are not able to learn or fully express their academic capabilities
because of cultural restrictions.

   Establishing classroom gender roles is not the only way through
which culture impacts EAL students' learning. Gender roles also
limit the parental support available to students. Because of cultural
restrictions, mothers of Middle Eastern students may not be able
to accompany them to the library (Cong, 2012). Culture defines
the roles and responsibilities for parents. Though established for
the overall wellbeing of the family, these rules can sometimes be
limiting and therefore hinder an EAL student's learning experience.

   Culture also dictates the relationship between students and the
teacher. In the North American culture, students and teachers have
a `shared responsibility' for learning in schools. While teachers are
given the appropriate respect, students are encouraged to speak
up and question their teachers. In most other cultures around the
world, "it is considered the height of insolence and disrespect to
question anything the teacher says or does" (Helmer and Eddy,
2012, pg. 40). These conflicting cultural values result in
misunderstandings. Teachers might think of a student's quiet
nature as being a behavioural or intellectual disorder. The students
on the other hand, face an internal conflict. They are not sure
whether to hold on to their cultural rules and keep quiet or take
part in classroom discussions. These misunderstandings and
confusions impact the EAL learners' educational experience.

   Furthermore, culture impacts EAL students' learning experience
16  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

by defining educational concepts such as knowledge and literacy.
Cong (2012) mentions that in the Chinese culture, the meaning
of literacy is "rooted in traditional Chinese philosophy that
emphasizes the ability to read classic literature" (pg. 73). In the
North American society, literacy, apart from reading and writing,
encompasses the skills needed to gain and present information
using a multitude of mediums, including written, oral, and
technology based (Vacca, Vacca, & Mraz, 2017). These varying
definitions of literacy construct barriers for the EAL students.
Compared to the modern definition of education, if parents of
the EAL students have a different philosophy regarding education
and learning, they will not be able to help their children with their
studies. These parents may even oppose the teachings of modern
school systems. As a result, a culture's philosophy of education may
hinder an EAL student's academic achievement.

   The challenges that result from cultural differences are
overwhelming and may force the school administrators and
teachers to resist promoting diversity. The diversity is not the
problem. The systems and resources used to deal with diversity
are flawed. Many educational institutions view diversity as a
bandwagon that should be supported, but with a minimal
commitment. They understand the advantages of creating diverse
learning environments, but do not allocate enough resources to the
teachers and the support staff to help the EAL learners. Teachers
themselves are not qualified and trained to teach a group of
students with diverse educational backgrounds and needs. Yet
overwhelming as they may be, the challenges of diversity can be
overcome.

   Getting through the cultural barriers is a cooperative process
that requires the administrators, the teachers and the parents to
work together in an effort to enhance the EAL learners' educational
experience. The administrators are responsible for setting up and
administering a successful intake process. Apart from assessing the
academic abilities, the intake process should include a discussion
EAL2019-ESSAY1-CHATHA  17

of the student's cultural background (Coelho, 2012). The
administrators, the teacher, and the parents should all get together
to discuss how the cultural differences might affect the EAL
learner's education. The parents and the teachers should voice
their educational philosophies so that there is no confusion about
the purpose of schooling. Cong (2012) advises parents to volunteer
in school activities and meet frequently with the teachers. These
interaction between the school staff and the parents may help
resolve most of the misunderstanding caused by cultural
differences. To help the EAL students familiarize themselves with
the new school environment, an orientation session should be
arranged. It is suggested to use student guides, preferably with the
same cultural background, for the orientation (Coelho, 2012).

   To combat the classroom interaction issues, teachers must work
towards creating an inclusive environment. There are numerous
"intercultural projects", as suggested by Coelho (2012), that may
be used to raise awareness about different cultures present in the
classroom. Students may interview each other about their cultural
backgrounds, create heritage boxes with symbols of their cultures,
or tell stories about their home countries (Coelho, 2012). These
activities will help the students, and the teacher, learn about each
others' cultures and traditions.

   In conclusion, culture plays a big role in impacting EAL learners'
education. Culture and language are intertwined. In order for the
newcomers to learn a new language, they must first understand
the cultural context surrounding the language. Moreover, cultural
stereotypes and misconceptions give rise to unfair expectations.
The teachers and the administrators must be aware of the EAL
students' cultural norms and traditions to avoid these
misunderstandings. The parents must also work towards the
academic excellence of their children by regularly meeting with the
teaching staff. Being an immigrant, who was once an EAL student,
I believe I am well-situated to understand the challenges faced
by EAL students. Though not all EAL students are from Pakistan,
18            NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

and face the same problems, I believe I have a certain advantage
when it comes to the cultural issues faced by EAL students. My
experience as an EAL student has allowed me to realize the
misunderstandings and frustrations, from a student's point of view,
that arise because of cultural differences. My learning in ECUR 415
has equipped me with the teaching tools necessary to overcome
those barriers.

2 - The Importance of Culturally
Responsive Teaching

KIM GUILLET

Culturally Responsive Teaching (CRT) is a term that refers to
pedagogy that embraces equality and inclusion. It is based on the
understanding that all students learn differently due to a variety
of factors including: social-emotional needs, language, culture, and
family background. Culture is used as a foundation for learning
while expanding intellectual growth in all students. Educators who
display a CRT mindset can help build productive, positive
relationships with families, engage and motivate students, and
value different perspectives in order to create strong communities
of learners who will grow linguistically, socially, and academically.

   Hammond (2015) has created a Ready for Rigor Framework which
describes the four practice areas of Culturally Responsive Teaching:
Awareness, Learning Partnerships, Information Processing, and
Community Building. Based on brain research, each of these areas
help to create authentic and relevant learning in our schools and
assist students in becoming independent. The priority is to
maximize their learning potential and close the achievement gap
for culturally and linguistically diverse students.

   The first practice area is Awareness of three different topics: the
nature of culture, acknowledging various constructs that may lead

                                                               19
20  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

to bias, and understanding structural racialization. Awareness will
help teachers "develop a socio-political consciousness, an
understanding that we live in a racialized society that gives
unearned privilege to some while others experience unearned
disadvantage because of race, gender, class or language"
(Hammond, p.18). Culture is not only our ethnicity but it is also
our every day practices, and the groups with whom we identify.
Helmer and Eddy (2012) stress that we are all the products of a
variety of influences and "there is not one aspect of human life that
is not touched and altered by culture" (Edward T. Hall, p.90). These
principles guide our behavior and our interactions. The culture
iceberg analogy developed by Else Hamayan (Helmer and Eddy,
p. 89) is a concrete example of how much of what we view as
culture is only a small fraction compared to what is hidden under
the surface. Most view the tip of the iceberg: literature, dance, and
art, as the main aspects of culture, but such examples as handling
emotions and the nature of friendships are embedded deep within
us and seldom discussed or explored. Hammond (2015) argues
that culture "is the way that every brain makes sense of the world
and helps us function in our environment" (p.23) and contends
there are three levels: surface, shallow, and deep. Surface culture
is like the tip of the iceberg including observable elements like
food, music, and holidays. Shallow culture, or the water line of the
iceberg, deals with interactions, norms, and trust. Deep culture, like
the bottom of the iceberg model, is made up of our unconscious
cultural values that shape our self- concept and the way we live.

   Teachers must have an understanding of cultural differences to
successfully immerse EAL learners into their classrooms. Helmer
and Eddy (2012) believe that by raising this awareness teachers
will become more empathetic and understand where potential
communication and cultural breakdowns may occur. Many of these
conflicts can arise due to differences in educational and belief
systems. Different perceptions of creativity, managing time, use
of their first language, emphasis on homework, and promoting
EAL2019-ESSAY2-GUILLET  21

choices in school are some key aspects where some conflicts may
occur. Some cultures don't "share knowledge" in the same way,
so class participation may look different, as well as how students
exhibit motivation. In addition, different instructional strategies
may pose a challenge for students. For some, cooperative learning,
and partner or group work will not be consistent with the strategies
in their previous schooling and may not seem natural at first. As
well, many countries prioritize fact based learning so problem
solving will need to be explicitly taught, not assumed. Discussing
the students' previous school experiences may aid in
understanding for both teachers and students alike, and limit
miscommunications before they occur. Acknowledging some of the
differences newcomers might face when moving into the
educational system in an English speaking country is another
integral part of assisting our students to navigate successfully
between two languages and cultures.

   As well, Helmer and Eddy (2012) identify five different constructs
that may cause misunderstandings: Assertiveness-Compliance,
Dominance-Submission, Disclosure-Privacy, Direct-Indirect
Communication, and Flexible Time-Time as a Commodity. In the
first construct, how people exhibit the motivation to help
themselves is considered. In North American culture, students are
encouraged to assert their individualism in comparison with other
cultures where people do not eagerly express their opinions. The
second encompasses power dimensions related to gender, which
may correlate to participation, attendance, and effort in female
students. In addition, this can affect student-teacher relationships,
as well as teacher-family relationships. We must be aware that
some topics are off limits to discuss in many cultures and offense
may be taken if families are expected to share private or taboo
information. Direct and indirect styles can lead to communication
breakdowns between students, student to teacher, and family to
teacher. Lastly, in most English speaking countries, time is
considered a commodity that should not be wasted. Efficiency is
22  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

incredibly important and seen as a necessity. In some cultures, time
is seen as more flexible and the pace of living is much slower and
relaxed.

   By understanding levels of culture and the differences that may
contribute to bias and breakdown, teachers are exhibiting their
socio-cultural consciousness (Ontario Ministry of Education, 2013).
Part of this socio-cultural consciousness is acknowledging how
these attitudes and stereotypes may be an implicit bias that shapes
our thinking and interactions with others. Unfortunately, our
society maintains some factors for some groups that perpetuate
discrepancies in resources and opportunities, such as housing and
health care. This inequity and structural racialization may
contribute to dependent learners who are vulnerable and at risk in
our schools. Understanding this will help us to better support the
social-emotional needs of our students and aid us in strengthening
their intellectual capacity (Hammond, 2015).

   The second practice area involves building Learning Partnerships
with students and families. Experts in differentiation and brain
research, Sousa and Tomlinson (2011) stress the importance of
social relationships on human behaviour. They urge teachers to be
empathetic and willing to see the world through the eyes of their
students and their parents. This cultivates a mutual respect and
builds strong relationships that will set the stage for warm, learner-
friendly environments. The teacher must be the leader in this. "We
need to consider the issue of affect, that is, how the students feel
about the learning process. Students need to feel that the teacher
really cares about them; if students feel supported and valued, they
are far more likely to be motivated to learn" (Harmer, 2007, p. 20).
Therefore, educators need to make it a priority to build positive
relationships by connecting to the lives of their students, finding
out their interests, and listening to their experiences.

   Teachers must see the "whole child", and not just their English
language abilities. Celebrating what makes students special and
unique emphasizes student strengths and values their
EAL2019-ESSAY2-GUILLET  23

competencies (Sousa and Tomlinson, 2011). Students gain self-
confidence and motivation if they are "truly seen." Fostering
principles of identity and investment (Brown and Lee, 2015)
illustrate how their emotions and self-worth are connected to their
learning. In addition, knowing their educational history and their
background gives a teacher a more complete picture of who they
are. It is this deep knowledge of students, and a desire to make
a difference, characteristics of a culturally responsive educator's
mindset (Ontario Ministry of Education, 2013), that promote
respect and collaboration with students and families.

   The third area of CRT is Information Processing and how the brain
uses culture to help interpret the world around us. Hammond
(2015) references six core principles or "brain rules" that work
together to keep our brains healthy and learning. The first two are
integral to being part of a caring school environment: the brain
seeks to minimize threats and maximize connections with others,
and positive relationships keep our safety detection system in
check. The relationship between one's sense of well-being and
feelings of belonging to a social community cannot be
underestimated. In addition, how we process information is guided
by culture. Many cultures have strong oral traditions where
knowledge is passed down through the generations. This helps to
build neural pathways, which means that learning will be enhanced
using stories, music, and repetition, as well as social interaction.
Next, attention drives learning. Each brain is ignited by novelty,
relevance, and emotion so active engagement is necessary. All new
information "must be coupled with existing funds of knowledge to
help make sense of the world" (Hammond, p.49) and is organized
based on cultural experiences. Building on students' background
knowledge, and engaging students in meaningful tasks, is critical
to learning and retaining information. This requires input, making
meaning, and application of this new knowledge. Lastly, the brain
stretches and changes through challenges. Intellectual capacity
24  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

grows when students are stimulated and pushed beyond their
comfort zone to do higher order thinking.

   The fourth practice area for CRT is Community Building. Learning
environments must be built as a safe space where all languages
and cultures are valued; we have the opportunity and responsibility
to ensure that each student is allowed to share who they are
without bias or prejudice. Brown and Lee's (2015) principle of
languaculture stresses the connection between language and
culture and how the two cannot be separated. As educators, we
need to be committed to honoring this, helping students feel proud
of who they are, and how their unique backgrounds and talents
enrich our schools.

   A student's individuality is also very much connected to a first
language. "Learning to think, feel, act, and communicate in an
L2 is a complex socio-affective process of perceiving yourself as
an integral part of a social community. The process involves self-
awareness, investment, agency, and a determination, amidst a host
of power issues, to form your own identity within the social
relationships of a community" (Brown and Lee, p. 78). Coelho (2012)
urges schools to incorporate languages to "draw on the linguistic
resources of the community" as a component of identity, pride and
self-esteem as well as a resource to families, as a tool for learning,
and as a resource to the whole community. If English is emphasized
as the only language of learning, educators have the potential to
produce inequitable learning experiences (Sterzuk & Nelson, 2016).

   Research studies about bilingualism illustrate the positive effects
on students. Educators must "directly address the dual language
and literacy needs of immigrant children, welcome all languages
into the classroom, and provide enriching language and literacy
experiences for all children" (Chumak-Horbatsch, p.46). Teachers
are the bridge that can help strengthen this by providing inclusive
practices which continue to strengthen the home- school
connection. Parents should be invited into classrooms as partners
in their child's learning journey. Some learning opportunities for
EAL2019-ESSAY2-GUILLET  25

families include reading dual language books, sharing about their
countries, adding their mother tongue to class bulletin boards, and
helping their children with research and vocabulary connections in
their first language.

   Moreover, there should be a balance among viewpoints and
perspectives. Students should see themselves in the curriculum, as
the teacher utilizes appropriate materials that are non-biased and
from different cultural contexts. "It is necessary to change what
we teach, adding diverse cultural perspectives and encouraging
students to recognize and speak out against prejudice and
discrimination" (Coelho, p.166). We must be reflective and
collaborative in our practice, continuing to think deeply about how
we choose what is learned, what literature is selected from a variety
of cultures and viewpoints, and methods that will be effective for
the needs of our students.

   Another important aspect of the learner environment is the need
to set high standards with all students, including those who are
linguistically and culturally diverse. When students are able to
reach self-motivated goals, have input in tasks with the
opportunities for choice, this fosters agency. "Agency, which lies at
the heart of language learning, is the ability of learners to make
choices, take control, self-regulate, and thereby pursue their goals
as individual within a sociocultural context. Teachers are called
on to offer appropriate affective and pedagogical support in their
students' struggle for autonomy, development of identities, and
journey toward empowerment" (Brown and Lee, 2015, p.84). Self-
determination and high intellectual performance helps to build the
risk-taking environment where language learning can occur.

   Educators should "think of culturally responsive teaching as a
mindset, a way of thinking about and organizing instruction to
allow for great flexibility in teaching" (Hammond, p.5). As an EAL
specialist, I see the relevance of culturally responsive teaching
every day, and how it is the foundation of building a safe, and
inclusive learning environment for all students. Understanding
26  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

your own cultural lens helps you to relate to different perspectives
and be more empathetic to families, many of whom are vulnerable
and underserved. Each student must be treated with dignity and
respect and ensuring fair and equitable opportunities needs to be
the basis for all that we do. Culture, as a catalyst for learning,
lends accessibility to and expanded possibilities for success with
curriculum outcomes. Building on strengths and student interests
makes students feel capable and empowered. Culturally
responsive teaching encompasses differentiated learning and
ensures all students grow linguistically, socially, and academically

3 - Supporting Newcomer EAL
Students in the Elementary
Classroom: The First Weeks

PATRICIA HICKS

   The increasing number of English as an Additional Language
(EAL) students in Saskatchewan schools is just one of the numerous
challenges faced by today's teachers, as well as being a potentially
exciting new learning opportunity. The number of EAL learners
in Saskatchewan schools has been steadily growing since 2008
(University of Saskatchewan, 2017, ECUR 415 Mod.1, p. 1). EAL
students must learn not only curricular outcomes but also social
and academic language. These students' immediate learning needs
create an urgency to begin developing language and academic
skills as soon as possible upon arrival at school. Providing
appropriate supports for the newcomer student in the first weeks
of Saskatchewan schooling will be the focus of this paper.

   EAL leaners are a diverse student population. Many are
Canadian-born learners whose first language is one other than
English (University of Saskatchewan, 2017, ECUR 415 Mod.1, p. 10).
Another population of EAL learners are students who have come to
Canada at a pre-school age. Garnett (2012), refers to these students
as generation 1.5. The third group of EAL students are newcomers

                                                               28
EAL2019-ESSAY3-HICKS  29

to Canada. Newcomer families are most often economic
immigrants, family class immigrants, or refugees. Over 3300 landed
immigrants and refugees aged 0-14 arrived in Saskatchewan in
2015 (Prokopchuk, 2017). Continuing immigration coupled with a
recent influx of Syrian refugees has brought unique challenges
to the classroom. Unlike Canadian born EAL students, newcomer
arrivals generally experience the "stages of adjustment" (University
of Saskatchewan, 2017, ECUR 415 Mod. 1, p. 10), which may include
a period of culture shock. Newcomers present many other unique
challenges because of "a vast difference in age, time of arrival,
country of origin, prior experiences, and educational needs"
(University of Saskatchewan, 2017, ECUR 415 Mod.1, p. 8).

   Newcomer students face many challenges that can impact their
learning. One of the most obvious challenges for newcomer
students is communication. Many newcomers must learn not only
a new language, but also new print conventions. Different cultural
norms challenge newcomer students as well. Often newcomers
feel isolated within the school community, especially as they move
from the honeymoon stage to the hostility or culture shock phase
of adjustment (University of Saskatchewan, 2017, ECUR 415 Mod.
1, p. 10). Students must also learn "to do school" (Helmer & Eddy,
2012, p. 60) as they learn the expectations and teaching/learning
styles prevalent in Saskatchewan schools. For refugee students,
trauma is a real and serious concern. Many students arrive in the
classroom having experienced separation from loved ones,
exposure to acts of war and interrupted schooling (Manitoba
Education, 2012).

   With so many challenges facing the newcomer EAL student, it
is imperative that teachers are well prepared to work with the
students and their families. One of the first lines of communication
with the newcomer family is through the Settlement Workers in
Schools (SWIS) program. As part of this program, these trained
workers provide services in Humboldt, Moose Jaw, Regina,
Saskatoon, Swift Current and Prince Albert regions (Regina Open
30  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

Door Society, 2017). All teachers can access valuable links, contacts
and information at the SWIS web site (SWIS Sask. 2017). If needed,
any school in the province can access free OPI (over-the-phone
interpretation) services funded by the Ministry of Education
(University of Saskatchewan, 2017, ECUR 415 Mod. 2, p. 9).

   Once the family has completed the initial intake procedures in
terms of school registration and placement, an assessment of the
student will take place. Like most school divisions, the Saskatoon
Public School Division has a two part interview and assessment
process. First, background information is gathered. An interpreter
is used if required. Next, a language assessment of the learner is
performed (Anderson & Tilbury, 2014). Common procedures for
reception, intake and assessment are established throughout
Saskatchewan school divisions (University of Saskatchewan, Mod.
1, p. 8). All of this information is accessible to the classroom
teacher and provides a well-rounded look at the newcomer
student.

   An important indicator of the newcomer student's language
abilities is the score on the Common Framework of Reference
(CFR). This assessment tool is "a well-established language
framework that identifies ways in which learners at various levels of
proficiency use language to perform meaningful, authentic tasks"
(Government of Saskatchewan, 2013). This "can do" scale
(Government of Saskatchewan, 2013) rates language learners on
what they are able to accomplish in the areas of listening, spoken
interaction, spoken production, reading and writing. Saskatchewan
schools focus on the first three proficiency levels of the CFR,
breaking them down further to A1.1, A1.2, A2.1, A2.2, B1.1 and
B1.2. The descriptors allow the teacher, students and parents to
see a detailed description of where the student is at and to track
progress over time.

   By examining all the data gathered from the initial intake and
assessment, a learner profile can be created and goals set. Data
collected early on will be important to keep. This data provides
EAL2019-ESSAY3-HICKS  31

evidence of growth which is important for EAL students to see
as they progress. The goals that are set will be dependent on
the student's present level of English communication and previous
schooling experiences. For students who have no English language
skills, "their immediate need is to learn the language of everyday
interaction as well as some basic academic terms" (Coelho, 2012, p.
84).

   The first experiences in the classroom should be designed to
make the newcomer student feel welcome and at ease. The way
that the student is introduced to the class can help create a
welcoming climate. Coelho (2012, p. 156) suggests that the teacher
introduces new students by telling the class about where they
come from, what language they speak, pronouncing names
correctly, and enlisting support from the entire class. Sometimes
new names can be difficult for English speakers to pronounce.
Amber Prentice from Colorin Colorado (2012) advises not to
anglicize student names, but to be respectful of their given names.
By practicing as many times as needed, teachers can learn to
pronounce new names correctly. Always confirm which name is
used as the everyday first name and how official names on
documents should appear as these vary culturally (Coelho, 2012).

   One of the first supports a classroom teacher can offer the new
student is a buddy (Helmer & Eddy, 2012). Preferably this buddy
would be another student who is the same age or slightly older who
speaks the same language as the newcomer student. However, "it
is more important to select students of any language background
who are kind, patient, and empathetic" (Coelho, 2012, p. 36).
Training sessions for potential buddies are a good way to
emphasize the need to be empathetic as well as informative. A well
trained buddy can assist the new student with familiarization of the
school and provide introductions. Also, recess or class change bells,
fire drills and lockdown drills should be explained in advance to
reduce any stress that these may cause the new student.

   Helmer and Eddy (2012) remind teachers to be aware of cultural
32  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

considerations that may impact student relationships when
assigning buddies. It is important to keep in mind that
circumstances, such as socio-economic status, religion and gender,
can affect relationships. Despite a similarity in first language,
students "could, in fact, come from areas that have been sworn
enemies for centuries" (Helmer & Eddy, 2012). By accessing
newcomer background information and educating oneself about
world cultures, the classroom teacher may be able to avoid cultural
conflicts, or recognize difficulties as they arise.

   Newcomer students can arrive at any time in the school year.
Simple preparations can speed the transition process for the
student. Having certain items ready ahead of time for potential
new students can reduce stress on the first days for everyone.
A welcome package containing essential classroom items such as
pencils, erasers, crayons, notebooks, and other items appropriate
to the classroom and grade is easy to have ready and will make
the newcomer student feel welcomed and prepared (University of
Saskatchewan, 2017, ECUR 415 Mod. 2, p. 9).

   It is important to remember that EAL students and their families
are capable of successful communication in their first language or
languages. "Research has shown that children who maintain and
continue to develop in their own language reach higher levels of
literacy and academic achievement than children who begin to
lose their first language once they start school" (Coelho, 2012).
Providing a print rich environment that includes the community
languages represented in the school population is one way to
include and encourage use of students' first languages. It is
affirming for newcomers to see signs, posters, and books in their
first language. By learning some key phrases in the school's
community languages, the teacher can make the newcomer
student and parents feel more welcomed (Colorin Colorado, 2012).
Various examples of multilingual school information for parents is
available on the SWIS web site (SWIS Sask. 2017).

   Some newcomer students will experience a silent period. This
EAL2019-ESSAY3-HICKS  33

period is normal for many beginning language learners (Coelho,
2012, p. 230). While students are first exposed to the new language
they may not be speaking but are learning. The student needs
support as they "take in" the language. The student will become
verbal once they are ready. This may take up to six months and
should not be considered abnormal as long as the student is
listening and participating in other ways in the classroom (RALLI
Campaign, 2013).

   The newcomer student requires many supports in the first
weeks, months and years of schooling. Supports provided to assist
student learning are referred to as scaffolding. Numerous scaffolds
are vital in the first weeks of instruction. Language presentation
can be scaffolded to support learning. Providing "comprehensible
input" (Coelho, p. 233) requires the teacher to present language
that is just slightly beyond the student's current level. To make the
language more comprehensible for newcomer students, Hill (2008)
suggests using simple authentic language at a slightly slower rate
with a clear voice. He also suggests using manipulatives, visuals,
gestures, pantomime, and facial expressions. With the use of
computers, tablets and Smartboards, it is easy to provide the
learner with visuals that support just about any topic.

   Using culturally responsive teaching methods is an excellent way
to incorporate the newcomer's background into the classroom
while developing language skills. (Ontario Ministry of Education,
2013) Newcomer students feel more engaged when the teacher
provides projects that incorporate their cultural background
(Coelho, 2012, p. 161). One of the examples of an intercultural
project offered by Coelho (2012) is The World in our Classroom
activity. A world map is hung in the classroom and all students and
teachers hang a picture of themselves to indicate their country of
origin or ancestry. As newcomers arrive they can add their picture
to the map. Later, when the newcomer student's English language
skills permit, this student can make a presentation to the class
34  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

about his or her own country of origin. Several other intercultural
project ideas are outlined in Coelho (2012, Ch. 6) and Muniz (2008).

   The information researched for this paper will be extremely
useful to me in the upcoming school year. Applying the appropriate
supports is key to successful transitions for newcomer students. In
my class journal (University of Saskatchewan, 2017, Journal 2-4) I
identified a need for more multilingual resources in my school. By
engaging the local community, new resources can be created that
are representative of the heritage languages in our community.
Creating multilingual welcome signage will be a great way to begin
building relationships and exploring the diversity of languages in
our community.

   I will begin the school year presenting this subject matter to
colleagues in a half- day workshop. Each newcomer student in
my school division will face his or her own unique challenges. I
hope that by welcoming them with an encouraging smile, setting
appropriate goals, learning names correctly, assigning a peer
buddy, embracing culture in the classroom, and seeking
appropriate supports, each newcomer student will be provided
with the best possible start to a successful Saskatchewan
education.

4 - Teaching EAL Students:
Children of Two Language
Worlds

KARUN MANN

Canada's vibrant diversity, often recognized as its intrinsic wealth,
comprises Indigenous Peoples, settler communities, and
newcomer populations. Globalization, an increased diversity in
immigration, and a large inflow of refugees have significantly
contributed to the existing pluralism of local populations. This, in
turn, has resulted in a noticeable change in the student
demography of Canadian classrooms  making them quite
heterogeneous. For newcomer students, learning a new language
(English) is generally a requirement for communicating and
integrating into the Canadian educational system. However, in their
efforts to learn English in schools, these children suffer a loss of
their heritage language(s), resulting in consequences such as a
language gap between them and their families.

   As an immigrant, a parent of two EAL (English as an Additional
Language) children, and a future educator in Canada, I believe
that schools should formulate policies to nurture the linguistic
advantages of EAL students. To facilitate the integration of EAL
learners into a new culture, educational institutes should promote

                                                               37
38  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

cross-cultural orientation by appreciating the linguistic and cultural
differences. This approach can also benefit many Canadian-born
students belonging to a non-English speaking background, such
as Indigenous and Hutterite students. Educators must step up for
EAL students by supporting English for academic success and
recognizing their bilingual potential. This can be achieved by
restructuring teacher education programs to better prepare
educators for teaching a diverse student body population,
increasing diversity in the teaching staff, adopting culturally
responsive pedagogy, and implementing linguistically and
educationally appropriate teaching practices.

   Teaching EAL learners who are in the process of adding English
to their language repertoire is considered one of the biggest
challenges by mainstream teachers. Bruce Garnett (2012)
attributes this to the teachers' "inadequate training" (p. 18) and
"belief that ESL students are not their responsibility" (p. 18). Nina
Webster and Angela Valeo (2011) also stress the importance of
teacher preparedness in teaching EAL students. In their article
Teacher Preparedness for a Changing Demographic of Language
Learners, they emphasize that "well-intentioned teachers lack the
competence necessary for effective classroom practice" (Webster &
Valeo, 2011, p. 105). Through this article, the authors confirm that
current education programs are increasing teachers' awareness
about EAL learners and inclusive mindsets, yet much more needs
to be done to prepare educators to teach in classes flourishing with
diversity.

   Due to a lack of emphasis on EAL-specific content in the training
process, it is not surprising that most pre-service (PT) and in-service
teachers feel unequipped to handle classroom diversity. In addition
to the scarcity of teachers prepared to respond to the needs of
EAL students, a lack of professional training leads to creating biases
towards students whose cultural and life experiences are different
from those of their teachers. Sheryl Taylor and Donna Sobel (2011)
discuss these biases and claim that most PTs regard diversity as
EAL2019-ESSAY4-MANN  39

a problem rather than an advantage. The underprepared teachers
believe that students of color are deficient, low in ability, and have
limited potential for success (Sobel & Taylor, 2011, p. 15). The
misconceptions regarding EAL students and the constant
misinterpretation of their abilities and behavior adversely affects
their personal, linguistic, and academic growth. An increase in EAL
content and field experience in education programs can enhance
teacher confidence and competence towards teaching EAL
students, and diminish biases.

   In addition to voicing the need for effective teacher training,
Elizabeth Coelho (2012) in her book Language and Learning in
Multilingual Classrooms: A Practical Approach, calls to attention the
benefits of increasing teacher diversity in multicultural classroom
settings. She identifies a lack of diversity in the teaching faculty and
points it to be significantly lesser than student diversity (Coelho,
2012, p. 141). Coelho (2012) recommends that while recruiting staff
members, teachers who speak community languages and share a
similar cultural background with students should be considered as
an asset (pp. 204-205). A lack of diversity in the teaching faculty
results in a cultural mismatch between teachers and students.
Taylor and Sobel (2011) assert that in order to teach students from
diverse backgrounds effectively, schools require teachers who
"understand the impact of students' home and community cultures
on their educational experience and who have the skills to interact
with students from a range of backgrounds" (p. 5).

   It is undeniable that the teachers' approach to classroom
management and instruction is highly influenced by their cultural
perspectives. A lack of knowledge about the students' cultural
beliefs can affect the teachers' selection of course material,
examples, and analogies that are relevant to the students'
experience. Ana Villegas and Jacqueline Irvine (2010) provide
research-based rationales for diversifying the teaching force. Their
findings suggest that minority students benefit from pairing with
teachers from the same ethnic backgrounds and from attending
40  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

schools where teachers of "minority groups are equitably
represented" (Villegas & Irvine, 2010, p. 187). Increasing teacher
diversity can promote a "color-blind approach to instruction" (Sobel
& Taylor, 2011, p. 18) and help in reducing prevalent cultural biases
and misperceptions. More teacher diversity improves cross-
cultural interaction amongst academic faculty which, in turn, can
facilitate the development of strong teaching strategies for anti-
racist and anti-oppressive education.

   Another significant contributor to the overall academic and
linguistic success of EAL students is a culturally responsive
pedagogy. Rooting from Lev Vygotsky's theory of sociocultural
learning  which highlights the influence of culture on learning and
behavior, culturally responsive teaching appreciates the cultural
knowledge and skills that learners from diverse ethnic backgrounds
bring into schools. The current dominant educational practices,
based heavily on the Eurocentric frameworks, do not pertain to all
students due to "cultural blindness" (Gay, 2000, p. 21). Geneva Gay
(2010) defines culturally responsive teaching as "using the cultural
knowledge, prior experiences, frames of reference, and
performance styles of culturally diverse students" (p. 31) in order
to construct effective learning and teaching strategies. In simple
words  classroom instruction should incorporate diverse cultural
values and aspects in texts, assignments, tasks, and activities. Such
an approach provides EAL students with a sense of belonging and
a feeling of being valued in their classrooms.

   Culturally responsive teaching enhances the linguistic skills of
EAL students by stimulating their interests to actively participate in
classrooms. Sylvia Helmer and Catherine Eddy in their book, Look
at Me When I Talk to You, recommend various ways of encouraging
participation of EAL learners in classrooms. Through these
interactions, teachers can learn about a "student's language
capabilities" and "monitor [their] capacity and growth over time"
(Helmer & Eddy, 2012, p. 63). Moreover, by promoting cross-
cultural knowledge, culturally responsive teaching eventually
EAL2019-ESSAY4-MANN  41

benefits the whole student body population and not just the EAL
students. With increased globalization and an emergence of
multicultural societies, culturally responsive pedagogy fits best with
the multicultural education. Students' intercultural understandings
are becoming vital for current and future job markets, building
a strong and viable economy, democratic decision making, and
working towards social equality.

   As globalization is creating a high demand for bilingual/
multilingual individuals, assimilative and supportive teaching
practices with monolingual focus are becoming "erroneous and
outdated" (Chumak-Horbatsch, 2012, p. 43) in rapidly transforming
multilingual work and trade environments. Unlike the assimilative
practices, supportive practices acknowledge the importance of
home language but still, treat the classroom language learning as
a priority. Inclusive teaching practices which aim at the "promotion
of bilingualism are in line" (p. 43) with the linguistically and
educationally appropriate practices. By including students' home
languages in the curriculum (p. 39), inclusive methods aim to
promote "dynamic bilingualism" (p. 53) in EAL learners.

   Linguistically appropriate practice (LAP), an approach developed
by early childhood specialist R. Chumak-Horbatsch, operates
through the research established language acquisition principles.
LAP recognizes "bilingualism as a positive force in children's
cognitive and linguistic development" (p. xi) and claims that
"conceptual and academic skills transfer across languages" (p. xi). It
dispels those myths which consider home language to be confusing
and interfering with the acquisition of a new language. Instead,
LAP's research-based philosophy believes that each language
supports the other and that there is a positive correlation between
"home language promotion within the school and development of
academic skills in the majority language" (p. xi).

   Teachers who practice LAP neither consider an EAL learners' lack
of understanding of the English language as a disadvantage, nor
profess the superiority of the classroom language over home
42  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

languages. Instead, these teachers treat EALs as the literates of
other languages and value their literacy skills in those languages.
Such educators acknowledge that learning a second language is
not an easy process and that it requires acquiring new linguistic
skills on social as well as academic levels. LAP considers "language
mixing of bilinguals" (p. 29) or translanguaging and code-switching
as a normal part of dual language learning process.
Translanguaging is an even more complex skill than code-switching
as it involves crossing linguistic borders during the course of
conversation (Lasagabaster & Garcia, 2014, p. 558). Code-switching,
on the other hand, refers to the use of "two languages as two
separate monolingual codes" (p. 558) by a bilingual speaker.
Elizabeth Coelho (2012) considers "bilingual instruction" (p. 201)
to be the most appropriate strategy for teaching bilingual EAL
students.

   The success of linguistic and educationally appropriate practices
is based on adapting instruction and assessments to meet the
needs of new language learners while achieving curricular
outcomes. Nadia Prokopchuk (2014) discusses the usefulness of
"differentiating instruction" (p. 83) and "assessment using
strategies that are most effective with learners of EAL" (p. 83) in
inclusive classrooms. Assessment of the progress of language
learners is essential for adapting instruction and planning language
support. Using the curricular outcomes and assessment tools
specifically developed for the native speakers of English is not only
unfair and inappropriate for EAL students but can also be
misleading. Use of a developmental continuum such as the
Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) reveals the
stages in a student's gradual progress with second language
acquisition. Teachers can also adapt the CEFR according to the
age of the EAL students. EAL students may also require "revised
alternative outcomes" (Coelho, 2016, p. 295) until they have
developed language proficiency to achieve grade-level outcomes.
The assessment strategies which are adapted by reducing the
EAL2019-ESSAY4-MANN  43

language demand enable the EAL learners to demonstrate their
content learning in an effective way.

   Similar to Jim Cummins and Margaret Early (2015), I believe that
a "home-school language switch becomes an educational
disadvantage only when the school fails to support students
effectively in learning the school language" (p. 26). Cummins and
Early (2015) believe that the home language can be used as an
advantage by "[activating] students' pre-existing knowledge so that
they can relate new information to what they already know" (p.
27). There is no dearth of research findings which corroborate
that home language does not impede but rather supports the
acquisition of more languages. Alongside, more and more research
is indicating the benefits of bilingualism, such as the "increased
cognitive abilities, flexibility, and [a] more advanced metalinguistic
understanding" (Hoy et al., 2016, p. 164). In the past two decades,
there is a noticeable growth in literature stressing the need to
reduce the "cultural split" (Ioga, 1995, p. 107) by validating the
heritage languages and cultural diversity in schools. Hence,
educational institutes are moving towards a paradigm shift from
`English-only' to `English-plus'. As a mother of two EAL children,
I view them and other EAL students as "emergent bilinguals"
(Chumak-Horbatsch, 2012, p. 23). I believe in teaching my bilingual
EAL students with the perspective that they can successfully
navigate in two languages.

   In conclusion, teacher preparedness is essential for developing
confidence, skills, and the mindset to teach in classroom settings
enriched by diversity. With a desire to become a future EAL
educator, I chose ECUR 415 as an elective course to enhance my
knowledge on the issues regarding EAL teaching and learning.
Additionally, the course content enabled me to see myself, a
teacher of color, as a contributor to teacher diversity. I now
consider myself to be a teacher that numerous EAL learners can
depend on and relate to in terms of ethnic background, language,
and cultural experiences. I feel better equipped to make efforts
44  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

to bridge the gap between the "two worlds of home and school"
(Ashworth, 1988, p. 131) in the lives of EAL learners through
culturally responsive pedagogy. I can creatively design and
effectively implement various linguistically and educationally
appropriate teaching practices in my classrooms. Furthermore, I
can adapt my instruction and assessment methods to maximize
the bilingual potential of the EAL students. As a future teacher
in Saskatchewan, I hope to make my classroom a safe learning
place where cultural and linguistic diversity is welcomed, and every
student feels valued.

5 - Culturally Responsive
Pedagogy

JAYDEN SMITH

Introduction
   In 1971, Canada adopted multiculturism as an official policy

(Prokopchuk, ECUR 415, Module 3, 2017). This policy was created to
be inclusive of all people of various cultural backgrounds living in
Canada. According to the SaskCulture website, culture is dynamic;
it is more than ethnicity and religion and includes all "symbolic
forms and the everyday practices through which people express
and experience meaning" (ECUR 415, Module 3).

   Saskatchewan has been growing in diversity since 2008 due to a
dramatic increase in immigration (ECUR 415, Module 2). In order to
maintain and grow the population of the province, Saskatchewan
sponsors skilled immigrant workers to move to Canada and
become citizens through the Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee
Program (ECUR 415, Module 2; Anderson & Tilbury, 2014, p. 88).
In response to rapid growth of diverse languages and cultures in
Canada, there is an increased need for teaching practices that are
culturally responsive. Culturally responsive pedagogy is defined as
"teaching that integrates a student's background knowledge and
prior home and community experiences into the curriculum and

                                                               46
EAL2019-ESSAY5-SMITH  47

the teaching and learning experiences that take place in the
classroom (Ontario Ministry of Education, 2013, p. 2).

   I believe that culturally responsive pedagogy is an approach to
instruction that is essential for teachers to adopt all over Canada
because not only is cultural inclusiveness a part of the Canadian
identity, but the rapid growth of diversity in Canada means that
soon every school in the country will have students from multiple
cultural or language backgrounds. Having attended a small rural
school, I failed to recognize the obligation that schools have to
ensure that all students feel safe, included, and accepting of
diversity. This paper argues that schools and teachers need to use
culturally responsive pedagogy to create welcoming classrooms,
dispel cultural assumptions, embrace linguistic diversity, and
support diverse strategies.

   Welcome Procedures
   The school is often the first public building a new family visits
and is the first impression newcomer families have of their new
community (ECUR 415 Module 2). The first step to culturally
responsive pedagogy is to create an inclusive environment. The
reception of new students and families is a crucial step for
implementing culturally responsive pedagogy to help newcomer
families feel welcome. The reception process begins when a new
family comes to the school or established welcome center for an
initial assessment (ECUR 415, Module 2). To help make new families
feel welcome, schools and welcome centers can anticipate
language needs by having EAL specialists and counselors either on
staff or available. Schools and school divisions should also have
translated material and interpreters available to help bridge the
language divide (ECUR 415, Module 2).
   In her book Language and Learning in Multilingual Classrooms: A
Practical Approach, Elizabeth Coelho (2012) recommends that at
the outset of initial assessment, students be asked specifically how
they want their name to appear on class lists and official school
records, and what name they would be liked to be called in class
48  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

(p. 23). Schools cannot ask for only a first and last name since
there are different cultural practices for names around the world
(p. 23). Discussing with the family their name preferences helps
the family feel welcome and respected. When conducting the initial
assessment, student's diverse knowledge background should also
be included. Schools should ask students about all the subjects
taught in their previous school and not assume that the only
subjects taught are the ones taught in North American schools (p.
28). Coelho stresses that schools should not privilege their system
and knowledge over other types of knowledge that students have
experienced in their prior schooling (p. 28). Welcoming students
and families by presenting the school as a diverse learning
environment is an important part of culturally responsive
pedagogy. Coelho also recommends that schools have bulletin
boards and posters in an array of languages (p. 21). By creating
such an environment, students see that diverse languages are
valued.

   Cultural Assumptions
   In the book Look at Me when I Talk to You by Helmer and Eddy
(2012), the authors describe culture using Jim Cummins' iceberg
model, which is also known as the Common Underlying Proficiency
or CUP Theory (p. 33; ECUR 415, Module 3). There are many
elements to culture and each person identifies with several
different cultures at once. The top of the iceberg represents the
visible aspects such as preference in music, dress, and food (p.
89). The bottom and much larger part of the iceberg represents
the invisible aspects of cultural such as status designations,
communication patterns, and body language (p. 89). Helmer and
Eddy bring attention to the fact that so little of someone's culture
is visible and therefore assumptions should not be made based
on their language practices (p. 89). They also indicate that teachers
must be aware of possible cultural differences that may affect
students and their attempts to create a communicative relationship
in the classroom (p. 35).
EAL2019-ESSAY5-SMITH  49

   Using culturally responsive pedagogy, teachers can critically
examine cultural differences and plan ways to deliver effective
instruction. For example, believing two students will work well
together because they share a home language is problematic
(Helmer & Eddy, 2012, p. 35) These students could be from two
different areas of a country that share vastly different views, or
the students could be of different gender and feel uncomfortable
working together (p. 35-37).

   In addition, assumption can hinder students' understanding of
their schoolwork. Coelho (2012) notes that a student with excellent
math skills and a basic understanding of math concepts can still do
poorly on an assignment, if the questions assume that the student
is familiar with its cultural context. For example, a new student
from Syria may not be familiar with hockey and will struggle to
answer a question that depends on knowledge of the sport. Such
cultural assumptions can cause the student to feel confused and
alienated by the subject matter (Helmer & Eddy, 2012, p. 35).

   Assumptions can be made, not just by students, but by parents
as well. The North American school system is not identical to other
school systems in the world. Helmer and Eddy (2012) note that
newcomer students may not be receptive to the level of group
discussion expected Canadian schools (p. 61) Through group
discussions, students are invited to engage in learning and critique
ideas. However, newcomer students and their parents might
perceive this as laziness on the part of the teacher (Helmer & Eddy,
2012, p. 61). Also, group projects may feel academically dishonest
to some students who are used to classrooms where they only
work individually. There are often varying views on the amounts of
homework students should receive as well (p. 66) Students in North
America receive less than the desired amount compared to Asian
countries where students are expected to have between three to
five hours of homework every night (p. 67). This difference in views
can lead parents and students to assume that the education their
children are receiving is inferior (p. 67). Helmer and Eddy (2012)
50  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

suggest that teachers tackle assumptions by building bridges (p.69),
starting with the similarities between the teacher and the
newcomer family, and building a relationship from there. Limiting
assumptions about a student's culture, assumptions on what
students know, and accommodating student's and their family's
assumptions of education are ways to teach with culturally
responsive pedagogy.

   Linguistic Diversity
   In the past, students coming to Canada were encouraged to stop
using their first language completely, when they started school
(Coelho, 2012, p. 195). It was believed that dropping the first
language and focusing on English was the best way for students
to catch up to their English-speaking peers (p. 195). Canadian
researcher Jim Cummins referred to this idea as the monolingual
principle (ECUR 415, Module 3). Today's research proves that
linguistic diversity is an asset to students (Coelho, 2012, p. 195).
Bilingualism enhances students' cognitive abilities as well as offers
them more economic opportunities in the future (p. 195).
Linguistically diverse schools that encourage and embrace EAL
students' multiple languages can also teach students to appreciate
diversity and embrace different cultures (p. 195). Part of culturally
responsive pedagogy involves encouraging students to build on
their L1 as well as their English. Creating an environment where
students feel like their linguistic diversity is respected and
encouraged will benefit all students greatly by teaching them to
value bilingualism. Students can suffer negative effects to their
learning and self-confidence if they feel like their L1 is a negative
quality (p. 196). The student's L1 is not only a component of their
identity and source of pride but is also necessary for growing their
English abilities (p. 196-197). Experts have warned that students
who drop their L1 while learning an additional language may not be
efficient enough in either language to accomplish tasks (p. 198). For
schools today to adopt culturally responsive pedagogy, students
EAL2019-ESSAY5-SMITH  51

should not only be using their first language at home but also using
their L1 to build their English in school.

   The monolingual principle still influences Saskatchewan schools
today. English is encouraged in schools and students are instructed
to use it as the language of learning (Sterzuk & Nelson, 2016, p.
379). Sterzuk and Nelson (2016) argue in their article "Nobody Told
Me They Didn't Speak English!" Teach Language Views and Student
Linguistic Repertories in Hutterite Colony Schools in Canada that "the
goals [of the monolingual principle] are to keep student's
languages separate and to develop fluency in English" (p. 379).
Even though students are no longer being pushed to drop their
L1 students are still encouraged to stop using it while they are at
school to develop their English. According to Sterzuk and Nelson,
this concept ignores "students' potential to become bilingual or
multilingual, teachers miss the opportunity to build on the home
languages and the cultural practices of the student as strengths"
(p. 379). An example of this situation is in Saskatchewan Hutterite
schools. Hutterite children receive an English only education
despite being multilingual (p. 379). Despite the difficulty of
balancing a vast array of different language in mainstream
classrooms, schools can begin to limit the effect of the monolingual
principle by bringing in different languages and cultures into their
classroom to reflect the diversity of the school. Culturally
responsive pedagogy encourages teachers to adapt and include
the diversity of their students to the classroom environment. It not
only has a positive effect on the EAL students of the school but on
the English-speakers as well.

   Support Strategies
   Researchers Jim Cummins and Elizabeth Coelho state that a
student learning an additional language may need between five
and seven years to catch up to the level of their peers (Prokopchuk,
2014, 82). In the article Supporting Strategies for English as an
Additional Language (EAL) in PreK-12 Education, Prokopchuk (2014)
states that for EAL learners to catch up they need "to move beyond
52  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

conversational language toward academic language and this
transition requires strategic, targeted support over time" (p. 82).
Culturally responsive pedagogy has adapted to include support
strategies for EAL students to continue to develop their L1.
Prokopchuk also states that "languages are supported through
ministry funding to heritage language schools, ministry-approved
high school credit courses in various languages, and the availability
of multilingual resources in the Saskatchewan Public Library
System (p. 86). Coelho (2012) also recommends that schools create
language and culture clubs that allow students to showcase and
develop their cultural identities (p. 41). Culturally responsive
pedagogy nurtures each student's language and identity by
creating support communities that represent diverse learners.

   Conclusion
   Culturally responsive pedagogy was designed to "move beyond
the heroes and holidays approach" which schools previously used
to celebrate diversity (ECUR 415, Module 3). Schools would hold
an event that focused on one aspect of a culture's identity such
as food or clothing and celebrate for one day of the whole year
(ECUR 415, Module 3). Culturally responsive pedagogy emerged
out of a need to properly embrace and work alongside various
cultures within one school. Today, culturally responsive pedagogy
is needed more than ever with the vast growing diversity in Canada,
including Saskatchewan. As members of the school, teachers have
an obligation to help students develop their abilities and help EAL
students find their identity as bilingual, which is a part of culturally
responsive pedagogy. EAL students specifically need to feel that
their linguistic and cultural diversity are assets. With the increase
of diversity, our schools could help foster students to be accepting
of different cultures and world views which I believe is a necessity
as globalization continues. The future will see more mingling of
cultures than ever before and schools have the responsibility to
teach students with culturally responsive pedagogy so that
students navigate the world with their own culturally responsive
EAL2019-ESSAY5-SMITH  53

beliefs and respect for the beliefs of others. I aspire to develop in
my own teaching many aspects of culturally responsive pedagogy
including the following: welcome procedures, cultural assumptions,
linguistic diversity, and support strategies. I want to instill respect
and acceptance of diversity in my students no matter the cultural
makeup in the school or my classroom. Even in the increasingly
rare classroom that contains only English speakers from one
background, like the one I grew up in, students are still different.
Jim Cummins' iceberg model illustrates that there is so much more
to a student than what appears on the surface, so I believe that
every student should be treated without assumptions and with
a culturally responsive pedagogy (ECUR 415, Module 3). Using
materials, ideas, and perspectives within the classroom that are
diverse is the best way to prepare students for life after high school
and the globalization of the world. That is why I plan to teach
in my own classroom with a culturally responsive pedagogy and
help the school I am employed in embrace diversity through school
welcome procedures and support strategies that build on the
languages and cultures of students in the classroom.

6 - Intercultural Competence and
the Inclusive Classroom

SHAWN WALKER

English language learners (ELL) come from varying backgrounds,
with their own unique reasons for learning English as an Additional
Language (EAL). As new immigrant students arrive in Canada,
classroom demographics are changing and becoming increasingly
diversified. In order to welcome and effectively support ELLs,
teachers must strive to understand their students as individuals
and foster an inclusive learning environment within the classroom
and the school community.

   Understanding Culture
   The metaphor of an iceberg is frequently used by theorists to
represent and understand culture. Helmer and Eddy (2012)
indicate that the small portion of the iceberg above the waterline
represents aspects of culture that are the most visible, such as
"physical characteristics, distinctive styles of clothing, food, art and,
of course, language" (p. 33). While these are undoubtedly important
aspects of culture, they aren't the entire picture of an individual's
identity. Below the metaphorical waterline sits the "less visible,
often nonverbal, aspects of culture that, to a large extent, define
our behaviour toward and the ways we communicate with others"
(p.33). These aspects are rooted in moral values and social beliefs

                                                               55
56  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

that an individual holds, based on cultural upbringing. For teachers,
recognizing and understanding these underlying values and beliefs
is important because they are what guide their students' approach
to daily life (p.91). However, "it is often hardest to step outside
oneself and reach out to others because, in attempting to do this,
we are trying to override the mostly unconscious patterns that
regulate how we live our lives" (p.91). A responsible educator will
not shrink away from this challenge, but will meet their students
with an open mind, being sure to emphasize that "no culture is
"better" than another, but that cross-cultural understanding is an
important facet of learning a language" (Brown & Lee, 2015, p. 82).

   At the forefront of understanding the various cultures in the
classroom is the concept of intercultural competence. A teacher
with intercultural competence has the "ability to understand,
empathize with, and/or function in a culture or cultures other than
one's L1 culture" (Brown/& Lee, 2015, p. 634). In a general
classroom that includes ELLs, or a designated EAL classroom
comprised only of ELLs, the teacher must treat each student as
an individual and take into account that "[s]tudents may view the
process of education and each other in very different ways from
what we may be tempted to assume; yet they may...look to us to
help them find their way in the new culture and language in which
they find themselves suddenly immersed" (Helmer & Eddy, 2012,
p. 41). By acknowledging that students are individuals with unique
cultural backgrounds and motivations, teachers can begin to adjust
their instructional strategies, planning, and assessment to meet
the needs of their students. This awareness prevents educators
from making assumptions based on superficial observations, which
has the adverse effect of alienating students and compromising
meaningful student-teacher relationships.

   Promoting Culture in the School and Classroom
   An interculturally competent teacher who promotes an inclusive
classroom environment through cultural awareness and respect
from the first day of school provides a positive example for their
EAL2019-ESSAY6-WALKER  57

students. It is often the simplest forms of respect that can have
positive or negative implications, depending on how students are
approached. An example of this is addressing a student by their
proper name and form. This may seem obvious, but often times
names that are perceived as foreign or unfamiliar can intimidate
the teacher. Coelho (2012) notes that "names are an important part
of our identity and must be respected" (p. 156). This is where a
teacher must lead by example by making an effort to learn each
students' name, just as they would learn those of their English-
speaking students. It is best to avoid nicknames, or short forms,
since it can signal an unwillingness to learn on the teacher's part.
Students who see their teacher making an effort will be encouraged
to do the same. This is also incredibly important when it is time
to meet parents, as some cultures, such as in South Korea, lead
with their surnames, followed by their given names. Showing this
cultural understanding helps foster positive relationships between
parents, students, and the teacher.

   Ultimately, the goal of the interculturally competent educator is
to create interculturally competent learners. After all, the teacher is
only one individual in the room. Utilizing peer supports for those
second language learners (L2L) helps build community in the
classroom and integrate those L2Ls into the social dynamic of the
classroom. Coelho (2012) states, "[y]our positive attitude may not
only establish a climate of support, but also enable students of the
dominant language group to see language learning in a positive
light" (p.158). The effects from this benefit not only the L2Ls, but
also the native English speakers of the group.

   The classroom is but one room in an entire building. Coelho
(2012) discusses how, ideally, the school will take a multilingual
approach that "raises language awareness, celebrates linguistic
diversity, and helps students and families view their own languages
as assets just as valuable as the language of the school" (p. 202).
Coelho also discusses the idea of community languages, meaning
recognizing all of the languages that are present within a school's
58  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

population. Through open communication with parents, the school
can encourage parents to maintain the first language (L1) as it
"provides a necessary foundation for learning the school language"
(p. 202). The school's goal should be to make the community
languages visible, so students see themselves reflected in the
school. Simple solutions such as printing signs, notices, and posters
in the community languages provide opportunities for visibility.
It also encourages parental involvement as it "enables [parents]
to contribute to the school rather than feel excluded" because
of a lack of ability in the school language (p. 203). Supporting
community languages shows that a school holds a positive
language policy toward the L1s of its students, demonstrating
additive bilingualism, "where a language is held in prestige by the
community" (Brown & Lee, 2015, p. 169).

   Benefits of an Inclusive Learning Environment
   One main variable in ELL success is motivation. Referring back
to the idea of language policy mentioned above, it is important for
students to feel as though they are welcome in a new country, and
more directly, in their new school. Paraphrasing the work of Lo
Bianco, Brown and Lee (2015), we might ask, "How does this policy
or status affect the motivation and purpose of your students?"
and note that having a language policy in place that celebrates
the L1s of ELLs is "extremely important because it has direct and
substantial consequences for society, economics, education, and
culture" (p.168). A learner's L1 is a major component of identity
and a "source of cultural pride and self-esteem" (Coelho, 2012,
p. 196). A student who feels that their culture is accepted by the
dominant culture will be motivated to engage in language learning.
Stephen Krashen's Affective Filter Hypothesis proposes that there is a
"mechanism that allows or restricts the processing of input" based
on a number of factors, such as the learning environment, peer
and teacher interactions, as well as personal factors such as anxiety
(Saville-Troike & Barto, 2017, p. 214). The Ontario Capacity Building
Series on culturally responsive pedagogy states that "[i]n order to
EAL2019-ESSAY6-WALKER  59

ensure that all students feel safe, welcomed and accepted, and
inspired to succeed in a culture of high expectations for learning,
schools and classrooms must be responsive to culture" (Culturally
responsive pedagogy, p. 2). The goal of the inclusive classroom
is to provide a welcoming environment that reduces anxiety and
creates positive relationships between peers where students can
be themselves and feel comfortable taking risks with language.

   There are also cognitive advantages to encouraging the
continued development of ELLs first languages. Citing the work of
Genesee, Coelho (2012) notes that multilingual children are better
at problem solving, more creative, and express more tolerant
attitudes toward others than those children who are fluent in only
one language (p. 199). Coelho also points out that "students who
can think in more than one language appear to be more flexible
thinkers and develop cognitive skills that have a positive effect
on their overall cognitive abilities" (p. 198). A supportive learning
environment where students are encouraged to take pride in their
culture helps to accelerate the learning of the L2. Promoting
multilingualism does not just benefit L2 learners, however. Coelho
asserts that valuing the cultural and language backgrounds of all
students and promoting bilingualism as a "worthy and attainable
goal... [the] speakers of the dominant language or school language
may be encouraged to learn additional languages" (p. 202).

   The ultimate goal of the classroom teacher should be to "make
language [and cultural] diversity normal rather than unusual,
exotic, or problematic" (Coelho, 2012, p. 204). A heightened level of
awareness is needed to be an interculturally competent educator.
As educators "we must probe and question, and never assume
anything, as we work to increase our understanding of the various
backgrounds the students bring to our classrooms" (Helmer &
Eddy, 2012, p. 69).

   Rationale and Reflection
   I chose to write about intercultural competence and an inclusive
classroom environment for a variety of reasons. After taking ECUR
60  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

291 and reading through the section on language policy in Teaching
by Principles by H. Douglas Brown and Heekyeong Lee, I was struck
by the use of the example of the United States and the general
"English only" policy that most people hold there. Being from the
US, this put into academic language something that I always knew
existed. It helped me understand the major difference between the
way the US and Canada view second languages. I never shared the
view of "English only" while I grew up in the US. I always figured
people were just trying to get by and do their best in a new country
with a new language. This course (and the EAL program in general)
has taught me that there is a huge correlation between ability
in the L1 and successful acquisition of the L2. It has also helped
me understand the need to be reflective of my own views since
I am looking at the world through my own unique lens that is
not universal. In a way I always knew that, but understanding the
implications on the success of students learning a L2 has really
helped drive that point home for me.

   In practice, I believe that intercultural competence and inclusive
classrooms are important concepts in education. The reality here
in Canada is that teachers will be faced with classrooms full of
students from diverse backgrounds. Even if those students are
English speakers, there is still a need to be aware of cultural
differences and commonalities. That is part of being an empathetic
teacher that is approachable. It is important to not be discouraged
by differences and to find common ground in order to better
understand your students and their motivations. Living and
teaching in a predominantly English-speaking Mtis community in
northern Saskatchewan has shown me how important it is to
understand the culture of my students. Even in a rural village of
1,500 people, there is still diversity, although perhaps not to the
extent that can be seen in a city school. Of my 25 students last year,
23 were Mtis, one was Irish, and one was from India. My Mtis
students were always interested to hear how things were different
in Ireland or India during lessons. During a Language Arts lesson
EAL2019-ESSAY6-WALKER  61

on sports, we talked about how Canada's major sport is ice hockey,
while places like Ireland and India, where there isn't much snow,
enjoy rugby and cricket. We watched videos of all three sports on
YouTube and compared them using a Venn diagram. It was such
a simple lesson, but one they all remembered on the last day of
school.

   In my future practice as an EAL teacher I will strive to "build
bridges" as Helmer and Eddy (2012) point out in their text Look at
Me When I Talk to You. From the earliest days of my Bachelor of
Education program, I was always told to build rapport and cultural
understanding with students and parents. Helmer and Eddy's text
helped clearly illustrate the importance of this concept. Now to
immediately contradict what I just said, I could appreciate the note
on page 68 where Helmer and Eddy note that in some cultures
parents only interact with the teacher when there is a problem.
Aside from behavioural issues, the parents put the full trust in the
teacher to do their job. It is easy to see that teacher education
programs have the best intentions when saying to have parental
contact, but it isn't as simple as just calling up the parents. A
teacher needs to be aware of their students' cultural norms
surrounding the relationship between school and home before
making any assumptions!

   The concept of intercultural competence will make me become
a more reflective practitioner when it comes to cultural awareness
with my ELLs. My goal going forward is to develop my instructional
strategies to support all language learners and continue to learn
more about the diverse cultures with which I will work.

7- Instructional Strategies to
Support EAL Learners at Various
Stages of the CFR

JANA BLECHINGER

Within recent years, the number of newcomer students welcomed
by Saskatoon schools has risen significantly, and this trend will
likely continue. In September 2013, Saskatoon Public Schools alone
had an EAL population of just under twenty percent of its total
school enrolment (Anderson & Tilbury, 2014). Most of these
students face the dual challenge of learning English in addition to
learning content. Canadian-born students who speak a language
other than English in the home may also require help to achieve
academic proficiency in English. In order to support all of these
students, who enter our schools at various ages and varying levels
of English proficiency, classroom teachers need to develop an
awareness of instructional strategies that best support English
language learners (ELLs) at each level of the Common Framework
of Reference (CFR). This essay will provide teachers with strategies
that support elementary-aged students at CFR levels A1, A2, and
B1, and will foster greater understanding among classroom
teachers of the capabilities and needs of their English language
learners.

                                                               65
66  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

   Background on the CFR
   The CFR, which is based on the reliable and reputable Common
European Framework of Reference (CEFR) developed in 2001, was
introduced in Saskatchewan in spring of 2012. It is a language
reference scale for assessing the language proficiency of ELLs and
for monitoring their progress over time (Prokopchuk, 2014).
Students at CFR levels A1 and A2 on the scale are considered basic
users of the language. These levels are further sub-divided into
A1.1, A1.2, A2.1, and A2.2. Students at level B1, which is subdivided
into B1.1 and B1.2, are considered to be independent users of the
language. When students have exited level B1.2, they "will have
reached a level of proficiency that allows them to work more
independently on improving language proficiency within the
context of language instruction" (CFR, 2013, p. 3), and formal EAL
support for these students is no longer provided. The CFR
document indicates that "learners benefit from differentiated
instruction strategies and classroom adaptations while working
alongside classroom English-speaking peers who also have diverse
skills and abilities" (CFR, 2013, p. 3). Providing elementary
classroom teachers with ideas for such strategies and adaptations
is the focus of the remainder of this essay.
   The Scaffolding Approach
   In her book Language and Learning in Multilingual Classrooms: A
Practical Approach (2012), Elizabeth Coelho provides a scaffolding-
based framework which indicates ways that teachers can adjust
their instruction so that strategies are aligned with ELLs' language
abilities and success is made attainable. Her framework is based
on a model created by well-known researcher Dr. Jim Cummins,
whose distinction between BICS (basic interpersonal
communication skills) and CALP (cognitive academic language
proficiency) underlie his model's four quadrants, which are
intersected by continua of contextual supports provided i.e.,
scaffolding) and cognitive demands placed on the learner (Coelho,
EAL2019-ESSAY7-BLECHINGER  67

2012). Coelho's scaffolding framework will be used as a reference
for the strategies that follow.

   The A1 Learner
   According to the CFR snapshot of language ability, students at
CFR level A1 can understand and use simple, familiar words and
very basic phrases to meet their needs. They can introduce
themselves in a simple way and answer basic questions about
personal information or personal items. Simple interaction is
possible provided that the other person speaks slowly and provides
support. Students at level A1 have limited ability to use simple
grammatical structures (CFR, 2013).
   In the beginning, A1 learners are primarily working on the
development of BICS. Their instruction, therefore, should be
designed in Quadrant A of Coelho's scaffolding framework. In this
quadrant, ELLs are provided with "maximum support or scaffolding
for tasks that are engaging but not academically challenging,
especially at the very beginning [and] instruction is focused on
the development of everyday language plus essential academic
vocabulary in various subject areas" (Coelho, 2012, p. 106). Content
should be related to their own lives and immediate needs. These
students, in the beginning, may not be able to attain regular
curriculum outcomes. Teachers will need to modify or replace the
outcomes with alternate outcomes in order for students to focus
on the development of BICS (Coelho, 2012).
   One of the most essential instructional strategies for A1 students
in Quadrant A is to provide them with comprehensible input, which
means that "the language being used for instruction (input) is at
a level that is understood by learners (comprehensible), although
it is slightly above the learner's proficiency level. This approach
promotes language growth" (Prokopchuk, ECUR 415.3, 2017).
Teachers can reduce the language barrier by modifying their
speech and language, and by providing additional contextual
support through the use of visuals. Coelho (2012) explains that
teachers can help learners infer meaning by facing students when
68  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

talking to them, articulating clearly with a slight increase in volume,
emphasizing key words, pausing slightly between phrases,
simplifying vocabulary and sentence structure, and using gestures
along with facial expression and mime. Visuals such as "models,
toys, manipulatives, pictures, charts, flashcards, vocabulary lists,
posters, and banners, as well as demonstrations and hands-on
activities" (Coelho, 2012, p. 236) will help ELLs at this level to infer
meaning from language and learn concepts. In Quadrant A, it is
also beneficial to use L1 as scaffolding for L2 tasks. Allowing
students to initially develop ideas in their first language enables
them to produce more thoughtful and developed work than if they
are confined to using their limited abilities in L2. Examples for
the classroom include allowing students to write notes, first drafts,
journal entries, and insert unknown words using their first
language (Coelho, 2012, p. 212). The use of these instructional
strategies will enable A1 learners to make connections to their prior
knowledge and experiences which is key to helping them learn.

   For A1 learners who are young children and also for those who
are older beginners, Coelho explains that:

   ...some of the strategies commonly used with young children in
the early stages of literacy development are equally effective with
students of all ages who are just beginning to learn the language of
instruction and who may or may not have well-developed literacy
skills in their own language (2012, p. 266).

   When using these strategies with older A1 students, it is
important that the content and resources provided are age-
appropriate. A print-rich environment is important in developing
reading and writing skills. Labelling in multiple languages the
classroom and places in the school, surrounding learners with
environmental print, and providing reading material matched to
students' ability and present level of comprehension are examples
of instructional strategies that are helpful to these learners.
Creating language experience stories based on personal or shared
experiences, allowing students to listen to audio recordings while
EAL2019-ESSAY7-BLECHINGER  69

following text, and providing shared reading experiences with age-
appropriate texts are also strategies that provide A1 learners with
the scaffolding necessary to develop literacy skills (Coelho, 2012).

   Cooperative learning is another Quadrant A strategy that
scaffolds beginning ELLs in the development of oral language, and
small group interaction also helps them learn social skills and
understand the value of collaboration. The Ontario Ministry
document ELL Voices in the Classroom (2009) explains that
cooperative learning strategies provide increased opportunities for
talk, which are especially beneficial for ELLs. Working in small
groups with more proficient English speakers provides ELLs with
language models and essential feedback, and occasionally
grouping beginner ELLs to work on adapted curricular-related tasks
can be beneficial. They suggest assigning students to groups of
three to five and changing the groups periodically for different
subjects and activities. It is important to establish clear routines,
timelines, and expectations as well as develop conversational
strategies so that these learners have the necessary social skills to
express ideas and manage disagreements.

   Other key instructional strategies for A1 ELLs, especially those
at beginning levels, include: practicing new vocabulary by
incorporating physical activity and objects as well as by using choral
repetition, songs, rhymes, games, puzzles and role play; providing
word banks for labeling tasks, completing sentences and graphic
organizers; providing examples and modelling think-aloud
processes while writing; and offering supportive, indirect feedback
for oral and written errors by modelling correct forms (Coelho,
2012, p. 104).

   Jane Hill (2016) in her article Engaging Your Beginners, urges
teachers not to water down the curriculum for beginning language
learners, but to use tiered questioning that is not only appropriate
to the student's ability, but that also promotes higher-order
thinking through the use of high-level questions. The use of tiered
questions as an instructional strategy will "increase students'
70  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

access to and comprehension of the content and provide English
learners with opportunities to practice their new language" (p. 3).
She explains that for students in the Preproduction stage of
language acquisition, which would be students at the very
beginning of level A1, tiered questions about content such as Show
me...Circle the...Where is...? Who has...? match student capabilities.
As students become more proficient and enter the Early Production
stage, high level questions that require ELLs to answer yes or no,
chose either-or, and answer Who...? What...? and How many...?
become appropriate. Hill says that "with the aid of tiered
questions, Preproduction and Early Production students can be
included in all classroom instruction rather than working on a
nonrelated activity" (2016, p. 3). As ELLs transition between level A1
and A2, they are capable of answering Why...? How...? Explain...and
can provide short-sentence answers, all of which are examples
of tiered questions from the Speech Emergence stage. Tiered
questioning is also a key strategy to use when assessing ELLs.

   The A2 Learner
   The CFR describes A2 learners as being able to comprehend
sentences and basic information related to their own needs and
family activities. They are able to communicate information on
matters familiar to them, including simple and routine tasks,
through direct exchange with others. They can use simple
language to describe their background, surroundings, and
interests. They are able to use some simple grammatical
structures with accuracy, but routinely make basic errors in things
such as verb tenses and use of articles (CFR, 2013).
   Coelho's Quadrant A is designed for students at both CFR levels
A1 and A2, therefore instruction for A2 learners will also require
maximum scaffolding, and the instructional strategies suggested
above for A1 learners will also be required for these students
(Coelho, 2012). It is important to remember, however, that A2
students have more developed BICS than A1 students, and are
growing in their ability to complete tasks that are more cognitively
EAL2019-ESSAY7-BLECHINGER  71

challenging. Instruction in this quadrant will still focus on BICS,
but instructional strategies that develop CALP will be increasingly
applicable as they align with students' growing proficiency.

   In addition to the print-rich environment strategies that help
level A1 ELLs develop literacy skills, A2 learners are increasingly
able to benefit from intensive (guided) reading as an instructional
strategy, in which "the teacher intervenes between students and
text, guiding and helping them as they read. Additional support
may be provided through the use of key visuals" (Coelho, 2012 p.
273). Before reading, teachers prepare ELLs for the text by pre-
teaching key words, using visuals or other sources to build
background knowledge of concepts, finding out what students
already know about the topic possibly through jointly completing
a KWL chart, surveying the text to learn about its organization and
features, as well as predicting what they will learn from the text
(Coelho, 2012). During reading, the teacher guides ELLs as they
learn how to read material in different ways depending on the
purpose for reading, an example of which would be skimming a
chapter to understand its main idea. Other strategies that provide
scaffolding are: providing guiding questions or prompts before
reading paragraphs; teacher modelling of pronunciation, rhythm,
and intonation as well as think-aloud modelling of useful reading
strategies; providing graphic organizers for students to complete as
they read; stopping after each section to check for understanding
and answer student questions; and modelling think-aloud
strategies for dealing with new vocabulary (Coelho, 2012). After
reading, teachers can provide questions that encourage students
to re-read specific sections. It is recommended to limit reading
aloud by students during the initial reading of a text; however
after reading, students feel more comfortable with the text and can
be asked to locate and read aloud specific sections of the text.
Teachers can select vocabulary words or phrases to study which
will be useful in other lessons or subject areas, and can provide
72  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

blank or partially-completed graphic organizers with information
from the text for students to complete (Coelho, 2012).

   An after-reading comprehension task appropriate for an A1
learner might be to arrange pictures from the story in order, while
an A2 ELL is capable of not only ordering pictures, but matching
simple text to the pictures as well. To help students develop their
writing at the sentence level, teachers can provide level A2 learners
with writing frameworks that provide scaffolding such as sentence
combining that helps them write longer sentences, sentence
completion activities that teach how to construct sentences of
various types, as well as simple paragraph frames that include
series of prompts (Coelho, 2012). Since students at level A2 are
able to understand and answer questions at the sentence level,
Hill's Speech Emergence tiered questions described in the previous
section should continue to be used as an instructional strategy to
help increase comprehension of content (Hill, 2016).

   The B1 Learner
   B1 learners, according to the CFR, are able to understand the
gist of clear regular speech if the topic is familiar. They can use
language to handle most in-school and after-school situations that
may arise, can describe experiences and events, and can briefly
justify and explain their opinions and plans. They are able to write
simple, connected text on familiar topics or those of personal
interest. Their use of structures and patterns is reasonably
accurate in routine or predictable contexts (CFR, 2013).
   ELLs at level B1 can now be supported by instructional strategies
in Quadrant B of Coelho's framework, in which "students continue
to receive maximum support for comprehension and language
production, but the tasks become more academically challenging,
so that students begin to accelerate their acquisition of academic
language" (Coelho, 2012, p. 106). Coelho also advises that by
continuing to provide quality scaffolding, teachers are able to help
B1 learners achieve many regular curricular outcomes, unless the
subject or topic is culturally or linguistically demanding. Coelho
EAL2019-ESSAY7-BLECHINGER  73

further explains that many of the strategies central to Quadrant A
remain important for B1 learners. Specifically, she suggests that
continuing to provide comprehensible instruction, supportive
feedback, strategic use of students' first languages, and
cooperative learning will help students in Quadrant B cope as
learning tasks become more demanding (Coelho, 2004).

   Intensive reading is a key instructional strategy for helping level
B1 students get meaning from complex text. The above-
mentioned before, during, and after reading strategies apply to
these learners as well, and can be extended to match their growing
capabilities. Key visuals remain important. Webs, t-charts, Venn
diagrams, and story maps are "content-specific graphic organisers
that provide a visual representation of key ideas and the
relationships among ideas in a text, a lesson, or a unit of study,
making visible the underlying organization of ideas" (Coelho, 2012,
p. 281). Using key visuals during intensive reading reduces the
language demands and enhances ELLs' understanding of the text.
After-reading strategies beneficial for B1 learners include:
encouraging students to make inferences beyond and form
opinions about the text; using role play to re-live the text and
encourage the use of new words; focusing on transition words and
teaching their use; and completing blank or partially-completed
graphic organizers with information from the text (Coelho, 2012
date). Word banks for completing increasingly complex sentences
and graphic organizers based on the content of a lesson can be
used. The word banks can provide more word choices or forms of
a word, and can manipulate grammatical endings such as plurals
(Coelho, 2012). Coelho also explains that research indicates
grammar instruction integrated into daily lessons is more effective
than isolated instruction. During intensive reading, teachers can
help B1 students learn grammar by looking at patterns such as
various verb forms that recur in a text, and then reinforce learning
by finding examples in other texts and completing extension
activities such as cloze passages.
74  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

   Teaching vocabulary as it arises, and focusing on those words
that will be transferable to other academic contexts is an important
instructional strategy for B1 learners. Roessingh (2016) draws on
the model of tiered vocabulary developed by Beck, McKeowen, &
Kucan (2002) to encourage the teaching of these Tier 2 vocabulary
words because of their high utility and recurrence, and their
importance in further developing students' CALP which leads to
academic achievement. Examples of Tier 2 vocabulary words,
which are often verbs with Greek or Latin origins and relate to
procedures, are "investigate, experiment, analyze, and prepare"
(Roessingh, p. 69).

   Instructional strategies that scaffold specific forms of writing are
helpful, especially for B1 learners in the older elementary grades,
as they are expected to go beyond writing expressively and
narratively and write non-fiction forms such as explanation and
persuasion (Coelho, 2012). Teachers can help B1 learners
understand how these types of writing should be organized by
providing writing frameworks and templates for paragraphs, as
well as composition templates that help older students write pieces
that are two or more paragraphs in length. Coelho (2016) suggests
providing completed models of writing for ELLs to see, as well as
modelling the writing process by thinking aloud and demonstrating
the steps in process writing. She also explains than another
important Quadrant B strategy is to teach and guide students in a
structured way through group and individual research projects, as
this type of learning may be unfamiliar to ELLs. Providing students
with alternative resource material may be necessary.

   Conclusion
   Coelho (2012) says, "Language learning is a long-term process.
While the help of a specialist language teacher is invaluable,
especially for the first few years, language support must be
provided over an extended period of time, by every teacher, in
every classroom, in every subject area (p. 64)." Through
scaffolding, providing comprehensible input, and offering
EAL2019-ESSAY7-BLECHINGER  75

contextual supports, classroom teachers can implement
instructional strategies such as those suggested in this paper to
differential learning for their ELLs at CFR levels A1, A2, and B1
therefore helping them to develop language proficiency in English
and achieve academic success. It is important to note that ELLs
may be functioning at different CFR levels within each of the four
strands of listening, speaking, reading, and writing, and this will
need to be taken into consideration by teachers when planning
strategy use. Another important consideration that teachers may
need to address, highlighted by Helmer & Eddy (2012), is that
differences in the backgrounds and culture of ELLs may influence
their familiarity with and appreciation for some of the strategies
used and valued in Canada, such as cooperative learning and group
discussion.

   Due to the confines of this paper, only general suggestions for
all elementary aged-students have been given; some instructional
strategies will require adaptation to make them applicable to
younger or older students within each CFR level. A deeper look into
strategies that promote vocabulary development is also needed. In
my role as an EAL teacher, these are areas I plan to focus on in the
future in order to continue providing specific and effective support
for classroom teachers and the EAL students they serve.

   Teaching is a demanding and complex job, and the growing
number of EAL students in classrooms with diverse language needs
and cultural experiences places additional burdens on teachers.
Armed with instructional strategies such as those suggested in this
paper, however, elementary teachers will be better equipped to
meet the needs of English language learners at all ages and stages
of development.

8 - Supporting the Needs of EAL
Learners

DANIELLE CLATNEY

Introduction
   Teachers welcome a variety of students into their classrooms

throughout the school year. Over the last ten years or so, the
growing population of learners of English as an Additional
Language (EAL) has dramatically changed the classroom
composition in many Saskatchewan schools and in schools across
Canada. In Saskatchewan, "The Ministry of Education describes
learners of EAL as speakers of other languages who are adding
English to their language repertoire in order to access the English
language curriculum and achieve grade level outcomes"
(Prokopchuk, 2014, p. 82). Since most EAL students spend the
majority of their day in mainstream classrooms, their needs cannot
be met by an EAL teacher specialist alone. Coelho (2012)
emphasized, "All teachers need to be prepared to support L2Ls
(Second Language Learners) so that they can learn the language of
instruction and experience success with the curriculum" (p. 148).
The numbers of EAL learners making their way into my own
mainstream elementary classes have emphasized the important
role that all teachers play in the education of EAL learners and the
need to explore best practices for teaching them. This essay will

                                                               77
78  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

demonstrate how equity in instruction and assessment is possible
for all students, not just EAL learners, if teachers implement five
key practices that have proven to be effective for students learning
English.

   Five Key Practices to Support the Needs of EAL Learners

 Culturally Responsive Teaching

One key practice that supports EAL learner needs is moving
towards culturally responsive teaching. The Ontario Ministry of
Education Student Achievement Division (2013) emphasized, "In
order to ensure that all students feel safe, welcomed and accepted,
and inspired to succeed in a culture of high expectations for
learning, schools and classrooms must be responsive to culture" (p.
1). They encourage embracing a collaborative approach to learning
by building strong relationships with students' families, cultural
groups, and community partners. Another key component of
culturally responsive teaching is viewing student diversity in terms
of student strengths that enhance learning rather than as
challenges or deficits of the student. This includes encouraging
students to use their first language to support and represent their
learning. As well, "Connecting new learning to prior knowledge and
experience helps L2Ls to learn the language they need to express
knowledge and skills they already have in their own language"
(Coelho, 2012, p. 233).

   Teachers can draw on student languages and experiences to
represent their knowledge in the curriculum in a meaningful way
that can allow them to see themselves reflected in classroom
learning. Helmer and Eddy (2012) advised, "We must note the
differences, acknowledge their validity, create mechanisms to
uncover their positive benefits, and incorporate them into our
teaching as a way of building bridges among students, and
between our students and ourselves" (p. 22). In doing this, we
EAL2019-ESSAY8-CLATNEY  79

create a positive and accepting culturally responsive teaching
environment.

 Integrated Language and Content Instruction

The second key practice that supports the needs of EAL learners
is the integration of language and content instruction. Genesee
and Lindholm-Leary (2013) state "People do not learn language and
then use it; rather, they learn language by using it" (p. 3). Coelho
(2012) recommends content-based instruction, or integrated
language and content instruction, as an approach to use with EAL
learners. She explains that in this approach, students learn the
language by talking, listening to, reading, and writing about content
or subject matter. The content area and academic task determine
the presentation of grammatical items as required. Coelho (2012)
further explains, "Academic language occurs mainly in the
classroom and therefore is best learned through engagement with
the curriculum, adapted as necessary according to the students'
level of proficiency in the language" (p. 61). She suggested that
the best way to acquire a language is by using it to do something
meaningful, such as learning how to play a game, solving a word
problem in math, or working on a group project. One way to
achieve this is through inquiry learning, which allows the teacher
to facilitate learning through active student involvement in
constructing knowledge, which builds information-processing and
problem-solving skills. Coelho (2012) writes that "Every teacher
needs to incorporate direct instruction on essential academic
vocabulary that arises within the context of the lesson and model
the use of vocabulary acquisition strategies that students can apply
to their own reading" (p. 317). This allows for improved
comprehension and works towards independent learning. By
combining language and content instruction, EAL learners can
progress in language learning while working towards the same
curriculum outcomes as their peers.
80  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

   One other point to keep in mind with integrated language and
content instruction is the necessity to focus on outcome
assessment in content areas. Helmer and Eddy (2012) stress "If the
objective of a lesson is to ensure that students understand content,
evaluate their speaking and writing for content, not grammar" (p.
118). Student performance should be assessed in ways that do not
depend on their proficiency in English. This is where differentiation
comes in.

 Differentiated Instruction Guided by Levels of Language
   Proficiency

Using levels of language proficiency to guide differentiated
instruction is the third key practice that supports EAL learners.
In Saskatchewan, the Ministry of Education (2013) introduced the
Common Framework of Reference (CFR). This provincial language
reference scale is based on the Common European Framework
of Reference (CEFR), created by the Council of Europe, and allows
teachers to monitor progress of EAL learners by identifying and
charting language proficiency levels. It also facilitates student self-
assessment with a Can Do Self-Assessment Scale. Coelho (2016)
emphasizes that:

   Using tools designed for use with ELLs informs teachers whether
the student is progressing appropriately along a normal path of
development for ELLs, and what the next steps should be, with the goal
of enabling the ELL to catch up to native speakers of the same age
within a five- or six-year period. (p. 286)

   EAL learners are often unable to meet curriculum outcomes in
the exact same way as native speakers of English. Gottlieb (2006)
asserts, "The skills and knowledge associated with content take
precedence and the language demands are adjusted according
to the students' language proficiency levels" (p. 64). Teachers
differentiate instruction by providing clear, simple oral and written
instructions, by slowing down their speech slightly, by using
EAL2019-ESSAY8-CLATNEY  81

developmentally appropriate comprehensible input, by allowing
extra time for students to comprehend key concepts, formulate
answers, and complete assignments, and by varying the length or
complexity of assignments. Helmer and Eddy (2012) pointed out,
"Projects that involve using many different skills give EAL learners
an opportunity to participate more fully, demonstrating their range
of talents and abilities" (p. 63). Differentiated instruction allows
students to highlight their strengths.

   Coelho (2016) also encourages differentiation through the use
the alternative assessment strategies to enable students to
demonstrate learning in ways that do not depend completely on
their proficiency in English. One strategy involves removing or
lowering the language barrier by allowing use of the first language
or dictionaries. Other strategies include simplifying language,
giving oral tests, allowing students to physically show what they
know, using cloze passages or graphic organizers, and asking fewer
questions on tests. Teachers can also provide models representing
a range of performance, provide opportunities for practice and
feedback before actual assessment, use assessment portfolios or
learning journals, and provide extra time to complete work being
assessed. Differentiation of both instruction and assessment is
critical for EAL learner success.

 Scaffolding Learning

The fourth key practice that supports EAL learners is the use of
the scaffolding strategy of teaching and learning. Coelho (2012)
explains that scaffolding allows the teacher, as an expert, to make
success attainable for all students by providing "support that
enables students to achieve levels of performance beyond their
independent level and gradually moving them towards
independence at that level so that they can begin working at the
next, with continued scaffolding" (p. 102). The Ontario Ministry of
Education (2009) advised, "Unless there is plenty of scaffolding to
82  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

support comprehension, ELLs may spend large amounts of time
sitting at their desks, with little understanding of what is happening
around them" (p. 5). In a basic way, scaffolding learning may
include using gestures, facial expressions, pictures, or realia to
clarify concepts and support comprehension and it is essential to
ensure EAL learner success and the development of language skills.

   Reiss (2005) states that there are two types of language skills
(Cummins,1984) and that EAL learners must transition from one
to the other for academic needs at school. Basic Interpersonal
Communicative Skills (BICS) is the language of everyday activities
that takes one to three years to acquire. Cognitive Academic
Language Proficiency (CALP) skills involve the language of the
classroom and require students to do things with language that
are more abstract and cognitively complex. This language typically
takes five to seven years to acquire. Roessingh (2016) stressed that
academic vocabulary (CALP) must be taught with a focus on words
that are high utility or general academic words that travel across
curricular boundaries (sometimes referred to as Tier 2 words).
Students must shift from learning to read to reading to learn.
Prokopchuk (2014) articulated, "Learners of EAL need to move
beyond conversational language toward academic language and
this transition requires strategic, targeted support over time" (p.
82). Scaffolding can provide this support.

   Cummins and Early (2015) recommend the use of specific
instructional strategies to scaffold students' ability to understand
and use academic language. These include the use of graphic
organizers and visuals, writing frameworks and templates, hands-
on experiences, collaborative group work, guided projects, use of
L1 for a variety of purposes, supporting students in acquiring
efficient learning strategies, and clarifying language features and
structures. The Ontario Ministry of Education (2009) also
recommends pre-teaching key vocabulary words before a lesson,
encouraging oral rehearsal of key ideas or vocabulary, and
checking often for comprehension. Helmer and Eddy (2012)
EAL2019-ESSAY8-CLATNEY  83

recognized, "The importance of establishing clear, consistent
routines and expectations, as well as the students' continuing need
for feedback and support, cannot be overemphasized" (p. 117).
Scaffolding learning is a long-term process for EAL learners and
their teachers.

 Opportunities for Interaction

Coelho (2012) reinforces the fifth key practice to support EAL
learners in her statement, "L2Ls need frequent sustained
interaction with native-speaker peers and adults in order to learn
the language to a high standard of performance" (p. 61). She notes
that "Opportunities for purposeful talk enable students to clarify
ideas, share their knowledge and experience, and solve problems
collaboratively" (p. 228). Coelho believes that this authentic
interaction provides opportunities to negotiate meaning and allows
EAL learners to develop oral fluency, grammatical accuracy, and
an adequate vocabulary when they receive comprehensible input,
produce meaningful output, and receive supportive feedback to
enable them to refine their language use. Genesee and Lindholm-
Leary (2013) assert "Authentic communication in the classroom
about matters of academic importance provides critical context for
learning the communicative functions of the new language" (p. 6).
This kind of authentic interaction can be facilitated through small-
group activities that challenge EAL learners to participate orally
rather than passively and take place in a learning environment
where EAL learners feel safe to experiment with the language.
Relevant, authentic tasks that use hands-on, interactive learning
and have real-life application can be very effective in promoting
purposeful, interactive language use to the benefit of EAL learners.
Teachers should also remember that opportunities for interaction
occur inside and outside of the classroom at school. Helmer and
Eddy (2012) suggest, "Encouraging EAL learners to participate in
extracurricular activities supports their social, emotional, cultural
84  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

and linguistic adjustment" (p. 121). Teachers can support EAL
learners by encouraging interaction in all school environments.

   Conclusion and Reflection
   All teachers play an important role in the successful integration
of EAL learners into the classroom and school environment
throughout the school year. The growing population of EAL
students has created a need for teachers to re-evaluate their
approaches to teaching in order to allow EAL students to
experience success with school curricula. Gottlieb (2006)
recognized, "There are instructional strategies, supports, and
methods that facilitate English language learners' language
development and conceptual understanding" (p. 70). By moving
toward culturally responsive teaching, integrating language and
content instruction, differentiating instruction guided by levels of
language proficiency, scaffolding learning, and providing
opportunities for interaction, teachers will gradually implement the
five key practices to support EAL learners and create equity in
instruction and assessment for all learners. I have used these five
key practices while teaching Core French and Social Studies from
Grades 1-8, and I look forward to challenging myself professionally
as I ensure that these five practices continue to be evident in my
own teaching. Not only will I be supporting the unique needs of my
EAL learners, I will be supporting all learners, because all students
can benefit from these teaching practices.

9 - The Power of Visual
Notetaking: Empowering EAL
Student Learning in the
Classroom

SARAH GERRARD

English as Additional Language (EAL) students are diverse.
Prokopchuk (2017) defines EAL learners as "recent immigrants,
refugees; fee-paying and international students; First Nations and
Mtis students; Hutterite students; or, local students who speak
languages other than English when they arrive at school" (p. 3).
With the increased numbers of EAL students in Saskatchewan
classes, visual notetaking is a powerful teaching tool that teachers
should embrace. Visual notetaking, herein defined as drawings that
combine both visual and text elements to convey information,
enhances teacher-student communication, helps EAL students
acquire their second language (L2), supports students learning
academic vocabulary, enhances memory performance, and is
culturally responsive. As someone who has been on both sides
of language instruction--both as an L2 learner and a teacher of
L2 students--I am convinced of the value of visual notetaking and
plan to infuse it into my own lessons in the future. The research

                                                               87
88  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

clearly illustrates that when teachers incorporate visual notetaking
in their classes, they amplify their EAL students' comprehension of
subject matter and simultaneously enrich their students' learning
experiences.

   EAL Newcomers in Saskatchewan Schools
   There has been an immense increase in EAL learners entering
Saskatchewan schools in the last eight years. In 2009, "Ministry of
Education sources indicate that less than one percent of all K-12
students required EAL support" (Prokopchuk, 2017, p. 6), whereas
in 2015, "8.5% of Saskatchewan students in Grades 1-12 were
receiving EAL support" (Prokopchuk, 2017, p. 11). In Saskatchewan,
EAL students' placement in classes is often based on their age
versus their L2 fluency, which "takes into account the research that
students are more motivated when placed with groups of age-
alike students, as well as guidelines in place in other provinces"
(Anderson & Tilbury, 2014, p. 91). Because urban school divisions,
such as Saskatoon and Regina, have experienced higher EAL
student enrollments, they are often able to provide specific
programming for their EAL students using a "pull-out . . . push-
in . . . co-teaching approach" (Anderson & Tilbury, 2014, p. 89),
even offering specific EAL courses in high schools. In contrast,
rural school divisions often employ itinerant teachers who provide
professional development to classroom teachers working with EAL
students, but rarely teach EAL courses themselves. This means
that many EAL students across Saskatchewan are relying on their
classroom teachers to support their L2 learning; in an era when
support staff are being cut due to budget restraints, this places
even more pressure on teachers to differentiate and adapt their
instruction. Visual notetaking is one way that teachers can better
support L2 learning and offers a practical approach to enriching
their lessons for all students.
   Visual Notetaking: A Powerful Teaching Tool
EAL2019-ESSAY9-GERRARD  89

 Visual Notetaking Enhances Communication

Visual notetaking offers teachers a powerful way through which
they can convey meaning to EAL students. Using Vygotsky's (1978)
zone of proximal development, teachers can explicitly teach
students how to construct visual notes and model visual notetaking
themselves, scaffolding their instruction before gradually shifting
to support students in creating their own original visual notes.
Carroll (1991) wrote that "students should be encouraged to draw
into meaning" because drawing is "a powerful writing tool" (pp.
35-38), arguably because "Before there are words, there are
images" (Rico, 1983, p. 157). In essence, sketches convey meaning.
Examples of visual notetaking approaches include: edu-sketches
(Pillars, 2016), sketchnoting (Rohde, 2013), and info-doodlingTM
(Brown, 2014).

   The authors of these approaches all stress that teachers need
not be artists (in fact, Pillars discourages this), and describe visual
notes as being constructed from expressive fonts, shapes, stick
figures, symbols, and selective use of colour, with special attention
focused on how containers of information are connected together
(For an example, see: https://www.bluelatitude.com/how-we-think/
an-introduction-to-sketchnotes/ ). Pillars (2016) writes that since
"nonlinguistic symbols. . . can be imparted quickly and clearly
without a single word. . . across linguistic barriers" (p. 6), visual
notetaking helps communicate meaning to EAL students in a way
that written or spoken words do not. In fact, Parkland Ambulance's
use of Kwikpoint brochures (Karasiuk, personal communication,
Sept. 24, 2017) reflects this sentiment since these brochures use
visual graphics to "foster two-way communication when no
interpreter is available" (Kwikpoint, 2016, p.1). Although all learners
benefit from visual notetaking, EAL students arguably have more to
gain by having their teachers use this approach since art functions
as a universal language.

   Visuals Help EAL Students Acquire Better Language Fluency
90  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

   There are a lot of similarities between how young children learn
to identify letters, words, and their corresponding sounds in early
literacy and how EAL learners acquire language and literacy in their
L2. The Institute for the Development of Educational Achievement
(2004) states that "the best approach to reading instruction is one
that incorporates explicit instruction in phonemic awareness,
systematic phonics instruction, method to improve fluency, and
ways to enhance comprehension" (p. 1). DiLorenzo, Rody, Bucholz,
and Brady (2011) state that, "Of these critical areas, the alphabetic
principle is commonly identified as a challenge to many young
readers" (p. 28). EAL learners go through a similar process of
learning the Roman alphabet, attaching sounds to letters and
words, and gaining fluency in their L2. Citing research that showed
"that prereaders who were taught letter-sound associations
through integrated picture mnemonics learned more letter-sound
associations than did their peers who were not exposed to the
mnemonics" (DiLorenzo et al., 2011, p. 29), DiLorenzo et al. (2011)
conducted a study on kindergarten students who were developing
their sublexical skills and found that kindergarten students who
received instruction about "letter-sound knowledge and
phonological awareness" (p. 29) using Itchy's mnemonic alphabet
were "better able to segment words into individual sounds" (p.
32) and "better able to decode unfamiliar (nonsense) words than
those who were in the comparison class" (p. 33). While "educators
and administrators understand that the developmental stages in
learning one's first language (between 0-5 years of age) are not
replicated by EAL learners at school" (Prokopchuk, 2017, Module 7,
p. 1), some of the same strategies are effective in supporting L2
acquisition.

   I have extensive experience as an L2 learner: I completed
elementary and middle school in a French immersion program,
studied Japanese for three years in high school, and took two
introductory Spanish courses in university. My Japanese language
teacher taught our class the hiragana alphabet using mnemonics,
EAL2019-ESSAY9-GERRARD  91

which is probably why, two decades later, I still remember how
to read and write it (for examples, see images for a key and no
smoking on the hiranga alphabet website). The time it took me to
learn the hiragana alphabet was much faster than the time it took
me to learn the Roman alphabet as a young child, because "L2L
[second language learners] who start learning the language years
later than their peers can understand language at a higher level of
complexity" (Coelho, 2012, p. 230).

   Teaching the Roman alphabet and its phonemic sounds using
visual mnemonics would increase EAL students' abilities to learn
letter-sound associations in their L2. Coelho (2012) would support
this approach, since she points out that school-wide actions that
would support academic progress for EAL students include
teachers incorporating more visuals into their lessons. Coelho
(2012) writes that, "Using key visuals can reduce the language
demands of the curriculum and enhance understanding, thus
enabling L2Ls to handle new concepts and information" (pp.
280-281). Creating visual notes is also a way that teachers can
provide differentiated instruction for EAL students, something
Garnett (2012) argues is needed because there is so much variation
between EAL students' socio-economical, cultural, and linguistic
backgrounds.

 Visual Notetaking Supports Learning Academic Vocabulary

Coelho (2012) points out that there is a "strong correlation" (p. 307)
between students' vocabularies and their academic achievements.
While some classroom teachers argue that "`Teaching English is the
job of the EAL specialist'" (Helmer & Eddy, 2012, p. 8), Helmer and
Eddy (2012) refute this, explaining, "Because research in second-
language acquisition clearly indicates that it takes five or more
years to become fluent and proficient in a second language,
responsibility for meeting the educational needs of these learners
must realistically extend to all the teachers our EAL learners
92  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

encounter" (p. 8). Coelho (2012) explains that the English language
is extra complex due to the fact that in addition to its Anglo-Saxon
words, it contains words from other languages, such as Latin and
Greek. Coelho (2012) defines low-frequency vocabulary that is
essential to academic success as "General academic words" (p. 314)
and notes that these tend to be "Latin-based words such as observe
or accurate" (p. 314). Roessingh (2016) explains that, "As language
becomes more cognitively demanding and context reduced,
learners must avail themselves of language itself to make meaning"
(p. 69), something that is difficult for EAL learners to do in their L2,
especially if they don't have a high Cognitive Academic Language
Proficiency (CALP). It is essential that EAL learners are explicitly
taught academic vocabulary since "It is impossible to get an
education without knowing these words" (Coelho, 2012, p. 314) and
"it is difficult to learn [academic vocabulary] from mere exposure
through reading alone" (Roessingh, 2016, p. 71).

   One way to support EAL students' academic vocabulary learning
is to have students create visual notes for these words. It is
imperative that classroom teachers receive professional
development regarding visual notetaking since "The school-level
personnel with the most direct effect on ESL students are teachers"
(Garnett, 2012, p. 17). Pillars (2016) states,

   When students are learning vocabulary for the first time. . . Simple
assessments can occur quickly - even though one student spelled `learn'
as `lean,' the sketch shows comprehension of the meaning of `learn,'
whereas another wrote `lean' and sketched the meaning of `lean'
instead of `learn.' In other words, I could see immediately whether
it was a spelling or semantic error. Both were easy fixes, with the
sketches. (p. 126)

   Visual notetaking allows teachers to better understand if EAL
students comprehend the academic vocabulary that has been
taught in a lesson. If administrators in Saskatchewan school
divisions took Garnett's (2012) advice that "more and better [EAL]
professional development is. . . an important investment" (p. 17),
EAL2019-ESSAY9-GERRARD  93

classroom teachers would be better prepared to support EAL
students' learning in schools.

 Visual Notetaking Supports Memory Performance

Pillars (2016) claims that adding visuals to a piece of information
increases a student's ability to recall it three days later by 65%.
Brown (2014), another visual note-taker, concurs with Pillars,
claiming that a person who doodles is "engaging in deep and
necessary information processing. A doodler is connecting
neurological pathways with previously disconnected pathways" (p.
11). Skeptics may be tempted to dismiss claims about the power
of visual notetaking and may argue that the act of notetaking alone
is responsible for boosting one's cognitive performance. They may
base their argument on Mueller and Oppenheimer's (2014) study
where researchers found that the act of writing longhand notes
helped individuals synthesize and recall information better than
individuals who took notes on their laptop computers. However,
Paivio's dual-code theory, which "suggests that pictures are better
remembered than words because they are represented both
visually and verbally" (Wammes, Maede, & Fernandes, 2016, p.
1754), challenges this notion.

   Curious about Paivio's theory, Wammes et al. (2016) executed
a study to "determine whether drawing provided a measurable
advantage over passive note-taking" (p. 1753), and explained that
data they collected and interpreted from seven different
experiments with numerous participants suggested that there was
a direct correlation between people who drew words and people
who experienced better word retention and "memory
performance" (p. 1752). Wammes et al. (2016) described this as the
"drawing effect" and argued that, "the mechanism driving the effect
is that engaging in drawing promotes the seamless integration of
many types of memory codes (elaboration, visual imagery, motor
action, and picture memory) into one cohesive memory trace, and
94  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

it is this that facilitates later retrieval of the studied words" (p.
1773).

   Visual notetaking does not just help with vocabulary retention; it
can help students process short stories, essays, and other course
content. A study conducted by Weimar and Perry (n.d.) found that
students who both wrote notes while Perry read a short story
and created visual notes immediately following the reading did 7%
better on a ten question quiz the following week than students
who only made written notes. This study reinforces the notion
that visual notetaking is coded in multiple ways; drawing is not just
creative as it increases one's memory performance.

 Visual Notetaking is Culturally Responsive

Effective education for EAL learners must be culturally responsive
and extend beyond direct L2 language instruction since many EAL
learners often experience societal marginalization due to both their
low socioeconomic status (SES) and the fact that many of them
are visible minorities (Cummins & Early, 2015). Cummins and Early
(2015) argue that teaching should aim "to counteract both the
negative consequences of socio-economic variables and the
devaluation of student and community identity experienced by
marginalized social groups" (p. 25). Since teachers are
predominantly from white, middle-class, Euro-Canadian
backgrounds, this means that teachers need to reflect upon the
privilege and power they possess (Ontario Ministry of Education,
2013).

   In the Ontario Ministry of Education's (2013) monograph titled
"Culturally Responsive Pedagogy," it states that teachers who
employ a constructivist approach and offer authentic learning
opportunities to students demonstrate two characteristics of
culturally responsive teachers. Visual notetaking, then, is culturally
responsive because it is constructivist in nature and authentically
allows students to attach their own symbols to represent meaning;
EAL2019-ESSAY9-GERRARD  95

for example, Pillars (2016) writes how "the word `ancient' was
signified by a spider web for one student, an Egyptian pyramid for
another, and a pirate ship for yet another student" (p. 66). These
students' visual notes serve as examples that illustrate "Instruction
[that] connects to students' lives by activating their background
knowledge and stimulating their curiosity and interest. Instruction
affirms students' academic, linguistic, and cultural identities by
enabling them to showcase their literacy accomplishments in both
L1 and L2" (Cummins & Early, 2015, p. 31), thus visual notetaking is
an approach that fits within Cummins and Early's (2015) culturally
responsive literacy engagement framework.

   Application of Visual Notetaking in My Own Practice
   John Dewey (1944), wrote that, "If we teach today, as we taught
yesterday, we rob our children of their tomorrow" (p. 167). Visual
notetaking offers teachers an opportunity to teach differently than
the traditional norm; an avant-garde teaching method that reaps
rewards for more than just EAL students, "visuals are equally useful
for native speakers of the language" (Coelho, 2012, p. 281). Brown
speculates that classism is behind society's valuing of print-based
literacy, saying in an interview that, "Historically, literacy, verbal
and spoken language has been associated with a certain level of
status and economic class" (in Maverick, 2012, para 2). Indeed,
Kerkham and Hutchison (2005) write of how teachers "privilege
written and verbal forms of communication over visual and multi-
modal forms" (p. 117). Rodriguez (in Alexis, 2016) challenges this
ideology, writing that teachers "should be focused on what works
for students, capitalizing on [students'] funds of knowledge and
strengths, such as `drawing', in which [students] conceptualize
literacy, to equip them for the twenty-first century skills" (para 4-5).
As a teacher, I am convinced of the value of visual notetaking, and
am committed to infusing my future lessons with it. As a first step, I
attempted my own original edu-sketch (illustration shown below) to
experiment with how I could use visual notetaking to better explain
figurative language to students, which is language that Roessingh
96  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

(2016) describes as particularly difficult for EAL students to
interpret.

        Figurative language visual note (Gerrard, 2017)

Conclusion
   Visual notetaking is a powerful way that teachers can support

EAL students in their classrooms while simultaneously enriching
their courses for all students. As both an L2 learner and a teacher
of L2 students, I believe if teachers use this method, it will correlate
with their students experiencing enhanced memory performance.
EAL2019-ESSAY9-GERRARD                                             97

It will lead to EAL students developing stronger academic
vocabularies and gaining better overall fluency in their L2 than they
would otherwise experience. At the very least, visuals enhance
communication between students and teachers and visual
notetaking offers a creative medium that helps facilitate more
engaging lessons. Visual notetaking is constructive and supports
authentic student learning opportunities, which means that it
demonstrates characteristics of a culturally responsive approach.
With so much to gain and so little to lose, it is time to spread the
word about the power of visual notetaking so that teachers can use
it to support EAL student learning in their classes.

10 - The Importance of
Meaningful and Consistent
Assessment Practices

KELLY KOSHINSKY

The word assessment is often intimidating for both students and
teachers. When it comes to school-aged English as an Additional
Language (EAL) learners, assessment can be extra challenging as
it encompasses both language and content. Although assessment
can be difficult, it is essential that it start immediately after
newcomer students enter Canada and continues throughout their
entire education. Whether students are in a pull-out, push-in or
co-teaching type of support program, assessment helps guide
teachers to successfully help their students learn English.
Assessment is a crucial component of newcomer EAL learners'
success. Students deserve meaningful and consistent assessment
to help them achieve the ultimate goal of full integration in a
mainstream classroom.

   As a relatively new teacher, with most of my teaching occurring
abroad in South Korea, I have limited experience with consistent
and meaningful assessment practices. Throughout this course I
have gained knowledge about the value of the right kind of
assessment for both teachers and the students. Through readings,

                                                              102
EAL2019-ESSAY10-KOSHINSKY  103

module content, and EAL classroom observation, I have learned
about effective assessment practices for immigrant and refugee
students and I am motivated to continue learning about how
assessment is used to benefit newcomers in our province.

   Assessment begins as soon as both immigrant and refugees
enter into Canada and before they are placed in any type of EAL
program. In Saskatchewan, protocol requires students to complete
the important first step of Initial Assessment at a Newcomers
Student Centre (or other assessment site). "The procedure should
include an interview followed by assessment tasks" (Coehlo, 2012,
p.22). Anderson and Tilbury (2014) explain, "By reviewing a
student's academic background and administering assessments in
the four skill areas of reading, writing, speaking, and listening,
baseline data can be recorded and an appropriate educational
program for each EAL student can be developed" (p.89). Initial
assessment allows professionals to gather information on
students' L1 and L2 skills, as well as their cultural backgrounds and
values. The information gathered is used to find the best fit for
the student to meet their language needs and position them into
a program where they can be successful. Anderson and Tilbury
(2014) further explain that the data acquired during initial
assessment can be used in the long term to track students'
language learning over time). It is important that initial assessment
is part of families' reception into a new country and new school
system.

   As mentioned above, initial assessment serves a key role in
immigrant and refugee students' intake into a new system. It is
vital that initial assessment and all following assessments hold both
validity and reliability. Coelho (2012) explains, "In order to ensure
that students are progressing steadily and sufficiently towards the
high levels of literacy that are required for success in school and
beyond, teachers, and others involved in the education of L2Ls
need some means of assessing and tracking progress over time" (p.
84). In order to ensure the level of validity and reliability required,
104  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

"the ministry introduced the Common Framework of Reference,
a provincial language reference scale for charting language
proficiency. The CFR presents a reputable reliable and objective
scale for monitoring and recognizing formal and informal language
learning experiences" (Prokopchuk, 2014, p. 84). "The CFR consists
of six levels between absolute beginner and a highly proficient user
of the language whose performance is virtually indistinguishable
from that of an extremely competent native speaker" (Coelho,
2012, p.86). In the CFR all six levels are explained for the four
language skill areas of reading, writing, listening, and speaking.
Each level provides an explanation of language abilities at that
level. It is a well-known assessment too throughout Europe and
North America that helps teachers track students' language
competence.

   As ELLs progress in their language skills it is important for their
teacher to continually assess their growth and movement from
conversational language to academic language. Roessingh (2016)
uses Beck, McKeown, and Kucan's (2013) three-tiered model for
understanding communicative and academic language. They
explain Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills (BICS) and
Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency (CALP) in terms of three
tiers: Tier 1 as conversational words; Tier 2 as high utility/general
academic words; and finally Tier 3 as subject specific words. As
students move closer into Tier 3 it is important that teachers
continue to assess students' progress by continuing to refer to the
CFR and their levels.

   In Saskatchewan, once students have reached an adequate level
of academic language, they will begin to be assessed alongside
their peers. Anderson and Tilbury (2014) state, "The goal of English
as an additional language program at both elementary and
secondary levels is to improve students' cultural and linguistic
competency so that they can be successfully integrated into
mainstream classrooms (p. 89). As students work towards fluency
and the goal of integration, "teachers working with English
EAL2019-ESSAY10-KOSHINSKY  105

Language Learners have to consider both language and content"
(Gottlieb, 2006, p.64). Therefore, they need to develop both
language and content objectives that line up with Saskatchewan
standards in the form of curriculum outcomes. Objectives for both
language and content need to be measureable to accurately track
student knowledge and skills (Acevedo, 2014). Teachers must
complete both formative assessment and summative assessment
and use it as wash-back into further teachings. Once students have
reached this level of competence it can be common for them to
participate in large-scale assessments in a standard classroom.

   Although many students will achieve the goal of integration and
participate with their peers in learning and assessment for all
subject areas, there will be challenges when it comes to
assessment of ELLs; alternative assessments may be required for
EAL learners. The Colorin Colorado website explains that
alternative assessments allow teachers to track the ongoing
progress of their students regularly and often and it also allows
teachers to target specific target areas, adapt instruction, and
intervene when needed. This eliminates the problem of
standardized tests not accurately showing students' abilities or
knowledge. Colorin Colorado suggests portfolio assessments and
performance-based assessments and the website provides
different examples of assessment to try with EAL learners. Hill
(2016) also provides educators with information on alternative
assessments for EAL students,including the importance of using
tiered questions and tasks.

   It is undeniable that assessment plays a key role in teaching both
in standard classrooms as well as EAL support programs. After
teaching abroad for two years, I fell in love with teaching English as
an Additional Language and I knew it was a teaching path I wanted
to continue on upon returning to Saskatchewan. When I came
home I soon realized the difference in standards and protocol
between South Korea and Saskatchewan. A key difference is the
area of assessment. The information I have gathered from this
106  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

course through the module material, readings, interactions with
English Language Teachers (ELTs), and observation of EAL students
has given me a firm understanding of the importance of consistent,
constant, and purposeful assessment.

   Initial assessment requirements, CFR standards, language and
content objectives, tiered academic language, assessment
adaptations for EAL students, are all valuable sets of information
for ELTs and classrooms teachers. Knowledge about each topic
should impact the steps teachers take to ensure ELLs receive the
support they need to be successful in learning English. As I move
forward in my teaching career, I hope to use what I have read
and heard throughout this course in practical ways. First I will have
students go through the initial assessment process so they are
placed in a support program that best fits their needs. Secondly,
I will refer to the CFR when teaching and assessing students'
language skills in all four areas. Third, I will continually monitor and
assess students with both formative and summative assessments
using measureable language and content objectives that meet
Saskatchewan curriculum standards. Finally, I will make any
adaptations necessary to assess students' abilities and help them
reach their academic goals. Although assessment is viewed
negatively at times, the use of consistent and meaningful
assessment can help both teachers and students successfully
navigate the learning of English as an Additional Language.

11 - Support and Resources for
EAL Students and Teachers

EDDY PASLOWSKI

English as Additional Language (EAL) students and their families
take on a tremendous challenge when then enter schools in the
hope of receiving an extremely valuable education in a language
which is new to most newcomer students at the time of entry. Our
job as educators is to help them adapt to a completely different
school culture and then give them the tools to be successful in this
new culture so they have the best chance for success while out in
the rest of society. For us to be able to do this, we must have access
to the best information and resources that are available to ensure
we can do the best job possible in this area. In Saskatchewan, our
education system has had to quickly adapt to a quite dramatic
increase in EAL students from a variety of backgrounds and
circumstances. Rising to the challenge, our system has developed
a strong protocol for these students, and in the following pages
evidence will be presented to support the strength and success of
our programs.

   The reason for choosing this area to expand upon is that, as a
middle-aged soon to be new educator, I have seen the evolution
of our society and our education systems. Memories of the way
education was delivered when I was younger, in the direct

                                                              108
EAL2019-ESSAY11-PASLOWSKI  109

instruction, one-fits-all style, would not work at all with the diversity
of cultures and learning styles that are in nearly every classroom
today. This realization, coupled with the fact that my wife has
taught for nearly 15 years, has shown me that extra resources will
be an absolute must for me, no matter where or what I teach.

   The first sections of this paper will explore some of the resources
provided by the Government of Saskatchewan and the
Saskatchewan Teachers Federation. Later sections will look
specifically at resources provided by two urban school divisions in
the province. The final section of the main body of this paper will
discuss literature that we can use to help us prepare, on our own,
for the challenges in this field. At the end of the main body, a final
discussion section will attempt to synthesize all the information
with the thesis, and explain how this information can assist
teachers in their schools.

   Let us begin with what is available on the Government of
Saskatchewan website Information on Pre-K to 12 Education for
Newcomers . Here, EAL students and their families can find easy
to use links for all aspects of starting school in the province such
as who needs to go to school, age requirements, language
interpreters, assessment guidelines, and immigration services. All
are in easy to read documents that will be a tremendous help
to both students and families There is also a link to the "Quick
Reference for Newcomers" which is a PDF, printable four-page
checklist for families to use in relation to education. This just
provides the basics for families to get a good start upon arrival in
our province.

   This website also discusses how funding is provided to school
divisions to assist with both initial and ongoing assessment. There
is also information on which school divisions worked together to
develop assessment kits to be used. These are primarily urban
school divisions, which makes sense, since the vast majority of EAL
students are located in urban centres. This was covered in Module

Point for this section. (ECUR 415, Module 1 pdf, pg. 8) Contact
information is provided on several fronts for anyone having
questions about information provided on the Government of
Saskatchewan site.

   The next resources to be discussed are those provided by the
Saskatchewan Teachers Federation (STF). These resources are
provided solely to teachers and are funded by the teachers. One
of the main ways the STF supports teachers in gaining knowledge
on EAL issues is with the use of Professional Development
opportunities. The STF provides short, one-day, educational
sessions that give educators new instructional and assessment
strategies for use with EAL students. These are provided at a small
cost to teachers (www.stf.sk.ca) and are put on at a variety of
locations around the province. It is important to note that the STF
provides a large number of PD opportunities to its members on a
wide variety of topics, and these are offered year-round. A calendar
of upcoming events, as well as online sign-up, are provided on their
website.

   The STF has a large library that is accessible online as well. This
resource is free of charge and has copies of all matter of literature
and information, relevant to K-12. Upon request, STF librarians will
locate all related literature on the subject requested, and ship them
to your school. Postage-paid stickers will also be sent with your
material for easy return, or you can do this in person as well.

   Next, information will be examined about two specific urban
school divisions, and what resources each provides. The first one
that will be examined is the Saskatoon Public School Division. On
their website, www.spsd.sk.ca, they provide information on an EAL
flyer. There is contact information for what they term as their
"Newcomer Student Centre" as well as a brief overview of the
benefits, skills and types of support available through this division.
This is also where EAL families get a brief look at the common
framework used to categorize EAL students, which is based on
the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages or
EAL2019-ESSAY11-PASLOWSKI  111

CEFR referenced by Coelho (2012). The information on this site is
brief, but it is a good beginning point for new EAL families.

   The second urban school division to explore is the Regina Public
School system. On their website, www.rbe.sk.ca , there are links
to a wide variety of documents related EAL students and families.
They start out with links to their EAL Flyer and the Regina
Newcomer Welcome Centre to give families a good starting point
and then move into a link to a 4-part video presentation called
"Supporting Refugees in Schools". There is also a link to the
"Immigration Presentation" that is provided by the Ministry of
Education. The next section on this site has many documents with
information on initial assessment, program recommendations, and
progress reporting for EAL learners. Here again we see information
on the Common Framework of Reference (CFR) and how it would
be used. This site gets far more in depth than most and families
of EAL learners would need a higher level of comprehension of
the English language or probably assistance to ensure a proper
understanding of all the information.

   Literature is a resource that is accessible for all of us to improve
our instruction and assessment of all students, not just EAL
learners. In this course, we were provided with two examples of
great texts that will help us in our careers: Elizabeth Coelho's
Language and Learning in Multilingual Classrooms, A Practical
Approach (2012), and Look at Me When I Talk to You (2012) by Sylvia
Helmer and Catherine Eddy. The Helmer and Eddy text gives us
information on the cultural and personal side that EAL learners
and teachers must navigate. There are many aspects of culture
that I had not considered prior to reading this book, such as cross-
cultural values and non-verbal communication.

   Coelho's (2012) text, as demonstrated by the title, is a very
practical text with examples of assessment and learning strategies.
Examples of actual teaching strategies such as scaffolding, cloze
sentences, charts, and guided projects are given in great detail. This
text even breaks down strategies for individual subjects to help
112                NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

us understand how they would work for students. Implementation
ideas are discussed and assessment strategies are also explored in
detail.

   In conclusion, it is my belief that the need for EAL assistance
will only continue to grow, as our world continues to be more
accessible for all. Canada continues to be a wonderful safe haven
for families trying to ensure the best for their children and
hopefully this does not change. For those of us going into the
field of education, the challenges of successfully assisting these
students may seem overwhelming at times, but with use help of
the resources discussed earlier as well as the support of staff and
administration in our schools, we can be successful. If there is one
thing I learned in this course, it is that communication between all
groups involved, (parents, students, staff, and administration) is the
key. Even with tougher financial times in the field of education, with
a little creativity and hard work, educators can still offer the very
best for all their students.

Saskatchewan Schools: The Role
of Settlement Workers

VICTORIA OLDERSHAW

Introduction
   Saskatchewan welcomes thousands of immigrants to the

province every year. In 2014 these immigrants increased the
province's population growth by 76%, with the addition of 11,826
newcomers (Ministry of the Economy Government of
Saskatchewan, 2014). Although the majority of immigrants entering
Saskatchewan settle in large urban centers such as Regina and
Saskatoon, the Government of Saskatchewan reported that "from
2012 to 2014, 292 Saskatchewan communities saw the arrival of
immigrants who were migrating from 158 different countries"
(Ministry of the Economy Government of Saskatchewan, 2014, p. 5).

   Newcomers seek to contribute positively to their new
communities, but there are challenges immigrants face regarding
settlement and integration. As immigrant populations continue to
grow in the province, there is a need for settlement and integration
programs that target school-aged newcomers attending schools
in Saskatchewan, especially in smaller urban centers and rural
communities. A collaborative approach is recommended - one

                                                              117
118  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

that links settlement service providers, Settlement Workers in
Schools (SWIS), and communities across the province - in order to
help newcomer families with children to navigate and succeed in a
new culture and education system.

   Rationale for Social Inclusion and Integration of Newcomers
   Omidvar & Richmond stressed that "social inclusion" is an
important part of the settlement and integration process for new
immigrants, describing the need to "dismantle barriers" and "risks"
by focusing on "basic notions of belonging, acceptance, and
recognition (2003, p. 1). Successful social inclusion of newcomers
to a country "would be represented by the realization of full and
equal participation in the economic, social, cultural and political
dimensions of life in their new country" (Omidvar & Richmond,
2003, p. 1). Settlement services within Saskatchewan communities
aid immigrants in the social inclusion process; "the provision of
these services is essential both to ensuring the effective settlement
of newcomers and maintaining public support for the continuing
high levels of immigration" (Omidvar & Richmond, 2003, p. 7). The
Government of Saskatchewan funds eleven Newcomer Gateways
located in urban centers with varying populations. These Service
Providing Organizations (SPOs) offer settlement and integration
services to newcomers across the province. These SPOs offer
services relating to housing, employment, education, health,
transportation, budgeting and finance, and social supports such as
connecting newcomers with community groups that share ethno-
cultural background, faith, language, or interests.
   Settlement Needs and Integration of School-Aged Children
   Many immigrants settling in communities all over the province
include families with school-aged children. For many immigrant
families, "the challenges of resettlement may appear
overwhelming. These challenges may include the language,
cultural differences and conflicts, economic difficulties, problems
in finding suitable work, or in the case of children, feelings of
loneliness and difficulties associated with school" (Coelho, 2012, p.
EAL2019-ESSAY12-OLDERSHAW  119

11). In 2009 the majority of the 2,424 immigrant children and youth
(age 19 and younger) who immigrated to Saskatchewan "require[d]
support to learn an official language. Almost two thirds, or 1,566
children and youth, had no knowledge of either official language
of Canada upon their arrival" (Saskatchewan Ministry of Education,
2010, p. 14). A lack of knowledge of the official languages used in
Saskatchewan schools can pose a challenge for newcomer children
and youth, but "it is important to remember that students from
around the world bring with them complete communication
systems, individual differences, and rich cultural backgrounds"
(Helmer & Eddy, 2012, p. 15). As such, there is a continued need
for supportive settlement and integration programs that help
immigrant youth navigate a new culture and education system,
while respecting the dignity of each individual.

   As noted by Coelho, immigrating to a new country is a "life-
changing experience" (2012, p. 8). Immigrant families and their
"children who end up in classrooms in North America...have lived
through a period of transition that may have been very difficult,
and now they face new challenges as they adjust to their new
environment" (Coelho, 2012, p. 8). Helmer & Eddy stressed that
there may be "enormous differences among school systems" (2012,
p. 59) that families have emigrated from; differences include "the
way they are organized, the way instruction occurs, and the extent
to which they conform with the cultural norms of a given society"
(2012, p. 59). The Saskatchewan Annual Integration Summit
reported that in K-12 education, there are "many challenges
newcomers face within the school system" such as a lack of support
for students with limited formal schooling or students who are
"not familiar with the school structure" (Saskatchewan Annual
Integration Summit Report, 2018, p. 10). Due to the challenges
young immigrants and their families face, "it is important [for
schools] to provide initial and ongoing orientation to the school
system for students and parents, and to be explicit about norms
120  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

and expectations, so that students understand the roles and
relationships in their new school environment" (Coelho, 2012, p. 1).

   For immigrant families with children, registering students in
school is one of the first challenges of settlement. Initial contact
with schools can affect a family's impression and perception of the
new education system. Coelho highlighted how important it is for
schools to "create a good first impression and establish a good
relationship from the start" (2012, p. 19). A good first impression
for families takes "careful planning", involving "all members of the
school community" (Coelho, 2012, p. 19). In an ideal setting,
successful intake for newcomer families includes "a school team
that will coordinate all aspects of newcomer reception, assessment,
and orientation" (Coelho, 2012, p. 22), involving the welcoming of
immigrant families and their children to the school system.

   Settlement/Intake Services for Newcomer Students in Large
Urban Centers vs. Smaller Communities in Saskatchewan

   Successful intake programs "ensure that all families feel
welcomed and their questions regarding the school division and
the school are answered" (Anderson & Tilbury, 2014, p. 90). This
can be an "involved process for families who are new to the country
and for whom English is not the first language" (Anderson & Tilbury,
2014, p. 90). Major urban centers in Saskatchewan have well-
established intake centers for newcomer students enrolling in
school. One of Saskatchewan's largest cities and its school division
has a centralized Newcomer Student Center (NSC) open to all
students who are newcomers to Canada and to the school division,
and who speak a language other than English. A directive of the
NSC is to "provide a welcoming environment where [families] can
learn about [the] school system, about [English as an Additional
Language] programming and about supports for their children, so
that the transition to school will be positive" (Anderson & Tilbury,
2014, p. 90). The NSC is necessary to meet the needs of ever-
increasing enrollment of school-aged newcomers and their families
to the city. By providing a centralized intake process in a
EAL2019-ESSAY12-OLDERSHAW  121

welcoming and supportive atmosphere, immigrant families and
their children have more opportunities for successful social
inclusion in their new communities.

   Even though smaller communities in Saskatchewan welcome
fewer newcomers each year, this does not mean that the need for
settlement and integration services is any less significant. Most
school divisions in the province, particularly those serving smaller
urban centers and rural communities, do not have centralized
intake for new immigrants and English as an Additional Language
(EAL) students. This poses a challenge for many schools and the
staff assigned to welcoming new enrollments of EAL students and
newcomers to Canada. In some cases, enrollment of immigrant
and EAL newcomers in school is no different than that of all other
students entering the school system. As such, little to no additional
support is provided to immigrant families, when schools do not
have a coordinated system for welcoming newcomers.

   Research conducted at the Rural Development Institute, Brandon
University (2015) focused on the need for expanded settlement
and integration services in western Canada, including those for
families with school-aged children. The study found that "all of the
communities sampled across western Canada identified that all or
most of the services offered in the communities needed to expand
in order to meet the demand" (2015, p. 18). Continued research in
this field focused on Saskatchewan:

Some respondents reiterated that services needed most by this
particular group of newcomers were more readily accessible in the
larger centers with full-fledged settlement service organizations and
key mainstream service organizations than in the smaller communities
that did not have such organizations. (2015, p. 17)

   There is a definite need for additional and expanded settlement
and integration services for newcomer youth and their parents.
Omidvar & Richmond recommended that "recent research and
122  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

program developments suggest that the school system is the
natural location for such programs" (2003, p. 17).

   Settlement Workers in Schools (SWIS)
   Services such as the federally-funded Settlement Workers in
Schools program (SWIS) benefit newcomer students and their
families as they navigate the challenges of settling in a new country
with school-aged children who are entering the education system.
The Saskatchewan SWIS program is described as,
   ...a partnership of the local Boards of Education, Citizenship and
Immigration Canada, and a Service Providing Organization. It is a
school based outreach program designed to help newcomer students
and their families settle in their school and community. ("Saskatchewan
SWIS Coordination", 2018)
   In Saskatchewan, six of the eleven Newcomer Gateways (as
described earlier) located in large urban centres have designated
SWIS workers, who work together with partnered school divisions
in their designated locations.
   SWIS allows for more comprehensive programming and support
for newcomer students and their families; "the first few years in
Canada are particularly difficult for newcomer students and their
families. SWIS connects newly arrived families to services and
resources in the school and community in order to promote
settlement and foster student achievement" ("Saskatchewan SWIS
Coordination", 2018). According to a SWIS worker who currently
works in a Saskatchewan community (see Appendix A for interview
questions):
   SWIS is an entry point for the newly arrived as we work to connect
them to the broad range of services offered by the settlement agency
and other community services, and at school will meet the families
at their arrival at student services, do a tour of the school, find an
interpreter if is needed, ask for information/transcripts related to
previous education, do bus registration and also explain the essential
school information and refer the newcomer to appropriate school staff
as necessary. (personal communication, June 12, 2018)
EAL2019-ESSAY12-OLDERSHAW  123

   From the perspective of an EAL teacher in Saskatchewan (see
Appendix A for interview questions):

   ...the role of the SWIS worker is flexible and is negotiated with the
school/staff they work with...the settlement workers handle all things
connected to settling newcomers and their families - specially related
to school...settlement workers provide a safe space for
students...students may go to them with questions/concerns about life
and school. (EAL Teacher Respondent 1, personal communication, June
12, 2018)

   The SWIS worker interviewed also emphasized the need to
"provide a service that respects the rights and dignity of the
students, without discrimination, understanding that each
student's unique background needs to be taken into consideration"
(personal communication, June 12, 2018).

   Benefits of SWIS Programming for all Stakeholders
   Programs like SWIS benefit school divisions, adding much
needed support to the workload of English as an Additional
Language (EAL) specialists and teachers, particularly with the intake
and integration of immigrant students. In schools without external
support of SPOs, the roles and responsibilities, as noted by the
SWIS worker above, are delegated to the EAL teacher/specialist
(if available), or other school staff. When asked about how the
implementation of a SWIS worker benefits the professional
workload of EAL teachers, EAL Teacher Respondent 1 replied as
follows:
   There is no question that SWIS has benefited our EAL teaching
staff. If the EAL teacher has a full-time teaching schedule and there
are high numbers of newcomers, then it is impossible to fulfill
all the students' needs completely and effectively. It is important
to remember that newcomers may arrive at any time during the
year and may show up at a school any time of day. Thus, the EAL
teacher cannot set aside a specific day or time at the beginning
of a semester to help with registration, orientation for families
and do language assessments. It can be stressful and `hurried' to
124  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

be called out of class to help a new student when they show up
mid-semester. As a result, there is undue pressure on the teacher
and the newcomer does not receive the support they require.
SWIS workers also provide a `missing piece' or valuable information
about students that the teacher might not know. Because
settlement workers work with families and have `case files' they
might know information, such as whether a student has a hearing
problem. Having a team to work with is critical with the numerous,
ongoing needs newcomers have. (personal communication, June
12, 2018)

   A SWIS worker is an integral team member within a successful
school community that strives to meet the needs of all its students.

   As a member of the school community, a SWIS worker can be
a "role model and mentor who provides a significant amount of
mental and emotional support to newcomer students" (EAL
Teacher Respondent 2, personal communication, June 12, 2018).
When asked about the impact a SWIS worker has had on his/her
professional practice, EAL Teacher Respondent 2 explained that:

   SWIS has relieved the workload of the EAL teachers, within the school,
by providing students with a trusted adult who can support them
with daily `life' activities that newcomers to Canada may have difficulty
with. Instead of teachers spending their day setting up doctor's
appointments, phoning SGI [driver's education], or contacting home
about extracurricular activities happening that weekend, SWIS is
another adult who can help with these responsibilities...this in turn
frees up the teacher to focus on planning lessons that help our students
with language acquisition. (personal communication, June 12, 2018)

   It is important to note that a SWIS worker does not take on any
role related to teaching and instruction, as this is the domain of
the EAL teacher and school staff, but the role is an integral part
of a successful school program. A SWIS worker's partnership with
school staff ensures more comprehensive and ongoing support
for vulnerable newcomer students. EAL Teacher Respondent 2
explained how the SWIS worker affiliated with his/her school is
EAL2019-ESSAY12-OLDERSHAW  125

"connected with each of the student's families, and makes home
visits" (personal communication, June 12, 2018). Respondent 2 also
noted how this provides "additional insight into our students' lives
that can help build empathy when teaching" (personal
communication, June 12, 2018). Collaboration and communication
between SWIS workers and EAL teachers helps build bridges with
newcomers and their families. Helmer & Eddy stressed that "taking
time to find out where EAL learners are on the path of cultural
adjustment and consistently communicating with them enables us
to find areas of commonality" (2012, p. 19). Therefore, ongoing
support and connections between SWIS workers, students and
their families, and teaching staff are advantageous for all
stakeholders in the settlement and integration process. Both EAL
teacher respondents who were interviewed expressed the
essential need for a SWIS worker in their school, in that this not only
benefited students and families, but also EAL teachers and school
staff.

   Continued Need for Settlement Support in Saskatchewan
Communities

   SWIS programming and other settlement services for students
are currently in place in urban centers in Saskatchewan, but the
need extends to many more Saskatchewan communities. A SWIS
worker is non-partisan, affiliated with a SPO, and as such, can
provide services to many schools, including public and Catholic
school divisions, within one community. Often population
numbers of newcomer students are not high enough for
centralized intake, settlement, and integration support. Even
without a centralized intake center, a SWIS worker assigned to an
SPO in a community can support newcomer students and their
families in that community and surrounding areas. As noted
earlier, settlement services, and particularly SWIS workers, provide
the `missing piece' that many school divisions currently need. As a
federally-funded program, more communities in the province need
126  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

to foster community partnerships with SPOs and school divisions
need to take advantage of this service.

   Identifying Needs in My Community
   In my own professional practice, as an EAL Lead Teacher at a
Saskatchewan school of over 900 students and in a division serving
over 5,000 students, there is a very clear need for settlement and
integration services for newcomer youth attending schools in my
community. I began my role as EAL Lead Teacher one year ago,
meaning I take on the role of program planning for all EAL students
in my school. Currently, no centralized intake for newcomers is in
place at the school level nor the division level. Each school in my
division is responsible for aiding newcomer students and families
with registration and integration in the school system. Although
each school does its best to help immigrant families and children
navigate the challenges of attending a new school in a new country,
little professional training or knowledge is provided to staff at the
division level. This is concerning, since levels of immigration in my
community continue to rise.
   I can relate to and empathize with the EAL Teacher Respondents
interviewed, in that the role of an EAL teacher often takes on more
responsibilities than just classroom instruction. Currently I aid in
registration, meeting with families, school orientation, initial and
ongoing language assessment, academic monitoring, and social
and emotional support. Many of these roles are beyond my
professional scope; for example, I have spent hours working with
families who were having difficulties with immigration documents,
something I know very little about, but as many teachers do, I
feel compelled to help families in need. It has been a challenge
balancing my work load, when my primary focus should be within
the domain of language instruction of EAL learners.
   At the division level I have proposed the need for a SWIS worker
in my community, to serve the needs of the many immigrant
students entering and attending school. I am pleased that
administration at my school and superintendents at the division
EAL2019-ESSAY12-OLDERSHAW  127

level also understand this need. My school division plans to work
jointly with our local Newcomer Gateway and another school
division within my community to apply for a federally-funded SWIS
worker. I am confident that a SWIS worker will be in place in my
community in years to come, adding a much needed team member
that will aid in settlement and integration to ensure both social and
academic success of newcomer students in my community.

for Refugee Learners

CHRYSTAL POLANIK

Rationale
   As English as Additional Language (EAL) teachers, "We must work

to create classrooms where there is a discourse of possibility and
hope...where we are much more attentive to using the text of
students' lives in our work" (Helmer & Eddy, 2012, p. 59) The
direction and scope of the discourse in this essay is derived from
personal EAL classroom teaching experiences and my work to
support EAL refugee learners in mainstream math and science
content classrooms. Ideas, approaches, and methods presented
are supported with evidence and research from course content and
readings.

   Refugees are a vulnerable group of English Language Learners
(ELLs) who view education as an important means to obtaining
better employment and life opportunities. Many refugees arrive
with well-established oral communication skills in L1 but are often
frustrated when language becomes a barrier to everyday
communication and academic achievement in English language
school systems. Age-time constraints place further stress and

                                                              129
130  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

anxiety on refugee ELLs. By attempting to bridge the achievement
gap in a shorter time span with accelerated academic language
acquisition, refugee ELL performance is often compromised.

   The educational aim of this paper is to examine how English
Language Teachers (ELTs) can approach instruction to support
refugees in academically challenging learning contexts, specifically
math and science, in order to achieve curricular outcomes that
facilitate refugee academic success and open doors to post
secondary education or employment. Information presented in the
paper will assist ELTs currently working in math and science
teaching contexts to achieve the following: (a) consider the
effectiveness of existing EAL practices, supports, and adaptations;
(b) determine if academic language acquisition is occurring; and
(c) evaluate whether assessment practices appropriately reflect
refugee ELL academic language learning in the content areas of
math and science.

   Essay
   A current issue in English as an Additional Language (EAL)
education today centers around finding an approach to instruction
that facilitates access to academic language and learning for
secondary English Language Learners (ELLs) and yields academic
success. Teenage refugee learners in particular are a vulnerable
group at risk of not completing traditional academic programs due
to interrupted or little to no formal education in their first language
(L1), low or no literacy skills in L1 or English, and very little
knowledge in academic content-areas (Freeman, 2002 as cited in
Helmer & Eddy, 2012, p.76) Typically, teenage refugees receive one
year of intensive EAL instruction within secondary schools, followed
by a gradual integration into mainstream content classrooms with
continued EAL supports. The dilemma facing ELTs today involves
the early integration of refugee ELLs into mainstream classrooms,
well before the minimum five to seven years required to reach
CALP "intermediate fluency," (Helmer & Eddy, 2012, p.74) and how
to approach academic language and learning to bridge the
EAL2019-ESSAY13-POLANIK  131

achievement gap. This essay will illustrate why identification and
explicit instruction of academic language, targeted teaching and
implementation of instructional strategies, and selection of
supports, adaptations, and assessments that facilitate academic
language learning and comprehension are all critical to teenage
refugee learners' academic achievement in the subject areas of
math and science.

   Refugee learners require intensive EAL support in learning
communicative language (Basic Interpersonal Communicative
Skills) and explicit instruction and EAL supports in academic
language (Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency) learning.
"CALP is the language of academia and textbooks (taking) a
minimum of five years to develop an intermediate fluency" (Helmer
& Eddy, 2012 p. 74). The complexity of academic language learning
for refugee learners often occurs in accelerated and cognitively
challenging academic learning contexts. In order to bridge the
achievement gap, the ELT must develop and implement
"approaches and materials that will help them (ELLs) catch up to
and compete with mainstream students" (Helmer & Eddy, 2012,
p.76) within a considerably shorter time frame than initially
predicted.

   Refugee learners repeatedly struggle in the subject areas of math
and science due to the specialized academic language found in
each of these subjects. EAL teachers must identify and analyze
the academic language found in math and science texts that are
problematic for ELLs, break it down into manageable language
components, and explicitly teach these language points for ELL
academic language learning and acquisition to occur. Academic
textbooks use formal language that is not normally encountered in
daily usage. For example, the usage of passive verbs in academic
texts is used to describe processes or focus on results or outcomes
and is problematic for second language learners (L2Ls) still
mastering the active voice (Coelho, 2012, p.242). Linking words and
phrases that aid in organizing ideas is another language point that
132  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

requires explicit teaching, such as: Sequence (e.g. first, next, then),
cause and effect (e.g. because, as a result of), and concession (e.g.
although, in spite of) (Coelho, 2012, p.242).

   Misconceptions around mathematics include that math deals
with numbers and is universal across languages and cultures,
leading to the assumption that L2Ls are able to acquire
mathematical learning relatively quickly and with minimal difficulty.
Current mathematic textbooks are language-comprehension
based. Mathematics has its own unique language, which causes
problems for refugee L2Ls still acquiring basic everyday vocabulary.
Mathematical vocabulary has three categories, all of which are
necessary to understand and do math. Vocabulary sub-groups are:
a) specific technical mathematical terms (e.g. quadrilateral); b)
technical terms with unrelated every day meanings (e.g. volume,
product); and c) math words taken from everyday meanings (e.g.
words like similar and face) (Coelho, 2012, p.242). The ELT now must
explicitly teach vocabulary on three different levels, in addition to
inferring meaning of everyday words that take on new meaning in
a mathematical context. This is very confusing and frustrating for
refugee learners, as another layer of language learning is added,
causing increased anxiety around completing homework and
writing exams.

   Given that math requires problem solving skills, refugee learners
benefit from explicit modeling and scaffolding that demonstrates
how to approach solving math problems. Refugee learners (and
many other ELLs) find it difficult to decode math problems and
decide which information is required and which details are
extraneous. Interchanging numerals and written words of numbers
within the same problem further compound the L2Ls confusion.
Refugee learners further struggle with symbols and the everyday
function words and vocabulary that replace these symbols (e.g. +,
plus, sum, and) (Jarrett, 1999). Depending on the country, some
symbols may represent different functions or meaning, further
complicating comprehension (Jarrett, 1999).
EAL2019-ESSAY13-POLANIK  133

   Science presents its own unique academic challenges. ELTs must
first identify the key topics and terms, and then make decisions
about the approaches to be used to help refugee learners access
the academic language within this content area. For example,
challenges in science language may include "use of abstract nouns
for processes (condensation), passive verbs, and condensed
expressions (organisms in water)" (Coelho, 2012, p.263). Science
also has its own unique vocabulary and use of words that have
similar everyday meaning requiring intensive vocabulary
instruction. In addition, science uses the inquiry and scientific
methods. "Students who are new to the study of science may need
to begin with explicit instruction and progress to more exploratory
learning, gradually developing independent-learning skills" (Jarrett,
1999).Therefore, ELTs need to identify and plan refugee L2L
instruction for the specific ways language is used in math and
science content and curricula (Coelho, 2012, p.263).

   Once problematic academic language elements are identified,
the ELT must then select and implement instructional strategies to
facilitate refugee ELLs' academic language acquisition and learning.
"The processes involved in doing school work are seldom described
explicitly and are usually learned over an extended period."
(Helmer & Eddy, 2012, p. 59). Refugee learners arrive with little or
no experience with consistent regular schooling, and in addition to
learning a new language must also acquire a new way of learning.
When selecting instructional strategies, the ELT must address: a)
identified problematic academic language elements (e.g.
grammatical structures - passive verbs, abstract nouns,
vocabulary); b) reading strategies that facilitate comprehension of
academic language and texts (e.g.) skimming, scanning,
summarizing, main idea); c) book literacy (e.g. textbook features
and how to use them - table of contents, glossary, index, headings,
sub-headings, diagrams, maps, labels, tables, graphs, photos, text
boxes, font features - italics, bold); d) writing and writing strategies
specific to the content area studied (e.g. math and science -
134  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

scientific method, problem solving, how to write a lab experiment,
compare/contrast, describe, analyze, identify, note taking,
annotation) and; e) study skills. These are all skills that native
speaking peers have been developing cumulatively in each grade
level over an extended period of time. However, refugee learners
must acquire these skills in cognitively demanding learning
contexts at an accelerated rate. The learning curve for these skills
and the amount of language required may be overwhelming for
refugee learners, creating anxiety and mental exhaustion. As a
result, a flight or fight response is usually induced resulting in
absenteeism, failure to submit assignments, lack of motivation, and
in some cases dropping out.

   Finally, the ELT must examine and provide EAL supports,
adaptations, and assessments that complement instructional
strategies in accessing the academic language in the content areas
of mathematics and science for refugee learner comprehension
and academic learning. Different approaches and intensive EAL
supports are required to assist refugee learners in meeting
academic success due to the heavy cognitive, language, and
content demands. Some examples of effective supports include:
EAL tutorials, use of Educational Assistants (EAs), graphic
organizers, visuals, technology, manipulatives, physical gestures,
and scaffolding. Scaffolding is a particularly important support in
assisting refugee learners in academic achievement as it models,
guides, and breaks down learning into manageable chunks and
achievable tasks. The "Scaffolding in the Quadrants" chart on page
294 in Chapter 13 of "Planning Instruction and Assessment" by
Elizabeth Coelho (2016) provides an excellent scaffold framework
for ELL differentiated instruction.

   With regard to adaptations, "specialist language teachers need to
collaborate with their colleagues, sharing strategies and resources
that can be used to adapt the curriculum in the mainstream
classroom" (Coelho, 2016, p.293). Adaptations may include: a)
cooperative learning, pair or small group work; b) thematic
EAL2019-ESSAY13-POLANIK  135

instruction around key concepts or big ideas; c) adapting activities
and discussions that center content around authentic real-world
situations and examples that can access ELLs' prior knowledge and
experiences; d) rephrasing problems or ideas in their own words;
and e) incorporating L1 where possible (Coelho, 2016). Kang, Pham,
and Latham conclude, "When students are allowed to use their
home language in the classroom, their academic performance as
well as English-language development often improves" (as cited in
Jarrett, 1999).

   In terms of assessment and evaluation, teachers must carefully
examine their assessment practices and consider adaptations to
assist refugee learners in achieving academic success. Curriculum
outcomes and tasks are designed for native English speakers and
may require adaptation for refugee learners who "have not had
opportunities to develop the same knowledge and skills as their
peers who have been immersed in the curriculum throughout their
years of schooling" (Coelho, 2016, p.295). Coelho states that,
"Adaptations may include revising outcomes, reducing the number
of outcomes, and substituting alternative outcomes that are more
appropriate" (Coelho, 2016, p.295). The important idea is to ensure
that attainable learning is the focus of the assessment. Refugee
learners require alternative assessment strategies to demonstrate
learning, such as: a) reducing the language requirement (giving
oral exams, demonstrate knowledge visually, focus on content and
meaning); b) provide opportunities for practice and feedback; c)
create performance-based tasks; d) portfolio assessment; e)
provide think time and dictionaries; and f) use a team approach
(Coelho, 2016, pp.298-301).

   Academic language learning is complex and not only refugees,
but all L2L students, would greatly benefit from targeted and
explicit instruction, relevant instructional strategies, as well as
supports, adaptations, and assessments in mathematics and
science that purposefully focus on attainable learning outcomes
for refugee ELL academic success. Working collaboratively as a
136  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

team, classroom teachers and EAL specialists can a) diagnose and
specifically target problematic language, content, and curricular
outcomes; b) tailor instructional strategies for refugee ELL
language and academic learning goals; c) provide the appropriate
scaffolding and supports that facilitate academic success; and d)
work towards developing and adapting curricular outcomes that
are attainable and reflective of refugee L2L language needs. In
conclusion, adaptations that incorporate collaborative learning,
inclusion of first languages of refugee learners, and authentic
contexts that draw out refugee learners' schema and experiences,
can facilitate learning and language growth in the content areas.

   In personal praxis, the evidence and research presented in this
paper has relevance to my work as a high school EAL educator. I
will be able to apply my learning to the development of a hybrid
non-credit EAL tutorial class at my school. This EAL tutorial class
is being designed to provide dedicated EAL and content support
simultaneously to immigrant and refugee L2Ls in mathematics and
science. This is the first time that a combined math and science
non-credit EAL tutorial will be offered in this high school. It is also
the first time that an EAL teacher and content classroom teacher
will collaborate and co-teach L2Ls together. The tutorial will be
broken into three peer study groups that rotate between: (a) the
EAL teacher focusing on language components and instructional
strategies; (b) the content teacher working on teaching and
reinforcing concepts and learning outcomes; and (c) an Educational
Assistant providing tutorial support for content learning. Within
this context, the goal is for the EAL specialist and the classroom
teacher to work together to find areas within the course content
that allow for adaptation and incorporation of explicit teaching of
academic language, instructional strategies, supports, adaptations,
and assessment. The classroom teacher currently practices
culturally responsive teaching, has experience working with
immigrant and refugee learners, and already incorporates many
instructional strategies, supports and adaptations into lesson
EAL2019-ESSAY13-POLANIK  137

plans. Some examples of alternative assessment practices already
in use include provision of extra time for assignments and exams,
alternate ways of demonstrating knowledge, visuals, and
portfolios. An area to examine is assignments and summative
assessments for heavy language usage which cause confusion for
L2Ls and not knowing what is being asked or what expectation is
required. The end goal is clear evidence of increased L2L academic
achievement in math and science for refugee learners in high
school.

Language Learners in Canadian
Classrooms

MISTY SCHROEDER

Canada is becoming very diverse as more people choose to start
a new life in the country. While some immigrants arrive by choice,
many refugees come to Canada because their country of origin
is no longer safe. As the school systems in Canada continue to
welcome many refugee learners each year, educators and support
staff must be aware of how to best meet the needs of these
vulnerable new students. Although the practices educators use
may be appropriate for students in mainstream classrooms, or
for those with English as an Additional Language (EAL) needs, the
selection of practices is especially important for learners who may
have limited or no experience with schooling, or those who have
experienced trauma in their lifetime. By analyzing applicable and
relevant Canadian research, I will describe the characteristics of
refugee learners and outline various effective practices that
teachers can use when working with refugee English language
learners in schools and classrooms.

   As described by the Government of Canada, refugees are people
who have fled their countries because of a well-founded fear of

                                                              138
EAL2019-ESSAY14-SCHROEDER  139

persecution. They are not able to return home and may have seen
or experienced many horrors. A refugee is different from an
immigrant. An immigrant is a person who chooses to settle
permanently in another country while refugees are forced to flee
(Government of Canada, 2017). The Calgary Board of Education
(CBE) states that "since 2002, Canada has been among the top
three re-settlement countries in the world for refugees, and the
Government is increasing the number of refugees and other
persons in vulnerable circumstances that this country resettles
each year by 20%" (CBE "Canada's Refugees," n.d., para.1). As more
families enter the country and the Canadian school system,
educators and support staff must have the knowledge and skills
necessary to provide refugee students with the most supportive
and beneficial educational experiences possible.

   When refugee students enter the school system, teachers must
first get to know who their learners are as individuals and what
their life experiences have been. Educators have to be aware that
"many refugee learners come from war-affected countries and they
have often experienced trauma, tragedy, persecution and
prolonged stays in transitional refugee camps. Some have been
forced to serve as soldiers and many have witnessed acts of
violence, torture and crime" (CBE "Characteristics of a Refugee,"
n.d., par. 1). Refugee learners may also arrive in Canada without
their parents. In some circumstances, parents may have died, gone
missing or may have been detained in the country of origin (CBE,
2017). The physical and emotional trauma that students may have
experienced in their lifetime can seem unimaginable to an
educator who is unaware of what many refugee learners have
been through. Education, knowledge, understanding, and empathy
are all necessary for teachers and support staff who work with
refugee learners and their families. We cannot begin the process of
teaching until we genuinely know students and families, what their
experiences have been, and what they need from us at school in
order to feel safe and comfortable in their new environment.
140  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

   A teacher shared a story with me about a young refugee learner
that struggled to focus and often seemed tired at school. After
connecting with the student's parents, this teacher learned that
each night, the child would sleep in the porch, beside the front
door, in order to escape quickly if need be. After many years in a
refugee camp, this child learned that sleep was often interrupted
by noises or experiences that caused the family to flee quickly, and
those feelings of fear and uncertainty carried over as they began
a new life in Canada. This child's lack of focus and drowsiness
could have been dismissed as boredom or lack of comprehension
in English, but the situation was understood by the teacher after
connecting with the family and learning about their past
experiences. This knowledge not only built empathy and
understanding, but also allowed the teacher to provide more
targeted emotional support as well as much needed quiet time for
this student during their time of need. Genuine human connection,
understanding, empathy, and support is a necessary starting point
when refugee students and their families become part of a school
and classroom in Canada. Connecting with students and families
and earning their trust and respect is the first step in creating a
positive school experience.

   Once a teacher has begun the critical stage of relationship-
building with his or her refugee students and their families, he
or she must ensure that the school environment is reflective of
students and student need. Creating a school and classroom
environment in which students feel safe and comfortable is
essential to the well-being and success of all learners, but especially
to that of refugee students. It is important for teachers to
understand that schooling in Canada may be the first educational
experience for many refugee learners: "For a variety of reasons
related to war, environmental disasters, civil unrest, or political
instability, they have attended school sporadically, if at all. They
have minimal schooling in their native language, and low levels
of literacy and numeracy" (CBE, "Students with Limited Formal
EAL2019-ESSAY14-SCHROEDER  141

Schooling," n.d., para. 1). Refugee students may have had disrupted
schooling due to time spent moving between countries, or time
spent in refugee camps or enclaves of displaced people for several
years. Schools may have been closed or unsafe, and children may
have been denied education due to gender, ethnicity, inability to
pay fees, or to being victims of forced labour or forced military
service (CBE, 2017). We cannot expect students with these
experiences to transition quickly or smoothly to a mainstream
classroom. Teachers must ensure that the classroom environment
feels welcoming, safe, and comfortable to our new learners.

   While some refugee students may have received schooling in
their home country, the learning environment would have differed
from the typical Canadian classroom. Expected behaviours in
Canada such as using bathroom facilities, waiting in line or for
one's turn, staying in one place for extended periods, or using
and handling school materials may have to be explicitly taught
and consistently revisited for some refugee learners (CBE, 2017).
It is also important for teachers to be aware of occurrences in
the school environment that may trigger anxiety or behavioural
reactions for refugee students, such as dark hallways, people
dressed in uniforms or heavy boots, elevated noise levels, bells, fire
alarms, lockdowns, or evacuation drills (CBE, 2017).

   Schools often practice for fire drills and lockdowns. It is critical
that all students know why the practices happen and that they
are safe throughout the process. In my EAL classroom, I made it
clear to my learners that schools do the drills and practices to
keep them safe. I reinforced that there was not an emergency and
that they were not in danger. For one of my groups of learners, I
utilized a translation tool because they were not able to understand
English enough to grasp the concepts. By speaking into my phone
and having the tool interpret what I was saying in three different
languages, I was able to ensure that the students understood that
no danger was present and that we were practicing the drills to
make sure that we knew how to be safe in all situations. Teachers
142  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

have to ensure the comprehension of refugee students in these
situations, especially if they have experienced trauma in the past.
Visuals, books, role-plays, and translation tools can assist teachers
in explaining these concepts in detail as a way to avoid triggers
and be sure that students continue to feel safe regardless of the
occurrences taking place in the environment.

   All learners must see themselves within the walls of the school
and the classroom. Cultural representation should be evident and
can be accomplished through displays in community languages,
flags hanging throughout the school or classroom, applicable
student work that is representative of each unique individual, and
artifacts celebrating cultural diversity (Coelho, 2012). Teachers can
also provide reading or other materials in the students' first
languages and learn key words or phrases to help students feel
more comfortable as they transition into their new environment.
Students must feel appreciated, recognized, represented, and
valued at school in order to help them feel safe and free from
stress as they begin their new educational journey.

   Routines and consistency can also help refugee learners to feel
safe in the classroom. When students know what to expect and
are aware of what will happen throughout the school day, they are
more likely to feel safe and at ease. Teachers can create predictable
environments and use routines to assist students to know what
will happen next. Establishing regular and consistent activities and
transitions, and anticipating and preparing students for
unexpected breaks in routines are some ways that teachers can
provide a sense of safety and security within the classroom (CBE,
2017). These steps are important in all classrooms, but are
especially beneficial when working to create an environment in
which vulnerable students can feel at ease during their time at
school.

   As a new student enters the classroom, a teacher may feel like
pairing him or her with a student from the same country of origin
is a logical step. Although this may be beneficial in some
EAL2019-ESSAY14-SCHROEDER  143

circumstances, teachers must be aware that students from the
same country can come from completely different socio-economic,
religious, and political backgrounds and therefore have vastly
different belief systems from one another (Helmer & Eddy, 2012).
In all classrooms, "care must be taken not to make inappropriate
assumptions by disregarding particulars of the students'
backgrounds that may seriously affect this relationship that has
been imposed upon them" (Helmer & Eddy, 2012, p. 36). I
experienced this first hand as our school prepared to host a Flag
Ceremony earlier this fall. We wanted to celebrate the 23 countries
represented at our elementary school, and, to do so, we held a
ceremony in which a student from each country entered the gym
carrying the flag from their country of origin. In preparation for
this ceremony, students learned about their flag and had the
opportunity to draw, color, and display their flags in the classroom
and the school. Five of my early learners as well as nine middle-
years learners came to our school as refugees from Syria, and as
we were learning about flags, it quickly became clear that we were
not appropriately representing our Syrian students.

   Two of my first-grade learners were adamant that the flag I had
presented them with was not their flag, and upon chatting with
our other EAL teacher, I realized that some of her Syrian students
were confused as well. After doing some research on the issue, we
realized that one flag represents the political views of one group
of people in Syria, while a second flag represents another set of
views and beliefs. Once I became educated on the topic, I sent
each student home with a blank template and had them work with
their families to draw the flag that they identified with so that I
had a completely accurate representation of each student. During
the ceremony, we had two students who identified with one flag
carry that during the ceremony, followed by two students carrying
the other flag that represented their beliefs. It was an impactful
learning experience and taught me the importance of genuinely
getting to know students as unique individuals with complex and
144  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

varying views, beliefs, and values. Had we lumped all of the children
from Syria into one category, the results would have been non-
representative, inappropriate, and highly offensive to some
families. As teachers, we must invest time into getting to know
our students and learning about their home countries and
backgrounds as much as possible in order to make their school
experience in Canada comfortable, responsive, authentic,
meaningful, and genuinely representative of their needs.

   Teachers are encouraged to take into consideration three
aspects of refugee learner characteristics and needs when
designing programs for refugee learners: linguistic, academic
background and experience, and learner experiences and personal
characteristics (Manitoba Education, 2012). Beginning with the
linguistic element, it is important to review student ability in both
English and their first language. If a student has had limited
exposure to English, analyzing his or her first language skills will
provide pertinent information regarding how to program
effectively for that student. If a student has had limited experience
with literacy in their first language as well, English language support
will need to be rather intensive and may progress in a slower
fashion (Manitoba Education, 2012). I have worked with students
who have strong literacy skills in their first language, as well as
students who have limited or no first language literacy skills.
Students who can read and write in their language of origin can
often make connections between reading, writing, and speaking
in English and their first language, and seem to progress rather
quickly, even if they are beginners. Students who are unable to
read and write in their first language often need differentiated
activities and intensive support, as they are working to build literacy
skills in general, and the entire process is new and complex.

   Teachers must also consider the academic background and
experiences of their refugee students. Students may or may not
have attended school in their country of origin, and schooling may
have been interrupted for significant periods. Some learners may
EAL2019-ESSAY14-SCHROEDER  145

have consistently attended one school, others may have attended
various schools with multiple languages of instruction, and some
students may have had positive educational experiences similar
to those in Canada (Manitoba Education, 2012). By gathering
information regarding the academic backgrounds of refugee
students, teachers can better plan to transition students
appropriately and develop effective and individualized
programming strategies for each learner.

   Each student comes with a different academic history, and
teachers must utilize the appropriate documents or support
workers to learn as much as possible about each student that joins
the Canadian school system. These supports may include intake
forms, school support workers, outside agencies affiliated with the
school system that work with newcomers, and/or interpreters.
Teachers must also take into account learner experiences and
personal characteristics to help them plan and program effectively.
Learning styles and preferences, potential learning disabilities,
physical characteristics and health, culture shock and socio-
emotional well-being, mental health, and educational and personal
aspirations will all affect how refugee students learn (Manitoba
Education, 2012). Knowing students and being aware of their
individual needs and challenges can help teachers to create
relevant, applicable, and meaningful learning experiences for all.

   Understanding effective classroom practices when working with
refugees is critical to the successful implementation of planning
and programming. Although each school division is different and
will have its own set of policies or strategies for working with EAL
or refugee students, many of the core ideas will remain the same
from division to division. The CBE offers several examples of best
practices, including "age appropriate groupings, self-contained
programs or classrooms offering intensive, accelerated English,
literacy and numeracy instruction for at least the first year or two,
and intensive small group or individual literacy interventions" (CBE
"Programming Ideas," para. 2). Effective transition plans must also
146  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

be developed to ensure that students are able to access
mainstream classes when they are ready. EAL teachers can plan
with and work alongside teachers in mainstream classrooms to
support learners and organize the use of first language educational
assistants or tutors, if possible (CBE, 2017).

   In order to effectively support students holistically, schools and
teachers must also work with refugee families and connect them
with the appropriate supports. Educators must understand that
"many refugee parents or guardians are living under difficult
socioeconomic conditions and experiencing emotional stress. They
have a great deal of concern for their children but may lack the
personal, financial or linguistic resources needed to effectively
support them in the acculturation process or in their academic
work" (CBE "Characteristics of a Refugee," n.d., para. 2). School staff
and affiliated outside agencies can assist parents in understanding
the school system, provide access to services such as tutoring,
mentoring, counselling, home-school liaison, and community
services, connect parents with supports that include family learning
in the area of literacy, help involve families in parent and
community groups, and provide information and access to sports
and art activities for children (CBE, 2017). By supporting the family
unit, teachers are not only meeting the needs of their students,
but also providing parents with information and resources to help
meet the needs of the family as a whole.

   By digging into relevant Canadian research and providing
information on refugee learners with limited schooling and/or
experiences with past trauma, I was able to detail effective
practices that teachers can use when working these students. As
more vulnerable students enter our school systems across the
country, it is increasingly important that teachers have the
knowledge and support in order to best meet the needs of refugee
learners in mainstream and EAL classrooms. Enhancing teacher
knowledge and confidence around best practices will allow schools
EAL2019-ESSAY14-SCHROEDER  147

to provide the most beneficial learning experiences possible for
refugee students.

In the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the
population of newcomers settling in Saskatchewan, many of whom
are learning English as an Additional Language. "Between 2008 and
2012, the number of PreK-12 students in the province requiring
support for EAL grew dramatically following the introduction of the
Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program (SINP) (Prokopchuk,
2014, p.81). "Increasing immigration means that our classrooms
are likely to continue welcoming learners whose countries of origin
are more and more diverse" (Helmer & Eddy, 2012, p.14). Although
working with newcomer populations can be exciting, I have had
first hand experience and know that some newcomers arrive with
various needs and experiences that can put a strain on the
resources that are available in our education system. I selected
this topic based on my experiences as a classroom teacher in a
community school that welcomed over seventy refugee children in
the span of a few weeks. My own experiences encouraged me to
begin researching the topic of trauma and its impact on learning.
This paper will differentiate between immigrants and refugees,
provide a definition of trauma, and describe how educators can

                                                              151

ensure that they are prepared to work with EAL students who have
experienced trauma.

   It is important to examine the difference between immigrants
and refugees when considering newcomers to our country.
Manitoba Education (2012) explains that while immigrants choose
to move and settle in Canada, refugees often do not have a choice.
Coelho (2012) refers to the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to
the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol, which describes
refugees as "persons with a well-founded fear of persecution based
on race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership to
a particular group." Often, refugees are forced to flee from their
home, are displaced for long periods of time and live in refugee
camps. According to The United Nations High Commission on
Refugees, as of six years ago "the number of refugees and persons
of concern worldwide exceeded 19.8 million" (Helmer & Eddy, 2012,
p.13). Helmer & Eddy (2012) explain that this number has increased
dramatically due to violence in the Middle East and Africa and is
currently at an estimated 42 million.

   Trauma is a very individual experience. An event that is traumatic
to one person may not be traumatic to another. According to
Manitoba Education (2012), a person may experience two different
types of traumatic events. Acute traumatic events can include
experiences such as school shootings, gang-related violence,
natural disasters, serious accidents, sudden loss of a loved one, or
physical or sexual assault. Chronic traumatic situations can include
events such as physical or sexual abuse, domestic violence, and
wars or political violence. Whether a person experiences an acute
traumatic event or chronic traumatic situations, both can
"overwhelm a person's capacity to cope" (Souers & Hall, 2016, p.
15). According to Souers & Hall (2016), students experiencing
stress or trauma are using the downstairs area of the brain (limbic
area), which controls arousal, emotion and the fight, flight or freeze
response. Souers & Hall (2016) go on to explain that education and
EAL2019-ESSAY15-CHAMBERS  153

learning requires students to be using the upstairs area of the brain
(prefrontal cortex), which enables them to think and reason.

   In the past decade, "the experience of trauma has dramatically
altered the landscape of the schools we work in" (Souers & Hall,
2016, p. 1). "Immigrants and particularly refugees arrive in Canada
from countries where they may have experienced trauma from
wars, persecution, violence, torture, or other horrendous
experiences" (Wilbur, 2017, p. 5). As educators, we expect our
students to enter our classrooms ready to learn but this is not the
reality. We expect our students to leave their baggage at the door
and focus solely on what we deem important and worthy. "Trauma
has a powerful negative effect on students' readiness to learn,
leading to the "triple whammy" of school troubles in attendance,
behaviour, and coursework" (Souers & Hall, 2016, p. 20). It is plain
and simple: "if our students aren't in the learning mode...they will
not learn" (Souers & Hall, 2016, p. 26). It is up to educators to
help these students by building safe and trusting relationships with
them, challenging our own personal belief systems, providing
adequate positive reinforcement, and caring for ourselves.

   One of the ways that we can support EAL students who have
experienced trauma is by working towards building relationships
with them. "A healthy relationship, in turn, is an instrumental
aspect of feeling safe - and a sense of safety enables students
who have experienced trauma to stay regulated and access the
healthy parts of their brain" (Souers & Hall, 2016, p. 102). Building
a relationship may involve taking an interest in something that
they enjoy, articulating clear classroom expectations, engaging with
their family, or modelling kindness and respect towards them and
others. "We have an incredible opportunity.....to show students
what they are capable of, to expose them to different ways of
being, to teach them healthy ways of managing, to empower them
to learn and grow in productive ways, and to love them for both
who they are and for who they may become" (Souers & Hall, 2016,
154  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

p. 140). However, this cannot be achieved without first establishing
a relationship with students.

   Another way that we can support EAL students who have
experienced trauma is by examining our personal belief systems.
"The way we see our students - through a strength-focused lens or
in a deficit-based model - shapes our beliefs and our expectations
follow suit" (Souers & Hall, 2016, p.146). If we believe that certain
students are only capable of being disruptive or uninterested, we
will base our decisions and our efforts on those beliefs. Positive
mindsets and belief systems about our students can help us be
more patient, willing to help them or try new strategies that we
have not attempted yet. Positive mindsets encourage us to think
outside of the box for struggling students who might need us to go
the extra mile for them. We must always remember that our EAL
students who have experienced trauma are simply young people
who are trying to make sense of the world and figure out how to
get their needs met.

   In addition to building relationships and examining our personal
belief system, we must ensure that we are providing adequate
positive feedback to our EAL students who have experienced
trauma. Most people "rely on external feedback to confirm that we
did something well, that we're worthy of love, that our appearance
is up to par, or that something we've done is valued" (Souers &
Hall, 2016, p.183). Compliments and praise feel good and we all
appreciate this in our lives. "Students who have experienced
trauma have a significantly compromised capacity to self-
acknowledge--that is, to recognize and validate themselves, their
feelings, or their efforts" (Souers & Hall, 2016, p.184). "Younger
children (8 and 9-year-olds) respond much more favorably to praise
and, in fact, do not access certain regions of their brains after
receiving negative feedback" (Souers & Hall, 2016, p.185).

   One of the most important things that educators can do in order
to support EAL students who have experienced trauma is to take
a step back and focus on our own self-awareness. "If we aren't
EAL2019-ESSAY15-CHAMBERS  155

physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually healthy, we cannot
reasonably expect to be able to help our students become
healthier and more successful in school" (Souers & Hall, 2016, p.
40). Souers & Hall (2016) explain the importance of focusing on our
health, love, competence and gratitude. Exercising for 40 minutes
at least three times a week will do wonders to regulate and manage
our stress levels. We need to take time each week to treat
ourselves, whether it is with a bubble bath, reading a book, or a
social outing. We must challenge ourselves and step out of our
comfort zone by trying new things and overcoming our fears.
Lastly, we must be thankful and express our gratitude for the little
things in our lives. It is critical that we are also able to identify
our own triggers, recognize when we are exhausted or emotional,
and when we are thinking with our "downstairs" brain. Our ability
to recognize these and regulate ourselves by providing self-care
is critical for our jobs and interactions with students and their
families.

   "Although it's not all about us, creating a trauma-sensitive
learning environment begins with us" (Souers & Hall, 2016, p.146).
If we do not take care of ourselves, it is just a matter of time before
our health is affected. Burnout refers to "when the individual feels
that they have too many demands, not enough support, and lack
resources" (Manitoba Education, 2012, p.55). Individuals suffering
from burnout may begin to feel powerless and/or overwhelmed.
Compassion fatigue is a condition of "deep physical and emotional
exhaustion that leaves the individual feeling drained and having
nothing to give to others" (Manitoba Education, 2012, p. 55).
Vicarious traumatisation is the "result of the cumulative effect of
contact and interaction with survivors of violence, war, and
disasters" (Manitoba Education, 2012, p. 55). Educators working
and supporting EAL students who have experienced trauma must
be aware of these conditions, the importance of self-care and the
risks associated with not putting ourselves first.

   "As educators, we have an obligation to truly understand how
156  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

students learn and what may be affecting their capacity to learn"
(Souers & Hall, 2016, p.117). Although I initially started researching
EAL students affected by trauma, I quickly learned that trauma
does not discriminate and it affects each one of us differently.
I have also realized that in order for learning to occur in my
classroom, I must create a trauma-sensitive classroom by building
relationships with all of my students (EAL and non-EAL), provide
a safe and caring environment, encourage them and believe that
they are capable of becoming resilient young adults. Most
importantly, I must take care of myself if I want to continue to be
a positive and healthy role model for any of my students who have
experienced trauma.

16 - Distinguishing Between a
Language Acquisition Problem
and Learning Challenges in ELL
Students

MICHELE HUDSON

Rationale
   Working in the high school setting in a resource position, I often

collaborate with teachers of students who are English Language
Learners (ELLs) regarding placement and best programming
options for some of their students. Distinguishing between a
language acquisition difficulty and a possible learning difficulty/
disability is very challenging, particularly when the student is a
refugee with little or no education in their first language. This is
perhaps one of the most difficult aspects of my job. Becoming more
informed on best practices will enhance my ability to be effective
and culturally responsive in my role.

   Introduction
   English Language Learners (ELL's) come to us with a great range
of cultural, linguistic, socio-economic and educational
backgrounds. Some may be new immigrants by choice, others from
refugee situations. Regardless of `why', all students will have a

                                                              158
EAL2019-ESSAY16-HUDSON  159

challenging road ahead of them in acquiring English as an
additional language. "Cummins states `English language learners
typically require at least five years to catch up to their English
speaking peers in literacy related language skills'" (Coehlo, 2012, p.
313). "Those with limited prior schooling will need more support
for a longer period of time" (Coehlo, 2012, p. 314). As well, "it is
reasonable to think that most cultural groups throughout the world
probably have the same percentage of children with more complex
learning needs as those statistically found in North American
populations"(Helmer & Eddy, 2012, p. 81). Because of the
similarities in characteristics of learning disabilities and language
acquisition problems, it has been common to find ELLs
overrepresented in special education for language acquisition
issues and for ELL students with a learning disability (LD) to go
undiagnosed. Klingner suggests using an "ecological framework"
that "considers both contextual and intrinsic factors that can affect
a student's performance" (Klingner, NYC document, p. 7) to
determine whether an ELL has a LD.

   In order to effectively distinguish between language acquisition
difficulties and learning challenges there needs to be a team-based
process requiring extensive analysis of student opportunities to
learn in the classroom and response interventions, consideration
of background data and factors, and the use of appropriate formal
and informal assessments over time to monitor student progress.

   Opportunities to Learn and Response to Intervention (RTI)
   "We cannot distinguish between LD and language acquisition
without making sure that ELLs are receiving adequate
opportunities to learn" (Klingner, 2012). As all EAL students are
diverse in needs and backgrounds, a thorough profile needs to be
established for new students during intake, gathering information
about L1 education, first languages, cultural background, family
circumstances and other specific needs. This "profile can be a
powerful tool for informed decision-making about the kind of EAL
support required within a school and a classroom" (Prokopchuk,
160  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

2017, Module 1). Along with the profiling at intake, whether at a
centralized center or at school, it is important for newcomers to be
directed and set up with other organizations that can support the
student and family. School staff needs to keep in mind the diversity
of EAL students and understand the stages newcomer students go
through. Teachers must also be aware of their cultural beliefs and
values and understand "the underlying values and belief systems
that, translated into action or inaction often lie at the root of
miscommunication" (Helmer & Eddy, 2012, p. 88). Following this,
provision of quality instruction and appropriate assessment in a
culturally responsive classroom occurs. Quality instruction includes
taking into account students' cultural backgrounds, providing
research-based instruction and strategies such as scaffolding,
comprehensible input and contextual supports, and use of
appropriate assessment. Differentiated instruction and use of
sheltered content classrooms as warranted should also be key
components of effective instruction. Teachers must also be aware
of the similar characteristics of LD and language acquisition
difficulties, notably: difficulty following directions; slower
processing speed; poor auditory memory and difficulty
concentrating; being easily frustrated; and confusion with
figurative language. However, there are slight differences to some
of these behaviors when acquiring L2 over an LD.

   ELL students may have difficulties with phonological awareness
distinguishing sounds not in their L1, with sound symbol
correspondence when different from L1 and difficulty pronouncing
these sounds, as well as not remembering sight words when
meanings are not understood (Klingner, 2012). It is also important
to note, "EAL learners can miss the meaning of an entire lesson
if key words in readings and presentations are beyond their level
of proficiency" (Prokopchuk, 2017, Module 10). When students
struggle, the first step is observation of the classroom setting.
Klingner (2012) states that some ELLs are taught in `disabling
EAL2019-ESSAY16-HUDSON  161

contexts,' with too few opportunities to develop their language/
literacy skills.

   The Response to Intervention (RTI) approach is a popular
approach used by many school divisions in Saskatchewan to assess
the quality of instruction. "RTI seeks to ensure that the learning
difficulties are not the result of extrinsic issues in teaching,
instruction, curriculum etc." (Ortiz, 2017). "It is a `three-tiered'
approach that supports student learning by adjusting and
modifying classroom instruction to meet student needs"
(Prokopchuk, 2017, Module 10). Tier 1 is quality instruction and
progress monitoring, while Tier 2 includes small group intervention
support. Students who do not progress enter Tier 3 for intensive
support and further evaluation or possible special education
placement. "There is general agreement among RTI specialists that
about 90% of students remain in Tier 1, while 5% of students
require additional, targeted support in Tier 2, and the remaining
5% require more intensive levels of support in Tier 3" (Prokopchuk,
2017, Module 10). RTI address learning needs and measures the
individual's success. It is a team approach which often includes the
classroom teacher, EAL specialist, consultants and when needed,
and the Special Education teacher. When students continue to
struggle after Tier 1 and Tier 2 supports, further investigation and
evaluations by school team personnel is required.

   Student Background and Assessments
   When a student shows signs of struggle and is not progressing,
there are many possible reasons as to why and, as Klingner (2012)
states, "there is a process of elimination and need to look at many
factors." If a student's true peers are progressing, it is time to collect
student data. "It is important to consider the unique characteristics
ELLs bring to the learning environment and to think about how
factors including their familiarity with and exposure to English,
socioeconomic status, prior schooling experiences, and life
experiences, interact with and influence their learning" (Klingner,
NYC document, p.8). Data collection on student background should
162  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

include information on previous schooling in L1, development in
L1, the student's cultural, linguistic and social systems,
socioeconomic status, evidence of culture shock or trauma, and
supports provided at home for learning the new language.
"Thomas and Collier concluded that the strongest predictor of
academic success is the amount of formal schooling in L1" (Coehlo,
2012, p.139). As well, "ELLs with LD exhibit difficulties in their first
language as well as in English" (Klingner, 2012). Refugee students
require special attention, as "most refugee learners require
support to build basic literacy due to interrupted education or
no formal education. There may be also be psychological, social,
or emotional complications resulting from trauma, persecution,
political upheaval, or war" (Prokopchuk, 2017, Module 10). "When
conducting the assessment, do so with the notion that there is
nothing wrong with the individual and that systemic, ecological,
or environmental factors are the primary reason for learning
problems. Maintain this hypothesis until data suggest otherwise
and all plausible external factors have been ruled out" (Klingner,
NYC document, p. 1). Since there are no tests that can reveal
whether a student has an LD and because formal tests that are
norm based are not appropriate for ELLs, assessment is often
informal. Review errors over time. "EAL learners generally make
consistent errors; learning-disabled leaners generally make
inconsistent ones" (Helmer & Eddy, p. 81). Monitoring progress of
ELLs should be multi dimensional and include multiple assessment
methods.

   Ortiz (2017) identifies the following as appropriate methods of
evaluation: Curriculum Based measurement (CBM), Response to
intervention (RTI with progress monitoring), Criterion referenced
evaluation (class tests, benchmark performance) and Dynamic
assessment (teach-test-teach models). "Authentic Dynamic
Assessment is a particularly useful evaluation approach as it can be
used with classroom materials and academic content. The goal is to
ascertain the degree of instruction required to promote learning.
EAL2019-ESSAY16-HUDSON  163

The less assistance required, the greater the individual's "learning
propensity" (Ortiz, 2017). The focus is on developing a profile of
strengths and weaknesses and areas of need and to set a plan for
intervention. If after quality instruction, intervention, appropriate
assessments and background data have been taken into account
and there is still no progress, further intervention by special
education personnel may be in order to address a learning
challenge.

   Conclusion
   Distinguishing whether an ELL has a language acquisition
problem or an LD is a very complex and difficult task. There are
no easy tests, no quick fixes. If it were easy, there would not be
numerous studies on the topic. Incorporating differentiation and
scaffolding in instruction, using multi-dimensional assessment over
time, and performing interventions as well as considering student
backgrounds, are all examples of best practice. They do not give us
the `answers' but can at least lead us in the right direction.
   I will be more insistent that systematic information gathering
and appropriate classroom-based interventions occur before my
involvement. We have sheltered content classes in our high school,
which are crucial for student success, but we also have many EAL
students integrated into mainstream classes in which the teachers
are still unprepared and lack the knowledge (and time!) to provide
the level of scaffolding and differentiation needed to support the
students. Therefore, this leads me to believe I must ensure that
appropriate classroom supports have been in place long enough
before warranting further assessments from the lens of special
education. Teachers must follow the Adaptive Dimension, whether
for my students with learning challenges or EAL students. A
collaborative, team approach to informal assessment will occur.
And when appropriate, a shared service delivery will be
established.

17 - Disproportionate
Representation of English
Language Learners in Special
Education

CARI PANKEWICH

The landscape of Saskatchewan schools is changing. The Ministry
of Education indicates that in September 2017, 9.2% of
Saskatchewan students in Grades 1-12 were receiving EAL support.
School divisions have noted that even newcomer students who
arrive with some English language skills require EAL support to
reach adequate proficiency levels for school purposes (ECUR 415
Module 1 Slide Presentation). EAL students enter school with
culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds that are different
from their mainstream peers. This diversity can be misunderstood
in the classroom context, resulting in disproportionate placement
numbers in Special Education. This paper aims to provide
information regarding the reasons that EAL leaners are
disproportionately represented in Special Education, how this
placement affects EAL students, and how teachers can move
toward a more balanced view of their EAL students.

   Difference or Disability

                                                              165
166  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

   In the general population, about 12% will have a learning
disability whether they speak one language or several, whether
they speak English or another language. However, the same
percentage of ELLs are not necessarily identified as having a
learning disability and have been both under- and over-identified
(Hamayan, Marler, Sanchez-Lopez, & Damino, 2007). Sullivan (2011)
suggests that understanding the underlying issues regarding the
disproportionate numbers of ELLS in special education requires an
examination of current practices and willingness to explore new
ways of defining educational practices. Disproportionately
classifying ELLs as learning disabled will not aid ELLs, as many of
their struggles are based on language development.

   Traditionally, guidelines for identification of students with special
needs have been designed for a monolingual, mainstream
population. Such guidelines put culturally and linguistically diverse
students at risk for either over-referral or under-referral to special
education (Oritz, 1998). Collier (2004) explains that the differences
that ELLs may display in the classroom can be mistaken for
disability. Teachers need to be aware that although social and
everyday English can develop quite quickly in ELLs, research
suggests that it can take at least five to seven years to develop the
academic and language skills of their monolingual peers (Cummins,
1995, 1997, 2000). Adolescent ELLs may face more challenges in
this respect and struggle with academic subjects due to lack of
adequate academic language skills. Cummins (1995) expresses
concern about Special Education placements, explaining that they
are not a viable option for the amount of time that a student may
need support in mastering the academic aspects of English.

   Teachers' Limited Understanding of Language Learning
   EAL learners bring with them a range of skills and strengths.
What they do not have are strong English skills. "We must make
sure that we remember what they do have, and not always focus
on their weaknesses, namely a lack of English" (Helmer and Eddy,
p. 71).
EAL2019-ESSAY17-PANKEWICH  167

   Confronted with a struggling English language learner, many
classroom teachers can be confused by the student's lack of
academic progress. Often the teachers faced with this situation
turn to special education for assistance because they are unsure
of how to adapt their English language curriculum to meet the
student's needs. They are also uncertain about how to determine
whether EAL students are experiencing problems due to learning
disabilities or due to their limited English language proficiency.
They may believe their only recourse is to refer the student for
an assessment and special education placement. Therefore,
placements are not due to developmental delays but the inability
to follow the regular streamed program due to language barriers.

   According to Collier (2004) and Cummins (1995, 1997, 2000),
there are many stages of acculturation when a child is learning
new academic language and is in a new setting. Not behaving and
not attending to the task at hand is typical for a beginner ELL. In
some cases, students may not speak at all for the first year. Each
ELL reacts differently when starting school, but these behaviors
are usually due to limited English proficiency. As students become
acculturated, they understand more in the classroom.

   Assessment
   Due to the language and cultural differences, the reliability and
validity of standardized tests may be affected. As a result of these
differences, many ELLs may be inappropriately identified as having
a disability. Assessments used in schools should be accessible and
free of cultural and linguistic biases. However, these assessments
are designed for English-speaking mainstream students, and are
often beyond the academic reach of English language learners
(Cummins 1995, 2000). The use of standardized tests does not
adequately demonstrate an English language learner's cognitive
ability, therefore the sole use of these tests to make placement and
educational decisions is ineffective and inappropriate. As Klingner
and Harry (2006) posit, schools should not rely only on
standardized test scores, but should perform other alternative
168  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

assessments to obtain the overall picture of the English language
learner's abilities.

   According to Ortiz et al. (2011), in order to make special
education referral decisions, educators must first collect baseline
data that demonstrates English language learners' language and
literacy skills and tracks their progress in over time. Teachers must
also systematically assess and track English language learners'
reading skills and development in areas such as phonemic
awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension.
Through monitoring progress in these areas, teachers can
determine if English language learners have not made expected
progress using culturally and linguistically responsive
interventions, which may then lead to a consideration for special
education (Ortiz & Yates, 2001).

   Cultural Factors
   Much research has been conducted regarding cultural and
socio-economic factors as contributing to the disproportionate
representation of minority students in special education programs
(Degato-Gaitan,1990; Delpit,1995; Gee,1996; Heath,1983; Moll,
Amanti, Neff, & Gonzalez,1992; and Moll & Greenburg,1990). This
research has demonstrated that when students and teachers are
knowledgeable about each other's culture, learning is enhanced.
Moll, Amanti, Neff, & Gonzalez (1992) observed that cultural
practices shape thinking processes; therefore, in order to enable
students to develop higher order thinking, students' cultural
background should be incorporated in school learning.
   Research on minority family literacy practices (Delgato-Gaitan,
1990; Heath, 1983; Li, 2006) found that literacy practices of the
culturally diverse are often very different from the mainstream,
in terms of beliefs and practices about instruction and parental
involvement, which may conflict with mainstream teaching models.
North American models of teaching and learning tend to be
teacher-centered and may disregard the autonomy of immigrant
students and families with regard to what they are able to
EAL2019-ESSAY17-PANKEWICH  169

contribute to the school and learning. In reality, these families have
vast knowledge bases from their homes and communities (Moll,
2004; Moll, Amanti, & Gonzalez, 1992; Moll & Greenburg, 1990)

   Mainstream parents do not necessarily have more interest in
their child's education, but have better resources to mediate the
school system to help their children. These resources may include
education, income, status, and social network. Despite the inequity
of resources, schools tend to ask for very similar types of behavior,
although resources are not equally available (Lareau, 2000, p. 8).
Education is most often grounded in mainstream culture; teachers
often filter curriculum through their own mainstream cultural
backgrounds and teach the way they were taught. The primary
discourse of students from mainstream backgrounds is often
similar to that of the school, as their mother language (English) is
used by the teacher in instruction.

   Effects of misrepresentation
   The overrepresentation of ELLs in special education is complex,
with a variety of factors contributing to the dilemma.
Disproportionality refers to "the extent to which membership in
a given group affects the probability of being placed in a specific
disability category" (Oswald, Coutinho, Best, & Singh, 1999, p. 198).
According to the American Psychological Association Individuals
with Disabilities Act (IDEA), a child is not eligible for special education
services if the determining factor is due to limited English
proficiency. Consequently, if a student is inappropriately placed in
special education, it could result in underachievement. Hence, if
steps are not taken to properly regulate how referrals are made,
there will be serious consequences. If the ELLs needs are not those
best suited to special education, the remediation is futile. This
situation is partly because the student might not suffer from a
real cognitive processing problem, and as such, the placement will
not be able to solve the problem if the issue is due to cultural
differences between the child and the school (Ortiz, 1991).
Moreover, research suggests that labelling also leads to
170  NADIA PROKOPCHUK, COLLECTION EDITOR

stigmatization, segregation and low self-esteem (Oriz, et al., 2011).
The misplacement often predisposes students to other risk factors
like learned helplessness, low academic performance, disruptive
behaviour, and drop-out, which reinforces the designation. The
more compelling reason for determining proper placement for
ELLs is that we must ensure the most effective learning
environment for these students. If a student is having difficulties
in school because of second language issues, the best support for
that student would come from expanding proficiency in English as
a second language, and not from special education interventions
(Damico & Hamayan, 1992).

   Moving Forward
   In summary, this paper aimed to examine why there is a
disproportionate number of ELLs that are being referred to Special
Education programs. The influx of immigrants to our province
means that there must be timely education on the parts of
educators to understand the factors which affect language
learning. We know that the acculturation process can mimic certain
academic delays, therefore, students must be allowed time to learn
language. Disproportionate number of referrals can be due to
misunderstanding of difference or disability, lack of understanding
about the needs of EAL students, skewed assessment practices,
and cultural mismatches. The effects of misrepresentation can
include stigmatization, learned helplessness, and inappropriate
learning programs and goals. Through education and increased
understanding, teachers can become more culturally responsive
in their teaching and allow for the inclusion of varied learning
needs. Teachers can work to create positive classroom climates
for all students by incorporating inclusive teaching practices such
as culturally responsive teaching. Culturally responsive teaching
is based on the socio-cultural understandings of learning. Socio-
cultural perspectives of learning see learning as participatory,
relational, and interactive, and ask educators to relate the practices
of school to practices which exist within the wider community (Moll,
EAL2019-ESSAY17-PANKEWICH  171

& Greenburg, 1990). Through the use of culturally responsive
methods of teaching, educators are encouraged to examine their
own understandings about learning and culture, which may be
biased. Understandings such as the official structure of the
classroom, student teacher interaction, lesson transmission, and
curriculum and hidden curriculum content which exists within the
classroom: "In culturally responsive teaching, knowledge is viewed
passionately and critically, and all biases are unmasked for what
they are and are open for discussion" (Quiocho & Ulanoof, 2009, p.
9).
