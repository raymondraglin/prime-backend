INTRODUCTION

   Ken Carano

Research has exposed a pro-White American narrative largely silent on race in textbooks, standards, and classrooms
(Shear, 2015). Social Studies, in the U.S., continues to largely incorporate a pedagogy that avoids an inquiry-
based understanding of race (Chandler, Branscombe & Hester, 2015). Black Americans are often introduced as
enslaved people in the Civil War. They then disappear for a hundred years before showing up during the Civil
Rights Movement and then magically racism ends and Barack Obama is president. There is often no mention of
1619. There is no continuation of the histories of Black people in the United States. Essentially Black histories lack
complexity in US classrooms (King, 2020). The most commonly taught Black histories topics are taught as islands,
lacking any connections. By doing this our children are robbed of the opportunity of seeing how these events
shape societies today. The ultimate goal of the book is to demonstrate, through examples that can be used, how
to teach Black Histories through rather than about. In order to do this, the chapter authors use a Black Historical
Consciousness framework as a guide in their instruction.

Brief Overview of Strategy Implementation

This book is the culminating part of a project of workshops on Black histories and geographies that spanned over a
year and a half, from December 2021 through September 2023, thanks to a couple of grants that enabled the Center
for Geography Education in Oregon (C-GEO) and its partners to run six workshops around the state of Oregon
and included taking 14 teachers on the Civil Rights Trail in parts of Alabama and Atlanta, Georgia, that focused on
using primary sources to teach Black histories and geographies. Many of the attendees participated in the process of
creating this open-source electronic book of K-12 lesson plans using primary sources (and the Library of Congress
analysis tools) to teach Black histories and geographies while decentering the teacher's voice. There were three stages
to this project. The initial stage of the institute included two workshops. One was in Portland and the second in
Coos Bay, at the site of Oregon's only confirmed lynching of a Black Oregonian. The second stage of the institute
was a 6-day trip to Georgia and Alabama in which 14 "core" teacher participants traveled to significant Civil Rights
sites and museums in order to gain a deeper understanding about the history and geography of the Civil Rights
Movement.

The 6-day trip portion was the one portion of the project that did not include use of TPS grant funds. This
portion was funded by C-GEO. The third stage of the institute included implementing the project portion in
which participants were writing chapters for a "reader" (E-book) on Black Histories and Geographies that included
primary sources and analysis from the Library of Congress' analysis tool. Additionally, during this stage we ran
4 more workshops, focusing on analyzing primary sources and BIPOC histories, for new teacher participants,
throughout the state, in geographically diverse areas (i.e. Portland, Lincoln City, Talent, and Bend, Oregon). During
the course of the grant, in addition to the workshops and stipends provided for book chapter reviewers, the grant
allowed us to bring in expert speakers, provided travel funding to be able to reach school districts in geographic areas
that we often have not been able to reach.
4 | INTRODUCTION

Our partners included the following: Social Science Specialist at the Oregon Department of Education, The
Oregon Historical Society, The Oregon Jewish Museum & Center for Holocaust Education (OJMCHE), Civics
Learning Project, Coos History Museum, North Lincoln County Historical Museum, Talent Historical Museum,
and the High Desert Museum. We also want to thank all the educators who put in hours of reviewing and providing
feedback the authors' work (their names are listed after the Table of Contents page. Additionally, Dr. Carmen
Thompson was a key consulting contributor throughout the process of our workshops and E-book framework
construction.

The social science specialist of the Oregon Department of Education helped facilitate each of the workshops and to
assure book chapters (from the E-book) are aligned with Oregon ethnic studies integrated social science standards.
The Oregon Historical Society provided access to their primary source collections and support training to use
their resources through their expert librarians and archivists. The OJMCHE and Civics Learning Project provided
professional development sessions on Black history, geographies, and alignment with the ethnic studies standards
throughout phases 1 and 3 of the project. Additionally, each of the museums listed and the Oregon Historical
Society) provided resources and locations for us to hold workshops.

At the six workshops that took place throughout the state of Oregon, educators ranged from grades K-12. The
secondary teachers were primarily social studies teachers. A few were language arts teachers. Participants also,
included some school district administrators, specifically a few district administrators that oversee the social studies
curricula.

Decentering the Teacher's Voice: Teaching "Through" Black
Voices Rather Than "About" Black Histories

In order to bring more voices and perspectives into a story the teacher's voice must be decentered. While
understanding the responsibility teachers have in the primary source analysis process, it is also critical for teachers to
avoid spending the majority of the time teaching about (i.e. centering their own voice) and rather focus on teaching
through Black perspective by having students read and listen to members from Black communities speak about
their histories and experiences. Teachers should also provide a more robust and complex presentation of Black
histories. The framework shared in this book does this and has the potential of disarming the biases discussed in the
proceeding sections. Ideally, primary sources from Black voices should be used whenever possible. As a framework
to bring in a more rounded teaching of Black histories, stories, and voices LaGarrett King (2020) has identified a
Black Historical Consciousness Framework (Table 1.1). For these reasons, we asked that chapter authors use this
framework's dimensions in their chapters. Each chapter uses one or more of the dimensions in the lesson plan
discussed.

                                 Black Historical Consciousness (King, 2020)

Dimensions                       Description

Power, Oppression, and Racism    Central is how Black people have been victims to racism, white supremacy, and anti-
                                 Black structures.

Black Agency, Resistance, and    Not helpless victims and have fought back against oppressive structures.
Perseverance

Africa and the African Diaspora  Black people should be contextualized within the African Diaspora.

Black Joy                        Focus on Black people's resolve during oppressive history.

Black Identities                 Shares the multiple identities of Black people throughout history.

Black Historical Contention      Recognizes that all Black histories are complex, not monolithic.

Chapter Formats

Each lesson chapter includes a similar format. The chapters begin with an introduction that provides a chapter
overview. Within this introductory overview, each chapter author explains their interpretation of teaching through
Black histories rather than about black histories and how the chapter does this. That is followed by a framework
section that provides an overview of how this fits into a Black Historical Consciousness. The chapter then turns to
an overview of the pedagogical applications applied in the chapter (i.e. analyzing primary sources and the lens used,
etc.) and how this fits into teaching through rather about Black histories.

Each chapter includes a completed lesson plan template (Table 1.2) and the lesson narrative, which provides the
essential and supporting questions, featured sources, and performance tasks. The chapters conclude with ways
the activities can be adapted or extended and will reiterate how you are teaching through rather than about Black
histories for this topic and why this is important.

Chapter Overviews

The remainder of this book consists of 13 chapters. The next chapter provides suggestions on primary sources
analysis. After that we share 11 chapters of model lessons on teaching Black Histories using various dimensions of
the previously discussed Black Historical Consciousness framework. The chapters consist of three middle school
chapters, and eight chapters dedicated to high school lesson plans. In the initial middle school chapter, Gricelda
M. Harshbarger has students exploring primary resources that highlight the resistance efforts of Black women
throughout history. Amit Kobrowski, next, demonstrates how students can use primary sources to explore the
prevalence of racism in Oregon's laws before statehood and the actions of resistance and resilience by a free Black
Oregon businessman, named A.H. Francis, who lived and operated a business in Oregon for several years. The third
middle school lesson, which comes from Lisa Colombo, again highlights the Portland Black Panthers, as students
investigate the media's portrayal of them and how that portrayal influenced community opinions.

The remaining lesson plan chapters are high school examples. Kristen Grosserhode has students investigate
Ethiopia's story through Ethiopian sources during a unit on New Imperialism in order to flip the constant narrative
of European dominance. In a chapter that has students exploring the United States' racist past and its impact
today, Murray Carlisle has students exploring the question, How do African Americans make social change? In the
third high school chapter, Nick Tayer shares a case study on a small town that has students exploring Oregon's
Back Exclusionary Acts. In the next chapter Karli Olson has students looking at various dimensions of the Black
Historical Consciousness framework in an inquiry lesson on children foot soldiers. This is followed by Rebecca
Eisenberg's chapter, in which students explore primary sources to learn about the Black Women's Club Movement.
In the second to last high school chapter lesson, Tabitha Richards provides examples of how localized primary
                                                                                                                                           INTRODUCTION | 7

source investigation can teach Black Histories. The seventh high school lesson is a chapter by Lynesy Turner, in
which students explore the systemically racist impacts of various US presidential administration's War on Drugs
policies on Black Americans. In the final chapter, Charles Williams provides a lesson in which students explore
the Tuskegee airmen's pursuit of equity in a US society that continued to present many roadblocks for non-White
citizens. We end the book with a concluding chapter that provides additional resources on teaching Black histories
and primary sources. While sharing our vision for future projects within this E-book.

TEACHER NEUTRALITY & PRIMARY SOURCE
ANALYSIS

   Ken Carano

Primary sources are items created by one present at an event and/or the time being studied (Waring, 2021). These
can include items such as letters, maps, clothing, newspapers, and oral histories. Thanks to the Internet, primary
sources are much more available now than at any point in history and more voices are now accessible to be included
in the story. Strangely, though, bringing in voices that have often not been involved in the main narrative of social
studies stories has also been deemed controversial in certain areas of the United States (Stephens, 2023) and has
called into question the misplaced notion of social studies classrooms ever being capable of being a neutral space.

Teachers need to be mindful to recognize that social studies classrooms are not neutral. They are contested spaces
in which perspectives of times and places are often narrowed to hegemonic views (Lintner, 2004). In order to
demonstrate this Hess (2005) outlined four methods in which teachers tend to approach controversial issues in their
curricula. These include denial, privilege, avoidance, and balance (see Table 2.1 for an explanation of each).

                                                                                   Table 2.1
                                                   Four Approaches to Controversial Issues in the curriculum

Approach Explanation

Denial     It is not a controversial political issue: "Some people may say it is controversial, but I think they are wrong. There is a right answ
           question. So I will teach as if it were not controversial to ensure that students develop that answer."

Privilege  Teach toward a particular perspective on the controversial political issue: "It is controversial, but I think there is a clearly right a
           will try to get my students to adopt that position."

Avoidance Avoid the controversial political issue: "The issue is controversial, but my personal views are so strong that I do not think I can t fairly, or I do not want to do so."

Balance    Teach the matter as a genuine controversial political issue: "The issue is controversial and I will aim toward balance and try to en
           various positions get a best case, fair hearing."

           (Hess, 2005, p. 48)

Examples of how educators may approach each of these in their classrooms might be the teacher who chooses to
teach climate change in a denial manner that it is even a controversial issue and, instead, presenting it as fact and
backing up their reasoning with the overwhelming scientific evidence that points to climate change, while giving
the remaining faulty claims that deny climate change no credibility. Teaching a controversial issue as privilege could
                                                                                    TEACHER NEUTRALITY & PRIMARY SOURCE ANALYSIS | 9

be refusing to call a human being "illegal" and an "alien". Instead, while acknowledging that some people still use
those terms, because the teacher finds that to be a derogatory and dehumanizing way of addressing another human
being, in their classroom the expectation and only correct way is to use the verbiage "undocumented immigrant"
or "undocumented citizen." The avoidance approach, may be used as a method by the male teacher, who is not
comfortable even discussing an issue, such as abortion vs. anti-abortion, because, as a male, the teacher does not feel
he has a right to take a position that men can dictate what a woman does with her own body. The balance approach
is what many teachers may attempt to do when discussing political parties and their candidates for elective office, as
the teacher may choose to attempt to give both sides' views.

In order to demonstrate what this has to do with primary source analysis, and this book, let us do a short
exercise. This activity would work best if the reader gathers a few other teachers to do this exercise, too, and then
compare and contrast answers. Looking at the four controversial approaches in table 2.1, write down, at least, a few
"controversial" topics and where you would choose to teach them in each category. If you are doing this activity
with others, you should each keep your answers to yourselves for the time being. After each person has had some
time to compile their answers, do the Likert Scale quiz in table 2.2 (again do not share your answers, at this point,
while completing the assignment).

Upon completion, compare and contrast your answers with the other teachers who have done both activities. Note
where there are differences and discuss reasons for those differences. What often happens is that when the people
discuss differences they either notice they are not as far away on the scale or in their approaches as they thought and/
or they gain new insights into a situation they had just interpreted differently. Additionally, and critical to the point
of this exercise, every person has made a personal and ideological choice on how they would approach an issue. The
point being that there is no such thing as neutrality in teaching social studies and that is not necessarily a negative.
We live in a world of diversity with a rich array of stories and perspectives that students need to be investigating
in order to become greater informed and develop an increased understanding and empathy for humans, who have
grown up with different worldviews.

                                                                   Table 2.2
                                                             Likert Scale Quiz

 On a scale of 1 - 5 (1 completely disagree, 5 completely agree):

 Do you Agree or Disagree?

   1. I want people to have the same opinion on issues as me.
   2. Parents should be able to have a say in what their children are taught.
   3. LGBTQ+ rights should be taught as a controversial issue in K-12 schools.
   4. I am okay with students kneeling when saying the pledge in the morning in K-12 schools.
   5. Religion should be taught in K-12 social studies.
   6. People should be willing to state their pronouns in class.
   7. It is okay to teach creationism in a social studies class.
   8. A Black Lives Maters T-shirt is okay to wear at school, because it isn't a political statement, it's a human rights

       statement.
   9. It is okay to refer to people as being "illegal" and/or "alien".
 10. Males have no right to be involved in making a law that denies a female the right to an abortion.
 11. White privilege is a real thing.
 12. If I feel a law is "unjust" I am justified in breaking that law.
10 | TEACHER NEUTRALITY & PRIMARY SOURCE ANALYSIS

You (the reader) might be asking, "What does this exercise have to do with primary sources?" The answer is that we
make these personal and ideological choices every day we teach with the sources (primary and secondary) we decide
to utilize in our curricula and the methods in which we choose to have students engage with and analyze these
sources (i.e., the disciplinary lens used, the types of questions we have students explore and the questions we leave
out of student exploration). For example, the questions that we provide students to analyze primary sources will be
quite different if we are using a temporal (historical) lens rather than a spatial (geographic) lens. Historical context
questions often focus on who, what, when, where, and why. While, formulating questions from a geographic
context often includes questions about space, attributes, time, multiple geographic entities, attribute relationships,
and temporal relationships. Each of these question types deals with where things are, how things relate to other
things, and how things change or persist relative to these locations (Carano, 2023).

When exploring primary sources, it is also critical to understand whose voice is driving the primary source. For the
purposes of this activity, it provides opportunities to bring in Black histories, experiences, and voices, decenters the
teacher's voice, and allows students to do the investigating. While primary sources can decenter a teacher's voice, it
is critical that the teacher understands whose voices are driving the primary source. Students (and teachers) must
understand that a primary source about Black experiences that is not voiced by the Black peoples being described
can lead to misconceptions and stereotypes. Therefore, it is recommended that if using a primary source from a non-
Black voice, students analyze the source for author bias. Imbalance through teacher selection of sources is another
example of bias (Sadker, 2009). This is a possible danger in using primary sources that inadvertently display Black
peoples from a non-Black voice. Additionally, the selector (teacher), should be cognizant of how the sources chosen
to be used in the curricula and the questions and/or prompts students are exploring narrows or provides a more
rounded experience of the peoples being explored (i.e. while teaching Black Histories is the curricula narrowed to
only acts of oppression and resistance or does the curricula also include stories of Black joy, Black agency, Black
historical contention, etc.?) Ultimately, when preparing to teach with primary sources, teachers should consider the
perspective of the creator of the source, the perspective of the selector of the source, and the cognitive levels and
experiences of the students analyzing the source.

      Understanding these positionality perspectives serves many purposes. As a learner who is engaging with a source,
      having a greater awareness of a source's perspective better positions the learner to make sense of the source and the
      potential unintentional consequences of learning about that source's topic with the methods being used. In a broader
      sense, understanding the perspective of the source and its creator situates learners to understand the historical context,
      and helps them discern a broader, unspoken message. The learner can then actively seek out various perspectives of a
      single event, issue, or time in history so they can understand it more holistically. (Carano & Ellsworth, 2023, p. 10-11)

The authors of each of the chapters, in this book, attempt to provide examples of ways they address these issues as
they discuss teaching through rather than about Black histories.

BLACK WOMEN IN REBELLION

   Gricelda M. Harshbarger

Introduction: Teaching Through Rather Than About

When learning about history, it is important to be able to make connections to help you understand an event or
historical figure you are learning about. As humans, we have a tendency to use our experiences as a baseline to
find relevance, similarities, and differences. This can seriously limit what content we can connect with if the type
of person or event is not familiar due to under representation. So to me, teaching through history is to allow the
learner to experience the story in a way that encompasses their being and finds that relevance in a meaningful way.
In choosing to write about a group of strong women that society might view as "unconventional", my hope is that
it will help some students to feel seen, while allowing others to find commonalities with figures they may not have
an obvious connection to.

There are many stories out there that talk about abolition efforts and resistance to slavery, but the large majority of
these tend to focus on men, while women are reduced to a side note or portrayed as a peaceful resistor. Through
the stories of Queen Nzinga of Angola, Queen Nanny of Jamaica, and Harriet Tubman of the United States, I
plan to challenge that narrative. These figures were chosen with the deliberate intention of showcasing a different
perspective of Black history. Instead of being the side note, these incredible women will be front and center to
teach students about the challenges faced by Africans across continents because of the transatlantic slave trade and
European colonialism, while also flipping that narrative of female non-violence.

In the first section, we will be focusing on Queen Nzinga of Angola. Her story will be used as a foundation of
resistance during the early days of the slave trade. Taking place in the early-17th century, Queen Nzinga openly
challenged colonial powers, used her political skills to negotiate treaties that protected her people from enslavement,
and fought well into her later years to retain power. Although she had to make many compromises and faced many
setbacks, she is remembered today as the mother of Angola.

In section two, we move across the Atlantic to Jamaica where we meet the African-born, Queen Nanny of the
Maroons. Most of what is known about Queen Nanny has been passed down through oral traditions, common
among West African culture. Through this collection of narratives, taking place in the early-18th century, we
have the story of a woman who resisted enslavement, engaged in effective military strategies, preserved cultural
knowledge among her followers, and fought off one the greatest military powers in the world during that period. As
an early pioneer for freedom in Jamaica, Queen Nanny remains a nationally recognized hero.

For the last section, we will be focusing on the lesser known exploits of Harriet Tubman. Celebrated for her work
in the Underground Railroad, Tubman was also a celebrated war hero during the Civil War. Leading a campaign of
soldiers in the Combahee River Raid in South Carolina, Tubman helped free over 700 people from bondage with
zero Union casualties. This story really expands on what we know about Harriet Tubman and highlights how her
unique set of skills were invaluable in pulling off this risky military operation.
16 | BLACK WOMEN IN REBELLION

Framework

The lesson in this chapter will be comparing and contrasting resistance efforts made by enslaved Africans in the
Americas to those in the African continent. By focusing on active resistance and the role women played in these
efforts, students will develop a deeper appreciation for a group of people that are often downplayed or ignored
within the curriculum as well as address unique challenges faced by female resistance leaders. While men typically
receive all of the credit, or blame, for violent uprisings and resistance, women have also engaged in these tactics across
continents and with great success. Through the stories of Queen Nzinga, Queen Nanny, and Harriet Tubman, we
will observe a different trend when discussing women's role in the fight against oppression; one of determination,
military prowess, and bravery. These women epitomize Black agency, resistance, and perseverance and will hopefully
show students that women were not always helpless victims. They were strong and capable, even if they did not
always get the credit they deserve.

Pedagogical Applications

For this chapter, students will be analyzing various primary and secondary sources, in multiple formats, to gain a
better understanding of each figure being studied. Students will then be comparing and contrasting each story to
highlight the unique challenges faced in each example. Through multiple individual and group activities, my hope
is that students will be able to gain a better understanding of the ways in which resistance efforts were carried out
across continents, what compromises had to be made by those in power, and how different cultural perspectives can
lend themselves to the cause of freedom. In other words, this will enable students to learn about the complexity of
resistance efforts through the lens of these three historical figures.

Lesson Narrative

Overview and Description of the Essential Question

Essential Question: In what ways did black women participate in active resistance against slavery and oppression?

When reviewing the essential question, students will be introduced to the idea of women leaders and resistance
fighters during the transatlantic slave trade and continuing through the American Civil War. It is intended to peak
student interest in how these women participated in resistance efforts in addition to questioning the dominant
narrative around who is typically portrayed in leadership roles and active resistance against slavery.

Using an inquiry-based and collaborative learning approach, I would anticipate that this lesson will take five
50-minute periods to complete. Here is a sample outline of what this might look like:

  · Day 1-3: Intro, read and discuss resources for each figure.
  · Day 4: Compare and contrast each figure in small groups.
  · Day 5: Reflection/whole class discussion.

Another option would be to create a jigsaw assignment in groups of 3, with each student focusing on one figure,
rather than reviewing each individually.

Staging the Question

To start things off, students will be asked to imagine the following scenario, then answer the follow-up questions:

       I want you to imagine a great leader in history. It can be anywhere in the world, from any time
       period. Someone who fights to protect their people and engages in challenges that are against the
       odds. Someone who, despite these challenges, rises up and comes out on top.

           1. Who do you see?
           2. Where are they from?
           3. What do they look like?
           4. What details or characteristics make them worth remembering?

Student responses can be documented on the board for the class to review. Ask students to make connections
between their responses. See if there are any trends or common themes. Do any of their responses tie into the
content you are about to introduce? If so, what inspired those responses? If not, why might this gap exist in who we
view as historical leaders or heroes?

Supporting Question: How was Queen Nzinga able to use her political and military skills to maintain power and
protect her people from enslavement by European forces?
18 | BLACK WOMEN IN REBELLION

Building Background:
Before introducing the first historical figure, we need to ensure that students have context surrounding the
geographical regions being discussed and a general knowledge about slavery as an institution, why Africans were
enslaved for labor in the Americas, and what impact it had on the African continent. I would recommend the
following resources:

  · Map Review: Students will need to be familiar with Angola, Jamaica (via the Gold Coast, modern-day
      Ghana), and the Southern United States.
          Map of the Transatlantic Slave Trade
          Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade - Database (interactive map w/statistical data)

  · Video: The Atlantic slave trade: What too few textbooks told you - Anthony Hazard

Once you are ready to begin reviewing the lesson content, provide students with the following graphic organizer
to take notes on each of the figures. The goal is to have them complete the reading, write a brief summary in their
own words, highlight the strategies used in their resistance efforts, and then make any additional observations or
connections they were able to make with the figure and the included primary sources.

Question 2, Formative Task 2, Featured Sources

Supporting Question: How did Queen Nanny use her cultural knowledge to empower her people and
successfully wage war against the British?

Continuing with the graphic organizer, students will complete the readings and analysis for Queen Nanny. When
beginning the second reading, the section related to Queen Nanny is located under the header: "The Maroon Wars,"
but I recommend that students read it in its entirety, if time permits. This reading also includes details from the
treaties offered by the British to the Maroons of Jamaica. Have students review the articles of "The Windward
Treaty". Encourage students to look for what is missing from this document, especially considering the role Nanny
had in the Windward Maroon community and how she is remembered by the people of Jamaica.

For this figure, it is also important to note that many of the details known about Nanny's life are based on oral
history traditions. The optional audio source can be used to show students what that might sound like, especially
since many stories are passed down through generations in the form of songs.

  · Maroons: fugitive slaves that created secret communities to escape chattel slavery.
  · Taínos: indigenous peoples of the Caribbean islands.

Question 3, Formative Task 3, Featured Sources

Supporting Question: After learning about Harriet Tubman's accomplishments in the Combahee River Raid,
why do you think the government was apprehensive to recognize her accomplishments or provide her with proper
compensation for her service?

For the final figure, have students complete the reading about Harriet Tubman, review the image from Harper's
Weekly documenting the raid, then review Tubman's claim to the US government advocating for proper
compensation for her military service during the war. As students review the documents, have them complete this
section in the graphic organizer.

While they review the claim Harriet Tubman submitted, ask them to clarify what her argument is in seeking
                                                                                                                     BLACK WOMEN IN REBELLION | 21

additional compensation since it notes that she had already received some funds from the government. Why was
this significant at the time?

  · Reading: Harriet Tubman, soldier and spy for Union Army during Civil War (requires a free account to
      read)*

  · Primary Source: Harper's Weekly - Combahee River Raid
  · Primary Source: Claim of Harriet Tubman

*Vocabulary and additional context information is available in the reading through Newsela.

Summative Performance Task

Once all readings and analyses have been completed, students will be tasked with comparing and contrasting each
story, followed by a class discussion. Students can use their graphic organizers as a reference for this activity.

After reviewing their graphic organizer, students will look for trends, similarities, and unique observations to share
in the class discussion. The instructor can highlight some of the overarching themes and important elements of
the lesson on the board. One suggestion for the compare and contrast activity would be to create an area in the
classroom with a poster for each category (i.e. similarities/differences/connections), then have students write their
comments on a post-it and place it on the corresponding section. Once completed, have students review their peers'
contributions in a gallery walk and discuss their observations.

For the final portion of the activity, students will complete a reflection paragraph and use what they learned
to answer the essential question: In what ways did women participate in active resistance against slavery and
oppression? Based on the research completed, there are many possible answers to this question. Included is an
optional proficiency based rubric for this activity: Perfect Paragraph Rubric (docx), which can be easily modified to
fit alternate grading formats.

Potential Civic Engagement

One option for civic engagement would be to locate and identify local figures that helped advocate for Black
Americans in Oregon. Student research projects can be used to supplement school curriculum and raise awareness
within your school community.

Resources:

  · Oregon Humanities: A Hidden History
  · Oregon Black Pioneers
  · Oregon Historical Society

Conclusion

By engaging and connecting with the resources in this lesson, students will be able to better understand the
complexities of Black resistance. There is no single narrative that encompasses all women in the fight against
oppression and it is important to highlight that Black women were not only active in these efforts, but were
capable leaders as well. It is astonishing to me that throughout the centuries, and across continents, Black women
have stayed true to their identity by embracing their strength of spirit, culture, and ancestral ties to make a real
22 | BLACK WOMEN IN REBELLION

difference for those around them. I believe there is something that we can all connect with in each of these figures
to find relevance and meaning. To see history through their stories and to gain a better appreciation of their unique
experiences.

PORTLAND BLACK PANTHERS AND THE
MEDIA

   Lisa Colombo

Introduction

In this lesson, students act as historians by exploring primary source documents to discover the role of the Portland
Black Panthers in the Black community, how their actions were portrayed in the media, and the response of the
Portland police to determine for themselves how the media portrayal impacted community opinions. Students
will be analyzing mainstream newspaper reports, flyers from the Panthers, alternative media reports, interviews or
personal statements, and police reports to make a claim and back it up with evidence and reasoning.

This multi-day lesson is designed for middle school students but could be easily adapted for high school or fourth
grade in conjunction with novels that discuss the Black Panthers, such as One Crazy Summer by Rita Williams-
Garcia. It could also be adapted for other locations by replacing Portland documents with your local Panther
chapter.

Framework

Using LaGarret J. King's "Black Historical Consciousness" as a framework, this lesson focuses on two of the six
principles.

Principle 2: Black Agency, Resistance, and Perseverance states:

      "Although Black people have been victimized, they were not helpless victims. Black people have had the capacity to
      act independently, have made their own decisions based on their interest, and have fought back against oppressive
      structures." (King, 2020)

In this lesson, students uncover how the Portland Black Panthers recognized a need in the Black community and,
despite poor media coverage, targeting by police, and some unsupportive businesses, persevered and spearheaded
several successful Community Survival Programs that helped Black and White people alike. Their efforts are still
felt by people today, especially those who attended the Free Breakfast program, who thank members of the Black
Panthers.

Principle 6: Black Historical Contention states, "All Black histories are not positive. Black histories are complex
and histories that are difficult should not be ignored. Black people were not a monolithic group; they had various
ideas of how to solve issues." Black Panther chapters were not all alike. The National party set a framework but
each chapter was free to pursue their own path determined by the needs of their community. Even within a branch,
members differed in opinions, actions, and beliefs. As a radical organization, the Panthers were vilified by some -
and hailed as heroes by others, often at the same time and for the same actions. This lesson allows students to explore
24 | PORTLAND BLACK PANTHERS AND THE MEDIA

the nuance behind the contentious reputation of the Panthers by showing that people or organizations are not all
"good" or all "bad" but are often a complex mix of both.

Pedagogical Applications

This lesson uses several lenses and methods that encourage students to "be a historian" instead of passively reading
about history as a student. Uncovering the stories can excite students as it can feel like being a detective, searching
for answers from pieces of the past. Engaging in the documents gives a feeling of ownership over their knowledge-
building while it also increases their critical thinking ability.

Place-Based Education is at the core of the lesson as it roots learning to one's own place. It gives students voice
and choice in determining how, what, and the depth of learning; it tailors instruction to each student's strengths,
needs, and interests; it promotes student agency and ensures mastery of standards (Getting Started With Place-
Based Education, Step-by-Step 2019). This lesson takes the national story of the Black Panther Party and connects
it to the local chapter in the Albina neighborhood in Portland, Oregon, 1969-1980.

Media literacy through primary source analysis is another lens that deepens students' understanding of events
and people. Instead of reading a secondary account which could have a bias, be missing context, or be curated to
show a specific narrative, students observe, infer, and think critically about the documents to uncover the story
for themselves. This increases engagement and provides an opportunity for all students to make meaning. This
lesson has students compare and contrast mainstream media reports, alternative media sources, and police reports
to identify potential biases and to think critically about motivations and consequences. Students can reflect on
their own media consumption and how it may be influenced by withholding certain details or by only showing one
perspective.

Jigsaw grouping was first developed in the 1970s after schools became integrated to encourage students from
different backgrounds to work collaboratively. It takes the onus off the teacher and allows the students to hold each
other accountable for the sharing of knowledge. Each student is responsible for deeply understanding one piece of
information (with the help of others who are learning the same thing) so they can teach the others in their jigsaw
group. As each bit of knowledge is needed to understand the whole story, each student is needed, which bolsters a
sense of belonging and self-worth. The expert groups (the ones who all study the same part) help each other answer
questions and make sure the information is accurate, which frees the teacher from the "keeper of the knowledge"
role. It gives students an opportunity to teach or present with less pressure than a formal presentation and allows
students who might not participate in a large group equal opportunity to ask or answer questions.

Lesson Narrative

Overview and Description of the Essential Question

Much has been written about the National Black Panther Party that started in Oakland, California in 1966. In
many history courses in middle and high schools, the Black Panther party is briefly mentioned in contrast to the
teachings of Martin Luther King and the principle of non-violence, or is missing completely. Photos of Panthers
with guns and reports of violence once filled the news and helped form a reputation or confirm a bias in the public's
mind.

It is less common to learn about other Black Panther chapters and to highlight the positive impact they made on
their local communities. In this multi-day lesson, students will explore and analyze primary source documents in
a jigsaw inquiry fashion in order to assess how the Portland Black Panthers' reputation was influenced by media
coverage.

In 1966, Kent Ford met Tommy Mills and quickly became friends, bonding over similar ideals such as anti-
capitalism and chess. Together, they raised money to bail out people targeted by police, held community meetings
and political education classes at Martin Luther King Elementary school, and started to gather like-minded people
who formed the National Committee to Combat Fascism (NCCF), an early iteration of the Black Panther Party. To
be an official chapter, it must be approved by the Oakland chapter, which did happen once Ford met Huey Newton
in 1969, but only after they had already started a free Breakfast program for school children, a health care clinic in
the Albina neighborhood, and a dental clinic -- the only one of its kind in the US.

The Portland Black Panthers were a bit different in that they downplayed the role of guns, as shown by the fact they
were not on display nor used in their demonstrations. They did not follow some of the teachings of the national
chapter such as forbidding birth control. They were also small, at most fifty people, with approximately one-third
of them women.

Some of the more well known members included Kent Ford, captain; Tommy Mills, deputy minister of defense;
Oscar Johnson, assistant deputy minister of information; Floyd Cruse, deputy minister of information; Tom
Venters, deputy minister of education; Raymond Joe, deputy minister of staff; Vernell Carter, deputy minister of
culture; and Percy Hampton as distribution manager of the newspaper. While the women of the Party were not
appointed titles, they were as active and as equal in power to the men in the Portland chapter. They included Linda
Thorton, who ran the free breakfast program; Sandra Ford, who was married to Kent, and Joyce Radford, who both
ran the medical clinics and often served as the officer of the day. As Ford recalls in the book Portland Black Panthers,
the reason for not giving titles to the women was less about misogyny - as they all had an equal say - but more for
protection against outside forces. (Burke & Jeffries, 2016).

To support the community survival programs, members sought out donations from local businesses and supportive
organizations. Often led by Linda Thorton, members would call or visit business owners and would provide
receipts for any donation. Some business owners felt threatened or intimidated by the request and would call the
police. This began a months-long investigation into "possible extortion" by the Panthers. As seen from police
records, officers canvassed nearly all businesses in Albina and even up into Kenton, asking if they had been
contacted by Black Panthers, showing pictures, and in some instances, even tapping phone lines. At the end, there
was no evidence of extortion and no charges were ever filed. In most reports, the business owners clearly stated there
were no threats made, yet they still felt threatened.
                                                                                             PORTLAND BLACK PANTHERS AND THE MEDIA | 31

This was part of a nationwide campaign under which J. Edgar Hoover instructed the FBI to "expose, disrupt,
misdirect, discredit or otherwise neutralize" the Black Panther Party. Panther members were often stopped by police
for misdemeanors or perceived threats such as threatening language, trespassing, traffic violations, and the like. The
Portland Black Panthers grew in notoriety when a known drug addict, 19-year-old Albert Williams, was shot by
police at the Panthers headquarters in 1970. Despite the fact Williams was not a member, this event and subsequent
trial was one of four events that dominated media coverage and generally portrayed the Portland Black Panthers
in a negative light. According to the research completed by Martha Gies and Jules Boykoff (2010) in the Oregon
Historical Quarterly essay, "We're Going to Defend Ourselves", these four events were "Kent Ford's arrest and
beating at the hands of Portland Police in 1969; the police shooting of Albert Williams at Panther headquarters in
February 1979; Black Panther Party picketing of McDonald's in summer 1970; and the imbroglio over whether to
issue the Fred Hampton People's Health Clinic a fund solicitation permit in the winter of 1970-1971."

The party continued to try to support the Black community in Portland, but a series of events - such as Kent and
Sandra Ford's divorce, the suspicious killing of member Jeff Fikes, and the pressures of running several programs
with shrinking membership- caused the chapter to close ranks and not accept any new members starting in 1979.
The branch continued as long as they could until they disbanded in 1980. Kent Ford now leads tours teaching
about the Portland Black Panthers, inspiring another generation of Portlanders to learn local history, care for each
other, and make change.

Staging the Question: Who were the Black Panthers? What was going
on in Portland in the late 60s- early 70s?

1 class period

Display the two photos on student page 1 and have students study the images for about a minute. Then, either
whole group or individually, have them record their observations and inferences about photo 1, followed by the
same for photo 2. Discuss what prior knowledge or connections they have to the Black Panther Party being mindful
of any potential family history your students may have as a culturally responsive educator.

Share the 10-point plan and have students read and annotate their reactions to the 10 points on student page 2.
Some suggestions could be a question mark for an unfamiliar word or idea, an exclamation point for something
surprising, a star for something that resonates with you, or a box for something that you feel strongly about. Have a
few students share their reactions or questions.

Share the 5-minute video History Brief: the Black Panther Party of the origin of the Black Panther Party. If students
are unfamiliar with Portland's Black History, consider reading the secondary source articles from the Civil Rights
and Civil Wrongs curriculum- specifically the sections on the 60s-70s (E, F, G ,H) and/or watching the OPB
documentaries Local Color and Lift Ev'ry Voice.

Share that Portland was one of the cities that had a local chapter of the Black Panthers. Generate a series of questions
students would like to know about the local chapter. Share the essential question: How did local media shape the
public's opinion of the Portland Black Panthers?

Supporting Question 1: What did the Portland Black Panthers do?

1-2 class periods
32 | PORTLAND BLACK PANTHERS AND THE MEDIA

To build knowledge of what the Portland Black Panthers did during their active period of 1969-1980, students
will analyze primary sources such as photographs, flyers, and documents using the National Archives analysis tools.
Choose the worksheet (novice or intermediate) that best fits your students. The Library of Congress tool.pdf is also
an option for more open ended learners. Depending on the size of the class, split students up into partners or trios
and have them analyze a primary source (or more if on one event.) Define any unfamiliar terms.

Display the primary sources with the relevant analysis worksheets around the room as a gallery walk. Using student
page 3, students will list the programs or events discovered in the documents in the first column.

Then, either independently or in a small discussion group, students will decide which, if any, of the programs or
actions performed by the Portland Black Panthers fit with the BPP 10 point platform and record their reasoning on
the second column of student page 3. In the third column, students can record questions, notes, or reactions.

After analyzing the sources and sharing, watch the Kent Ford and Percy Hampton interviews to confirm or
challenge their findings. Lead a reflective discussion on the lesson to reinforce the learning. Sample questions could
include: What was something surprising you learned? What challenged your initial perception of the BPP?

Exit ticket: What was a program or event that interests you? Why?

Supporting Question 2: How did the mainstream and alternative media
report on the Portland Black Panthers?

2-3 class periods

Start with a journal or pair share: What is your impression of the Portland Black Panthers based on what you learned
last class?

In the last lesson, students gleaned what events or programs the Panthers were involved in from photos and flyers
and other primary source documents. Share: What do you think people thought of the Panthers during that
time period? Where could we find that kind of information? (interviews, newspapers, tv reports, etc.) How does
media influence people's impressions? (editors decide what stories are told, reporters decide who to talk to, one
sided stories vs both sides, creating or reinforcing a binary or hierarchy, simplification, etc.) What are different
perspectives one might find published? (factual news stories, investigative reports, editorials, biased or persuasive
articles.)

Arrange the students into groups of 3, ideally grouping students with homogeneous analyses skills- this is their
jigsaw group. After the activity, they will come back to this group to share what they have learned. An option is
to have the jigsaw group choose a name or secret handshake as a bonding activity. Have each member choose a
number: 1, 2, or 3. Have all the same numbers form a new group and provide them with their numbered packet of
documents -this is their expert group. Ideally, these expert groups will be made up of students with heterogeneous
analysis skills which allows higher performing students to scaffold the more novice learners.

Each expert group will analyze the articles in their packet and record the events or programs the media was reporting
on regarding the Portland BPP chapter using the Student Page 4 . Refer to the Gallery walk Images to connect
the primary source photos and documents to the news articles to gain context about the events or programs. Define
any unfamiliar terms.
                                                                                             PORTLAND BLACK PANTHERS AND THE MEDIA | 33

After all articles are read and charted, reform into the jigsaw groups and have students share out and compare and
contrast their charts. Add any missing information and discuss any contradictory results. What themes emerge?
What seems to be missing?

Share the document Analysis of mainstream newspapers -Excerpt (Boykoff & Gies) and have students reflect on
the types of stories they uncovered in the newspapers. Why do news articles seem to focus more on the negative
stories than the positive ones? What impact does that have on their readers?

Exit ticket: Why might it be important to think about where a story comes from?

Supporting Question 3: What kind of bias is evident in the media
reporting of the Portland Black Panthers?

2-3 class periods

Start with a journal or pair share: Has your impression of the Portland Black Panthers changed since last class? If
yes, how? If no, what has been reinforced?

How does one form an opinion? It is usually based on what we know and feel. But sometimes we have associations
that are based on stereotypes and that can influence our communication and thought without even realizing
it. Define bias and implicit bias by watching one or both videos and discuss how to identify bias in a news
article by using Student page 5. If it would benefit your students, use the National Archives Understanding
Perspectives in Primary Sources worksheet or the ESCAPE Junk News (evidence, source, context, audience,
purpose, execution) infographic to guide the analysis.

Using the articles from the last lesson, students will reform into their expert groups and choose a few articles to read
closely and analyze for bias and the author's perspective. Depending on the size of the expert group, students can
pair up or form smaller groups of three to analyze an article for bias but encourage them to ask for help from the
other people in their expert group. Consider modeling the process using one of the articles to guide the students
through the procedure and to anticipate any questions or stumbling blocks.

Once students have completed at least one bias analysis of an article, have students reform into their jigsaw groups
and share out. Notice similarities and differences and discuss the difference in bias subtlety between the mainstream
media and alternative media. Use the jigsaw questions on Student page 5 as prompts for journaling or discussion.

Summative Performance Task

The Portland Black Panthers were active from 1969 to 1980, but not always very visible to the greater community.
Read an Excerpt from The Portland Black Panthers: Empowering Albina and Remaking a City, a
secondary source, and the Oregonian article Ex Panther Leader focuses attention on people projects, and
discuss how organizations can sometimes have a lifespan. Kent Ford and other former Panthers continue to have a
role in Portland civic life.

With a partner, students will create a one pager mini-poster about a program or event that the Portland Black
Panthers were involved in and inferring the legacy or impact it has had on the city of Portland. Using the CER
framework, (claim, evidence, reasoning), students will use primary sources to back up their claim and explore the
influence media biases can have on the general public. More advanced researchers could explore other primary
34 | PORTLAND BLACK PANTHERS AND THE MEDIA

sources such as the historical archives of Portland Police reports on Black Panthers and explore the nuances of
reputations.

Potential Civic Engagement

In Place-Based Education, civic engagement is an essential part of connecting students to their greater community
and is used to provide a concrete reason for learning about a topic. Listen for opportunities in classroom discussions
to connect to a local partner or to identify a need in your community. If one does not come naturally, lead a
brainstorming lesson to identify a need and consider how the Black Panther party would have addressed it. Plan
your own community survival program or contact an existing organization and see how the students can support
their mission.

An alternative would be to teach others about the Portland Black Panthers by displaying their mini-posters in a
public place, hosting a roundtable discussion (potentially inviting former members or city officials), or making a
YouTube video documentary.

Conclusion

The purpose of this lesson is three-fold. Primarily, it is to allow students to think like a historian by analyzing
primary source documents and creating their own meaning, as opposed to being told their meaning. Secondly, it
demonstrates to students how certain stories are overlooked or manipulated by the media and people in power
and how to uncover the hidden histories. Finally, it encourages students to be actively engaged citizens in helping
strengthen their communities.

There are many opportunities to build on this lesson and connect it to the current day. Consider researching and
discussing how it relates to the mutual aid programs in your neighborhood or that are a part of protest movements,
compare and contrast the Black Panthers 10 point plan to the Black Lives Matter movement or the Defund the
Police movement, or investigate the FBI's role in infiltrating and dissolving "threats to internal security."

It is assumed the students are familiar with how to analyze documents, how jigsaw groups function, and have a good
understanding of Portland's history of the Black Community. To aid in this, please refer to the Civil Rights and
Civil Wrongs curriculum which has supporting lessons to build community and set strong discussion expectations,
explanation of the jigsaw method, and many follow up opportunities including field trips and guest speakers when
learning about Portland's Black History.

A RESILIENT BLACK VOICE IN THE
WILDERNESS: A.H. FRANCIS' RESISTANCE
AGAINST LEGAL EXCLUSION

   Amit Kobrowski

Introduction

For many, present-day Oregon conjures a particular political image. A strong environmentalist movement, a vibrant
hippie community, the legalization and decriminalization of drug laws, the first in the nation to vote for euthanasia
and to elect an openly LGBTQ governor, Oregon checks many of the boxes of what is assumed by the notion of a
"liberal West Coast." Yet, on issues of race, Oregon's past is marked by attempts at creating an exclusive white-only
state (Madeo, 2023).

Oregon plays a limited role in most U.S. History textbooks. Typically, students outside of Oregon learn about the
state for the first time as part of the Lewis and Clark exploration story. A once popular video game about adventures
on the Oregon Trail introduced several generations of students to a narrow version of Oregon Territory history.
However, a closer examination of the road to Oregon statehood provides an excellent opportunity to explore the
ramifications of several key events in the years leading to the Civil War. The admission of Oregon into the Union
as a "Free State" elides its racist past. While the white settlers forming the first provisional government in the
territory prohibited slavery with the adoption of portions of the 1787 NW Ordinance Act, they soon amended
the provision in 1844 (Millner, 2021) to require settler slave owners to relinquish their slaves within three years of
settlement in Oregon. This effectively allowed slavery to extend to Oregon, even if for a limited time. However, an
additional provision also required newly freed Black men (within two years) and Black women (within three years)
to leave the state upon emancipation. Violators of this law were subject to physical punishment by lash. Sometimes
called Burnett's lash law, the requirement for physical punishment was removed without it ever being enforced, but
subsequent Black exclusion laws remained.

In 1849 (Millner, 2021), a new exclusion law prohibited any new Black settlement into Oregon territory but
allowed Blacks already residing in Oregon to remain. This law was repealed in 1854, but the 1857 Oregon
Constitution banned slavery and reintroduced legal Black exclusion. Although the Black Exclusion Clause in the
Oregon Constitution was never legally enforced and became invalid with the passage of the 14th Amendment,
Black emigration to Oregon remained low well into the 20th century.

The documents in this collection span the six years between the second exclusion law of 1849 and 1855, a year after
its repeal. The focus here is on A.H. Francis, a Black shop owner who, along with his brother, was charged with
violating the 1849 law. Although the court dismissed the charges, these letters reveal his impressions of Oregon, his
frustration with the hypocrisy of a nation that proclaims liberty and freedom, and his thoughts on the best ways to
pursue legal recognition and equality for Black people.
          A RESILIENT BLACK VOICE IN THE WILDERNESS: A.H. FRANCIS' RESISTANCE AGAINST LEGAL EXCLUSION | 39

Oregon's history includes at least one known case of expulsion based on the 1849 law. Jacob Vanderpool, a Black
businessman, settled in Oregon City in 1850. Accused by a rival hotel owner of breaking the exclusion law,
Vanderpool was found guilty of being a "mulatto" residing in Oregon Territory in violation of the 1849 law.
Vanderpool was forced to leave the territory within thirty days. "The Place We Make," a 2023 book by Sarah
Sanderson, explores some of this history. However, we do not have records of Jacob Vanderpool's own words
beyond the advertisement for his Oregon City hotel.

The letters from Francis and his tenacious efforts in business from Buffalo to Portland to Victoria, despite the
challenges of racism, display the resilience ("Black perseverance" King, 2020) necessary for Black business owners
throughout our nation's history. His letters to Douglass also outline a course of resistance against Oregon's racial
laws and the continuation and expansion of slavery through the Compromise of 1850 and popular sovereignty.

Historical Context

To establish the historical context of this chapter, it may be necessary to revisit the early settler history of the
territory of Oregon. In the early 19th century, American and British traders found a lucrative business in the animal
furs of the Pacific Northwest. By the 1830s, American missionaries had settled in Oregon Country (modern-day
Washington, Oregon, and Idaho) with the hopes of converting the numerous tribes of the region.

An influx of settlers from Missouri and other U.S. states, the shifting economic priorities of Great Britain, and an
expansionist mood in the United States helped elect James K. Polk to the presidency in 1844 on the promise of
bringing Texas and Oregon Country into the United States. By 1845, some Americans were simply pursuing the
logic of Manifest Destiny by calling for 54°40 or fight, a claim, if realized, that would have drawn the northern
border of the United States well into modern British Columbia (Lang, 2023).

The United States and Great Britain settled the dispute with the 1846 Oregon Treaty, drawing the northern border
at the 49th parallel. Before officially becoming a United States territory, American settlers had already established
a framework for government and established the Organic Laws of Oregon. From its origins, the provisional
government of Oregon was concerned with the issue of slavery and white supremacy. By 1844, the Organic Laws
prohibited slavery in Oregon territory and any permanent Black settlement. This included a short-lived "lash law"
that threatened physical harm to Blacks who did not leave the territory. Although never enforced and soon removed,
the tone was set for Black settlers to Oregon. Nevertheless, there was always a small Black presence in Oregon of
enslaved, newly emancipated, or free Blacks who made the journey overland or by steamship to Oregon Territory.

The U.S. victory over Mexico in 1848 and the expansion of the United States' territory through the Southwest to
California once again opened the issue of the expansion of slavery. The Compromise of 1850 attempted to address
the national divisions on the slavery question by admitting California into the Union as a free state, banning the
slave trade in Washington, D.C., and, in two provisions that arguably increased national divisions, allowing popular
sovereignty to determine if either Utah or New Mexico would allow for slavery, and strengthening the Fugitive Slave
Laws. The new law required Northern officials to actively participate in the return of the self-emancipated who had
escaped to the North.

Abolitionists, both Black and White, were outraged by the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act. In his letters to Frederick
Douglass, A.H. Francis is well aware of the rift amongst abolitionists on the best way to pursue the end of
slavery in the face of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act. Francis referenced the division between the followers of William
Lloyd Garrison and Douglass in the debate around the 1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act and the repeal of the Missouri
Compromise (Source 3).
40 | A RESILIENT BLACK VOICE IN THE WILDERNESS: A.H. FRANCIS' RESISTANCE AGAINST LEGAL EXCLUSION

The documents in this chapter begin with A.H. Francis's first impressions of Oregon (Source 1). Francis arrived by
ship rather than the overland route experienced by most immigrants to the Oregon Territory. His first impressions
of Oregon are of the geography along the Columbia and Willamette rivers. Although not included in this collection,
Francis shares the American settler view of Indigenous people and culture, referring to the natives of Oregon as
"savage" and "degraded." Black and other racialized settler groups were not immune to the dismissive attitudes
towards Native Americans. These complex narratives are part of what Dr. LaGarrett King categorizes as "Black
Historical Contention" in his framework for Black Historical Consciousness (King, 2020).

Source 1 continues with Francis briefly referencing the 1849 Black Exclusion Law. Here, he laments the existence of
the law but is assured by his white friends and neighbors of Portland that this law is of no consequence and will soon
be repealed. Only two months later, Francis again writes to Douglass to inform him that Francis and his brother
have been found guilty of violating Oregon's Black Exclusion Law (Source 2).

In addition to the four letters from A.H. Francis to Frederick Douglass, this collection includes Oregon's Black
Exclusion Law of 1849 (Source 5) and the Oregon Donation Land Act of 1850 (Source 6). The 1849 Exclusion
Law was enacted by the white settlers in Oregon Territory, attempting to move toward statehood. The Oregon
Donation Land Act (Source 6), is an example from the Federal Legislature demonstrating the racial policies of the
antebellum federal government.

Essential Question: How do the stated values of American
democracy inspire resilience and resistance to injustice?

     Source 1: Letter from A.H. Francis Upon Arrival in Portland, Oregon
     Territory, after August 10, 1851

       Dear Douglass:

       ...Pacific City is near the mouth of the Columbia. The entrance into the harbor is quite difficult, and
       not safe without an experienced pilot. Once Inside, you glide along on the beautiful waters of the
       harbor, (which is as smooth as glass,) until mountain fastnesses, on either side, hide all other objects
       from view, save the city in front, and the great sandbar in the rear, around which we had just been
       piloted. The land is well timbered with pine, cedar, and oak, showing already some proof, that
       American enterprise will yet mould this portion of the continent to rank, among her richest and
       certainly most pleasant (in regard to climate) of all her domain. After a short stay, to land some
       passengers, the steamer rounded to, and passed safely out. Rounding a point, we came suddenly in
       view of the mouth of the Columbia river. No doubt, in many respects, one of the finest rivers in the
       world. I think her length is thirteen hundred miles, and breadth varying from some three to four
       miles at its mouth, down to one-half mile, and were it not for some difficult falls to pass, would be
       navigable to its terminus.

       ...It was on a pleasant Sabbath, the 10th of August, I came in sight of St. Hellens, Mount Hood, and
       Mount Jefferson, the peaks of which, and for some distance down their sides, were covered with
       snow. As the rays of the sun sent back the reflection (although some eighty to a hundred miles
       distant.) the eyesight was dazzled. The former named of these mountains, stands elevated thirteen
       thousand feet above the level of the sea.

       ...I arrived in Portland on Sunday evening. It lies on the Whillhamet River, one of the branches of the
       Columbia, about one hundred miles from the mouth of the Columbia. The situation is a desirable one
       for a city, and must eventually become a city of considerable size. It is now the largest in Oregon.

       I avow the fact, although the greater portion of the citizens are Southerners. From the desire to
       make money, or in consequence of no colored people living among them, they do not show out their
       principles as is their usual custom, God grant they never may.

       I am informed that some Judas had introduced, and succeeded in getting it passed in the Territorial
       Legislature, a resolution that no colored person should settle in the Territory. I have conversed with
       some of the leading officials of this city, in relation thereto. They say it was passed by stratagem.
       Although in operation, it will be repealed. Portland is less than two years old, contains three to four
       thousand inhabitants, (whites,) beside a large number of Indians. It is the great trading depot for the
  A RESILIENT BLACK VOICE IN THE WILDERNESS: A.H. FRANCIS' RESISTANCE AGAINST LEGAL EXCLUSION | 43

Territory, and many of the mining districts trade at this place. Government lands are rapidly being
taken up, and settled by industrious farmers, who are running the products of the soil into market,
and receiving enormous prices...
I have more than filled up my sheet, and therefore bid you adieu, for the present, and subscribe
myself,
Yours as ever, A.H. Francis.
* Published in Frederick Douglass' Paper, November 20, 1851, p. 3

Source 2: "Free Territory" of Oregon October 1851

To Frederick Douglass -- My Dear Friend: ... I was brought to the knowledge of the fact, and
experienced the result of an existing law in this "free territory" of Oregon, so unjust and devilish in
all its features, that I waive other matter[s] that you may immediately give publicity to the facts
relating to it.
...[m]y brother was arrested through the complaint of an Englishman (said, by some, not to be
naturalized), on charge of violating one of the laws of the territory. And what do you suppose was
the crime? That he was a negro, and that one of the laws of the "free" territory forbid any colored
person who had a preponderance of African blood from settling in the territory. He was tried before
a Justice of the Peace, and, I must say, very generously given six months to leave the territory. The
law says thirty days. The second day after my return, Sept. 15th, the complainant, not being satisfied
with the past decision, carried the case up to the Supreme Court, Judge Pratt presiding.
Before his Judgeship we were summoned. After a formal hearing, establishing the fact of negro
identity, the court adjourned, to meet the next morning at 9 o'clock. At the hour appointed, the room
was crowded, showing much feeling of indignation and wrath against the complainant. Judge
Tilford, late of San Francisco (a Kentuckian), appeared as counsel for the defense. To be brief, he
conducted the case with the ability and skill rarely seen by the legal profession, showing, by the
constitution of the United States, the right of citizens of one state to enjoy the rights of citizens in
another. [h]is argument rested that citizens of one state had a right to enjoy the same privileges that
the same class of citizens enjoy in the state which they visit. This he contended was the
understanding or meaning of that article in the constitution. He demanded for us, under this clause,
all the rights which colored people enjoyed in the territory prior to the passage of this law. (Those in
the territory at the time of the passage of this law are not affected by it). He then took the position,
44 | A RESILIENT BLACK VOICE IN THE WILDERNESS: A.H. FRANCIS' RESISTANCE AGAINST LEGAL EXCLUSION

       and clearly proved it, that the law was unconstitutional, on the ground that [it] made no provision
       for jury trial in these arrests, showing that any person, no matter how debased, had the power to
       enter complaint against any colored persons and have them brought before any petty Justice of the
       Peace and commanded to leave the territory.

       At the close of it, the whole house appeared to feel that the triumph was complete on the part of
       the defendants, that unconstitutionality of the law must be conceded by Judge Pratt. But alas! self-
       interest or selfishness led him to attempt to override the whole argument, and prove the
       constitutionality of the law; and it is none the less true that we now stand condemned under his
       decision, which is to close up business and leave the territory within four months.

       This decision produced considerable excitement. Some said the scoundrel (the complainant) ought to
       have a coat of tar, while the mass have agreed to withhold their patronage from him. . .

       ...The people declare we shall not leave at the expiration of the time, whether the Legislature repeal
       the law or not. Petitions are now being circulated for its repeal. The member from this district, Col.
       King, one of the most influential men in the house, declares, as far as his influence can go, it shall be
       repealed at the commencement of the session, which takes place on the first of December next.
       Thus you see, my dear sir, that even in the so-called free territory of Oregon, the colored American
       citizen, though he may possess all of the qualities and qualifications which make a man a good
       citizen, is driven out like a beast in the forest, made to sacrifice every interest dear to him, and
       forbidden the privilege to take the portion of the soil which the government says every citizen shall
       enjoy.

       Ah! when I see and experience such treatment, the words of that departed patriot come before me.
       "I tremble for my country when I remember that God is just, and that his justice will not always
       sleep." I find, upon examination, that more than half of the citizens of Portland were ignorant of any
       such law. The universal sentiment is, that it shall be repealed. God grant that this may be the case. If
       I have been one who, through suffering severely, has had the least agency in bringing about this
       repeal, I shall freely surrender, and be well pleased with the result. Yours for equal rights, equal laws
       and equal justice to all men.

Source 3: Letter from A.H. Francis, "Onward Be Your Motto"
Portland, Oregon, June 1, 1854

Frederick Douglass, Esq: Esteemed Friend: --

The changes that have taken place, in relation to your views in carrying on the Anti Slavery
movement, the violent attacks within which those views have been met by those who heretofore
were professedly your dearest friends and co-adjutors in the branch of reformatory movement, has
been a source of great grief to my mind.

It has established in my mind for you (if possible) an increased amount of confidence in your honest
and untiring efforts to rid the American Government of that system of abominations that already
places her on the brink of ruin, betraying in some degree the confidence I heretofore held in some of
the most able defenders of human rights. Permit me to say that you have sustained your position
against fearful odds. Draw not back. Onward be your motto. -- No attacks from your opponents in a
righteous cause can avail anything when professedly anti-slavery men stoop (falsely) so low, in
order to give a semblance of truth to their vile calumny...

Stand firm to your position, my esteemed friend. The crisis imperiously demands that political anti-
slavery should be brought to bear upon the rotten, false-hearted demagogues that now fill the State
and National councils of the American Government. The drama that politicians are now playing is
hastening to the last act. In the name of God and humanity, I call upon Abolitionists, and all honest
men, to come to the rescue. Displace, and forever lay low the heartless, dishonest and ungrateful
political wretches who have betrayed their trust, and sold themselves to a power through which
naught is to be seen but blight and decease throughout the land. It is a mystery to me how anti-
slavery men can look through moral suasion alone to the overthrow of such infamous time servers
as those who supported the repeal of the Missouri Compromise...

...The first Legislative Council of Washington Territory (that portion that was taken in the division of
Oregon) convened in February at Olympia. By the acts I notice they have drawn the line of
distinction between the races. The colored man, and half-breeds of African descent, are
disfranchised, while half-breeds of whites and Indians are not. The President of the Council, [Francis
A.] Chenowith, representative from the Cascades, a man with whom I have some acquaintance, and
who held the most liberal views three years ago in relation to my ejection from the territory on
account of complexion, was the first to offer an amendment to the resolution which produced this
result, at a time, too, when there was a prospect of its going through without this odious clause.
Truly, the time has come when we know not what politicians to trust. He was one of the candidates
for Congress. That hope buried all his amazing philanthropy. When will men learn true wisdom, and
act for the right?
46 | A RESILIENT BLACK VOICE IN THE WILDERNESS: A.H. FRANCIS' RESISTANCE AGAINST LEGAL EXCLUSION

       Before I close, I must congratulate you, and the projectors and supporters of the National Council. I
       consider it the great movement of the age among colored Americans. Let the objects in view of that
       body be carried out, and our increasing strength and influence will be permanently felt throughout
       the Union. I certainly deplore the unwise and unjustifiable position taken by some friends of
       Freedom in this Colonization Conventional movement, soon to take place in Cleveland, Ohio.
       Personally acquainted, and friendly as I feel towards the projectors of that scheme, I can but feel
       that the spirit of opposition and self-aggrandizement are higher motives with some, than real
       sympathy for the good they expect to accomplish.
       I want no better evidence than the fact that the most tenacious supporters of that movement are
       the last to leave the country, and the first to deny those to meet with them who disagree with their
       views. A subject what will not bear thorough investigation by friends and foes, is a dangerous
       subject to meddle with. Condemnation is written on every move. Please accept these hasty
       thoughts not only from a friend personal but a friend of the oppressed throughout the world.

     Source 4: Letter from A.H. Francis, "Taxation without
     Representation," Portland, Oregon, July 22, 1855

       Dear Frederick: I have nothing important to relate since my last, except a flare-up this morning with
       the County Assessor.
       The law of the Territory levys a tax on stock in trade, money, &c. of ½ per cent., which makes it very
       heavy on large mercantile houses. The Assessor newly appointed demands on oath the value of
       your effects.
       The law of the Territory forbids my oath on account of complexion. In compliance with this
       outrageous law I refused to swear to my amount of capital. The Assessor has taken issue, and no
       doubt it will end in a law suit; the fine for refusing to swear is $20. I have concluded not to tamely
       submit to witnessing this outrage on my rights without testing the legality thereof.
       Look for a moment to the detestable principle here involved. Outrages, insults, or abuse, may be
       practiced upon me, and I have no oath to defend myself. When taxation, without representation is
       levied upon me, then my oath is good in order that a heavier tax may not be collected from me.

ETHIOPIAN INDEPENDENCE IN THE IMPERIAL
AGE

   Kristen Grosserhode

Introduction: Teaching Through Rather Than About

Ethiopia remained an independent nation while its neighbors fell to European domination during the wave of
New Imperialism that stretched from 1884 to 1914, when Europe was conducting its "Scramble for Africa". It is
common to view these events from a European perspective. Certainly there are myriad sources available. But the
goal here is not to view imperialism in Africa through a European lens, but to view European imperialism through
an African (in this case Ethiopian) lens. Ethiopian voices should be used to tell the Ethiopian story. It is their land
after all. Changing this perspective may give us a very different understanding of history. Ethiopia is treated as an
exception, always showing up as a different color on historical maps because it didn't "belong" to anyone like Egypt
or Ghana or Algeria. Why, though? How did Ethiopia maintain its independence when no other nation did? Often
because of its exceptionalism, Ethiopia's story is skipped over. It may appear again during WWII when Mussolini
invades and wins a fleeting victory. However, in the teaching of history that tends to focus on the European journey,
this exceptional case should make us pause and look closer, with excitement, to this Eastern African nation that
stood against European imperialism.

In order to examine this history with authenticity and integrity, Ethiopia's history should be told with Ethiopian
voices. We should learn Ethiopian history through Ethiopian primary sources rather than learn about Ethiopian
history through Western sources. It is easy to find a Puck cover that clearly and cleverly shares the European view
of Africa, but what did Ethiopians have to say during the same time period about the same events? In any telling
of history, the voices chosen show us who has the power, whose rendition gets shared, who gets to direct the
narrative. Teachers and students should pay close attention to this! It is easy to default to the sources most readily
available-likely in English and from an American or European perspective. However, digging a little deeper to teach
through Black voices, through Black histories, instead of about them, will be worth the effort.

Many of the key sources in this lesson come from King Menelik II, a powerful and revered figure in Ethiopian
history for his role in leading Ethiopia to defeat Italy in the Battle of Adwa and show the world that Africa was not
just up for the taking. To teach through Black histories, this lesson looks at history through Menelik's voice as he
navigated this turbulent time. Another fascinating source is the Kebra Nagast, a religious and historical work that
describes Ethiopia's proud place in Christian history. Of course one may read in the Bible about Ethiopia, but the
Kebra Nagast shows us what Ethiopia has to say about its own Biblical role. Many written sources were produced in
Amharic, so the English translations are provided. It is possible to find images of the Treaty of Wuchale in Amharic
as well as the Amharic recording of Menelik to Queen Victoria, but again, English translations are provided here.

Framework

This lesson fits into a Black Historical Consciousness framework by demonstrating the qualities of Black Agency,
Resistance and Perseverance as well as Black Historical Contention. To give honor and power to the stories of Black
people, the sources used will be from the voices of Black people. As mentioned above, Ethiopia was an exceptional
nation during this time period. Not falling to European power shows Ethiopian agency, resistance and perseverance.
When none of its neighbors could claim the same, Ethiopia shows us that not all African nations were doomed to
the same colonial fate. In fact, Liberia also escaped European control. This demonstrates historical contention by
acknowledging that we cannot make a blanket statement about Africa being colonized. There was another story
happening on the continent with a very different ending. Too often, this story is ignored.

Pedagogical Applications

When considering pedagogical strategies and applications, this lesson clearly focuses on analyzing primary sources,
comparing and contrasting, and drawing conclusions. In terms of Costa's Levels of Questioning, all levels will be
used. The approach employed here gradually takes students from identifying to comparing to defending using
primary sources and group support. The bulk of the sources used are from Ethiopia, which is likely unusual for
most American students-but the goal is to teach through Black histories!

Students will use writing and speaking to organize and share ideas throughout the lesson. A quick write will get
ideas flowing; analyzing maps and identifying natural resources will help students visualize Ethiopia geographically;
comparing and contrasting Ethiopian and European sources will guide students to consider different historical
perspectives; and analyzing Ethiopian political and military primary sources will facilitate students' viewing of
European imperialism through Ethiopian eyes while demonstrating Ethiopia's incredible ability to fend off foreign
domination.

             monarchy. Ask students to consider if one type of government is more suited to certain situations-historical
             or contemporary.

Lesson Narrative

In 1884, European nations met at the Berlin Conference to divide Africa amongst themselves, deciding who would
colonize which areas and have access to the resources found there. They agreed to policies to make this scramble
as amicable as possible. Of course, as the South African History Online site explains, this was done without the
consent of any African people and resulted in decades of African exploitation.

However, Ethiopia managed to remain independent. If one nation could, why not all? This lesson is an inquiry-
based lesson to explore what made Ethiopia different from the other nations. The time period of interest is
1884-1913, during the so-called "Scramble for Africa", instigated by Belgium's interest in the Congo. African
nations suffered terribly during this time and continue to feel the effects today. In the case of Belgium, the king
has expressed regrets and some officials have apologized for the cruelty of their colonization. Ethiopia escaped this
fate. A natural extension of this lesson would be to examine Ethiopia's current economic and political situation
and compare it with a nation like the Democratic Republic of the Congo to look for long-term effects of such
colonization. This lesson remains historical. There are general information sources and some European sources
used to aid in providing context. Because he was a prolific political figure and many sources are available, the
primary subject is King Menelik II, the leader of Ethiopia during the era of study. Students will be drawing their
own conclusions to answer the essential question in written or illustrated form using the sources, activities, and
discussion provided. The activities include a quick write, analyzing maps to answer Question 1, comparing and
contrasting sources in a T-chart to answer Question 2, and analyzing sources in a Jigsaw to answer Question 3. All
60 | ETHIOPIAN INDEPENDENCE IN THE IMPERIAL AGE

activities beyond the quick write involve group work. The final product will be a CEA paragraph or propaganda
poster that demonstrates each student's conclusion to the essential question. There is no definitive answer to the
essential question; it is truly up to the student to determine, using evidence, to decide.

Prior Knowledge: Students should have some prior knowledge including understanding the Industrial
Revolution, the 1815 Vienna Congress and Europe's desire to avoid international war, and the 1884 Berlin
Conference. This lesson is designed to fit into a unit on imperialism, to serve as one example of many Afro-
European interactions during the age of New Imperialism. Students should understand Europe's hunger and
motivations for empire, leading up to and after the Berlin Conference, before beginning this lesson. The teacher
may want to give a lesson to introduce King Menelik, Queen Taytu, and Ethiopia. A useful source for creating a
lesson or slides to use for the Scramble for Africa background information is the South African History Online
lesson website. The lesson can be used for information and context, background reading for the teacher or
additional reading for students. For providing a brief online biography of King Menelik II of Ethiopia. *Disclaimer:
This lesson is not meant to be all-inclusive for teaching about imperialism and the European history behind it.

Overview and Description of the Essential Question

The essential question is: How did Ethiopia manage to remain independent during the second wave of European
imperialism (1884-1914)? It is the hope of this lesson that students will see how a strong leader like Menelik II
was able to navigate the European Scramble for Africa on his own terms, uniting his people and contending with
Europe on equal political and military footing. Through predominantly Ethiopian primary sources, students will
use inquiry to develop their own understanding and form a response to the question. Depending on the length of
classes, this lesson may take 1-2 days to complete. In order to give sufficient time for quality summative assessments,
two days is a better commitment.

  · Staging the Question (10 minutes)
  · Question 1 (15 minutes)
  · Question 2 (20 minutes)
  · Question 3 (15-20 minutes)
  · Summative Task (30-60 minutes, perhaps done as homework or on a separate day)

PowerPoint slides to teach this lesson: Ethiopian Independence (pptx)

Staging the Question

Begin the lesson with a quick write addressing these questions: What does it mean to be victorious? A winner? How
do you know when you are victorious or when you have won? What do you do with your status as victor? When
you hear the word "winner" who is a person or entity you think of? Do you admire them? Why?

Ask students to write for five minutes and then cold call or take volunteers to share out and lead an organic
discussion. Perhaps write down their big ideas on the board where you can return to them later.

The idea is that most studies of this time period focus on Europe's domination of the African kingdoms. This
lesson, though, focuses on Ethiopia's resistance to domination. By the end of the lesson, this question should be
brought up again by asking if Ethiopia was victorious in a way that was meaningful to them. Students might think
of winners in sports or elections, but not necessarily nations. So, how does a nation "win", specifically in an imperial
                                                                                         ETHIOPIAN INDEPENDENCE IN THE IMPERIAL AGE | 61

setting? What does an admirable victory look like in this context? What should the winning nation do with its
power?

Question 1, Formative Task 1, Featured Sources

Question: Did Ethiopia have natural resources attractive to Europeans?

Sources: South African History Online lesson and resource map (see map below). The lesson can be used for
information and context, background reading for the teacher or additional reading for students. The map is the
essential source for the activity.

Activity: Novel Ideas Only. Students will be in groups of 3-4. Equip each group with a small whiteboard and
dry erase markers or simply a piece of paper and pen. Students should be familiar with the concept of imperialism
and colonization and be familiar with the Scramble for Africa (at least that European nations began quickly and
greedily carving out African colonies for themselves in the late 1800s). Ask students to make a list of valuable natural
resources in Africa. What kinds of resources would make European nations so eager to gain colonies? Allow 2
minutes. Ask the first group to read their list. The teacher or a volunteer student should record a master list at the
front of the class. All other groups must cross off any ideas on their own list that are stated by the first group. The
second group will read what remains on their list. All other groups must cross off any ideas repeated in their own list.
Continue to the last group (they may or may not have anything left on their list). Correct answers should include:
gold, diamonds, oil, rubber, timber, gas, coal, copper, uranium, cobalt, coffee, tropical fruits, platinum.

Now introduce the fact that Ethiopia was never colonized by Europe. Use this map image to show colonization of
Africa. There are many renditions of this map online, so you can also choose one you like. Ask students to find
Ethiopia and make observations. How is it different from the other parts of Africa? Correct answers should include
that it is independent or not controlled by a European empire.

Ask students if Ethiopia perhaps didn't have any of the valuable natural resources they listed earlier-could that be a
reason Ethiopia remained independent? Select 1-2 students to give their answer.

Show the following maps (Figures 6.2 and 6.3) and ask students to take 1-2 minutes to quietly study them. Ask
them to discuss and agree as a group whether Ethiopia had valuable resources. Ask for a student volunteer to
share their answer with the class. Correct answer should indicate that yes, Ethiopia had valuable resources (gold,
agricultural products).

Ask students if the other parts of Africa were colonized for resources, and Ethiopia had valuable resources too, what
other explanation could there be for its independence? Solicit student ideas and discuss as needed before moving to

Question 2, Formative Task 2, Featured Sources

Question: Did Ethiopia's culture identify closely enough with Europe that "civilizing" was not needed?

Ethiopian Sources:

King Menelik II's call to arms:

      "Now an enemy that intends to destroy our homeland and change our religion has come crossing our God-given
      frontiers digging in like a mole. Now, with the help of God, I will not allow him to have my country. You, my
      countrymen, I have never knowingly hurt you, nor have you hurt me. Help me, those of you with zeal and will power;
      those who do not have the zeal, for the sake of your wives and your religion, help me with your prayers." (1896
      declaration recorded by Battle of Adwa eyewitness, Gebre Selassie).

King Menelik II's declaration of blackness:
66 | ETHIOPIAN INDEPENDENCE IN THE IMPERIAL AGE

      "I am black, and you are black; let us unite to hunt our common enemy." (1895 quote when trying to convince
      Muslims to help fight imperial Italy).

Kebra Nagast (Glory of the Kings). This is a collection of stories, history, myths, legends of Abyssinia/Ethiopia that
explains how the kings of Ethiopia are descended from the son, named Menelik, of Israel's King Solomon and the
Queen of Sheba, making them relatives of the divine line of Christ and closely related to the Semitic peoples of
Asia. It even claims that the Ark of the Covenant was taken to Ethiopia because the Jews were not worthy to care
for it. It was collected and written over the centuries in several languages due to conquest and eventually translated
into Ethiopian in the Middle Ages. Use some or all of the following quotes and excerpts from the Kebra Nagast to
illustrate Ethiopia's proud Christian heritage.

The text was taken to England and in 1872, King John IV of Ethiopia wrote to ask for it back saying:

      "Again there is a book called KIVERA NEGUST (i.e. KEBRA NAGAST), which contains the Law of the whole of
      ETHIOPIA, and the names of the SHUMS (i.e. Chiefs), Churches, and Provinces are in this book. I pray you will
      find out who has got this book, and send it to me, for in my Country my people will not obey my orders without it"
      (King John IV to Lord Granville regarding the Kebra Nagast being returned to Ethiopia).

The introduction to the Kebra Nagast states:

      "IN PRAISING GOD THE FATHER, THE SUSTAINER OF THE UNIVERSE, AND HIS SON JESUS CHRIST,
      THROUGH WHOM EVERYTHING CAME INTO BEING, AND WITHOUT WHOM NOTHING CAME
      INTO BEING, AND THE HOLY TRIUNE SPIRIT, THE PARACLETE, WHO GOETH FORTH FROM THE
      FATHER, AND DERIVETH FROM THE SON, WE BELIEVE IN AND ADORE THE TRINITY, ONE GOD,
      THE FATHER, AND THE SON, AND THE HOLY SPIRIT."

Chapter 20 states:

      "From the middle of JERUSALEM, and from the north thereof to the south-east is the portion of the Emperor of
      RÔM; and from the middle of JERUSALEM from the north thereof to the south and to WESTERN INDIA is the
      portion of the Emperor of ETHIOPIA. For both of them are of the seed of SHEM, the son of NOAH, the seed of
      ABRAHAM, the seed of DAVID, the children of SOLOMON. For God gave the seed of SHEM glory because of the
      blessing of their father NOAH. The Emperor of RÔM is the son of SOLOMON, and the Emperor of ETHIOPIA
      is the firstborn and eldest son of SOLOMON."

Chapter 21 states:

      "And our Lord JESUS CHRIST, in condemning the Jewish people, the crucifiers, who lived at that time, spake,
      saying: "The Queen of the South shall rise up on the Day of Judgment and shall dispute with, and condemn, and
      overcome this generation who would not hearken unto p. 17 the preaching of My word, for she came from the ends
      of the earth to hear the wisdom of SOLOMON."1 And the Queen of the South of whom He spake was the Queen
      of ETHIOPIA."

On one of her visits to Solomon, she devoted her life to the God of Israel.

Chapter 28 says:

      "And the Queen said, "From this moment I will not worship the sun, but will worship the Creator of the sun, the
                                                                                        ETHIOPIAN INDEPENDENCE IN THE IMPERIAL AGE | 67

      God of ISRAEL. And that Tabernacle of the God of ISRAEL shall be unto me my Lady, and unto my seed after me,
      and unto all my kingdoms that are under my dominion. And because of this I have found favour before thee, and
      before the God of ISRAEL my Creator, Who hath brought me unto thee, and hath made me to hear thy voice, and
      hath shown me thy face, and hath made me to understand thy commandment." Then she returned to [her] house."

Chapter 32 explains the birth of her son, the son of Solomon, cementing Ethiopia's connection to Israel:

      "And the Queen departed and came into the country of BÂLÂ ZADÎSÂRYÂ nine months and five days after she
      had separated from King SOLOMON. And the pains of childbirth laid hold upon her, and she brought forth a man
      child, and she gave it to the nurse with great pride and delight. And she tarried until the days of her purification were
      ended, and then she came to her own country with great pomp and ceremony. And her officers who had remained
      there brought gifts to their mistress, and made obeisance to her, and did homage to her, and all the borders of the
      country rejoiced at her coming. Those who were nobles among them she arrayed in splendid apparel, and to some she
      gave gold and silver, and hyacinthine and purple robes; and she gave them all manner of things that could be desired.
      And she ordered her kingdom aright, and none disobeyed her command; for she loved wisdom and God strengthened
      her kingdom."

Chapter 117 describes Ethiopia's mission to destroy the Jews and then their divine status:

      "And they were to rise up to fight, to make war upon the enemies of God, the JEWS, and to destroy them, the King of
      RÔMÊ 'ÊNYÂ, and the King of ETHIOPIA PINAS (PHINEHAS); and they were to lay waste their lands, and to
      build churches there, and they were to cut to pieces JEWS at the end of this Cycle in p. 226 twelve cycles of the moon.
      Then the kingdom of the JEWS shall be made an end of...Thus hath God made for the King of ETHIOPIA more
      glory, and grace, and majesty than for all the other kings of the earth because of the greatness of ZION, the Tabernacle
      of the Law of God, the heavenly ZION. And may God make us to perform His spiritual good pleasure, and deliver us
      from His wrath, and make us to share His kingdom. Amen."

       advantage of the victory, but he never abuses it.' The underlying message is that the `beastly' and
       `barbarian' king is going to shame Europe (i.e., Italy), here represented by the helpless, naked woman
       clutched in his monster-like hands.

Edmund Burke (British statesman) quote, 1777:

      "Now the Great Map of Mankind is unrolled at once; and there is no state or Gradation of barbarism, and no mode
      of refinement which we have not at the same instant under our View. The very different Civility of Europe and of
      China; the barbarism of Persia and Abyssinia [Ethiopia], the erratic manners of Tartary, and of Arabia. The Savage
      state of North America, and of New Zealand."

       The image is an illustration of King Menelik II after victory over Italy in 1896. Menelik is dressed in
       rich, colorful garments set against a backdrop of mountains under a blue sky. The figure is shown in
       profile, facing left, wearing a golden crown with ornate detailing and a yellow robe with intricate
       patterns over a blue garment. A deep red cloak with golden trim drapes from his shoulders. The
       setting includes a stone wall, suggesting a terrace or a fortification. The landscape behind displays
       rugged mountains with hints of greenery, and a sky filled with fluffy clouds in soft pastel hues.

Activity: T-chart comparison of European and Ethiopian views. Ask students what Europeans prided themselves
on; what made them feel superior or like they had to go dominate other parts of the world? You might mention
"gold, glory, God" or "missionaries, militaries, and mercantilism". Correct answers should include that Europeans
thought they were culturally superior (religion, language, customs), that they needed certain resources to fuel their
new industrial economies, and thus needed militaries to facilitate acquisition of such resources from perceived
inferior peoples.

Prepare slides or handouts of each source to share with the class. Students should still work in groups of 3-4.
Provide the T-chart below to each student. Present sources one at a time. Ask students to record how Ethiopians
saw themselves using Ethiopian sources and how Europeans saw Ethiopians using European sources. Allow time
with each source for students to read, ask questions, discuss in groups, and make a chart entry.

If students do not have prior knowledge of European culture, it may be helpful to provide some for comparison.
Some points to include would be that Europe was predominantly Christian, whether Catholic, Protestant or
Orthodox. Teachers should recall the Treaty of Tordesillas, which stipulated that any lands in the Americas already
ruled by a Christian king could not be colonized. Of course, there were no Christian indigenous rulers, opening the
door for total colonization. Even during the Enlightenment, when traditional methods were being left behind for
more reasoned and practical ones, philosophers and agents of political change still called on God or a Supreme Being
to bear witness to their revolutions. The period of time during this lesson is after the Enlightenment, which means
ideas of equality are already widespread as well. It is post-colonial in that colonies in the Americas have earned their
freedom due to these Enlightenment principles; additionally, France has survived her revolution. This should serve
to highlight that Europe values Christianity, equality, and liberty-at least on paper. Europe is still concerned with
empire, though, and accumulating resources and wealth through colonies, protectorates, and spheres of influence.

Cold call or take volunteers to share what they noted: How did Ethiopians view themselves and their culture?
How did Europeans view them? Correct answers should include that Ethiopians saw themselves as Christians,
religiously similar to Europeans, the kings were referred to as "king of kings" indicating superiority, Ethiopians
also demonstrated antisemitic attitudes common in Europe, the Ethiopian leader identified as Black and called on
other Black people to unite. Europeans on the other hand saw Ethiopians (Abbyssinians) as barbaric, as disfigured,
perhaps Christian but not equally so, or in a similar vein to Native Americans as "noble savages".

Ask students to take 2-3 minutes to answer the last question on the T-chart (Table 6.2): Was there a significant
difference that would have inspired Europeans to act on the 3 Gs or 3 Ms of imperialism to invade Ethiopia?

King Menelik's letter to the caliph of the Sudan:

      This is to inform you that the Europeans who are present round the White Nile with the English have come out
      from both the east and the west, and intended to enter between my country and yours and to separate and divide us.
      And I, when I heard of their plan, dispatched an expedition, sending detachments in five directions. The group [of
      Europeans] who are near are the English and the French, who are located in the direction from which the Belgians
      came. And do you remember when I sent to you Kantiba Jiru, you wrote to me by him that you have men in the
      direction from which the Belgians came?; and I ordered the chiefs of [my] troops that if they met with them, they were
      to parley with them and explain [my] intention. And now I have ordered my troops to advance towards the White
      Nile. And perhaps [if] you heard the news from merchants or from others you might misunderstand my action, [so
      now] I have written to you so that you would understand the object [of this expedition]. And you look to yourself,
      and do not let the Europeans enter between us. Be strong, lest if the Europeans enter our midst a great disaster befall
      us and our children have no rest. And if one of the Europeans comes to you as a traveler, do your utmost to send him
      away in peace; and do not listen to rumors against me. All my intention is to increase my friendship with you, and that
      our countries may be protected from [their] enemies.

general) sought alliances with Ethiopia to check the spread of the Ottoman empire.

      "I, Victoria, Queen of England, hope your Majesty is in good health. I thank you for the kind reception which you
      have given to my Envoys, Mr. Rodd and Mr. Harrington. I wish your Majesty and the Empress Taitou all prosperity
      and success, and I hope that the friendship between our two Empires will constantly increase."

King Menelik's response:

      "I, Menelik II, king of kings of Ethiopia, say to our very honoured friend Victoria, Queen of the great English people,
      `May the Saviour of the World give you health! When the very beautiful and excellent phonograph (recording) of the
      Queen reached me by the hands of Monsieur Harrington and when I heard the voice of Your Majesty (as if) you were
      beside me, I listened with great pleasure. May God thank you for your good wishes for us and for my kingdom. May
      God give you long life and health and give your people peace and repose. I have spoken with M. Harrington concerning
      all issues between both our peoples. When he told me that he was now returning to England, I said to him that I would
      be pleased if he could settle all our affairs before coming back. And now, may the Queen receive him well. Furthermore,
      we have told M. Harrington about Matamma, how our great king is and many of our compatriots died there for their
      religious zeal. I have hopes that you will help us in having the English government recognize this city for us.May God help
      us that Ethiopia and England may remain in peace and friendship. Having said this, I extend my greetings of respect to
      your great people."

Queen Taytu's response:

      "I, Itege (Queen) Taitu, Light of Ethiopia, say to the very honoured Queen Victoria, the great Queen of the English...
      May God give you health. Your phonograph has reached me. With great pleasure I listened to you (as if) you were
      beside me. And now, since God has willed to bring my voice to the ear of the honoured Queen, I declare ... that God
      give you health and long life. May God keep you many years in good health."

King Menelik's letter to European heads of state explaining Ethiopia's borders, written to Britain, France, Germany,
Italy and Russia, 1891:

      Being desirous to make known to our friends the Powers (Sovereigns) of Europe the boundaries of Ethiopia, we have
      addressed also to you (your Majesty) the present letter.

      These are the boundaries of Ethiopia:-Starting from the Italian boundary of Arafale, which is situated on the sea, the line
      goes westward over the plain (Meda) of Gegra towards Mahio, Halai, Digsa, and Gura up to Adibaro. From Adibaro to
      the junction of the Rivers Mareb and Arated.

      From this point the line runs southward to the junction of the Atbara and Setit Rivers, where is situated the town known
      as Tomat.

      From Tomat the frontier embraces the Province of Gederef up to Karkoj on the Blue Nile. From Karkoj the line passes
      to the junction of the Sobat River with the White Nile. From thence the frontier follows the River Sobat including the
      country of Arbore, Gallas and reaches Samburu.

      Towards the east are included within the frontier the country of the Borana Gallas and Arussi country up to the limits of
      the Somalis, including also the Province of Ogaden.

      To the northward the line of the frontier includes the Habar Awal, the Gadabursi, and Essa Somalis , and reaches Ambos.

      Leaving Ambos the line includes Lake Assal, the province of our ancient vassal Mohamed Anfari, skirts the coast of the
      sea, and rejoins Arafale. While tracing today the actual boundaries of my Empire, I shall endeavour, if God gives me life
      and strength, to re-establish the ancient frontiers (tributaries) of Ethiopia up to Khartoum, and as Lake Nyanza with all
      the Gallas.
                                                                                         ETHIOPIAN INDEPENDENCE IN THE IMPERIAL AGE | 73

      Ethiopia has been for fourteen centuries a Christian island in a sea of pagans. If powers at a distance come forward to
      partition Africa between them, I do not intend to be an indifferent spectator.

      As the Almighty has protected Ethiopia up to this day, I have confidence He will continue to protect her, and increase her
      borders in the future . I am certain He will not suffer her to be divided among other Powers.

      Formerly the boundary of Ethiopia was the sea. Having lacked strength sufficient, and having received no help from
      Christian Powers, our frontier on the sea coast fell into the power of the Muslim-man.

      At present we do not intend to regain our sea frontier by force, but we trust that the Christian Power, guided by our
      Saviour, will restore to us our sea-coast line, at any rate, certain points on the coast.

      Written at Addis Ababa, the 14 th Mazir, 1883 (10th April, 1891).

Treaty of Wuchale, 1889. This treaty was signed with Italy. Italy used different language in the Amharic version
and the Italian version to trick the Ethiopians into a protectorate status. When King Menelik discovered this, he
abandoned the treaty and went to war with Italy, coming out victorious after the Battle of Adwa.

Article 17 in Amharic states: "his Majesty the King of Kings of Ethiopia can use the Government of His Majesty the
King of Italy for all treatments that did business with other powers or governments."

Article 17 in Italian states: "his Majesty the King of Kings of Ethiopia must use the Government of His Majesty the
King of Italy for all treatments that did business with other powers or governments."

It is important to note that Menelik was unique and revered for his ability to unite Ethiopians that resulted in a
victory over Italy (refer back to his call to arms in Question 2).

       Figure 6.7 Image Description
       In this typewritten translation, Emperor Menelik II writes in a letter to U.S. President Theodore
       Roosevelt that he hopes that the recently completed Treaty of Commerce between Ethiopia and the
       U.S. will establish good relations. He thanks President Roosevelt for the gifts that were sent to him
       and is sending President Roosevelt two lions and two elephant tusks as a sign of friendship.

Activity: Jigsaw. Keeping students in groups of 3-4, provide each student with ONE of the above sources. Allow
sufficient time for students to read or examine their source while considering the questions: Did Ethiopia have a
superior political and military situation from 1884-1914? How did their situation contend with Europe? How did
Ethiopia interact with other African nations? Students should record their ideas on the document shown in Table
6.3.

Once students have examined their own sources, ask them to share one at a time their responses with the rest of
their group. As group mates share, students should record their own response to the rest of the sources based on
their group mates' faithful reporting. If any sources are missing, discuss as a class.

Return to the quick write from the beginning of class and ask some follow up questions.

Was Ethiopia victorious in its pursuits? Was Europe victorious (specifically Italy in the case of Ethiopia)? What did
"victory" mean to each contender?

With Menelik's ability to unite the Ethiopians and defeat the Italians, does he have further obligation to Ethiopia
or other African nations under European control?

Ethiopia's Political and Military Position

Examine your assigned source while considering the following questions:

 1. Did Ethiopia have a superior political and military situation from 1884-1914?
 2. How did their situation contend with Europe?
 3. How did Ethiopia interact with other African nations?

Record your answer/reflection in the space that corresponds with your source.

When prompted, listen to your group mates and record a response for the remaining sources.

Summative Performance Task

To demonstrate their understanding of the essential question, students will choose from two options: a CEA
paragraph or a propaganda poster. It should be clear that the evidence used came from the sources provided in the
lesson.

CEA paragraph: Write a paragraph that begins with a CLAIM to respond to the essential question. Support your
claim with three pieces of EVIDENCE before providing an ANALYSIS of the evidence. This paragraph should be
at least 5-8 sentences long.

Propaganda poster: Create a thoughtful and colorful poster that illustrates a response to the essential question
using three pieces of evidence. This poster should be from an Ethiopian perspective, celebrating how they were able
to maintain independence from European domination.

Potential Civic Engagement

This lesson allows students to examine and consider different government and leadership types. Ethiopia was a
monarchy at the time, as were many of the oncoming European nations. If students have not already learned
about types of government, take time to teach them about democracy, theocracy, aristocracy, plutocracy, oligarchy,
communism, autocracy, and monarchy. Ask students to consider if one type of government is more suited to certain
situations-historical or contemporary.

Conclusion

The essential question was: How did Ethiopia manage to remain independent during the second wave of European
imperialism (1884-1914)? You may extend this lesson by asking students to find one additional source not used
in the lesson (for example, King Menelik II and the Pope corresponded, or the Treaty of Addis Ababa). The goal
78 | ETHIOPIAN INDEPENDENCE IN THE IMPERIAL AGE

of the lesson is not to provide students with a concrete, definitive answer. It is to provide them with sources to
analyze and draw their own conclusions-thus, there may be many answers. The important part is that students
explore this period of history so commonly presented through European sources instead through Ethiopian sources
and develop their own answer to the essential question. Rather than continue to focus on European domination,
turn the narrative on its head and present an African domination. This lesson should give students a chance to see
Black history through Black eyes and show Black agency, resistance and perseverance as well as historical contention
with the common narrative. Students should feel empowered to consider multiple perspectives and to look outside
of their familiar narrative to examine history.

HOLMES: A PIONEERING OREGON FAMILY

   Tabitha Richards

Introduction: Teaching Through Rather Than About

The Holmes family story is told through primary source documentation and interviews. By exploring these
documents students will form an understanding as to what happened to bring an enslaved family to Oregon in
a time of racial turmoil, when free Blacks and enslaved Blacks were not legally welcome in Oregon. Utilizing the
Court Records of Robin Holmes vs. Nathaniel Ford case, the Statesman Journal article "A Slave in Oregon Now
Living Free" and Mary Jane Holmes Shipley Drake's Certificate of Death students will explore a small part of
the lives of an Oregon family that came to this Country/Territory enslaved and fought for their freedom and
recognition as free Oregonians.

Framework

Concentrating upon Black Historical Consciousness Principles: 2. Black Agency, Resistance, and Perseverance,
from LaGarrett J. King's (2020) "Black History is Not American History: Toward a Framework of Black Historical
Consciousness" students will be able to answer the question "How do African Americans make social change?".

Pedagogical Applications

Students will use the Library of Congress Primary Source Analysis Tool to observe, reflect and question the words
of Robin Holmes through the court case, Mary Jane's story through her interview in the Statesman Journal article
from 1924, and Mary Jane's impression left by her Certificate of Death.

Lesson Narrative

In 1844 Robin (Robert) and Polly Holmes migrated to what would become the town of Rickreall in the county
of Polk in the state of Oregon, but at the time was known as Oregon Country. With them came three children:
Harriett, 7; Celi Ann, 5; and Mary Jane, 3; their other three children: Eliza, 13; Clarisa, 12; and William, 11 were
left in Missouri (Nokes, 2013, 8 & 22). Why would parents leave behind three children and undertake a 2000 mile,
7 month move by wagon train? Robin, Polly, and all six of their children were Black and enslaved, property owned
by the Ford family to be disposed of as any other property (McCarthy & Stanton, 2011, 56). Nathaniel Ford had
debts to settle before he could leave Missouri for the Oregon Country with his wife and six children. The three
oldest Holmes children along with another enslaved man, Harrison, were mortgaged as collateral to secure a loan
and never mentioned again in the Ford family history. But why? Why would Robin and Polly Holmes agree to move
away from their children? At this time in United States history, 1844, enslaved families were frequently separated by
the sale/trade of one or more family members for the financial benefit of those that owned them.

In 1844 Nathaniel Ford asked Robin and Polly Holmes to accompany him and his family to Oregon Country to
help set up a farm. Once the farm was running, Ford would free Robin, Polly, and their family as "Oregon was a free
country, that slavery did not exist there..." (Oregon Historical Society 1922, 117). The Holmes family agreed and
faced the daunting challenge of the overland move from Howard County, Missouri to Polk County, Oregon. Upon
arrival in Oregon Country Nathaniel Ford took his son, Mark and another enslaved man known only as Scott to
acquire land in what is today Rickreall, Oregon. The three men built three cabins, one for the Ford family, one for
the Holmes family, and one for Scott (Nokes, 2013, 27). The farm was established, and within one to two years was
profitable (McCarthy & Stanton 2011, 57). Ford did not grant Robin, Polly, and family freedom as he had agreed to
before they left Missouri until Holmes stood up for himself and his family and asked outright to be released. At this
point Ford told Holmes if he went to California to mine for gold with Ford's son Mark and the enslaved man Scott,
upon his return the Holmes family would be freed as agreed in Missouri. Also, Holmes would receive a share of the
gold procured in California. Mr. Holmes agreed to expedite the process and spent a year, spring of 1849 to spring of
1850, mining gold in California with Scott under the supervision of Mark Ford. When Mr. Holmes returned from
California, Ford freed Robin, Polly, and their infant son (who had been born while Robin was in California) but
refused to release Mary Jane, Roxanna and James from enslavement as he felt he was entitled to their services until
they were of legal age: 18 years of age for Mary Jane and Roxanna and 20 years of age for James (Oregon Historical
Society, 1922, 117-118).

During this time of individual migration and struggle for freedom the Oregon Country was becoming the Oregon
Territory. While determining the laws, the white population voted to prohibit slavery on July 5, 1843, followed by
the June 26, 1844 law that required slave owners to remove any of their enslaved persons from the Territory within
three years. In other words, Oregon did not want slavery, but they also did not want Blacks to reside here. Once
freed, formerly enslaved men had two years to leave and women had three years. If they did not leave within the
86 | HOLMES: A PIONEERING OREGON FAMILY

prescribed time frame they were to be lashed (whipped) until they did leave. This law was determined to be unduly
harsh and was changed to involuntary servitude until the person left the Territory.

On September 21, 1846 the Oregon Territorial Legislature enacted a new law that "it shall not be lawful for any
negro or mulatto to enter into, or reside." This law was repealed in 1854. When Oregon had its constitutional
convention in 1857 voters decided that Oregon would be a free state, but included in the Bill of Rights clause 18
that prohibited Blacks from residing, owning property, and making contracts in the newly formed state of Oregon
(Nokes, 2022a).

In April of 1852 Robin and Polly Holmes had enough. They wanted their children back in their own care. With
the assistance of attorney O.C. Pratt, they filed a Writ of Habeas Corpus with the District Court of Polk County to
have Nathaniel Ford return their children: Mary Jane Holmes, Roxanna Holmes and James Holmes. Ford did not
respond until April of 1853, citing that the children were born into enslavement and while there was no legal slavery
in Oregon, he would keep the children until they reached legal age. Ford maintained that Mr. Holmes had agreed
to this arrangement; Mr. Holmes insisted he never agreed to such. Mr. Holmes made statement after statement
that Ford had agreed to free the whole family once they arrived in Oregon and the Ford farm was established,
and that Ford had no right to keep the children nor any entitlement to their services. The case proceeded to The
Supreme Court of the Territory of Oregon in Portland, attorney A.G.P. Wood represented Holmes. Robin Holmes
continued to speak for himself and his family through court documents insisting Ford was illegally holding his
children and not allowing himself nor Polly to see the children. Holmes had a rational fear that Ford would take the
children back to Missouri and sell them into lifelong enslavement jeopardizing their life, liberty, and happiness. In
June of 1853 he requested that custody of the children be remanded to the custody of the sheriff of Polk County so
that they could not be removed from the Oregon Territory.

Attorneys changed, judges changed (three refused to rule on the case). Robin and Polly Holmes stood steadfast,
fighting for the right to raise their own children. Finally, on July 13, 1853 George H. Williams, the new chief justice
of the Oregon Territorial Supreme Court ruled that Nathaniel Ford must return the Holmes children to their
parents. Williams said that the case "was the last effort made to hold slaves in Oregon by force of law." With the
return of Roxanna and James, Mary Jane stayed with the Fords, the Holmes family moved to Salem in Marion
County and opened a plant nursery that was successful (Nokes, 2022b).

Whatever the reasons may have been, there is no definitive proof as to why Mary Jane stayed with the Fords until
1857, when she married Reuben Shipley (Ficklin) a former enslaved man who owned a farm in Benton County
in modern day Philomath, Oregon. Reuben was forced to purchase his bride from Ford for $400-800 (Horner,
1924). Mary Jane and Reuben raised six children on their farm; Wallace, Ella, Thomas, Martha, Nellie, and Edward.
According to Mary Jane in the Horner (1924) interview her family was highly respected, her children played and
were educated with white children, and the family was invited to gatherings at the homes of community members,
both white and black. Reuben passed away in 1872 and Mary Jane remarried in 1875 to Alfred Drake, who passed
away four months after they were wed. Mary Jane stayed on at the farm in Benton County until she sold it in 1889
and moved to Portland to live with her youngest son Edward Ficklin (Shipley) (Nokes, 2013, 159-163).

Mary Jane Holmes Shipley Drake passed away in Portland, Oregon on January 26, 1925. According to her
Certificate of Death she was 101 years old, having been born in Pike County Missouri on November 29, 1823 (State
Archives). Mary Jane is buried in the Mt. Union Cemetery in modern day Philomath, Oregon. A cemetery exists
because Reuben and Mary Jane donated three acres of land for an integrated cemetery (Nokes, 2013, 163). Like her

parents before her, Mary Jane Holmes Shipley Drake never had a formal education, her story is oral, written down
and recollected by those whose lives she touched.

Overview and Description of the Essential Question

Changes in the U.S. during the 19th century opened the door to opportunity for many Americans. How did Black
Americans make their own opportunities and open their own doors?

Students will utilize Primary Sources, a newspaper article and the Library of Congress analysis forms to answer this
family based on the history of one Oregon family.

Time needed: three - four 45 minute class periods

Staging the Question

Discuss what is opportunity and equality. Employing the primary sources focus on a Black family accessing legal
assistance during the mid- 19th century and how far that support truly went.

Question 1, Formative Task 1, Featured Sources

How did Robin Holmes stand-up for himself and his family?

  · Using the Primary Source Analyzing form, students will scrutinize the "Robin Holmes vs. Nathaniel Ford"
      court documents from Polk County and Oregon Territorial Supreme Court.

  · Library of Congress Primary Source Analysis Sheet (pdf)
  · Library of Congress Teacher's Guide to to Analyzing Primary Sources (pdf)
  · "Robin Holmes vs. Nathaniel Ford" The Quarterly of the Oregon Historical Society, 1922. (page 162-188 on

      the scroll bar in the linked resource) https://open.library.ubc.ca/viewer/bcbooks/1.0340551#p161z-5r0f
  · Answers should follow how a Black man accused a white man of wrongdoing in District court and how the

      case eventually ended up at the State Supreme Court.

Question 2, Formative Task 2, Featured Sources

How was Mary Jane Holmes Shipley able to gain her freedom? What did she do with that freedom?

  · Appendix A: Horner, J. B., "A Slave in Oregon Now Living Free (pdf)" from the Oregon Statesman.

      https://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn85042470/1924-02-10/ed-1/seq-15.pdf.
  · Answers should discuss how Reuben Shipley had to pay for his wife's freedom. Became a respected member

      of her community along with her husband, raised six children and gave back to the community by donating
      land for the Mt. Union Cemetery in modern Philomath, Oregon.

Question 3, Formative Task 3, Featured Sources

What does her Certificate of Death tell us about Mary Jane Drake's past? Is the Certificate accurate?
88 | HOLMES: A PIONEERING OREGON FAMILY

  · Using the Primary Source Analysis form students will examine the Oregon State Board of Health, Certificate
      of Death for Mary Jane Drake.

  · Library of Congress Primary Source Analysis Sheet (pdf)
  · Library of Congress Teacher's Guide to to Analyzing Primary Sources (pdf)
  · Appendix B: Oregon Death Certificate of Mary Jane Holmes Shipley Drake. [https://sos.oregon.gov/

  · Answers should include: place of death, name, personal and statistical particulars, date of death. Is it

      accurate: note place and date of birth, father's name, mother's name.

Summative Performance Task

Appendix C: Create a "One-Pager" using the assignment/rubric document (docx)

  · A One-Pager is a creative response to your learning experience. It allows you to respond imaginatively, while
      being brief and concise in making connections between words, images, and thoughts. We think about what
      we see and read differently when we are asked to do something with what we have seen or read. We learn best
      when we create our own ideas. Your personal thinking about what you have experienced should be
      understood by the audience that views the One-Pager.

Potential Civic Engagement

Understand-Research underrepresented Black contributions in your community, begin at your local Historical
Society (with or for your students), search the archives for information/newspaper articles referencing Black
community members whom you may have never heard. Assess-Examine the benefits of knowing more about these
underrepresented members of our society. Act-Share this information with your community through classroom,
school wide or community presentations, partner with the Oregon Black Pioneers or Equal Justice Initiative to help
your community embrace the lives of those that have been obscured because they are Black.

Conclusion

Student investigation of primary sources relating to underrepresented Black members of our communities both
past and present will empower them to look at the world through less of a "them and us" lens and encourage our
students to view our communities as one. By creating a One-Pager as the summative performance task students
will better remember and relate what their investigation has shown them, as well as think more critically about this
information.

 HOW DID BLACK AMERICANS IN MAXVILLE
 EXPERIENCE JOY IN AN EXCLUSIONARY
 OREGON

    Nick Tayer

 Introduction: Teaching Through Rather Than About

  Section 35, Article 1 of the Constitution of the state of Oregon reads as follows:

        No free Negro, or Mulatto, not residing in this state at the time of the adoption of this constitution, shall come, reside,
        or be within this state, or hold any real estate, or make any contracts, or maintain any suit therein; an the Legislative
        Assembly shall provide by penal laws, for the removal, by public officers, of all such Negroes, and Mulattos, and for their
        effectual exclusion from the state, and for the punishment of persons who shall bring them into the state, or employ, or
        harbor them."1

  This provision of the Constitution would not be rescinded until 1926 and yet between the adoption of this
  Constitution in 1857 and the repeal of that section in 1926 Black Americans would reside, work, and raise their
  children in Oregon. Maxville2 was a segregated logging town founded three years prior to the amendment to the
  Oregon Constitution to allow for Black Americans to reside in the state. The lives and identities of those who
  came to Maxville broke away from common conceptions of Black American life. By studying it we get a sliver of
  a vision of what life was like for Black Americans in the rural West during the Great Migration (specifically 1923
  - 1943). We also see how a place once forgotten, today a ghost town, can contribute to our conception of race in
  the West. Instead of industrial workers in cities or sharecroppers in the South in Maxville Black Americans were
  loggers and pioneers. Their isolation nestled among the lush forests of the Wallowa Valley in northeastern Oregon
  gave them a measure of freedom unknown to them in Arkansas and Louisiana, where most of them migrated from.
  Yet there was also a commonality to their experience in the South, segregation was the law in Maxville and the Ku
  Klux Klan was a political force in Oregon. In fact it was their support, which likely helped Oregon's then governor,
  Walter M. Pierce, win the 1922 gubernatorial election. The nearby regional hub, LaGrande, was also a hub of Klan
  activity. Despite these similarities Pearl Alice Marsh, a professor of Political Science at the University of California
  - Berkeley, who was born in Maxville and grew up in nearby Wallowa would title her history of Maxville life "But

  Not Jim Crow". It would be this tension between oppression and agency that would define Maxville life as dozens
  of Black American families would come to call it home throughout the 1920s, 30s, and 40s.

 Framework

  The notable historian and cofounder of the Annales school of history Marc Bloch once wrote, "When all is said
  and done, a single word, "understanding", is the beacon of light in our studies."3 If understanding is the historian's
  goal then the historian must occasionally seek guidance from others in order to gain this understanding. For our
  study of Maxville we will be adopting LaGarrett King's Black Historical Consciousness approach to history. King
  is a professor of Black American studies at the University of Buffalo and developed this framework to specifically
  address shortcomings in the study of Black American history. Specifically his view that Black American history
  was either focused solely on oppression without reference to achievement or that Black American history was
  amalgamated into whiggish narratives of the United States national history with Black Americans placed on the
  periphery rather than at the center of that narrative. It is founded upon breaking the Black American experience
  down into six themes; power and oppression, agency, resistance, and perseverance, the African diaspora, joy,
  identities, and contention.4 Studying each of these themes of Black American history has value in understanding
  the place and experiences of Black Americans in the history of the American West. However, when considering
  the experiences of the Black Americans who came to Maxville we will focus on two of these six themes. Black
  Agency, Resistance, and Perseverance, Oregon being a state founded upon the exclusion of Black Americans is
  but one example of the use of power to oppress Black Americans in the West. Also present in Eastern Oregon at
  this time was a resurgent Klu Klux Klan. How these factors impacted Black Americans in Maxville and how they
  resisted and preserved in the face of that oppression is the first theme that studying Maxville allows us to explore.
  Black Joy is another theme of Black American life which studying Maxville allows us to explore. Maxville had a
  company baseball team which unlike its Southern counterparts was allowed to play integrated when playing away
  from Maxville and was allowed to play against White teams. This is just one example of ways in which the Black
  Americans of Maxville found joy and pride in their daily existences that we will investigate. Before we explore these
  themes and how they played out in Maxville we must first understand why Maxville came to exist at all.

 Pedagogical Applications

  When we teach about history we have a content goal, when we teach through history we have a thinking goal,
  and this lesson is built around a thinking goal. The objective for students in this inquiry lesson is to be able to

4. LaGarrett King, "Black History Is Not American History: Toward a Framework of Black Historical Consciousness," Social Education 84, no. 6
  (2020): pp. 335-341, 339.King defined these themes as follows; Power and oppression: "Power and oppression as Black histories are narratives
  that highlight the lack of justice, freedom, equality, and equity of Black people experienced throughout history." Black Agency, Resistance, and
  Perseverance: "Black agency, resistance, and perseverance are Black histories that explain that although Black people have been victimized, they
  were not helpless victims." Africa and the African Diaspora: "Africa and the African Diaspora as Black histories stress that narratives of Black
  people should be contextualized within the African Diaspora." Black joy: "Black joy narratives are narratives of Black histories that focus on Black
  people's resolve during oppressive history." Black identities: "Understanding Black identities as Black histories promotes a more inclusive history
  that seeks to uncover the multiple identities of Black people through Black history." Black Historical Contention: "Black historical contention is
  the recognition that all Black histories are not positive. Black histories are complex and histories that are difficult should not be ignored."

think about what joy is and how the circumstances beyond our control may limit our access to joy but struggles
to eliminate it completely. Teaching through history rather than about it is also about accessing and using sources,
both primary and secondary. This lesson relies on three sources; the Oregon Constitution, Pearl Alice Marsh's "But
Not Jim Crow: Family Memories of African American Loggers of Maxville, Oregon", and the Maxville Heritage
Interpretive Center which was founded and directed by Gwen Trice. Marsh and Trice are Black American women
who are the descendants of loggers of Maxville, who were born and raised in nearby Wallowa shortly after the
Maxville logging operation shut down. Both have engaged in extensive interviews with the surviving workers of
Maxville to give us insight into what life was like for those living there.

Lesson Narrative

Overview and Description of the Essential Question

In this lesson, students will examine and analyze the perspectives and contributions of Black Americans in the
community of Maxville, Oregon. Specifically, students will explore how that community experienced joy in an
Oregon that legally prohibited their existence. Students will examine several primary sources from the Maxville
Heritage Interpretive Center as well as a historical essay and the Oregon Constitution.

Staging the Question

Procedure

 1. Read the passage from the Oregon State Constitution: Section 35, Article 1
 2. Have students identify key words from the passage.

          Example response: free Negro, Mulatto, residing, adoption, constitution, state, real estate, contracts,
            maintain, suit, Legislative Assembly, penal laws, removal, public officers, exclusion, punishment, bring,
            employ, harbor

 3. Have students utilize those words to create a sentence that summarizes the passage.

          Example response: The constitution stated that no free Negro or Mulatto, who was not residing in the
            state at the time of its adoption, could come to reside, hold real estate, make contracts, maintain suits, or
            even be within the state; and the Legislative Assembly had the power to pass penal laws for their removal
            and exclusion from the state, as well as punish those who brought them into the state, employed or
            harbored them.

 4. Have students summarize the passage in their own words.

          Example response: The law says that African Americans who weren't living in this state before the
            constitution was made can't live here, buy property or make any agreements. The government will use
            the police to kick out black people who are here illegally and punish those who bring them here.

 Analyzing the essay: Resistance to oppression in Maxville

          Although Maxville sprang forth from the forest it was not born with a blank slate. Wallowa county
          had a well established history of exclusion of all non-whites from its founding. Maxville itself sat
          along the seasonal rounds of the Wallowa band of the Nez Perce Indians. That band had been
          forcibly relocated to Idaho after confusion over the geography of a reservation in the area combined
          with local pressure led to that reservation being terminated and resulted in Chief Joseph leading that
          band on its attempted escape to Canada.5 This had "opened" the county to settlement and led to its

5. Marsh, 11.
                              HOW DID BLACK AMERICANS IN MAXVILLE EXPERIENCE JOY IN AN EXCLUSIONARY OREGON | 99

          becoming a county in its own right separate from nearby Union county. This was not the end of
          violent exclusion in the area. In 1887 a local criminal gang massacred thirty-four Chinese miners near
          Deep Creek in Hells Canyon with the express intent of ensuring that any gold found in the area
          would be possessed by Whites.6 Beyond that history Wallowa county was also party to the rising
          tide of racism in the United States which followed World War I.
          Long before the arrival of Maxville and its Black American loggers Wallowa county newspapers had
          been republishing racist cartoons and articles from around the country. Marsh found an 1895 article
          that decried the, "flood of negro talk that has discolored recent literature" with later articles
          advertising minstrel shows or including jokes made at the expense of the country's Black American
          population.7 To give one an idea of how opposed to the introduction of Black Americans to the
          county residents were believed to be when Henry Ashby the foreman of the logging operation at
          Maxville went to greet his incoming Black American workers with armed guards for fear of a
          possible attack by the local Klu Klux Klan.8 Given such examples of the prevailing attitudes of the
          area that such an incident was avoided is remarkable.
          That Ashby was willing to place his life on the line was not a singular occurrence but nor did it mean
          that he and the community had shed all of its institutions of oppression that it had inherited from
          the South. "Bowman Hicks drew racial lines and housing and education out of its own tradition as a
          Southern town and perhaps to appease some Southern white workers living in Maxville."9 This
          appeasement took the form of segregated schools, segregated housing, segregated baseball teams,
          and preferential housing for White workers. That preference extended specifically to whether or not
          one got an actual house at all. White workers and their families had houses and cabins built for
          them. Black American families and the few Greek immigrants and their families in Maxville were
          assigned to railcars repurposed as housing. This is at a place where snow is commonly measured in
          feet rather than inches during the winter, where the rains of spring last past the 4th of July and cool
          autumn winds begin to blow in early September. However, there were also some accommodations
          made to the realities of this new life that lead to some integration.

           Most apparent to the workers was the willingness of their White colleagues to oppose the local Klan
           and support the right to live and work in Oregon. Relations with the Klan were tense, not only did
           Ashby meet each group of Black American migrants to Maxville with an armed guard out of fear of
           an attack but armed guards were also utilized initially to protect workers in the forest.10 Even with
           such precautions, worry over what the Klan might do pervaded operations at Maxville until the
           potential conflict came to a head. Alan Dale Victor a White resident of Maxville related the following
           story in an interview with Gwen Trice of the Maxville Heritage Interpretive Center:
           Well, it would probably be about the middle `20s-a group of Klu Klux Klan members with their
           hoods on showed up at Maxville. MacMillan, who was the superintendent, and Jim Criley, who was
           the woods boss, they told them to get the hell out of Maxville. They said, don't you people ever
           come back. Jim Criley (sp?) says, maybe you guys have a mask to fool us, but he said, I know who
           you are. He said I don't ever want to see your face around here again.11
           This ended the threat of the Klan but it didn't mean a complete end to conflict. Although housing,
           education, and baseball were segregated nearly everything else was integrated. As a result workers
           shopped together, played together, and often worshiped together. "Bonds between black-and-
           white loggers were forced for practical reasons integrated labor processes of the timber enterprise in
           the woods and the danger of the work meant they depended on one another for their safety."12
           Eventually even the baseball team was integrated for the purpose of playing other teams in the
           region but there was one line which could never be crossed. "While the family's experienced new
           personal liberty there were still social realities of racism in the schools physically segregated housing
           and little tolerance for interracial romantic relationships."13 Oregon followed the South and much of
           the rest of the nation in outlawing marriages between Whites and Black Americans. Ester Wilfong
           recounted her brother's dating experiences, "these were the girls who had to live in that town
           where they weren't willing to run the risk of social ostracism by their parents or that their parents

           would be socially ostracized."14 Not only might one be ostracized but also one risked outright
           violence. Joseph Hillard Jr. is recounted by Marsh as having one incident in which that threat of
           violence was made explicit:
           A friend had been dating a local white girl and not doing a good enough job of covering his tracks.
           When her mother found out she was dating this black kid named junior, she did some sleuthing and
           determined incorrectly that I was the culprit. So she called dad and told him he would find me
           hanging in a tree if I didn't stop dating her daughter.15
           This wasn't the only threat, dances often became a focal point of potential violence as young men
           would seek out companionship but as a result of these threats most such men dated women from
           Pendleton or Walla Walla or left Eastern Oregon to find their significant others. The young women
           had similar frustrations and sought similar remedies. Across the thirty years there would be only one
           instance where an interracial relationship resulted in marriage, and that required the happy couple to
           travel to Washington state to circumvent Oregon law prohibiting such a marriage. Over time this
           resulted in more and more families moving away from Maxville, usually to either nearby LaGrande or
           to Portland, in search of greater connection with the Black American community.

    Example Responses

     Critical thinking question 1: What is the major claim being made by the author of this essay?
     Maxville, a logging town in Oregon, was founded in a region with a history of exclusion and racism

         2. a local criminal gang massacred thirty-four Chinese miners
         3. the foreman of the logging operation at Maxville went to greet his incoming Black American
             workers with armed guards for fear of a possible attack by the local Klu Klux Klan
        4. segregated schools, segregated housing, segregated baseball teams, and preferential housing for
             White workers
         5. little tolerance for interracial romantic relationships

     Does the claim that is being presented appear to be fact based or opinion based?
     Fact based: each piece of evidence is either sourced from historians or from eye witness accounts.

     Critical thinking question 2: What is the "feel" or attitude of the essay?
     The attitude of the essay is one of informed neutrality.

     Give evidence of the "feel" or attitude taken from this essay:
         1. "Bonds between black-and-white loggers were forced for practical reasons. Integrated labor
             processes of the timber enterprise in the woods and the danger of the work meant they
             depended on one another for their safety."
         2. While the family's experienced new personal liberty there were still social realities of racism in the
             schools' physically segregated housing and little tolerance for interracial romantic relationships."

     How does this affect the essay's effectiveness?
     It weighs the scales towards oppression being the dominant force in their lives.

     Critical thinking question 3: What are the most convincing or thought-provoking parts of the
     essay?
     The balance between willingness to allow them to live their own lives with the unwillingness to fully
     integrate. Colleagues were fine, maybe even friendships, but the essay draws a clear line at romance.

       Figure 8.1 Image Description
       The image shows a black and white photograph of eight individuals. In the foreground, seven
       children of varying ages stand on a small wooden step in front of a wooden structure, possibly a
       house. They are dressed in a mix of overalls, dresses, and sweaters, typical of early to mid-20th
       century rural attire. The children are positioned in two rows, with the tallest in the back. Behind
       them, an adult woman stands, wearing a light-colored blouse. Behind them appears to be the
       exterior of a small, log school house.

      Interview with Bob Chrisman

       The only thing that I know is, again, definitely second hand from my father and my uncle Verd Baird
       that had Baird's Tavern down here. I guess nobody could beat them. They had the best baseball
       team in the whole area. Big Amos was just an amazing athlete. I guess he was just something else.
       I can remember looking at that guy-my gosh, he was just a perfect person when it came physically,
       just this big, strong man. I guess he ran fast. My uncle Verd, he played a lot of baseball. They had
       the town team, baseball teams and whatever. He said, ah, we quit playing them-they just beat us
       so bad. I do know they won about every game they ever played. But that's all I really know about
       that.

       Well, we would embroidery and like that. Mostly, we had something to do we would bring over,
       and we would read the Bible. Most all of us--some of us knitted. I did embroidery work. We did
       little things, you know, like that together. But, other than that, and you see we would have what
       we called our little church, because we didn't go to--there was no church or nothing. No church
       there and everything, and so I really don't remember at all going to church in Wallowa. We just--we
       had a little church there, reading the Bible certain days and we called it our Bible week and like that
       and Sunday ourselves.

      Interview with Ester Wilfong Jr. Part 1

       In looking at Wallowa, that's where most of the minority folks who were in the area lived. It was
116 | HOW DID BLACK AMERICANS IN MAXVILLE EXPERIENCE JOY IN AN EXCLUSIONARY OREGON

       because of the work that they were doing as being hired to work in that area. So dad was out in the
       woods felling trees and would come home on the weekends to be with the family. I got to the town
       of Promise, that I remember, early while we were there. Being a child, you don't look at things as
       adults do. You don't see as much as adults do, so you would pass over some things. But I did
       remember myself and my parents and Joe Patterson, Jr. and his wife, Helen. We went up to Promise
       to some function, and while there, there was a dance going on. We just sat and watched the people
       dancing-a different kind of dancing that what Joe and Helen had done-but they did get up and do a
       little number or two, but it all went well. Then that's my biggest thing-I remember except going up
       there once again when Bob Baggett, who was African American and lived there, and he was sort of
       overseer-somewhat of part of the area-I am not sure, but anyway we went up there to visit with
       him and his wife, Lillian...

     Patterson Jr., Helen, function, dance, different kind of dancing, Bob Baggett, African American, overseer,
     visit, Lillian.

     Summary:
     While living in Wallowa, my dad worked in the woods felling trees and would come home on the
     weekends to be with our family; as a child, I remember going up to Promise with my parents, Joe
     Patterson Jr. and his wife, Helen, for a function where we watched a different kind of dancing and later
     visited Bob Baggett, an African American overseer, and his wife, Lillian.

     In your own words:

      Interview with Ester Wilfong Jr., Part 2

       Oh, there was no dating. This was way back then. If it was dating, it was on the side, that nobody
       knew about, and the after hours kinds of thing that you have to sneak around to do because those
       were the white girls-there weren't that many African American girls there. Most of them were
       younger than I, so there wasn't any dating to speak of. There were things that happened, but they
       weren't the things that came out in the open. And that might be one of the reasons why that we
       got along because we were not dating the white girls. I would go to the dances and dance, but Bob
       and Jim-they were ahead of me both, and they didn't go to the dances. Once we got to college, I
       went to the dances there and I did some dating in college, but not in high school because these were
       the girls who had to live in that town where they weren't willing to run the risk of social ostracism
       by their parents or that their parents would be socially ostracized...

    Example Response

     Key Words:
     dating, white girls, African American girls, after hours, sneak around, younger, things happened, social
     ostracism, college, dances

     Summary:
     Most African American boys in the town refrained from dating white girls due to social ostracism and
     the limited availability of African American girls in the area

     In your own words:
     The passage describes how dating was not common in the speaker's high school due to the limited
     number of African American girls and societal pressures. The speaker and their friends did not date
118 | HOW DID BLACK AMERICANS IN MAXVILLE EXPERIENCE JOY IN AN EXCLUSIONARY OREGON

     white girls and engaged in after-hours activities that were kept secret. The speaker did attend dances
     but did not date until college. The lack of dating in high school may have contributed to their strong
     friendships.

      Interview with Ester Wilfong Jr., Part 3

       The men who worked in the woods in Wallowa, a number of them lived in Maxville. Some of the
       families lived there in Wallowa, and dad had wanted us to live in La Grande where he thought there
       was a better schooling there that I could receive. So, he would come home on the weekends. That's
       the time that I would see my father more. I didn't see him during the week except in the wintertime
       when it was too cold to go out into the woods. So the experiences that we had were not so much
       dad and son. He loved to hunt, but I didn't go hunting with him that much because he didn't get a
       chance to hunt that much himself. I did go out a few times, but shooting a deer might be fine for
       him but I didn't want to kill a deer. I have always said if you gave those deer a rifle and they could
       shoot back, there wouldn't be as many hunters out there. But that's factitious. No, I was really not
       a hunter, although I could shoot a rifle fairly well.

    Example Response

     Key Words:
     Wallowa, Maxville, La Grande, schooling, father, weekends, hunting, experiences, son, deer, rifle.

     Summary:
                              HOW DID BLACK AMERICANS IN MAXVILLE EXPERIENCE JOY IN AN EXCLUSIONARY OREGON | 119

         Dad worked in the woods in Wallowa and would come home on the weekends, but since it was too cold
         to work during the winter, I didn't get to see him as often except when we went hunting together.

         In your own words:
         The passage describes the relationship between a father and son who lived apart during the week
         because of the father's work in the woods. The father wanted his son to receive a better education in La
         Grande, so he would come home on weekends. Despite the father's love for hunting, the son did not
         share his enthusiasm for killing animals.

  Optional Summative Performance Task

   Students will compose a 500 word essay or project of equivalent rigor answering the question, "How did Black

  Conclusion

   By the end of World War II Maxville had ceased to exist as a town. Some of its residents had moved to nearby
   Wallowa or LaGrande. Many of the Black American logging families traded in their saws for welders at the Kaiser
   Shipyard in Portland joining a great influx of Black Americans to the city that would increase their population
   from just under two thousand, in the twenties, thirties, and forties to over nine thousand by 1950.16 Nearly eight
   thousand of whom were employed by those shipyards alone.17 In this sense Maxville was merely a waypoint on
   those families' migration from the South similar to how Portland would be a waypoint for over half of the twenty
   thousand Black Americans who came to work there during World War II but moved on after the war.18 Many of the
   houses in Maxville were moved to Wallowa where they provided housing for workers at the new lumber mill there.
   Maxville was neither the first, nor the largest segregated community in Oregon. It was however an unusual presence
   in the state's northeast corner where the Klu Klux Klan dominated local politics and its largest community had a
   sundown law on the books prohibiting Black Americans from staying within city limits after dark. It wasn't unique

in its experience of oppression but it also didn't fit the norms of the era in that integration came long before the
courts or legislation required it. It was a place of hard work, fears, and joys. By looking at it through the framework
of a Black Historical Consciousness we have been able to focus on both oppression and joy in the lives of those
who came to Maxville. With that we have been able to understand how they were able to exist in a place whose
laws said upon their arrival that they were not allowed to be there. How despite that limitation, and the limitations
of the racism endemic to that time and place, were able to persevere in the face of such oppression. How that
perseverance allowed them to resist the bleakness such an existence might have had and instead find joy in their lives.
In Maxville they were segregated, and faced threats of lynching, but were never lynched. They raised families and
played baseball. They enjoyed plentiful fish and game that the forests they worked in provided. Then they took what
meager wealth the rigor and danger of logging had afforded them and moved on to places that would afford their
children the opportunity to raise families of their own.

THE FIGHT FOR THE VOTE FROM JIM CROW
TO THE PRESENT

   Murray Carlisle

Introduction

The United States prides itself on being a beacon of democracy, however, many Americans have struggled to gain
the right to vote throughout American history. African Americans are one of the groups of American citizens who
have struggled to gain the right to vote. That story will be told through a series of primary documents that will
require students to confront America's racist past and its problematic present. Students will examine an Alabama
literacy test from the 1960s, a legal affidavit of African Americans denied the chance to register to vote and a
document that explores the nonviolent direct action tactics that were prevalent during the Black freedom struggle
of the 1960s.

Framework

Concentrating upon Black Historical Consciousness Principles: 2. Black Agency, Resistance, and Perseverance,
from LaGarrett J. King's (2020) "Black History is Not American History: Toward a Framework of Black Historical
Consciousness" students will be able to answer the question "How do African Americans make social change?".

Pedagogical Applications

Students will use a variety of primary documents to develop an understanding of the struggle for African Americans
to attain full suffrage rights in the United States. Students will examine the following primary documents: a literacy
test from the state of Alabama for white and Black applicants, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, interviews with Black
Southerners who attempted to register to vote and excerpts from the 2012 Supreme Court decision, Shelby County
vs. Holder.

Lesson Narrative

E Pluribus Unum: "Out of many, one", has been the motto of the United States since 1782. Americans are a diverse
people, made up of different genders, races, socioeconomic classes and beliefs. The United States has struggled at
various times to live up to its national motto along with America's stated belief that all men are created equal. One
of the defining struggles of American history has been over suffrage. Indigenous people, women, young people and
African Americans have all fought for the right to vote. This curriculum chapter will examine the struggle faced by
African Americans in the Jim Crow era and beyond for the right to vote.

The first group of enslaved Africans landed on the shores of the United States in 1619. The arrival of enslaved
Africans placed the United States on a path towards civil war. After the Civil War ended in 1865, nearly four million
formerly enslaved people found themselves emancipated thanks to the 13th Amendment. For 12 years, the country
would undergo a period called Reconstruction. During this period the Constitution was amended twice more with
the addition of the 14th and 15th Amendments. The 15th Amendment granted Black men the right of suffrage and
transformed the former Confederacy. Nearly 2000 Black men held an elected office across the federal, state and local
level. According to historian Eric Foner, South Carolina was the only state to have a Black majority in its legislature
during Reconstruction and also saw two Black lieutenant governors during this period.
126 | THE FIGHT FOR THE VOTE FROM JIM CROW TO THE PRESENT

Sadly, Reconstruction was cut short and ended after just only 12 years in 1877 after a contested presidential
election. Famed attorney and founder of the Equal Justice Initiative, Bryan Stevenson called the historical era that
was ushered into existence after the collapse of Reconstruction as "Deconstruction". That's because the political,
social and economic advances gained by freed men and women were decimated after the return of white political
rule to the South. The Jim Crow era brought about a strict regime of racial apartheid, loss of political rights and
racial terrorism across the former Confederacy. Southern states passed laws and revised their state constitutions in
order to disenfranchise Black voters. New restrictions like the grandfather clause, poll taxes, white primaries and
literacy tests made registering to vote almost impossible across the South.

These restrictive and overtly racist voting policies led to almost complete disenfranchisement of Black voters across
the South. For example, in some counties in Alabama there was not a single Black citizen registered to vote.
Attempts to register to vote were ultimately met with failure as white county registrars carried out nearly impossible
to pass literacy tests. In some cases, if a Black citizen was able to register to vote their full name and address were
published in the local newspaper for weeks at a time. This often led to acts of violence carried out against them or
loss of employment.

The curriculum presented in this chapter uses primary documents to shed light on the struggle faced by Black
citizens to register to vote as well as their efforts to fight against this racial oppression. The goal of this curriculum
on the fight for Black voting rights is to teach through Black history rather than about Black history. Primary
documents are an excellent tool to achieve that objective.

Overview and Description of the Essential Question

In What Ways Have States Limited the Right to Vote?

  · Students will read and analyze an Alabama literacy test, legal affidavits of Black citizens in Georgia who
      attempted to register to vote, and a field report from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in
      Selma, Alabama.

  · Time needed: One-two 87 minute class periods.

Staging the Question

Discuss with students the significance of voting in the United States. Ask students what groups of Americans have
faced difficulties in gaining suffrage rights throughout American history. Review with students the struggle African
Americans have encountered in order to vote in the United States. Ask students about the barriers that states erected
to prevent Black suffrage.

Question 1, Formative Task 1, Featured Sources

Students will read and analyze an Alabama literacy test from the 1960s. Students will answer guiding questions that
are found on the primary document. Alabama literacy test.

 1. What person in Alabama was probably given section 20 of the state constitution?
      Answer: A white applicant

 2. Why was this person given this section of the constitution?
      Answer: To make it easier for the white applicant with limited literacy skills to satisfy the requirements of the
      literacy test.
                                                                       THE FIGHT FOR THE VOTE FROM JIM CROW TO THE PRESENT | 127

 3. What person in Alabama was probably given section 260 of the state constitution?
      Answer: A Black applicant.

 4. Why was this person given this section of the constitution?
      Answer: To make it difficult for the Black applicant to satisfy the requirements of the literacy test.

Question 2, Formative Task 2, Featured Sources

Students will read and analyze legal affidavits from two Black citizens in Lee County Georgia who attempted to
register to vote. The affidavits were taken by a SNCC volunteer. Students will answer guiding questions found on
the primary document.

Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. Fact sheet, Alabama events Jan 17 - Feb 4,
1965 [https://www.crmvet.org/docs/63 sncc ga affidavits-lr.pdf]

 1. What difficulty did these applicants face when attempting to register to vote in Lee County Alabama?
      Answer: The Black applicants both faced a situation where the county registrar was available to register citizens
      to vote. This was most likely an intentional act done to dissuade Black citizens from registering to vote.

 2. Describe the likely political effects on Black voters in Georgia and other states in the South that used similar
      tactics like these in the Jim Crow era.
      Answer: These state actions resulted in extremely low Black voter registration across the South and a loss of Black
      political power.

Question 3, Formative Task 3, Featured Sources

January and February of 1965 related to the Selma Campaign. Fact sheet, Alabama events Jan 17 - Feb 4, 1965
[https://www.crmvet.org/docs/6502 sncc ala factsheet.pdf]

 1. What type of nonviolent tactics were used in the Selma Campaign to register Black voters?
      Answer: Voting rights activists took part in nonviolent marches to the Dallas County Courthouse in order to
      protest their inability to register to vote.

 2. Based on this document, what difficulties did Black voters face besides literacy tests and unhelpful county
      registrars in their efforts to become registered voters?
      Answer: Activists often faced arrest and physical harm from local law enforcement.

Summative Performance Task

Engage students in a Socratic Seminar on voting in the United States today. Students will take part in a class
discussion on various reforms that have been passed in states across the country regarding voting and voter
registration.

This culminating activity will require students to activate knowledge from classroom instruction, primary and
supplemental documents and the excerpt below from The New Yorker `Drawing Lines" by Louis Menand.
128 | THE FIGHT FOR THE VOTE FROM JIM CROW TO THE PRESENT

      "Last year, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, legislatures in nineteen states passed thirty-four laws imposing

Conclusion

This curriculum on Black history examined a very specific chapter in American history that focused on the Black
freedom struggle. The goal of this curriculum is to teach through Black history rather than about Black history
in order to develop a Black historical consciousness approach to Black history. Professor LaGuerrette King (2020)
describes the objective of a Black historical consciousness approach to Black history as the following:

      A Black historical consciousness approach to Black history is to develop and learn Black history as its own genre of
      historical thought that is independent of Western knowledge. Redefining Black history is to explore Black identity
      through complex and nuanced narratives that attempt to get at the full humanity of Black people. (337)

The use of primary documents that focus on African Americans is an attempt to develop a more critical
understanding of the Black freedom struggle. The goal of this curriculum was to have students connect the struggle
for voting rights to the present in light of the 2013 Supreme Court ruling that struck down some of the protections
afforded to Black citizens under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. My hope is that educators use this curriculum as
part of a larger unit that makes connections between the political and social apartheid of the Jim Crow South and
the fight for civil rights and the destruction of Jim Crow.

In Part "A" of the Literacy Test you are given a section of the Alabama Constitution to read aloud. The sections are
taken from a big loose-leaf binder. Some are easier than others.

Literacy Test #1:

SECTION 20 of the Alabama state constitution: That no person shall be imprisoned for debt.

Literacy Test #2

SECTION 260 of the Alabama state constitution: The income arising from the sixteenth section trust fund, the
surplus revenue fund, until it is called for by the United States government, and the funds enumerated in sections 257
and 258 of this Constitution, together with a special annual tax of thirty cents on each one hundred dollars of taxable
property in this state, which the legislature shall levy, shall be applied to the support and maintenance of the public
schools, and it shall be the duty of the legislature to increase the public school fund from time to time as the necessity
therefor and the condition of the treasury and the resources of the state may justify; provided, that nothing herein
contained shall be so construed as to authorize the legislature to levy in any one year a greater rate of state taxation
for all purposes, including schools, than sixty-five cents on each one hundred dollars' worth of taxable property; and
provided further, that nothing herein contained shall prevent the legislature from first providing for the payment of the
bonded indebtedness of the state and interest thereon out of all the revenue of the state.

Primary Document: Excerpts from a Field Report by SNCC
summarizing events that transpired during January and February of
1965 related to the Selma Campaign.

January 18, 1965: 500 march on the Dallas County courthouse led by Dr. King and SNCC chairman John Lewis.
They are made to stand all day in the alley, and none are able to take the voter's test. Later in the day Dr. King is
punched and kicked by a white racist in the newly integrated Selma hotel.

January 20: 156 arrested including SNCC chairman, John Lewis, SNCC worker Terry Shaw, Frank Sorraco, Gladys
Freeman, Tom Brown-while marching to the courthouse. Sheriff Jim Clark of Dallas County tells SNCC chairman
John Lewis: "You are an agitator and that's the lowest form of humanity."

January 25: Mrs. Annie Lee Cooper of Selma and SNCC worker Willie McCray are arrested at the courthouse. After
a scuffle with Sheriff Clark four lawmen pounce on Mrs.

Cooper and beat her with billy clubs. Sheriff Clark says later: "She's a niggar woman and hasn't got a Miss or Mrs. in
front of her name!"

On Friday, December 21, 1962, I, Mr. Arthur Lowe, went with John O'Nea/, Field Secretary of the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee, to the Leesburg Courthouse in order to file my application for registering to vote. We went to
the Courthouse at about 4pm .

The registrar, Mr. Sol Yeoman, did not permit me to apply for registration. He said he was too occupied taking in taxes
. At the time of my talking to him, Mr. Yeoman was doing nothing except reading a newspaper.

I asked him what day I should come back to register. He said any day after Tuesday next week would be okay. He said
130 | THE FIGHT FOR THE VOTE FROM JIM CROW TO THE PRESENT

Monday he wouldn't be open; Tuesday he wouldn't be open because it was Christmas; but any day after that would be
alright. Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday.

Affidavit from J.L. McGrady

On Friday, January 18, 1963, I along with four others went with John O'Neal of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee to apply for status as registered voters in Lee County Georgia.

When we arrived at the County Courthouse at approximately 3:30 PM we were unable to make an application because
the Registrar, one Sol Yeoman, had apparently left for the day. A Mrs. Forrester, who shares the same office space, told
us that he was gone and the best time to catch him was in the morning.

If Friday is the only day of the week that applications will be accepted, as we have been Jed to believe, then the registrar
should at least keep regular office hours.

Because Mr. Yeoman was not in, I was unable to apply for registration. According to Georgia state law, I am, to the best
of my knowledge, duly qualified to be a registered voter.

Appendix B: Glossary of Historical Terms

Racial Apartheid:

Systemic racial segregation and discrimination that existed, primarily in the Southern states, from the late 19th
century through much of the 20th century, commonly known as the era of "Jim Crow." During this period,
state and local laws enforced racial segregation in various aspects of life, such as education, public facilities,
transportation, housing, and voting.

Grandfather Clause:

A legal provision used to exempt certain individuals from the restrictive voting requirements and literacy tests
that were often put in place to disenfranchise Black Americans. These clauses allowed individuals to vote if their
grandfathers had been eligible voters, effectively creating an exemption from new, racially discriminatory voting
laws.

Poll Taxes:

A form of voter suppression utilized by Southern states during the Jim Crow era to reduce and/or eliminate Black
suffrage. Voters had to pay a yearly tax to the state in order to vote.

Literacy Tests:

A form of voter suppression utilized by Southern states during the Jim Crow ear to reduce and/or eliminate Black
suffrage. In order to register to vote voters had to take an examination that tested their ability to read and write. The
tests were nearly impossible to pass and resulted in incredibly low Black voter registration in the South.

White Primaries:

A discriminatory practice used in the United States, primarily in the Southern states during the Jim Crow era (late
19th century to mid-20th century), to prevent Black Americans from participating in primary elections, which were
                                                                       THE FIGHT FOR THE VOTE FROM JIM CROW TO THE PRESENT | 131

a crucial step in the political process. These primaries were conducted by political parties to select their candidates
for general elections.

Socratic Seminar:

A method of structured, collaborative discussion typically used in educational settings, particularly in the field of
philosophy and in literature or social studies classes. In a Socratic seminar, participants engage in a thoughtful and
open-ended dialogue to explore complex ideas, texts, or issues.

THE BLACK WOMEN'S CLUB MOVEMENT: AN
OPPORTUNITY FOR IMMERSIVE LOCAL
HISTORY

   Rebecca Eisenberg

Introduction: Teaching Through Rather Than About

A facet of history that is often overlooked in US History classrooms are the many contributions Black women
contributed to resisting and pushing back against institutional racism and systemic oppression. With the exception
of women like Ida B. Wells and Rosa Parks, Black women's history is largely erased in the collective historical
narrative of the United States. The intention of this lesson is to provide an opportunity for secondary Social Science
students to learn about the collective contribution Black women made to civil rights throughout US history via the
Black Women's Club movement. Using a mixture of secondary and primary sources, students have the opportunity
to localize their understanding of history and learn through Black history, rather than about Black history.

Black women have been organizing politically and economically in some fashion since before the Civil War. In the
Antebellum South, enslaved women's collective and individual efforts to provide some relief from the inhumane
living and labor conditions is a type of resistance and rebellion often overlooked when teaching about the era of
American slavery. Organizing happened in the North as well. In Philadelphia, the Daughters of Africa, formed
in 1821 as a Black female benevolent society to provide aid for the needy and sick. The Colored Females Free
Produce Society, also from Philadelphia and formed in 1831, organized boycotts of products produced by slavery.
It is estimated that there were over 200 Black mutual-aid societies with over 15,000 members by 1850 (Shaw, 1991).

Black women also began organizing for better working conditions as early as 1866, a year after the conclusion of the
Civil War. Many Black women worked as washerwomen and domestic servants in White homes, spending hours
doing laborious work for little pay. Doing laundry, in particular, was a challenging job, as it required long hours
with insufficient access to water and exposure to unsanitary conditions. In 1866, Black washerwomen presented the
mayor a list of demands with the threat of a work stoppage to increase pay. While there is no record of the outcome,
this type of labor organization would be repeated again throughout the South during Reconstruction (Kelly, 2022).

During Reconstruction, Black female-driven mutual-aid societies thrived and grew in numbers and localities; this is
known as the Black Women's Club movement. While some historians argue that these organizations mirrored the
work of their White female counterparts (Lerner, 1974), the reality was that the groundwork for these organizations
already existed. Regardless, the massive boom of local Black Women's Club chapters was underway, seeking to
provide aid as needed (Shaw, 1991). For example, in the immediate post-Civil War era, the Memphis' Daughters of
Zion advocated for public health and educational access initiatives. The Independent Order of St. Luke, founded
in Baltimore in 1867, created a bank to lend to Black individuals and businesses (Shaw, 1991). As organizations like
                         THE BLACK WOMEN'S CLUB MOVEMENT: AN OPPORTUNITY FOR IMMERSIVE LOCAL HISTORY | 133

the YWCA of New York often refused housing to Black women, the Women's Loyal Union of NYC stepped in to
assist young Black women to relocate and find housing during the Great Migration (Lerner, 1974).

In 1895-1896, there was a movement to create a coalition of Black Women's Clubs under a national banner. The
most well-known national organization is the National Association of Colored Women (NACW), most famously
led by Mary Church Terrell. While they had many initiatives, they are remembered for their work on Black women's
suffrage, as well as supporting antilynching efforts of Ida B. Wells (Berry & Gross, 2020). But, while there were
efforts to organize nationally, local clubs still thrived and worked to mediate economic and civic challenges that
impacted Black communities (Shaw, 1991).

It is this last point that brings us to this particular lesson. Learning about the Black Women's Club movement is
an opportunity for students to learn about local civil rights history through historical documentation. There are a
number of primary resources housed in local archives (historical societies, universities, and libraries) that capture
the work of Black Women's Clubs. In looking at the work they did locally, such as setting up housing for young
women and lobbying against discriminatory housing practices, a student can learn about localized civil rights issues
through the organization's efforts.

This lesson features learning through, rather than about, history because students will use historical skills to uncover
local histories of Black Women's Clubs and evaluate their significance in supporting civil rights in Portland,
Oregon. In doing this, students are an active participant in understanding what work Black Women's Clubs
were engaged with and the impact they had on their local community. Students will analyze different historians'
interpretations of Black Women's Clubs and their rationales for organizing, analyze a collection of primary
documents on Portland's Culture Club, an organization of Portland Black women community leaders, and write
and record a two-minute podcast teaching others not only what Black Women's Clubs were, but offering their own
analysis of their impact on civil rights initiatives in Portland.

To learn through history, rather than about history, is represented in this lesson by uncovering the nuances of
engagement by the Black community through organization efforts in response to systemic oppression. Rather
than learning about what happened to the Black community during the Civil Rights era, students will experience
through working with primary documentation how the Black community, with a focus on the Culture Club, one
of Portland's Black Women's Clubs, and Urban League organized and resisted the oppression as told by the actors
engaged in the work themselves. This will create a nuanced and detailed history ripe for student analysis and in-
depth understanding. More importantly, it adjusts the narrative of Black Portlanders as victims to agents in creating
change.

Framework

Educators are currently in a significant moment in contemplating how to teach the history of all Americans, not just
a masculine, Anglophile interpretation of history with token moments of diversified history. We must consider how
to decouple the sidebar nature of gendered, racial, and national history that plays a supporting role in telling US
history from that of the status quo in teaching history to our students. This lesson on the Culture Club of Portland
offers an opportunity for students to learn civil rights history through Black women who shaped the direction of
the movement through fundraising efforts and political support. It centers the voices of those who actively pushed
for change, rather than an over-generalized explanation on the evolution of civil rights. It creates a nuanced and rich
retelling of history with opportunity for meaningful analysis and historical thought for students.

King (2020) argues that teaching Black history requires more than just teaching over-simplified narratives of general
134 | THE BLACK WOMEN'S CLUB MOVEMENT: AN OPPORTUNITY FOR IMMERSIVE LOCAL HISTORY

actions by the Black community in parallel to developments in the Anglo-schema of US history; instead teachers
must fold in elements of Black historical consciousness to deliver a more rich curriculum. King states these elements
include "systemic power, oppression, and racism; agency, resistance, and perseverance; Africa and the African
Diaspora; Black joy and love; Black identities; and Black historical contention" (p. 337). This lesson on the Black
Women's Club movement predominantly focuses on Black agency, resistance, and perseverance. King defines and
argues the importance for teaching this tenet of Black historical consciousness as such:

                Black agency, resistance, and perseverance help us understand that, throughout history, Black people could
                act independently, made their own decisions based on their interests, and fought back against oppressive
                structures. This concept recognizes that Black people have a spirit of freedom and revolt as each generation
                has fought against oppression. Without Black agency to balance oppression, Black history falls into the trap
                of victimhood, accompanied by a Black suffering narrative. (p. 338)

While this lesson does touch upon other tenets of Black historical consciousness, to include systemic power,
oppression, and racism, that is not the focus of the primary document exploration and historical analysis.

Using primary documents of Portland's Culture Club and the Urban League from 1964 and 1965 and teaching
students how to work with primary documents to write history is a way in which to teach through history rather
than about history. King argues that, "Redefining Black history is to explore Black identity through complex and
nuanced narratives that attempt to get at the full humanity of Black people" (p. 337). Examining the Culture
Club's yearbooks and a select set of the Urban League's meeting notes will yield surprising results and moments
of meaningful analysis as it relates to understanding the reality of systematic oppression and the response, as well
resistance, to the oppression by Portland's Black community. In looking at the documents that are directly tied to
Black organization efforts, students will begin to glimpse these "complex and nuanced narratives" and learn details
of Portland's civil rights movement that might otherwise get lost in a generalized narrative.

Pedagogical Applications

This lesson has a number of pedagogical applications to build content knowledge, historical thinking skills, and
organization of analytical thought. Students will learn about the Black Women's Club movement from both the
national and local level and have the opportunity to use contextual knowledge to analyze the work of women
engaged in and around the Portland region.

The first part of the lesson builds basic knowledge about Black Women's Clubs. Students will watch a "Crash
Course: Black History" on the Black Women's Club movement and begin to think about why certain narratives
appear in history texts, while others do not and how that can impact our understanding of history.

The second part of the lesson is two-fold: it asks students to compare two interpretations of history, while also
asking them to consider which version of history they think is "more accurate." This models how history can
be analyzed by historians, but also is an opportunity for students to begin thinking about what makes history
"accurate" (if history can ever be accurate).

The third part of the lesson engages students in primary document analysis. This portion of the lesson has the
teacher modeling how to unpack a primary document, using a scripted approach to seeing a whole primary source,
rather than just summarizing its content. After the teacher models how to read a primary source, students will
read several documents on their own using the same set strategies for unpacking a primary source. They will use
                         THE BLACK WOMEN'S CLUB MOVEMENT: AN OPPORTUNITY FOR IMMERSIVE LOCAL HISTORY | 135

local documentation, including Culture Club yearbooks and Urban League meeting notes, as the Culture Club
financially and politically supported the work of Portland's Urban League.

The final part of the lesson, the formative assessment, asks students to do something with the history they learned.
Students will write and record a two-minute podcast that offers an analysis of the importance of The Culture Club
moving civil rights initiatives forward in Portland. Students will need to use contextual knowledge from part one of
the lesson, analysis skills built from part two, and research conducted in part three to write and produce the podcast.

      opinion.

  · Essential Disciplinary Practice VI Construct well-reasoned and logically coherent explanations, arguments,
      and solutions related to complex societal issues.

Lesson Narrative

Black women's history in the United States is often oversimplified or completely erased when teaching the trajectory
between the Antebellum South and the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Some US History classes
might touch upon critical Black women, such as Ida B. Wells, Mamie Till, Rosa Parks, or Angela Davis, but the
larger narrative capturing the intersection of Black women's history and civil rights is largely absent from the
collective curriculum. This lesson on the Black Women's Club movement purposefully centers Black women's
history and local voices through primary documentation into the US History curriculum at the high school level.

Black Women's Clubs have a long history in the US - from the Antebellum South to modern day. They are both
local (such as the Oregon Federation of Colored Women) and national (National Association for Colored Women)
(Shaw, 1991). As such, this lesson can be placed anywhere in a number of places throughout the US History
curriculum, to include units about Reconstruction, the Progressive Era, the Great Migration, or Civil Rights in the
136 | THE BLACK WOMEN'S CLUB MOVEMENT: AN OPPORTUNITY FOR IMMERSIVE LOCAL HISTORY

1950s and 1960s. Furthermore, this lesson can be adapted to a teacher's local area. As this is originally written for
a Portland, Oregon audience, it will feature Oregon history, but it can be very easily adapted to other major cities
across the United States, as local archives are brimming with documentation of Black Women's Club actions and
initiatives.

There are four components to this lesson. The first component is "the what." The intention of this is to learn who
Black Women's Club members were and what their purposes entailed. The second component is a comparative
analysis of how historians have written about Club Women, thereby offering competing analysis of the history
just learned. The third component is an opportunity for students to immerse themselves in a selection of primary
sources that look at Oregon-related Club Women and discuss the localized aspects of clubs, as it pertains to Oregon
history. The final component, the formal assessment, combines the skills and content learned in the first three parts
into a short podcast that assesses the significance of Portland's local Black Women's Club-The Culture Club-on
the Civil Rights movement.

This lesson has natural breaking points should it need to be divided among classes. There are also a number of
extension opportunities, which will be discussed in a later section of this chapter. If the lesson is followed as written,
it will likely take three 90-minute block periods to complete.

Overview and Description of the Essential Question:

Why, and with what results, did Black Women's Club members organize in Portland, Oregon?

Staging the Question:

Ask the students what they already know about Black Women and US History - make a list on the board (this
might be short and that is okay).

Students will likely know very little about Black women in US History - inquire why that might be.

Question 1, Formative Task 1, Featured Sources:

First Supporting Question:

Who joined the Black Women's Club movement and why did they join?

Intro to the topic: The "WHAT"

This part of the lesson introduces what Black Women's Clubs were to the students.

 1. Introduce the Black Women's Club movement verbally, using Slides or PowerPoint, that covers the content
      in Figure 10.1.

Figure 10.1
Black Women's Club Movement Overview
                         THE BLACK WOMEN'S CLUB MOVEMENT: AN OPPORTUNITY FOR IMMERSIVE LOCAL HISTORY | 137

       Black Women's Club:

            · Local organizations of Black women focused on improving social and economic conditions in
                their region;

            · Existed prior to the Civil War, continued through Reconstruction, Civil Rights, and still exist
                today.

            · Examples of clubs and what they focused on:

                     Atlanta - improving education
                     NYC - housing for newly arrived Black southern women
                     Boston - reducing recidivism rates for young Black men

            · Portland, Oregon:

                     Began forming in the 1910s and 1920s
                     Supported Black soldiers in WWI and WWII, as well as homefront efforts
                     Supported organizations that helped with housing, medical care, and political lobbying

                        on behalf of Black workers' rights and housing discrimination (YWCA, Urban League)
                        through fundraising efforts.

            · Black Women's Club movement - Provided critical support to civil rights efforts, as well as
                localized solutions to discrimination.

 2. Crash Course - Black History - The Black Women's Club Movement: Crash Course Black American History
      #23(Warning about mature content - sexual and physical abuse). Below are questions students can answer as
      they watch. You can convert these questions into a worksheet with space to answer or allow students to
      answer informally in notebooks.

          Additional Lesson Guidance: Review questions 1, 2, and 3 with students prior to engaging in question
            4 - the free-write/ discussion portion.

          Additional Lesson Guidance: You can scaffold the lesson by building vocabulary (ie - "suffrage") prior
            to watching the Crash Course depending on the grade and academic level of your class.

          Additional Lesson Guidance - If you want an additional video (or if you need a refresher of contextual
            information at any point in the lesson), please refer to "Black History in Two Minutes: The Women's
            Club Movement"

Questions

As you watch, answer these questions:
138 | THE BLACK WOMEN'S CLUB MOVEMENT: AN OPPORTUNITY FOR IMMERSIVE LOCAL HISTORY

 1. Black Women's Club movement - What is the CONTEXTUAL history helpful to know about Club
      Women?

 2. Two CRITICAL PLAYERS - who were they and how did they contribute to the overall growth of the Club
      Women's movement?

               Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin
               Mary Church Terrell

 3. Keep track of the TYPES OF ACTIONS or areas of focus for Club Women (i.e., - creating preschools).

After viewing the Crash Course, reply to the following prompts (spend about 4-5 minutes per question):

 4. What do you think "Lifting as We Climb" means? What does this slogan tell you about Black women and the
      push for civil rights after the Civil War?

 5. "Our textbooks don't always include the contributions that Black women made towards civil rights, but we
      should be absolutely clear that without their work, our world would not be where it is today." Let's reflect on
      this:

          Why might a typical US History textbook leave this information out?
          What impact does this history's exclusion have on our collective understanding of Black women's

            history?
          How might the inclusion of this history give a better more/ complete understanding of US history?

Question 2, Formative Task 2, Featured Sources

Second Supporting Question:

How is Black women's history shaped by the Black Women's Club movement?

Assessment of Black Women's Clubs in History: "THE ANALYSIS"

Now that the historical context of the Black Women's Club movement is established, it is time to look at historical
analysis of the movement, as offered by two distinct historians. Have a physical copy of this reading so students can
actively underline and highlight.

 1. Students will read independently and interact with excerpts from the articles below to identify concrete details
      and analysis.

          When reading, students will underline information that offers concrete details about what Club Women
            were - who joined the clubs, goals, etc.

          After identifying concrete details, students will highlight (or circle) analysis (meaning an argument or
            interpretation) offered by the historians.

          If students have never done this type of identification of concrete details and analysis, model how to do
            this with the first document (Lerner) and allow students to complete the second document (Shaw) on
            their own.

History, 59(2), 158-167. https://doi.org/10.2307/2717327

       Black women organized, throughout the nineteenth century, at first on a local, later- on a state and
       national level, to undertake educational, philanthropic and welfare activities. Urbanization, the
       urgent needs of the poor in a period of rapid industrialization and the presence of a sizable group of
       educated women with leisure led to the emergence of a national club movement of white women
       after the Civil War. Similar conditions did not begin to operate in the black communities until the
       1890's, when local clubs in a number of different cities began almost simultaneously to form
       federations. In 1896 the newly formed National Association of Colored Women (NACW) united the
       three largest of these and over a hundred local women's clubs. (p. 158)
       ...The work of black clubwomen contributed to the survival of the black community. Black women's
       clubs were, like the clubs of white women, led by educated, often by middle-class women, but unlike
       their white counterparts, black club women frequently successfully bridged the class barrier and
       concerned themselves with issues of importance to poor women, working mothers, tenant farm
       wives. They were concerned with education, self and community improvement, but they always
       strongly emphasized race pride and race advancement. Their inspiring example of self-help and
       persistent community service deserves to be more closely studied by historians, especially those
       interested in urban history. (p. 167)

Colored Women. Journal of Women's History., 3(2), 10-25. https://doi.org/10.1353/jowh.2010.0065

       The purpose of this article is to formulate a new interpretation of the creation of the national black
       women's dub coalition of the 1890s--one that points to the internal traditions of the African-
       American community rather than activities in the white community. Numerous factors suggest the
       need for the alternative view. First, the history of "voluntary associations" among African-Americans
       indicates an historical legacy of collective consciousness and mutual associations. Second, individual
       histories of diverse club women reveal early lessons in racial consciousness and community
       commitment. And third, the work of organized black women before the formation of the NACW was
       no different from the activities of club women after the creation of the NACW. Altogether, the
140 | THE BLACK WOMEN'S CLUB MOVEMENT: AN OPPORTUNITY FOR IMMERSIVE LOCAL HISTORY

       founding of the NACW did not mark the beginning of the important organized work of black
       women against racism, sexism, and their effects, as earlier studies imply. Instead, the creation of the
       national organization represents another step in an internal historical process of encouraging and
       supporting self-determination, self-improvement, and community development. (p. 11)
       ...At least as early as the advent of American slavery, African-Americans consistently demonstrated
       inclinations toward community consciousness and collective activity. Historians of the antebellum
       South, slavery, and slave culture inform us that even under slavery, black men and women operated
       as a community within a community in which both personal and social identities developed and
       helped to ameliorate the harsh conditions of their enforced bondage. Slaves often acted together in
       rebellion, or colluded afterwards to protect those implicated in acts of resistance. Plantation childcare
       situations, the forced secrecy surrounding organized religious ceremonies, and the potential for and
       actual loss of blood family members continually encouraged the development of group
       consciousness. (p. 11)

 2. When done independently reading, provide students with a blank Venn diagram (Figure 10.4) and markers
      of two different colors. They can work individually, in pairs, or small groups.

          In the middle of the Venn Diagram, students will fill out any commonalities they found between the
            readings for concrete detail in Color A and commonalities for analysis in a Color B.

          On the outside spaces of the Venn Diagram, students will fill out differences they found - Color A for
            concrete details and Color B for analysis.

 3. When done with the Venn Diagram, review with the class what they found that was similar or different
      across the two historians for concrete details and analysis, then discuss - which interpretation of events did they
      find more compelling or "accurate"?

Question 3, Formative Task 3, Featured Sources

Third Supporting Question:

  · How did social, political, and economic conditions impact the agendas of the Black Women's Club in
      Portland, Oregon?

Learning "THROUGH" History - PRIMARY SOURCES
In this portion of the lesson, students will examine primary sources and determine what it was the Oregon's Club
Women were doing. A reminder that many clubs were localized, as discussed earlier in the chapter. What Oregon's
                         THE BLACK WOMEN'S CLUB MOVEMENT: AN OPPORTUNITY FOR IMMERSIVE LOCAL HISTORY | 141

Club Women focused on might be different from that of chapters in New York City, Boston, or Atlanta. Actions
Oregon Club Women chose to engage with will illustrate significant issues of discrimination as it relates to gender
and race.

  · To introduce this lesson, students will read Pauline Bradford's interview. Bradford was a member of the
      Harriet Tubman Club. This reviews what Club Women did, to include localized purposes in the Portland
      region. This is a great read if you need to break the lesson over two days, as it will help refresh key historical
      points already covered.

  · Students will use a collection of yearbooks from the "Culture Club," one Portland's Black Women's Clubs,
      as they exemplify localized issues of concern. Students will look at who the Culture Club donated money to
      and supported politically, which will elucidate larger objectives of this particular club, as well as issues of
      concern to the Black community in Portland.

Documents Needed:

 1. National Archives Worksheet for Understanding Perspective in Primary Sources.pdf
 2. Portland State Culture Club Yearbook, 1937-1938.pdf

Part One: Modeling Document Analysis:

  · Open up the document analysis worksheet (see below).
  · Visit the Culture Club's Yearbook from 1937-1938 - [https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/

      viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=cc_yearbooks]
  · Work through the document analysis worksheet with the class to model how to unpack a primary source.
  · A critical component of this document is what the women were learning each week - what that might tell us

      about the purpose clubs served in the community, particularly for Black women?

Part Two: Culture Club + Local Beneficiaries:

  · Students will look at a series of documents to determine what it was the Culture Club did and who they
      supported via fundraising, thereby illustrating issues of interest to Black Club women.

  · Documents and framing questions for each document. For students, have physical or electronic copies of
      each document AND four Primary Document Analysis worksheets (one for each document).

                     What is it talking about?
                     Why did the author write it?
                     List evidence from the document that is relevant to the larger historical context (this

                        will remind you what you learned about the topic of issue through this document).
           3. Making Document into Historical Evidence:

                     What did you find out from this document that you might not learn anywhere else?
                     In one sentence, how did this document further your knowledge about the larger topic

                        of study?

Summative Performance Task

Your students are now equipped with knowledge of Black Women's Clubs, two historical perspectives on their
significance and impact on the larger civil rights movement, and localized primary document data. Now it is time
to do something with that information and the historical skills they have been building.
Students will create a two minute podcast with their local peers as their intended audience (a podcast for teens by
teens). Podcasts must cover the following:

 1. What the Black Women's Club movement was (historical context and general overview);
 2. Offers analysis for why they were critical to localized civil rights movements;
 3. Uses the Culture Club as an example.

Groups of 3 students is ideal, as each student can have a particular role:

  · All three students draft the script - each student is responsible for one of the three aspects listed above (what,
      analysis, Culture Club);

  · Two students record and one is responsible for production/ tech aspects.

Helpful Resources for Podcasting - If your students have never written or recorded a podcast, here are two
resources to help:

  · NPR (2018) article: "Starting your podcast: A guide for students."

Potential Civic Engagement

There are a number of ways students can use history to civically engage with their surrounding community,
whether that be their local school, neighborhood, city, or state. Educating others through podcasts, newspaper
articles, and public memorials is a significant form of civic engagement that is very attainable for students. Below
are a few examples of how this work can be done by students:

  · Publish podcasts on school's local social media, website, or school news site;
  · Contact school's archivist (many schools have one) and offer to provide data found about Black Culture

      Women and work done in local communities;
  · Interview surviving and current Club Women from local area and create a searchable database or donate to

      local historical society;
  · Research local women leaders (i.e., - Thelma Unthank) - create a public memorial for that person or group;
  · Utilize school newspaper archives or local newspapers (The Oregonian or The Advocate) to corroborate what

      they learned - write a story for school newspaper or other local publication.

Conclusion

Too often, America's diverse history is taught as a footnote or sidebar in parallel to the dominant US historical
narrative. Teaching the Black Women's Club movement is an opportunity for students to engage with materials
that create a rich narrative that captures the complexities of the civil rights movement in Portland, Oregon. Using
primary and secondary sources, students will understand how Black women were influencing the direction and
initiatives of the civil rights movement, rather than being passive participants. Students will understand how Black
Portland women were actively resisting and challenging systemic and institutional racism at the local level, rather
than being merely victims of white supremacy.

In creating a rich narrative of the civil rights movement using primary documents, students will learn through,
rather than about Black women's history because they will understand the nuances of progress related to civil rights
by reading actions taken by local community leaders, rather than learning an over-generalized historical retelling of
events about this particular era. As argued by King (2020), it is this type of learning that shifts US history away
146 | THE BLACK WOMEN'S CLUB MOVEMENT: AN OPPORTUNITY FOR IMMERSIVE LOCAL HISTORY

from tokenizing Black history and into teaching Black historical consciousness. Teaching in this manner is critical
in rethinking best practices for teaching the diversified histories of the United States.

If educators want ways to expand upon this lesson, please refer to the list below:

  · Compare Portland to NYC, Atlanta, or St. Louis (or anywhere...really).
  · Look at collections of pictures:

          Oregon Historical Society - Collections results for Oregon Association of Colored Women's Clubs
          Multnomah County Library - National Association of Colored Women's Clubs
  · Examination of tension between local chapters and national organizations (ie - NACW)
  · Biographics of members of the Culture Club (ie - Thelma Unthank).

RESISTANCE & PERSISTENCE: STUDENT
ACTION IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT

   Karli Olsen

Introduction: Teaching Through Rather Than About

If the purpose of social studies education is to create socially conscious and politically engaged young people, our
instruction in the classroom must show students how they can engage with the world on a local, national, and
global level. The majority of our students cannot vote because of their age, and students lack engagement with
our political and social institutions because of this and other factors. Therefore, it is incumbent upon educators to
show students all of the levers of power that they can access to impact the social and political issues about which
they are passionate. Teaching through Black history means showing students not only what happened in the civil
rights movement, but showing students how it happened and how they, like the students in Birmingham Children's
Crusade of 1963, also have the power to create change.

Framework

LeGarret King's (2020) framework of Black Historical Consciousness(pdf) invites us to consider teaching Black
history with particular regard for the historical moments, movements, and events that are especially significant to
Black people. King invites educators to consider the lens through which we teach Black history. Does our teaching
center the voices and perspectives of Black people? Or are we teaching and studying history from a Eurocentric
perspective? Whose voice is at the center of our teaching? Within King's framework, this lesson is focused on three
areas: Power, Oppression, & Racism; Black Agency, Resistance, and Perseverance; and Black Joy. With respect to
Power, Oppression, and Racism, the videos used to introduce this unit and the Kelly Ingram Park virtual tour
introduce students to the purpose of the fight for civil rights: What are foot soldiers and leaders of the civil rights
movement fighting for (and against)? This lesson also demonstrates how existing power structures, such as the
Public Safety Commissioner of Birmingham at the time, responded to action by Black leaders, students, and foot
soldiers.

Black Agency, Resistance, and Perseverance is at the center of this unit. The virtual tour centers the agency
and action of the foot soldiers of the movement, particularly the students and children who participated in the
Children's March of the Birmingham Campaign. It contextualizes their participation within the broader strategy
of the movement and the outcome of their direct action.

Black Joy is present in the lesson through the first-person accounts from student foot soldiers and the use of
protest music featured in the media (audio and video) used and performance tasks throughout. In the summative
performance task, students will incorporate their knowledge of all three areas of Black Historical Consciousness to
create an original protest song.
148 | RESISTANCE & PERSISTENCE: STUDENT ACTION IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT

Pedagogical Applications

Students will use inquiry to analyze both primary and secondary sources to understand the critical role of foot
soldiers, particularly students and children, in the civil rights Movement. Students will also analyze a current
primary source on student activism and compare and contrast that with what they learn about student action
during the Birmingham Campaign. (A present-day primary source is provided, but teachers are encouraged to find
a source from their own school or community.) After analyzing a protest song from the civil rights era, students will
create an original protest song for the 1963 Birmingham Campaign or a current issue of their choice.

Lesson Narrative

Supporting Question 1 and the associated Formative Performance Task will provide students with historical context
about the role of student foot soldiers in the civil rights Movement. It will use a guided virtual tour of Kelly Ingram
Park that includes audio and photographic content as well as discussion questions.

Supporting Question 2 and the associated Formative Performance Task will introduce students to a current or
recent student action. An example primary source and discussion questions are provided, but teachers should select
a source that is local and relevant to their student population.

For Supporting Question 3 and the associated Formative Performance Task, students will analyze a protest song
popular in the civil rights movement and connect it to their historical knowledge. Ultimately, students will write
an original protest song for either the 1963 Children's March or for a current issue of their choice, such as the one
introduced in the second Formative Performance Task.

Overview and Description of the Essential Question

The essential question here is how can people who cannot vote affect public policy? This question is of particular
relevance to our students. As they learn about the world in our classrooms, they often receive a perspective that
does not engage their capacity for civic engagement. Much of their education about civics and about the civil rights
movement is centered around voting. Nearly all of our students, however, cannot vote. Some of our students will
never be able to due to their citizenship or other status. Teaching students about the impact of young people in the
civil rights movement demonstrates directly to our students that they can impact the course of history regardless of
their age or voter registration status.

This lesson is anticipated to take place over the course of two 90 minute class periods, with Supporting Questions 1
and 2 to be conducted in one session, followed by Supporting Question 3 and the Summative Performance Task in
the second class session. Opportunities for civic engagement and extension would take place over subsequent class
periods.

Staging the Question

Begin by asking students: who participated in the civil rights movement? Elicit student responses. Expect limited
answers and mention of civil rights leaders such as The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Rosa Parks. This is
consistent with the heroified (Loewen, 2018) version of history that pervades social studies education.
                                          RESISTANCE & PERSISTENCE: STUDENT ACTION IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT | 151

Introduce the concept of the foot soldiers of the movement. Foot soldiers, as defined by University of Georgia Foot
Soldier Project for Civil Rights Studies, are those "whose names may not be familiar, but whose dedication to the
cause of equality and civil rights formed the backbone of a movement that brought about sweeping changes in the
nation's history" (n.d., para. 2). Most participants in the civil rights movement were foot soldiers, not leaders.

Play the video from Atlanta History Center, The Children's March: Birmingham Children's Crusade (video). As
you watch, ask students to think about the overarching essential question: How can people who cannot vote affect
public policy?

Question 1: How did students and children participate in the civil rights
movement? - Kelly Ingram Park Virtual Tour

Begin by watching the History Channels, Children's Crusade of 1963 (video) embedded on slide 2 to show first-
person accounts from student foot soldiers.

Orient students using the map on slide 3, which shows the location of Kelly Ingram Park and 16th Street Baptist
Church relative to one another. Students will take a virtual tour of Kelly Ingram Park using the slides in Kelly
Ingram Park Class Presentation Slides (pptx) In person, visitors are invited to dial in to learn more about the
historical context behind each of the art installations, memorials, and statues featured in Kelly Ingram Park. The
slides include links to these guided audio recordings, images of the statues in the park, and primary source images
that inspired them. Ensure that students understand they are to listen to the recordings and examine the image
before moving on to the discussion questions for that site. All images hyperlink to the original web location so
students can interact with the images. Show how to use the hyperlinks and arrows to work their way to each slide
and the associated discussion questions.

Students can work in groups, with a partner, or solo to navigate the virtual tour and answer the Kelly Ingram Park
Class Questions (docx) document. Teachers may choose to have students write answers to the discussion questions,
or simply discuss them in groups/with a partner.

Question 2: How are students and children impacting public policy in
our local community? - News Article & Discussion

Introduce the second supporting question. Teachers should select a primary source, like the news article provided
in the example, to show current or recent students engaging in direct action (protest, lobbying, etc.) to impact
public policy. Examples should be local and relevant to the students in class. After reading an example like the
newspaper article on Student-led protest takes on racism, police brutality (pdf), in the aftermath of George Floyed,
the teacher should facilitate a discussion guided by the discussion questions provided on slide 3 of the Student
Protest Presentation Slides (pptx). Think-Pair-Share in partners and small table groups is an effective structured
student talk strategy for eliciting more student participation, but teachers should use their judgment and select a
structured student talk strategy that is best for their students.

Question 3: What obstacles do foot soldiers in social and political
movements face? How do they respond to those obstacles? - Song
Lyrics Analysis

Introduce the song, Ain't Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me Around. The song is referenced in the video from the Staging
the Question section of the lesson from The children's march: Birmingham children's crusade (video) . Provide
152 | RESISTANCE & PERSISTENCE: STUDENT ACTION IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT

students with a copy of the Ain't Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me Around (docx) lyrics sheet. Teachers may choose to
support student learning using the video Sing With Us, The Children's March: Ain't Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me
Around (video) as background information about the song produced by the Atlanta History Center. This video
also introduces some of the vocabulary terms in the song, which may be appropriate for students with limited
English proficiency. As with many protest songs, multiple versions exist from a variety of sources. This particular
example was selected for its length. While students work, it is suggested that you play the song for your class. Many
free versions exist on Youtube, such Ain' Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me `Round (video) rendition by Sweet Honey
in the Rock.

Students should connect the obstacles that seek to turn marchers around (segregation, Jim Crow, jail cell, etc.)
referenced in the song to the historical knowledge they gained by watching the videos and in the Kelly Ingram
Park Tour. Students should cite textual evidence from the song and from the sources presented in class. Students
are asked to connect the lyrics to student participation in the civil rights movement as well as a current-day event,
setting the stage for their summative performance task.

Summative Performance Task

For the summative performance task, use the Create a Protest Song (docx), students will apply their knowledge of
the experiences of foot soldiers and/or their passion for a current civil rights issue to write an original protest song.
Students are presented with two options, both of which connect to previous learning.

Option #1: Imagine you are a teenager who has decided to participate in the Children's March in Birmingham,
AL in 1963. You have been tasked with writing a protest song that will be sung as you march the streets of downtown
Birmingham.

Option #2: Choose a current day civil rights issue. Imagine you are a teenager who has decided to participate in a
Children's March on that issue. You have been tasked with writing a protest song that will be sung as you march the
streets of your local community.

Potential Civic Engagement

This lesson lends itself to multiple extension activities that demand civic engagement from our students. Students
may:

  · Organize a local Children's March on an issue of their choice
  · Teach their original protest song to other students
  · Collect oral histories from family, peers, or those connected to the issue/action in Performance Task 2 (the

      article Conversations With The Past: Creating Oral History at Home Atlanta History Center provides a
      useful and adaptable framework)
  · Explore oral histories from other collections

Conclusion

When creating opportunities for civic engagement among high school students, the possibilities are boundless.
After completing this lesson sequence, students will walk away knowing that young people, like them, were integral
to the success of the civil rights movement. This knowledge will, hopefully, inspire them to follow in the footsteps
of student foot soldiers of the civil rights movement, propelling them toward a lifetime of civic engagement. By
                                          RESISTANCE & PERSISTENCE: STUDENT ACTION IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT | 153

teaching through Black history, we imbue our students with the knowledge and tools to make change in their own
community.

If you or your students are interested in historiography and developing their historical thinking skills, consider
digging more deeply into oral histories. If your students are interested in a particular civil rights or public policy
issue, consider allocating class time for them to organize a direct action campaign, such as letter writing, lobbying,
or a nonviolent protest.

MASS INCARCERATION AND THE WAR ON
DRUGS

   Lynsey Turner

Introduction: Teaching Through Rather Than About

This lesson chooses to focus on not only the historical aspects of the War on Drugs but showcase the number
of African Americans currently incarcerated. Students first participate in a short discussion, take notes on the
history of War on Drugs, learn about War on Drugs from four African Americans, study incarceration rates in
different states, and finally write a short essay about War on Drugs initiatives and how it affects a community. An
extra credit/homework opportunity is provided for students to use several resources to research the abolishment
of prisons or how to reform incarceration. Overarching goal of this lesson is to teach students about the War on
Drugs through a Black/African American perspective by having students read and listen to members from that
community speak about history, experiences, and consequences of mass incarceration. All documents and videos'
that students utilize throughout the lesson are purely from a Black/African American perspective. Thereby this
lesson acknowledges that Americans have different perspectives and experiences based upon one's race. Throughout
this lesson the focus is for students to understand the historical significance of the increasing African American
incarceration rates since the 1970's and the governments perpetuation of racial stereotypes-especially of African
American men/boys. This lesson lends itself to a follow up lesson plan on the Golden Age of Rap, a time when
the African American community began to openly call out incarceration rate injustices. Students will concur at the
end, how racially biased the criminal justice system currently operates as well as the government initiatives that sent
millions of African American men and boys to prison.

Framework

During the lesson, Black voices will be heard rather than talked about in a variety of avenues. Jay-Z's nearly four-
minute video discussing the history of War on Drugs, and how it affected him is a pivotal moment in this lesson.
While most students will be familiar with Jay-Z's name or music, some may not understand his significance as
a leader within the African American community who purposely created a video about how War on Drugs has
harmed his community. Another important moment is Roland Martin's discussion and interview of two people
who are working to end the War on Drugs. This short video provides answers as to how to end the War on Drugs
by three people who are from the community it affects the most. In America, most educators continue to be White
females, while only 1% of educators are Black men. Which means that educators must first ensure their classroom
includes culturally inclusive materials and topics. Then ensure those topics are spoken about from the people
group it affects i.e., showing a video about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr created by an African American. Two Black
Historical Consciousness Principles guided this lesson plan on how the War on Drugs and incarceration affects
Black/African American community. First, Power and Oppression theme can be noted as students study the high
percentage of incarcerated Black men and women compared to white and Latinx counterparts. The Taifa article
explains how incarceration continues to disproportionately affect the Black/African American community. Second,
                                                                                        MASS INCARCERATION AND THE WAR ON DRUGS | 157

Roland Martin and Jay-Z's videos indicate the Black Agency, Resistance, and Perseverance theme by demonstrating
how the Black/African American community is fighting against oppressive mass incarceration. Jay-Z's video seeks
to educate on mass incarceration of Black/African American men whereas Roland Martin's explains how it has
damaged the Black community. By creating YouTube videos these two men are teaching possibly thousands of
viewers about the toll mass incarceration takes on the Black/African American community. Teaching through Black
Histories requires White educators to be honest with themselves and utilize self-reflection. Thus, class materials
from the perspective of a variety of races are essential to White teachers. The 21st century teacher whose classroom
increasingly diversified needs multicultural resources.

Pedagogical Applications

One of the goals of this lesson is to get students talking about prisons and incarcerations. Pedagogically, students
will participate in discussion (either verbally or written). Cultures more orally inclined will likely want to discuss
these topics as a class whereas less outspoken cultures may prefer to write their answers down. It is up to the teacher
to determine the best avenue for their class. The first part of this lesson has students using notetaking skills to learn
about the history of the War on Drugs. Note Taking has been shown to be a skill needed in college, while the
handout has fill in notes, a teacher can make these sections blank for students to take their own notes on the slides.
Analysis of both primary and secondary sources is a third pedagogical skill used with the documents. Students must
be able to hear, see and read four documents' perspectives on the War on Drugs. Finally, research skills and the
ability to use charts as proof of historical issues in the United States will teach students how to analyze data. This
lesson intends to utilize all these pedagogical approaches with the ultimate goal of studying War on Drugs and mass
incarceration.

Lesson Narrative

Beginning in the 1970's with President Nixon, and then pushed by President Reagan in the 1980's, the War on
Drugs has driven the imprisonment of individuals caught with or dealing in illegal substances (some of which were
not illegal in the early 20th century). However, data denotes the increased imprisonment of African Americans,
specifically during the War on Drugs. After Reconstruction, African Americans seeking a better life after slavery
were imprisoned at significantly higher rates, many often without a trial. African Americans men/boys in prison
were forced to do hard labor and young African American boys were imprisoned for crimes white peers were not.
Currently, African Americans are imprisoned at five times the rate of white Americans and four times the rate
of Latinx counterparts (The Sentencing Project (pdf), 2021). These statistics do not show the humanity in what
increased incarceration of African American men has on the community or how unjust the justice system has
been towards Black men/boys. This lesson hopes to bring light, awareness and hopefully advocacy for imprisoned
African Americans.

Overview and Description of the Essential Question

The essential question asks which government policies affected the War on Drugs initiative; students will be
required to conclude that specific government intervention on the drug market propelled incarceration. As the
lesson progresses students will be able to identify that these government policies, proposed and encouraged by
wealthy Caucasians, especially affected the African American community. The last part of the question is meant
to give a historical timeline or context as to when these events are occurring such as in the aftermath of the 1960's
revolutions where drug use became commonplace. This lesson plan includes a class discussion, a short note taking
section for students to become familiar with the facts of the War on Drugs, an inquiry section about each state's
incarceration rates, and a short essay. This lesson could be done during a 90-minute class or broken into two
50-minute class periods.

Staging the Question

Students will be given an open-ended question to pique interest. Student question: Does anyone know someone
who has spent time in prison? If so, what do you know about that person's time in prison? If not, what do you know
about prison? The teacher will then give students 5-10 minutes to answer this question. After giving students time
to think and write about their answer (which is also on the student handout) the teacher will open the question
to the class for answers. Students will not be required to give their answer to this question, since this might be a
sensitive and personal topic. It is imperative that the teacher be careful but forthright when discussing incarceration.

Question 1, Formative Task 1, Featured Sources

The first supporting question opens another short discussion by asking students what they know about prison.
Then showing students how the War on Drugs increased incarceration rates, especially within the African
American community. Students will fill out a handout as Google's Slides are presented on history of War on Drugs.
This handout includes questions for Formative Task 2 and Formative Task 3 as well as an extra credit/homework
section. The primary objective of this section is to give students context as to why and how incarceration rates
climbed beginning in the 1970's.

  · War on Drugs and Mass Incarceration Presentation Slides (pptx)

  · War on Drugs and Mass Incarceration Student Handout (docx)

Question 2, Formative Task 2, Featured Sources

The second supporting question asks students to self-reflect and analyze where they have gotten information about
what life is like in prison. The teacher will then lead the class in a short discussion and even create a list on the
board about how students know about prison life. This list will likely include places such as-friend/relative, movies/
TV shows, YouTube, social media. The teacher can also extend this discussion to ask students if it was clear in all
these reenactments why the prisoners were incarcerated. Then the teacher will separate students into groups of 2-3
students to go through four stories of African Americans imprisoned via QR codes. Student groups will watch or
read each of these documents together as a group, then answer each set of questions. The goal of this activity is
to read or hear about the personal stories of African Americans who have been incarcerated due to War on Drugs
initiatives.

  · War on Drugs and Mass Incarceration Videos & Student Questions Document (docx)

Question 3, Formative Task 3, Featured Sources

In a very simply stated question, this part of the lesson asks students to reveal what they have learned from the
personal stories in Formative Task 2. The obvious answer is yes to this question. It will then be up to the teacher to
ask students to explain why some people are falsely and wrongfully imprisoned. A teacher might choose to create a
shortlist on the board of the reasons why a person is unjustly imprisoned. Then the teacher will direct students to
use the website to choose one state to study. It is vital that the teacher demonstrate to the class how to complete this
task and encourage students to choose a variety of states. The goal of this activity is to get students to first see what
role each state plays in the mass incarceration of African American men then how mass incarceration is a national
crisis.
162 | MASS INCARCERATION AND THE WAR ON DRUGS

Summative Performance Task

The Conclusion section on the War on Drugs and Mass Incarceration Student Handout will demonstrate students'
understanding of essential questions by asking students to explain which government policy had the greatest effect
on the African American community. Student answers will show how at least one government policy increased
incarceration rates, particularly in the African American community. Then students will show how an increased
incarceration affects a community (less men in the community to work, more families in poverty, etc). as pointed
out throughout the lesson.

Potential Civic Engagement

During this part of the lesson plan students can earn extra credit or complete for homework an outline on how to
change or abolish the prison system. Six websites given for students on the War on Drugs and Mass Incarceration
Student Handout to assist in the beginnings of research. While learning more about the prison reform and
abolishment projects students can choose to become more civically engaged by interacting with each project via
social media. If a student chooses, they can begin getting support for prison reform/abolishment within their own
community.

Conclusion

The goal of this lesson plan is to showcase the cause and effect of the War on Drugs, pushed by various presidents,
on the African American community. Thus, demonstrating one visual of systematic racism in America. By first
teaching the history of the War on Drugs and then allowing students to read letters from those incarcerated,
students will learn more about the humanity of the prison system. This lesson seeks to teach through, rather than
about Black histories by allowing students to read letters from African Americans imprisoned via the War on Drugs.
As well as showcasing the effect the initiative has had on the African American community in the late 20th Century.
Furthermore, it is hoped that this lesson plan teaches students to be empathetic to prisoners and their families.

TUSKEGEE AIRMEN

   Charles Williams

Introduction: Teaching Through Rather Than About

The history of African Americans in the military is a powerful narrative that not only highlights the contributions
and sacrifices of Black individuals but also serves as a lens through which we can examine broader societal issues of
racial prejudice and resilience. In 1941, the Air Corps initiated an experiment to train Black individuals as combat
pilots, challenging long-held misconceptions about their capabilities based on a 1925 War Department study that
wrongly asserted racial inferiority. The journey of the first African American military pilots, who graduated from
Tuskegee Army Air Field in 1942, is marked by limited opportunities and profound achievements. Despite facing
segregation, racial bias, and intense opposition, these brave men, led by figures like Captain Benjamin O. Davis
Jr., demonstrated exceptional skill and determination. Their story is not just about their fight for equality in the
military; it's about the struggle for recognition and respect in a society that was reluctant to embrace them as
full citizens. Through their experiences, we gain insight into the complexities of race, identity, and the quest for
civil rights in America--a history that resonates today. By teaching through their stories, we can engage with the
struggles and triumphs that shaped our present, fostering a deeper understanding of the ongoing fight for justice
and equality.

Framework

In teaching Black History, we often fail by only highlighting the positive aspects, reducing Black History to a
monolith and neglecting the complexities of human agency. LaGarrett King's framework addresses this through
six principles and warns against the monolithic teaching of Black histories. "Black histories have been problematic
and susceptible to the evils of sexism, capitalism, and Black ethnic subjugation. To represent Black humanity, Black
historical contention emphasizes that we should not merely teach and present positive Black histories and images.
We need to provide a complete history that acknowledges the humanity of Black people, including their deficiencies
and vulnerabilities" (King, 2020, 340). The Tuskegee lesson draws from King's principles: Black Agency, Power and
Oppression, and Black Identity. Black Agency enables students to understand African Americans' role in shaping
their destiny despite the adversity they face. At the same time, Power and Oppression expose the systemic racism
present in our military and society at large. Finally, Black Identity seeks to bring an inclusive perspective on the
diverse identities of Black people throughout history.

Pedagogical Applications

The pedagogical approach outlined emphasizes a student-centered, interactive learning experience that fosters
critical thinking, collaboration, and personal connection to historical content. By utilizing Inquiry-Based Learning,
students are encouraged to pose questions about the Tuskegee Airmen and the historical context of racism in
the military, promoting deeper investigation and discussion. Collaborative Learning activities foster teamwork and
communication as students create projects together, while Multimodal Learning accommodates various learning
                                                                                                                                   TUSKEGEE AIRMEN | 165

styles, allowing for expression through different mediums. Reflective Practice and Historical Empathy deepen
students' engagement with personal narratives, cultivating a sense of responsibility through Civic Engagement
initiatives. Additionally, Critical Analysis challenges students to evaluate systemic oppression, and Interdisciplinary
Connections highlight the relationships between social studies, art, and technology. Peer Teaching enhances
understanding through sharing knowledge, and ongoing Feedback and Assessment support continuous
improvement and learning throughout the educational process.

Lesson Narrative

In the thick of World War II, amidst the roar of engines and the chaos of battle, a radical experiment was unfolding
in the segregated South. This was not just a test of flying skills but a challenge to deeply ingrained societal norms and
prejudices. The airfield in Tuskegee, Alabama, became a bastion of hope and courage for a group of young Black
men who dared to prove their worth in a military that had long dismissed them as inferior.

Among them was Benjamin O. Davis Jr., a young man fueled by his father's legacy, Benjamin O. Davis Sr., the
first Black general in the U.S. Army. Growing up, Davis Jr. witnessed his father's challenges in a segregated military
system, but he also learned the value of resilience and honor. Following the family tradition, he sought to carve out
his path in the military despite the towering walls of discrimination that awaited him.

In 1941, as the Air Corps cautiously initiated its experiment to train Black individuals as combat pilots, Davis Jr.
was determined to rise above the prejudices that claimed to define him. On March 7, 1942, he and his fellow cadets
made history as they donned their uniforms for the first time as the nation's first African American military pilots.
After graduating from Tuskegee Army Air Field, Davis Jr. achieved the rank of Captain, a triumph that resonated
deeply in a society that relegated Black individuals to second-class status.

Yet, the path was fraught with challenges. The War Department, reflecting the prevailing racial attitudes, initially
had no intention of deploying these pilots into actual combat. In a world that suggested they were incapable, these
young aviators were dismissed to assignments in North Africa, where their chance for glory was as distant as the
168 | TUSKEGEE AIRMEN

enemy they were trained to fight. With little engagement with soldiers of the Axis Powers, their effectiveness was
unjustly evaluated, leading to frustrations and an early return to America.

However, Davis Jr. and his comrades were not ones to be quickly silenced. After pleading their case before Congress,
they were finally allowed to demonstrate their skills in combat by providing escort cover for white bomber crews.
The moment they took to the skies, the Tuskegee Airmen proved they were more than capable pilots; they were
extraordinary warriors. Their success became undeniable as they garnered the respect of their peers, who sought
their help for dangerous missions, even as the walls of prejudice continued to loom large around them.

Within this story, the backdrop of the Jim Crow South painted a somber picture. The townsfolk of Tuskegee
held steadfast to their racist beliefs, often threatening these brave men with arrest for merely existing in public
spaces. Racially biased personnel within the Air Corps echoed these sentiments, making it all too easy for cadets
to be dismissed with minimal cause. But Davis Jr. and his squadron faced these adversities with unwavering
determination.

In 1945, the culmination of their fight against segregation came to a head when members of the 477th
Bombardment Group staged a non-violent sit-in to integrate the "White Only" officers' club at Freemen Field in
Indiana. This bold act challenged an unjust rule and a profound assertion of their rights as veterans and citizens.
They aimed to overturn an illegal Base Order and dismantle the barriers that had kept them in the shadows for far
too long.

Davis Jr.'s leadership was vital during this time of upheaval. An exemplary graduate from West Point, he had
endured the isolation and prejudice of military life, yet he emerged triumphant, graduating 35th in a class of 276
cadets. His command of the 99th Fighter Squadron and later the 332d Fighter Group during critical missions in
Europe shattered the narrative of racial inferiority. His bravery earned him accolades, including the Air Medal and
the Distinguished Flying Cross, solidifying his legacy as a pioneer for Black Americans in the armed forces.

As the war ended and military integration became a reality in 1948, Davis Jr.'s journey stood as a testament to
the sacrifices and struggles of the Tuskegee Airmen. They had not only fought valiantly in the skies but had also
fought for the dignity and rights of their race. Their story, filled with bravery, resilience, and the indomitable spirit
of change, continues to inspire generations, urging us all to recognize the power of courage in the face of adversity.

In the end, the legacy of the Tuskegee Airmen would not only reshape the future of the U.S. military. Still, it would
also echo the call for justice and equality beyond the confines of military service--reminding us that freedom is a
battlefield we must all engage in, and true leadership transcends the barriers society attempts to impose.

Overview and Description of the Essential Question

The Tuskegee Airmen was a group of African American military pilots who fought in World War II. They
were trained at the Tuskegee Army Airfield in Alabama, becoming the first Black aviators in the United States
Armed Forces. Both significant challenges and remarkable accomplishments marked their experiences as they faced
extensive racial discrimination and segregation within the military and society at large. Despite these obstacles,
the Tuskegee Airmen demonstrated exceptional skill and bravery in combat, ultimately earning a distinguished
reputation and paving the way for the integration of the armed forces. Exploring their journey reveals their
contributions to aviation, military history, and the broader struggle for civil rights and equality in America.

Staging the Question

The Tuskegee Airmen and what they represented for African Americans then and now centered around the 1925
War College Report. In November of 1925 the United States Army assembled in secret to discuss, "The Negro
Problem," (As it was coined) in combat roles and officer positions. This report is the basis on which the following
lesson is built. Read a few excerpts from the report to your students and pose the following question in small table
groups that will be shared with the class.

 1. What was the military's view on African Americans in combat roles?
 2. What evidence was given supporting their claim?
 3. How do you think the Tuskegee Airmen defied the status quo?
 4. After reading about the Tuskegee Airmen, has your viewpoint changed?

Question 1, Formative Task 1, Featured Sources

To explore this question, we will examine a variety of sources that highlight the experiences of the Tuskegee
Airmen and the broader context of racial discrimination during the war. After reviewing these sources, students
will engage in creating a reflective journal. In this journal, they will reflect on how the bravery and dedication of the
Tuskegee Airmen helped dismantle stereotypes and challenged institutional racism within the military. They will
write personal responses to specific excerpts from readings or interviews, considering how these narratives resonate
with contemporary issues of race and equality. Students will analyze the significance of the Tuskegee Airmen's
legacy and how their contributions changed military policy and inspired future generations in the fight for civil
rights. This journal will be a personal project that encourages critical thinking and allows students to synthesize
their understanding of the complex interplay between service, race, and societal change during this pivotal time in
American history.

Question 2, Formative Task 2, Featured Sources

The project focuses on the life and accomplishments of Benjamin O. Davis Jr., an influential figure in the U.S.
military and civil rights movement. By exploring his early life, military career, and pivotal role in advocating
for desegregation, we aim to understand the significance of his contributions to American history and the fight
for equality. His commitment to justice is highlighted through personal quotes and speeches that resonate with
his experiences and beliefs. Students will conduct research using the autobiography, "Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.
American," and an article written by Daniel Haulman titled " Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., as a Tuskegee Airman,"
to gather information about Davis's early life, military career, and contributions. (Information for both is in the
reference list). They will compile quotes and narratives that highlight his commitment to justice. Students will
create a biographical poster visually representing the key aspects of Davis's life and achievements using digital
tools or traditional art supplies. The poster will include images, timelines, and highlighted quotes illustrating his
influence on military desegregation. Students will present their posters to the class, sharing insights about Davis's
life and how his experiences shaped his drive for justice. This will promote discussion on the broader implications of
his work for civil rights and military integration. Following the presentations, students will write a short reflection
on what they learned about Benjamin O. Davis Jr. and how his legacy inspires advocacy for equality in the military
and beyond.

Question 3, Formative Task 3

Your third formative task asks you to participate in a Socratic Seminar and have a philosophical debate over the
170 | TUSKEGEE AIRMEN

essential question, "Who were the Tuskegee Airmen and what were their experiences. A Socratic Seminar is a
student-led, inquiry-based discussion where you, as the instructor, are a facilitator and not a participant. Attached
is a complete Google Slide presentation that will walk you through how to set up a Socratic correctly. The
presentation includes a student roster, a short vocabulary list, and reference to pertinent material.

Summative Performance Task

Students will research the history of the Tuskegee Airmen, focusing on their achievements and challenges, using
various credible sources like books and documentaries. They will create a timeline of key events and individuals,
connecting the Airmen's experiences to the broader Civil Rights Movement and comparing their challenges with
other civil rights issues.

Each student or group will organize their findings into a multimedia presentation featuring visuals for better
engagement. After presenting, they will write a one-page reflection on the Tuskegee Airmen's impact on modern
society and military practices. This reflection will address lessons for current and future leaders, the precedent for
diversity and inclusion, and ways to honor their legacy today.

Potential Civic Engagement

Students will organize a community event honoring the legacy of the Tuskegee Airmen. This could include a
guest speaker (a local historian or a veteran), a display of student projects from the summative and formative
assessments, and an open discussion forum about the importance of diversity in the military and society. Students
can be responsible for planning, marketing, and executing the event. This type of student agency fosters a sense of
community and civic responsibility.

Conclusion

As we become more conscious of how we as educators teach history, stories such as those about the Tuskegee
Airmen must be shared so that we are giving the students a complete picture of Black History. Using LaGarrett
King's framework, we ensure that future students understand the complexities in the early 20th century
surrounding race relations, black identity, segregation, and continued resistance.

Through their experiences, we gain insight into the complexities of race, identity, and the quest for civil rights
in America--a history that resonates today. By teaching through their stories, we can engage with the struggles
and triumphs that have shaped our present, fostering a deeper understanding of the ongoing fight for justice and
equality. Ultimately, the legacy of these African American military pilots reminds us that the pursuit of equality
is not just a historical struggle but a continuous journey that demands our attention and commitment in the face
172 | TUSKEGEE AIRMEN

of persistent racial challenges. Recognizing their sacrifices and achievements empowers us to advocate for a more
equitable society, ensuring that the lessons learned from their experiences are not forgotten.

CONCLUDING THOUGHTS

   Ken Carano

Approximately 80% of public school teachers in PK-12 are white (National Center for Educational Statistics,
2023), but the student body is more diverse than it has ever been. It is imperative that we begin teaching more
rounded stories that include diverse experiences rather than a narrow story that has traditionally been dominated
by white voices (Chandler & Branscombe, 2015). These are just a couple of reasons, teachers should be decentering
their own voices and allowing students to build critical analysis skills through exploring a diverse array of voices.
Teaching through rather than about and juxtaposing that with using a framework (in this case, Black Historical
Consciousness) is one way of doing this.

We hope you find these eleven inquiry lessons helpful in teaching through rather than about Black histories and
geographies while encouraging a more rounded method for learning about these voices and places. While we have
come to the conclusion of this book, the hope is that this is just the first volume and there will be future volumes
with many more stories and lessons that provide a wider array of Black histories and geographies in which readers
can have access.

If you are interested in participating and contributing topics to a future volume of this book, which fits within
the inquiry and Black Historical Consciousness frameworks we are using, feel free to send an email to
caranok@wou.edu. We will leave you with a list of resources below.
