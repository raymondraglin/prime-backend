About this Textbook

Good researchers have a host of tools at their disposal that make navigating today's com-
plex information ecosystem much more manageable. Gaining the knowledge, abilities, and
self-reflection necessary to be a good researcher helps not only in academic settings, but is
invaluable in any career, and throughout one's life. The Information Literacy User's Guide will
start you on this route to success.

The Information Literacy User's Guide is based on two current models in information literacy:
The 2011 version of The Seven Pillars Model, developed by the Society of College, National
and University Libraries in the United Kingdom1 and the conception of information lit-
eracy as a metaliteracy, a model developed by one of this book's authors in conjunction with
Thomas Mackey, Dean of the Center for Distance Learning at SUNY Empire State Col-
lege.2 These core foundations ensure that the material will be relevant to today's students.

The Information Literacy User's Guide introduces students to critical concepts of information
literacy as defined for the information-infused and technology-rich environment in which
they find themselves. This book helps students examine their roles as information creators
and sharers and enables them to more effectively deploy related skills.This textbook includes
relatable case studies and scenarios, many hands-on exercises, and interactive quizzes.

Reviewer's Notes

The Information Literacy User's Guide: An Open, Online Textbook is written for teaching-librar-
ians and faculty who conduct instruction either online or face-to-face. It is a contemporary
take on what the information literate learner should know in the 21st century. Using the 7
Pillars of Information Literacy as the framework, the textbook is a hands-on step by step
guide that can be incorporated in for-credit courses, embedded librarian projects and also
one-shot instruction sessions.

The question many librarians and academics struggle with today is what does it mean to be
information literate in the 21st century? Oftentimes we look at the technological innova-
tions that has changed the very nature of information as the catalyst for this disruption, but
this textbook challenges us to think about the information cycle from the base levels (what
is a book, what is an article etc.) to the broader and deeper questions about information,
like what ownership means in in our participatory culture. It transcends the basic pretense
that technology has changed the meaning of information literacy and delves deeper into
looking at networks, both physical and virtual and the information gathering and creation
inside those networks.

The book examines information literacy as it relates to the liberal arts, as well as the hard
sciences, and is layered with excellent classroom examples that can be incorporated in
classes with a research component. The textbook is ideal for undergraduate level work and
could be used as a companion piece to a discipline-focused class, like Anthropology or
Chemistry, or could be used as the base text to an information literacy course.

Conclusion
                 Introduction

You may be using this book for any one of a variety of reasons. It may have been assigned
by a professor, in whole or in part. You may be using it to enhance your research techniques
for your classes. Or you may see the importance of being savvy about information use and
production, and have decided to learn more on your own. After all, our world is defined
by our easy access to information. In fact, as is often said, we are drowning in information.
Some is valuable. Some is worthless. And some is just fun, in its proper context. As you
know, information comes in many different formats and sometimes, depending on the con-
tent, information in one format can be in any of these categories. For example, a tweet could
be valuable (maybe an expert on a topic has just announced something groundbreaking),
worthless ("Going shopping. Looking for socks that don't fall down."), or fun (I'll let you
decide what that message might be). So it seems that information content, context, and
quality matter more than what kind of package or format the information takes. You will
have a chance to read more about this later in the book. And accessing information is just
one component; there is also your role as an information producer. We'll get to that, too.
You will learn a number of ways to enhance your abilities to work with the information that
surrounds you.

So let's start at the beginning. This book is entitled The Information Literacy User's Guide. If
you are information literate, you are adept at working with information. But a user's guide
can still be of assistance, since there are so many components to information. You, the au-
thors, and just about everyone is better versed in working with some aspects of information
than with others. While you will find elements in this book that you are totally up to speed
on, there will be others that you have less familiarity with. Hence, the value of a user's guide.

While this textbook refers to information literacy throughout, there are a variety of different
models and subsets of information literacy: visual literacy, science literacy, digital literacy,
information fluency, media literacy, and many more. Let's highlight just one: metaliteracy.
The originators of this model think of it as information literacy for today's open, networked,
collaborative information environment. It also places an emphasis on metacognition, or
thinking about your own thinking. Being able to find and use information well means real-
izing what you know, what you don't, and what you need to learn, and thinking about these
categories throughout the process. It means being aware of how one is interacting with
information, and not just reverting to long-standing habits only because they are familiar.
There is a list of learning objectives for metaliterate learners at the end of this chapter, but
we continue to identify occasional small changes to the objectives. The most current version
can be found at http://metaliteracy.org.
The Information Literacy User's Guide  Introduction

You might think of the learning objectives as one of those headlines you see on magazine
covers while waiting in a grocery store checkout lane: 1

          6 Symptoms You Shouldn't Ignore
          50 People Who Make Your Life Better
          Get 30% Richer This Year: Very Smart Money Tips
          4 Panza-Blasting Moves for a Tighter Bod

Maybe there should be some catchy, motivational title for these learning objectives. (If you
have a good idea, send it to one of the authors.) But, in seriousness, being aware of your own
thought processes and working towards becoming more proficient in the areas included in
the metaliteracy learning objectives will help you in your academic endeavors and in your
everyday life. When you finish reading this introduction, take a look at the list. Are there
items that you do well? Are there others that you just need to remember to follow through
on? Possibly some will be less familiar to you. Recognize that they are empowering behav-
iors and attributes that will advance your abilities in school, the workplace, and in daily life.
Knowing this may well provide the motivation to follow through with the readings and
exercises in the upcoming chapters.

This book is arranged using a model called the SCONUL Seven Pillars of Information Lit-
eracy (http://www.sconul.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/coremodel.pdf ). The model
was developed in the United Kingdom, and revised in 2011, to reflect today's information
world. As you would expect, its visual representation shows pillars, each one labeled with a
one-word access point to a larger concept. The pillars, with short explanatory descriptions,
are

Identify (understanding your information need)

Scope (knowing what is available)

Plan (developing research strategies)

Gather (finding what you need)

Evaluate (assessing your research process and findings)

Manage (organizing information effectively and ethically)

Present (sharing what you've learned)

The authors of this book have added two additional chapters to engage you in important
areas not specifically represented by the pillars:

was on Marie Claire, February 2013, and the last was on Cosmopolitan, Spring 2013.

                                                 2
The Information Literacy User's Guide  Introduction

Visual Literacy (applying information literacy to visual materials)

Science Literacy (information literacy in the sciences)

The developers of the Seven Pillars model explain that an individual can be more expert in
some areas than others, and has the ability to increase their expertise. But interestingly, they
also mention that people can become less expert in the areas designated by the pillars. How
might that be? If you learned something, and then learned more, you become more adept,
right? They make the point, however, that because the information environment shifts all
the time, it is possible people won't keep up, and thus become less proficient. So just as
someone can climb one of the pillars, so too can he or she slip down.

Each of the seven areas incorporates both abilities and understandings. The abilities in-
clude what an individual can do. The understandings cover both attitude and behaviors.
For example, someone might be aware that they should carefully evaluate the information
they find and know how to go about it, yet not care enough to actually do it. Abilities and
understandings work together to enable information literacy. Near the beginning of each
chapter, you will find pertinent abilities and understandings lists taken from the Seven
Pillars model.

As mentioned earlier, you are likely skilled at some of the elements the book will be dis-
cussing, less so at others. In other words, you will have ascended some of the pillars more
than others. This is true of the authors themselves. We teach information literacy and call
ourselves experts. But we can still learn from our colleagues' chapters on various facets of
the nine areas covered in this book. We hope you will also find this to be the case.

This introductory chapter is intended to be short, and will end with an important recom-
mendation: As you learn from this textbook, remember to reflect on your new knowledge,
skills, and attitudes.What are you doing differently? Did you find particular new approaches
to locating or sharing information that work better? Why? Are you evaluating information
more consistently? Differently? Do you feel more comfortable as an information producer?
If you continue to ask yourself questions like these, and follow through based on your
responses, your proficiency with information will last far beyond your memory of reading
this textbook.

Appendix

Developing Metaliterate Learners

Metaliteracy learning falls into four domains: behavioral (what students should be able
to do upon successful completion of learning activities--skills, competencies), cognitive
(what students should know upon successful completion of learning activities--compre-
hension, organization, application, evaluation), affective (changes in learners' emotions or
attitudes through engagement with learning activities), and metacognitive (what learners
think about their own thinking--a reflective understanding of how and why they learn,
what they do and do not know, their preconceptions, and how to continue to learn). Each
aspect of the main metaliteracy learning goals presented below applies to one or more of
these categories, and is labeled as such (B for behavioral, C for cognitive, A for affective, M
for metacognitive).

The learning objectives recognize that metaliterate "learners," as they are called here, must
learn continually, given the constantly and rapidly evolving information landscape. Instruc-
tors and learners can meet these objectives in a variety of ways, depending on the learning
context, choosing from a menu of learning activities. The objectives are conceived broadly,
so as to remain scalable, reproducible, and accessible in a range of contexts.

Goal 1: Evaluate content critically, including dynamic, online content that changes and
evolves, such as article preprints, blogs, and wikis.

    1. Place an information source in its context (for example, author's purpose, format
         of information, and delivery mode) in order to ascertain the value of the material
         for that particular situation. (B, C)

    2. Distinguish between editorial commentary and information presented from a
         more research-based perspective, recognizing that values and beliefs are em-
         bedded in all information. (C)

    3. Determine the value of formal and informal information from various networked
         sources (scholarly, user-generated, OERs, etc.). (C)

    4. Evaluate user response as an active researcher; understand the differing natures of
         feedback mechanisms and context in traditional and social media platforms. (B,
         C)

    5. Appreciate the importance of assessing content from different sources, including
         dynamic content from social media, critically. (A)

                                                 4
The Information Literacy User's Guide     Introduction

Goal 2: Understand personal privacy, information ethics, and intellectual property issues in
changing technology environments.

    1. Differentiate between the production of original information and remixing or
         re-purposing open resources. (C)

    2. Distinguish the kinds of information appropriate to reproduce and share publicly,
         and private information disseminated in more restricted/discreet environments.
         (C)

    3. Use technology to build a positive web presence. (B)

    4. Apply copyright and Creative Commons licensing as appropriate to the creation
         of original or repurposed information. (B)

    5. Recognize the ethical considerations of sharing information. (A)

Goal 3: Share information and collaborate in a variety of participatory environments.

    1. Participate conscientiously in collaborative environments. (B)

    2. Take responsibility for participation in collaborative environments. (A)

    3. Compare the unique attributes of different information formats (e.g., scholarly
         article, blog, wiki, online community), and have the ability to use these effectively
         and to cite information for the development of original content. (B)

    4. Describe the potential impact of online resources for sharing information (text,
         images, video, and other media) in collaboration with others. (A)

    5. Demonstrate the ability to translate information presented in one manner to
         another in order to best meet the needs of particular audiences; integrate infor-
         mation from multiple sources into coherent new forms. (M, C)

    6. Effectively communicate personal and professional experiences to inform and
         assist others; and recognize that learners can also be teachers. (A, B)

    7. Produce original content appropriate to specific needs in multiple media formats;
         transfer knowledge gained to new formats in unpredictable and evolving environ-
         ments. (B)

    8. Value user-generated content and critically evaluate contributions made by
         others: see self as a producer, as well as consumer, of information. (A)

    9. Be open to global perspectives; use communication with others in a global
         context to encourage deep learning. (A)

                                       5
The Information Literacy User's Guide     Introduction

Goal 4: Demonstrate ability to connect learning and research strategies with lifelong
learning processes and personal, academic, and professional goals.

    1. Determine scope of the question or task required to meet one's needs. (C)

    2. Reevaluate needs and next steps throughout the process. (C)

    3. Demonstrate the importance of matching information needs and search strate-
         gies to appropriate search tools. (C)

    4. Use self-reflection to assess one's own learning and knowledge of the learning
         process. (M)

    5. Demonstrate the ability to think critically in context and to transfer critical
         thinking to new learning. (M)

    6. Value persistence, adaptability, and flexibility. (M)

    7. Communicate effectively with collaborators in shared spaces and learn from
         multiple points of view. (M)

    8. Recognize that learning is a process and that reflecting on errors or mistakes leads
         to new insights and discoveries. (M)

    9. Engage in informed, self-directed learning that encourages a broader worldview
         through the global reach of today's information technology. (M)

    10. Demonstrate self-empowerment through interaction and the presentation of
         ideas; gain the ability to see what is transferable, translatable, and teachable
         (learners are both students and teachers). (M)

    11. Conclude that metaliteracy is a lifelong value and practice. (M)

                Identify

In this chapter, you will learn about the first pillar of information literacy. While the pillars
are normally presented in a certain order, it is important to remember that they are not in-
tended to be a step-by-step guide to be followed in a strict order. In most research projects,
you will find that you move back and forth between the different pillars as you discover
more information and come up with more questions about your topic. In this chapter you
will learn how to identify your information need so that you can begin your research, but
it is likely that you will also revisit some of the ideas in this chapter to make sure you are
actually meeting that need with your research findings.

A person proficient in the Identify pillar is expected to be able to identify a personal need
for information. They understand

          That new information and data is constantly being produced and that there is
              always more to learn

          That being information literate involves developing a learning habit so new
              information is being actively sought all the time

          That ideas and opportunities are created by investigating/seeking information

Proficiencies in the Identify pillar

Scenario

Norm Allknow was having trouble. He had been using computers since he was five years
old and thought he knew all there was to know about them. So, when he was given an
assignment to write about the impact of the Internet on society, he thought it would be a
breeze. He would just write what he knew, and in no time the paper would be finished. In
fact, Norm thought the paper would probably be much longer than the required ten pages.
He spent a few minutes imagining how impressed his teacher was going to be, and then sat
down to start writing.

                         8
The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 1: Identify

He wrote about how the Internet had helped him to play online games with his friends,
and to keep in touch with distant relatives, and even to do some homework once in a while.
Soon he leaned back in his chair and looked over what he had written. It was just half a
page long and he was out of ideas.

Identifying a Personal Need for
Information

One of the first things you need to do when beginning any information-based project is
to identify your personal need for information. This may seem obvious, but it is something
many of us take for granted. We may mistakenly assume, as Norm did in the above example,
that we already know enough to proceed. Such an assumption can lead us to waste valuable
time working with incomplete or outdated information. Information literacy addresses a
number of abilities and concepts that can help us to determine exactly what our informa-
tion needs are in various circumstances. These are discussed below, and are followed by
exercises to help develop your fluency in this area.

Understanding the Context of an
Information Need

When you realize that you have an information need it may be because you thought you
knew more than you actually do, or it may be that there is simply new information you
were not aware of. One of the most important things you can do when starting to research
a topic is to scan the existing information landscape to find out what is already out there.
We'll get into more specific strategies for accessing different types of information later in
the book, particularly in the Gather chapter, but for now it pays to think more broadly
about the information environment in which you are operating.

For instance, any topic you need information about is constantly evolving as new informa-
tion is added to what is known about the topic. Trained experts, informed amateurs, and
opinionated laypeople are publishing in traditional and emerging formats; there is always
something new to find out. The scale of information available varies according to topic, but
in general it's safe to say that there is more information accessible now than ever before.

Due to the extensive amount of information available, part of becoming more information
literate is developing habits of mind and of practice that enable you to continually seek
new information and to adapt your understanding of topics according to what you find.

The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 1: Identify

Because of the widely varying quality of new information, evaluation is also a key element
of information literacy, and will be addressed in the Evaluate chapter of this book.

Finally, while you are busy searching for information on your current topic, be sure to keep
your mind open for new avenues or angles of research that you haven't yet considered.
Often the information you found for your initial need will turn out to be the pathway to a
rich vein of information that can serve as raw material for many subsequent projects.

When you understand the information environment where your information need is situ-
ated, you can begin to define the topic more clearly and you can begin to understand where
your research fits in with related work that precedes it. Your information literacy skills will
develop against this changing background as you use the same underlying principles to do
research on a variety of topics.

From Information Need to Research
Question

Norm was abruptly confronted by his lack of knowledge when he realized that he had
nothing left to say on his topic after writing half a page. Now that he is aware of that
shortcoming, he can take steps to rectify it.

Your own lack of knowledge may become apparent in other ways. When reading an article
or textbook, you may notice that something the author refers to is completely new to you.
You might realize while out walking that you can't identify any of the trees around your
house. You may be assigned a topic you have never heard of.

    Exercise: Identifying What You Don't Know

      Wherever you are, look around you. Find one thing in your immediate field of view
      that you can't explain.

      What is it that you don't understand about that thing?

      What is it that you need to find out so that you can understand it?

      How can you express what you need to find out?

      For example: You can't explain why your coat repels water. You know that it's plastic,
      and that it's designed to repel water, but can't explain why this happens. You need
      to find out what kind of plastic the coat is made of and the chemistry or physics of
      that plastic and of water that makes the water run off instead of soaking through.
      (The terminology in your first explanation would get more specific once you did some
      research.)

All of us lack knowledge in countless areas, but this isn't a bad thing. Once we step back and
acknowledge that we don't know something, it opens up the possibility that we can find out
all sorts of interesting things, and that's when the searching begins.

Taking your lack of knowledge and turning it into a search topic or research question starts
with being able to state what your lack of knowledge is. Part of this is to state what you
already know. It's rare that you'll start a search from absolute zero. Most of the time you've
at least heard something about the topic, even if it is just a brief reference in a lecture or
reading. Taking stock of what you already know can help you to identify any erroneous
assumptions you might be making based on incomplete or biased information. If you think
you know something, make sure you find at least a couple of reliable sources to confirm that
knowledge before taking it for granted. Use the following exercise to see if there is anything
that needs to be supported with background research before proceeding.

    Exercise: Taking Stock of What You Already Know

      As discussed above, part of identifying your own information need is giving yourself
      credit for what you already know about your topic. Construct a chart using the fol-
      lowing format to list whatever you already know about the topic.

      Name your topic at the top.

      In the first column, list what you know about your topic.

      In the second column, briefly explain how you know this (heard it from the professor,
      read it in the textbook, saw it on a blog, etc.).

      In the last column, rate your confidence in that knowledge. Are you 100% sure of this
      bit of knowledge, or did you just hear it somewhere and assume it was right?

      When you've looked at everything you think you know about the topic and why, step
      back and look at the chart as a whole. How much do you know about the topic, and
      how confident are you about it? You may be surprised at how little or how much you
      already know, but either way you will be aware of your own background on the topic.
      This self-awareness is key to becoming more information literate.

      This exercise gives you a simple way to gauge your starting point, and may help you
      identify specific gaps in your knowledge of your topic that you will need to fill as you
      proceed with your research. It can also be useful to revisit the chart as you work on
      your project to see how far you've progressed, as well as to double check that you
      haven't forgotten an area of weakness.

The Information Literacy User's Guide                  Chapter 1: Identify

What do you know? How do you know it?                  are you in this
                                                        knowledge?

OnceKyWouH'veL1clearly stated what you do know, it should be easier to state what you don't
know. Keep in mind that you are not attempting to state everything you don't know. You are
only stating what you don't know in terms of your current information need. This is where
you define the limits of what you are searching for. These limits enable you to meet both
size requirements and time deadlines for a project. If you state them clearly, they can help
to keep you on track as you proceed with your research. You can learn more about this in
the Scope chapter of this book.

One useful way to keep your research on track is with a "KWHL" chart. This type of chart
enables you to state both what you know and what you want to know, as well as providing
space where you can track your planning, searching and evaluation progress. For now, just
fill out the first column, but start thinking about the gaps in your knowledge and how
they might inform your research questions. You will learn more about developing these
questions and the research activities that follow from them as you work through this
book.

   What do you     What do you Want    information on     What have you
  already Know       to know about       your topic?   Learned about your
about your topic?       your topic?
                                                                topic?

KWHL2

Defining a research question can be more difficult than it seems. Your initial questions may
be too broad or too narrow. You may not be familiar with specialized terminology used in
the field you are researching. You may not know if your question is worth investigating at
all.

                                                12
The Information Literacy User's Guide      Chapter 1: Identify

These problems can often be solved by a preliminary investigation of existing published
information on the topic. As previously discussed, gaining a general understanding of the
information environment helps you to situate your information need in the relevant context
and can also make you aware of possible alternative directions for your research. On a more
practical note, however, reading through some of the existing information can also provide
you with commonly used terminology, which you can then use to state your own research
question, as well as in searches for additional information. Don't try to reinvent the wheel,
but rely on the experts who have laid the groundwork for you to build upon.

Once you have identified your own lack of knowledge, investigated the existing informa-
tion on the topic, and set some limits on your research based on your current information
need, write out your research question or state your thesis. The next exercise will help you
transform the question you have into an actual thesis statement. You'll find that it's not
uncommon to revise your question or thesis statement several times in the course of a
research project. As you become more and more knowledgeable about the topic, you will
be able to state your ideas more clearly and precisely, until they almost perfectly reflect the
information you have found.

    Exercise: Research Question/Thesis Statement/Search Terms

      Since this chapter is all about determining and expressing your information need,
      let's follow up on thinking about that with a practical exercise. Follow these steps
      to get a better grasp of exactly what you are trying to find out, and to identify some
      initial search terms to get you started.

        1. Whatever project you are currently working on, there should be some question
             you are trying to answer. Write your current version of that question here.

        2. Now write your proposed answer to your question. This may be the first draft of
             your thesis statement which you will attempt to support with your research, or
             in some cases, the first draft of a hypothesis that you will go on to test experi-
             mentally. It doesn't have to be perfect at this point, but based on your current
             understanding of your topic and what you expect or hope to find is the answer
             to the question you asked.

        3. Look at your question and your thesis/hypothesis, and make a list of the terms
             common to both lists (excluding "the", "and", "a", etc.). These common terms
             are likely the important concepts that you will need to research to support your
             thesis/hypothesis. They may be the most useful search terms overall or they
             may only be a starting point.

      If none of the terms from your question and thesis/hypothesis lists overlap at all, you
      might want to take a closer look and see if your thesis/hypothesis really answers your
      research question. If not, you may have arrived at your first opportunity for revision.
      Does your question really ask what you're trying to find out? Does your proposed
      answer really answer that question? You may find that you need to change one or
      both, or to add something to one or both to really get at what you're interested in. This
      is part of the process, and you will likely discover that as you gather more information
      about your topic, you will find other ways that you want to change your question or
      thesis to align with the facts, even if they are different from what you hoped.

A Wider View

While the identification of an information need is presented in this chapter as the first
step in the research process, many times the information need you initially identified will
change as you discover new information and connections. Other chapters in this book deal
with finding, evaluating, and managing information in a variety of ways and formats. As
you become more skilled in using different information resources, you will likely find that
the line between the various information literacy skills becomes increasingly blurred, and
that you will revisit your initial ideas about your topic in response to both the information
you're finding and what you're doing with what that information.

Continually think about your relationship to the information you find. Why are you doing
things the way you are? Is it really the best way for your current situation? What other
options are there? Keeping an open mind about your use of information will help you to
ensure that you take responsibility for the results of that use, and will help you to be more
successful in any information-intensive endeavor.

                 Scope

A person who is information literate in the Scope pillar is able to assess current knowledge
and identify gaps.

The above statement is from the Seven Pillars of Information Literacy, the model of in-
formation literacy presented in the Introduction of this book. The following list, from the
creators of the Seven Pillars model, provides more detail about the Scope pillar. Compo-
nents include:

          "Know what you don't know" to identify any information gaps
          Identify which types of information will best meet the need
          Identify the available search tools, such as general and subject specific

              resources at different levels
          Identify different formats in which information may be provided
          Demonstrate the ability to use new tools as they become available
Additionally the information literate person in the Scope pillar understands
          What types of information are available
          The characteristics of the different types of information source available to

              them and how they may be affected by the format (digital, print)
          The publication process in terms of why individuals publish and the currency

              of information

Now let's examine these concepts.

Scenario

Harry and Sally Dennis have lived in central New York State for 25 years. They work as
teachers in the Cortland City School District. Lately, they have been closely following the
debate about hydraulic fracturing or fracking in New York State and are concerned about
their ability to influence the course of fracking in the future. Although they don't own
much land, they are worried about the possible adverse effect on drinking water, disruption
to their environment, and the influx of people that fracking-related jobs will bring into
their city. Sally Dennis is considering running for public office in her town to have a more

                                                16
The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 2: Scope

powerful voice in the fracking debate. To receive the backing of her local political party,
Sally needs to present some persuasive arguments against hydraulic fracking that are well
thought out and scientifically sound. She needs to engage in substantial research on this
issue so that she can present herself as an expert.

At this point, all that Sally really knows about fracking is what she has heard from neighbors
and news shows. How will she proceed with her research? Sally's intentions are laudable
and she knows she will have to fill in the information gaps in her fracking issue knowledge
before she can be taken seriously as a candidate for city office. Knowing that you don't have
sufficient information to solve an information need is one important aspect of information
literacy. It enables you to obtain that missing information.

More in-depth informationDifferent Information Formats and
Their Characteristics

In addition to knowing that you are missing essential information, another component
of information literacy is understanding that the information you seek may be available
in different formats such as books, journal articles, government documents, blog postings,
and news items. Each format has a unique value. The graphic below represents a common
process of information dissemination. When an event happens, we usually hear about it
from news sources--broadcast, web, and print. More in-depth exploration and analysis
of the event often comes from government studies and scholarly journal articles. Deeper
exploration, as well as an overview of much of the information available about the event, is
often published in book format.

                               News

The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 2: Scope

Sally realizes that she needs to obtain an overview of the whole fracking debate. She needs
to determine how severe the consequences of fracking could be and what is actually in-
volved in the fracking process. Where can she find such an overview and how can she trust
that the overview is accurate and complete?

Sally believes that she can find this information online and uses Google to search the World
Wide Web. She quickly finds that there is an overwhelming amount of online information
about fracking. Her search has resulted in more than 11,000,000 sites. Sally knows that she
doesn't have to peruse all of these resources, but those that she does examine do not provide
a comprehensive overview of the issues. She also notices that many of the sites are obviously
advocating their own point of view.

A better first step is to identify a library that contains academic resources so that Sally will
have access to more scholarly treatments of the subject. Sally can use the SUNY union
catalog or Worldcat.org (that will allow her to search numerous academic libraries at once).

Library Catalogs

A library catalog is a database that contains all of the items located in a library as well as all
of the items to which the library has access. It allows you to search for items by title, author,
subject, and keyword. A keyword is a word that is found anywhere within the record of an
item in the catalog. A catalog record displays information that is pertinent to one item,
which could be a book, a journal, a government document, or a video or audio recording.

If you search by subject in an academic library catalog you can take advantage of the con-
trolled vocabulary created by the Library of Congress. Controlled vocabulary consists of
terms or phrases that have been selected to describe a concept. For example, the Library
of Congress has selected the phrase "Motion Picture" to represent films and movies. So, if
you are looking for books about movies, you would enter the phrase "Motion Picture" into
the search box. Controlled vocabulary is important because it helps pull together all of the
items about one topic. In this example, you would not have to conduct individual searches
for movies, then motion pictures, then film; you could just search once for motion pictures
and retrieve all the items on movies and film. You can discover subject terms in item catalog
records.

Many libraries provide catalog discovery interfaces that provide cues to help refine a search.
This makes it easier to find items on specific topics. For example, if Sally enters the search
terms "Hydraulic Fracturing" into a catalog with a discovery interface, the results page will
include suggestions for refinements including several different aspects of the topic. Sally
can click on any of these suggested refinements to focus her search.

Using this method, Sally finds several good resources on her topic, now she needs to locate
them. The SUNY catalog will provide a list of the institutions that own the book she wants

                                                18
The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 2: Scope

to read. She can then link to the institution's own library catalog to find out more informa-
tion on the location and status of the item.

Why should Sally choose books instead of another format? Books can provide an overview
of a broad topic. Often, the author has gathered the information from multiple sources and
created an easy to understand overview. Sally can later look for corroborating evidence in
government documents and journal articles. Books are a good information resource for this
stage of her research.

Once Sally starts to locate useful information resources, she realizes that there are further
gaps in her knowledge. How does she decide which books to use? She needs the most
current information, because she certainly doesn't want to get caught spouting outdated
information.

Looking at publication date will help her to choose the most recent items.

How can she get these books? She is not a SUNY student or faculty member.

Interlibrary loan services at her public library will allow her to access books from an aca-
demic library or the college in her area may allow community members to borrow materials.
There is a wealth of knowledge contained in the resources of academic and public libraries
throughout the United States. Single libraries can't hope to collect all of the resources
available on a topic. Fortunately, libraries are happy to share their resources and they do this
through interlibrary loan. Interlibrary loan allows you to borrow books and other informa-
tion resources regardless of where they are located. If you know that a book exists, ask your
library to request it through their interlibrary loan program. This service is available at both
academic and most public libraries.

Checking for Further Knowledge Gaps

Sally has had a chance to review the books that she chose and although her understanding
of the issues associated with fracking has improved, she still needs more specific informa-
tion from the point of view of the energy industry, the government, and the scientific
community. Sally knows that if she doesn't investigate all points of view, she will not be able
to speak intelligently about the issues involved in the fracking debate. Where will she get
this information? Because this information should be as current as possible, much of it will
not be available in book format. Sally will need to look for scholarly journal articles and
government documents. It is not likely that the public library will have the depth and scope
of information that Sally now needs. Fortunately, Sally has just enrolled in a class at her
local SUNY school and is able to use the resources at this academic library. However, when
Sally visits the library, she finds that the amount of information available is overwhelming.
There are many databases that will help Sally find journal articles on almost any topic. There
are also many kinds of government information, some in article format, some as documents,

                                                19
The Information Literacy User's Guide      Chapter 2: Scope

and some as published rules and regulations. Sally suddenly feels out of her element and
doesn't have any idea of where to start her research.

Databases

Sally should start her search for journal articles with research databases. Research databases
contain records of journal articles, documents, book chapters, and other resources. Online
library catalogs differ from other research databases in that they contain only the items
available through a particular library or library system. Research databases are often either
broad or comprehensive collections and are not tied to the physical items available at any
one library. Many databases provide the full-text of articles and can be searched by subject,
author, or title. Another type of database provides just the information about articles and
may provide tools for you to find the full text in another database. The databases that
contain resources for a vast array of subjects are referred to as general or multidisciplinary
databases. Other databases are devoted to a single subject, and are known as subject-specific
databases. Databases are made up of:

          Records: A record contains descriptive information that is pertinent to
              one item which may be a book, a chapter, an article, a document, or other
              information unit.

          Fields: These are part of the record and they contain information that
              pertains to one aspect of an item such as the title, author, publication date,
              and subject.

          The subject field can sometimes be labeled subject heading or descriptor. This
              is the field that contains controlled vocabulary. Controlled vocabulary in a
              database is similar to controlled vocabulary in a Library Catalog, but each
              database usually has a unique controlled vocabulary unrelated to Library
              of Congress classifications. Many databases will make their controlled
              vocabulary available in a thesaurus. If the database you are searching does
              not have a thesaurus, use the subject field in a record to find relevant subject
              terms.

Below is the first screen of a subject specific database called GEORef. This database covers
technical literature on geology and geophysics. The thesaurus is circled. Clicking on the
thesaurus allows you to find controlled vocabulary that will focus your search. In this search,
Sally has typed the word "fracking" in the search box and only retrieved 23 records. When
Sally uses the controlled vocabulary phrase "hydraulic fracturing," she is able to increase
her search results. In fact, she has retrieved too many records. Now she wants to limit her
search, but she still wants to obtain the most relevant articles available.

The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 2: Scope

Boolean Operators

One way to limit a database search is to use Boolean operators; words you can add to a
search to narrow or broaden your search results. They are and, or, and not. You can usually
find these words in the advanced search query area of a database. And will narrow your
search. For example, if you are interested in fresh water fishing you would enter the terms
"fish and freshwater." Your results would then include records that only contained both of
these words.

                  Fish Search Your Freshwater

The green overlapping area in the diagram above represents the results from the "fish and
freshwater" search.

The Information Literacy User's Guide                       Chapter 2: Scope

Or will broaden your search and is usually used with synonyms. If you are interested in
finding information on mammals found in the Atlantic Ocean, you could enter the terms
"whales or dolphins".

both of your search terms will be in your results list.

The larger green circle represents the results that you would retrieve with this search.
Let's go back to Sally's search of the GEORef database. If you remember, she searched the
controlled vocabulary term, "hydraulic fracturing." She can use and with the phrase "Mar-
cellus Shale" to focus and limit her results. Sally's search query is now "hydraulic fracturing
and Marcellus Shale." You can see this represented below. The overlapping area represents
the records this search will retrieve.

Database searching can seem confusing at first, but the more you use databases, the easier it
gets and most of the time, the results you are able to retrieve are superior to the results that
you will get from a simple internet search.

Other Information Sources

After taking some time to think about her goal, which is to present a persuasive
argument on why she would be a good candidate for public office, Sally decides to
concentrate on obtaining relevant government information. After all, she hopes to become
part of the government, so she should have some knowledge of the government's role in
the fracking issue.

Government information consists of any information produced by local, state, national,
or international governments and is usually available at no cost. However, sometimes it is
reproduced by a commercial entity with added value. Look for websites that are created by
official government entities, such as the U.S. Department of the Interior at http://www.
doi.gov/index.cfm and Thomas, the congressional website at Thomas.loc.gov. New York
State's website can be found at www.ny.gov. It contains information from all New York
State government branches. As Sally will discover, you can usually find a wealth of reliable
information in government sources.

Even though she has narrowed the scope of her search for information resources, Sally is
still confronted with a myriad of information formats. With help from a reference librarian,

                                                23
The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 2: Scope

Sally discovers a research guide on government information available in the library. She
notices that there is a section for New York State that she can explore.

She breathes a sigh of relief when she sees a whole section on the environment that in-
cludes a link to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation's website,
which has many documents and regulations on the topic of Hydraulic Fracturing. The
reference librarian continues to assist Sally to find the most useful information as she navi-
gates through the site. Since this information is freely available to the public, Sally is able to
access the site from home and spends many hours reading the documents.

Conclusion

Sally has demonstrated that she is competent in the Scope information literacy pillar. She
was able to determine that there were gaps in her knowledge and she formulated a plan to
locate information to close those gaps. Sally became aware that information was available
in many different formats and she was able to choose the formats that were most relevant
to her needs: books and government information. In addition, she was able to navigate a
complex information environment--the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation--to identify the information that was most useful for her purpose. She did
encounter some barriers:

          The information she found using Google was not useful because there was
              too much and it was biased.

          She had to determine which information formats would best serve her needs.
          Her public library didn't have the required information.
          She was overwhelmed by the resources available at the academic library.

Sally was able to overcome all of these common research pitfalls. Consulting a reference
librarian was a good way for her to obtain information that she might otherwise have not
thought to use.

    Exercise: Searching in Databases

        1. Search both the SUNY connect catalog and Worldcat.org to identify possible
             books that will provide the information that Sally is seeking. Choose a few re-
             sources based on information provided in catalog record and explain why these
             resources will help Sally solve her knowledge gap.

        2. Using an online catalog, identify both a print resource and an online resource on
             one specific topic. Compare these resources in terms of content and currency.
             Which resource would be most useful for obtaining an in depth understanding
             of the topic? Which would be more useful for gaining a broad overview of the
             topic?

3. Use a newspaper database, such as Proquest Historical Newspapers to find a
    newspaper article written shortly after a well-known news event such as the
    immediate results of the election for the President of the United States in 2000.
    Compare that information with the information that we now have on that con-
    tested Presidential Election. What is missing from the newspaper account?
    What are some possible information sources that would provide the missing
    information from the early reports?

                  Plan

Scenario

Sarah's art history professor just assigned the course project and Sarah is delighted that it
isn't the typical research paper. Rather, it involves putting together a website to help readers
understand a topic. It will certainly help Sarah get a grasp on the topic herself ! Learning by
attempting to teach others, she agrees, might be a good idea. The professor wants the web
site to be written for people who are interested in the topic and with backgrounds similar
to the students in the course. Sarah likes that a target audience is defined, and since she has
a good idea of what her friends might understand and what they would need more help
with, she thinks it will be easier to know what to include in her site. Well, at least easier than
writing a paper for an expert like her professor.

An interesting feature of this course is that the professor has formed the students into
teams. Sarah wasn't sure she liked this idea at the beginning, but it seems to be working out
okay. Sarah's team has decided that their topic for this website will be 19th century women
painters. But her teammate Chris seems concerned, "Isn't that an awfully big topic?" The
team checks with the professor, who agrees they would be taking on far more than they
could successfully explain on their website. He suggests they develop a draft thesis state-
ment to help them focus, and after several false starts, they come up with:

The involvement of women painters in the Impressionist movement had an effect upon the
subjects portrayed.

They decide this sounds more manageable. Because Sarah doesn't feel comfortable on the
technical aspects of setting up the website, she offers to start locating resources that will
help them to develop the site's content.

Before we learn more about what happens with Sarah and her team, let's look at the
components of the Plan pillar. The overall ability is: "Can construct strategies for locating
The Information Literacy User's Guide      Chapter 3: Plan

information and data." That is a fairly short sentence, but a great deal is packed into it. It
includes

          Understanding a range of searching techniques
          Understanding the various tools and how they differ
          Knowing how to create effective search strategies
          Being open to searching out the most appropriate tools
          Understanding that revising your search as you proceed is important
          Recognizing that subject terms are of value

And these are just the items to understand! There are also the things you need to be able
to do:

          Clearly phrase your search question.
          Develop an appropriate search strategy, using key techniques.
          Selecting good search tools, including specialized ones.
          Use the terms and techniques that are best suited to your search.

Here is a visual representation of these components:

Now, take a look at the essence of these items condensed into another concept map:

The second concept map is simplified. The focus is on the key elements: the tools and strat-
egies that you use and the mindset that will help you as you plan your research. This may
seem a bit daunting, so let's see how Sarah tackles the project. She sometimes falters, but
that happens even to experienced researchers. As you read through Sarah's quest for good
information, think about the range and appropriateness of the strategies she uses. What
would you do differently? What approaches seem to be good ones? (While there is some
mention of particular research tools and resources in this chapter, they will be discussed in
depth in the Gather chapter, and also in the Scope chapter.)

                    29
The Information Literacy User's Guide                         Chapter 3: Plan

As you read about Sarah's quest for information, and reflect on your own information
searches in the past, remember particularly the bullet within the Plan pillar that emphasizes
the need to revise your search as you work. It is very important to do this, and to build time
into the process so you are able to revise. As you learn more about your topic, or the terms
used in conjunction with its concepts, or key scholars in the field, it is only natural that you
will need to shift focus, and, perhaps, change course. This is a natural part of the research
process and indicates that your efforts are bearing fruit. Let's return to Sarah...

The next time the class meets, Sarah tells her teammates what she has done so far:

"I thought I'd start with some scholarly sources, since they should be helpful, right? I put a
search into the online catalog for the library, but nothing came up! The library should have
books on this topic, shouldn't it? I typed the search in exactly as we have it in our thesis
statement. That was so frustrating. Since that didn't work, I tried Google, and put in the
search. I got over 8 million results, but when I looked over the ones on the first page, they
didn't seem very useful. One was about the feminist art movement in the 1960s, not during
the Impressionist period. The results all seemed to have the words I typed highlighted,
but most really weren't useful. I am sorry I don't have much to show you. Do you think we
should change our topic?"

Alisha suggests that Sarah talk with a reference librarian. She mentions that a librarian
came to talk to another of her classes about doing research, and it was really helpful. Alisha
thinks that maybe Sarah shouldn't have entered the entire thesis statement as the search,
and maybe she should have tried databases to find articles. The team decides to brainstorm
all the search tools and resources they can think of.

Here's what they came up with:

Search Tools and Resources

The Information Literacy User's Guide                Chapter 3: Plan

Sarah and her team think that their list is pretty good. They decide to take it further and
list the advantages and limitations of each search tool, at least as far as they can determine.

Search Tools and Resources

          Jacobson_Media_Plan_04

Alisha suggests that Sarah should show the worksheet to a librarian and volunteers to go
with her. The librarian, Mr. Harrison, says they have made a really good start, but he can fill
them in on some other search strategies that will help them to focus on their topic. Would
Sarah and Alisha like to learn more?

Let's step back from this case study again, and think about the elements that someone
doing research should plan before starting to enter search terms in Google, Wikipedia, or
even a scholarly database. There is some preparation you can do to make things go much
more smoothly than they have for Sarah.

Self-Reflection

As you work through your own research quests, it is very important to be self-reflective. The
first couple of items in this list have been considered in the Identify chapter:

          What do you really need to find?
          Do you need to learn more about the general subject before you can identify

                                                31
The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 3: Plan

              the focus of your search?

          How thoroughly did you develop your search strategy?

          Did you spend enough time finding the best tools to search?

          What is going really well, so well that you'll want to remember to do it in the
              future?

Another term for what you are doing is metacognition, or thinking about your thinking.
Reflect on what Sarah is going through as you read this chapter. Does some of it sound
familiar based on your own experiences? You may already know some of the strategies
presented here. Do you do them the same way? How does it work? What pieces are new
to you? When might you follow this advice? Don't just let the words flow over you, rather
think carefully about the explanation of the process. You may disagree with some of what
you read. If you do, follow though and test both methods to see which provides better
results.

Selecting Search Tools

After you have thought the planning process through more thoroughly, start to think about
where you can look for information. Part of planning to do research is determining which
search tools will be the best ones to use. This applies whether you are doing scholarly
research or trying to answer a question in your everyday life, such as what would be the best
place to go on vacation. "Search tools" might be a bit misleading, since a person might be
the source of the information you need. Or it might be a web search engine, a specialized
database, an association--the possibilities are endless. Often people automatically search
Google first, regardless of what they are looking for. Choosing the wrong search tool may
just waste your time and provide only mediocre information, whereas other sources might
provide really spot-on information and quickly, too. In some cases, a carefully constructed
search on Google, particularly using the advanced search option, will provide the necessary
information, but other times it won't. This is true of all sources: make an informed choice
about which ones to use for a specific need.

So, how do you identify search tools? Let's begin with a first-rate method. For academic
research, talking with a librarian or your professor is a great start. They will direct you to
those specialized tools that will provide access to what you need. If you ask a librarian for
help, she or he may also show you some tips about searching in the resources. This chapter
will cover some of the generic strategies that will work in many search tools, but a librarian
can show you very specific ways to focus your search and retrieve the most useful items.

If neither your professor nor a librarian is available when you need help, check your school's
library website to see what guidance is provided. There will often be subject-related guides
or lists of the best resources to assist researchers. There may be a directory of the databases
the library subscribes to and the subjects they cover. Take advantage of the expertise of

                                                32
The Information Literacy User's Guide      Chapter 3: Plan

librarians by using such guides. Novice researchers usually don't think of looking for this
type of help, and, as a consequence, often waste time.

When you are looking for non-academic material, consider who cares about this type of
information. Who works with it? Who produces it or help guides for it? Some sources are
really obvious, and you are already using them--for example, if you need information about
the weather in London three days from now, you might check Weather.com for London's
forecast. You don't go to a library (in person or online), and you don't do a research database
search. For other information you need, think the same way. Are you looking for anecdotal
information on old railroads? Find out if there is an organization of railroad buffs. You can
search on the web for this kind of information, or, if you know about and have access to it,
you could check the Encyclopedia of Associations. This source provides entries for all U.S.
membership organizations, which can quickly lead you to a potentially wonderful source of
information. Librarians can point you to tools like these.

As you consider the information presented in this chapter, keep the scope of the informa-
tion you are looking for in mind. In the previous chapter we examined the topic of scope
in detail. The breadth and depth of the information you require will have an impact as you
plan.

Consider Asking an Expert

Have you thought about using people, not just inanimate sources, as a way to obtain infor-
mation? This might be particularly appropriate if you are working on an emerging topic or
a topic with local connections. There are a variety of reasons that talking with someone will
add to your research.

For personal interactions, there are other specific things you can do to obtain better results.
Do some background work on the topic before contacting the person you hope to interview.
The more familiarity you have with your topic and its terminology, the easier it will be to
ask focused questions. Focused questions are important if you want to get into the meat
of what you need. Asking general questions because you think the specifics might be too
detailed rarely leads to the best information. Acknowledge the time and effort someone
is taking to answer your questions, but also realize that people who are passionate about
subjects enjoy sharing what they know. Take the opportunity to ask experts about sources
they would recommend.

The Information Literacy User's Guide                          Chapter 3: Plan

Determining Search Concepts and
Keywords

Once you've selected some good resources for your topic, and possibly talked with an expert,
it is time to move on to identify words you will used to search for information on your topic
in various databases and search engines. This is sometimes referred to as building a search
query. When deciding what terms to use in a search, break down your topic into its main
concepts. Don't enter an entire sentence, or a full question. Different databases and search
engines process such queries in different ways, but many look for the entire phrase you enter
as a complete unit, rather than the component words. While some will focus on just the
important words, such as Sarah's Google search that you read about earlier in this chapter,
the results are often still unsatisfactory. The best thing to do is to use the key concepts
involved with your topic. In addition, think of synonyms or related terms for each concept.
If you do this, you will have more flexibility when searching in case your first search term
doesn't produce any or enough results. This may sound strange, since if you are looking for
information using a Web search engine, you almost always get too many results. Databases,
however, contain fewer items, and having alternative search terms may lead you to useful
sources. Even in a search engine like Google, having terms you can combine thoughtfully
will yield better results.

The following worksheet is an example of a process you can use to come up with search
terms. It illustrates how you might think about the topic of violence in high schools. Notice
that this exact phrase is not what will be used for the search. Rather, it is a starting point for
identifying the terms that will eventually be used.

>TOPIC: Violence in high schools

>CONCEPTS:                                    High School

The Information Literacy User's Guide                        Chapter 3: Plan

Now, use a clean copy of the same worksheet to think about the topic Sarah's team is
working on. How might you divide their topic into concepts and then search terms? Keep
in mind that the number of concepts will depend on what you are searching for. And that
the search terms may be synonyms or narrower terms. Occasionally, you may be searching
for something very specific, and in those cases, you may need to use broader terms as well.
Jot down your ideas then compare what you have written to the information on the second,
completed worksheet and identify 3 differences.

Boolean Operators

Once you have the concepts you want to search, you need to think about how you will enter
them into the search box. Often, but not always, Boolean operators will help you. You may
be familiar with Boolean operators. They provide a way to link terms. Boolean operators
are also discussed in the Scope chapter. The information in the two chapters complements
each other and reading about this important topic again provides a review for the topics
that overlap.

We will start by capturing the ideas of the women creating the art. We will use women
painters and women artists as the first step in our sample search. You could do to two sepa-
rate searches by typing one or the other of the terms into the search box of whatever tool
you are using:

                                            women painters

                                              women artists

You would end up with two separate result lists and have the added headache of trying to
identify unique items from the lists. You could also search on the phrase

                                 women painters and women artists

But once you understand Boolean operators, that last strategy won't make as much sense
as it seems to.

There are three Boolean operators: and, or, and not.

And is used to get the intersection of all the terms you wish to include in your search. With
this example

                                 women painters and women artists

you are asking that the items you retrieve have both of those terms. If an item only has
one term, it won't show up in the results. This is not what the searcher had in mind--she
is interested in both artists and painters, because she doesn't know which term might be
used. She doesn't intend that both terms have to be used. Let's go on to the next Boolean
operator, which will help us out with this problem.

Or is used when you want at least one of the terms to show up in the search results. If both
do, that's fine, but it isn't a condition of the search. So or makes a lot more sense for this
search:

                                  women painters or women artists

Now, if you want to get fancy with this search, you could use both and as well as or:

                                       37
The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 3: Plan

                                   women and (painters or artists)

The parentheses mean that these two concepts, painters and artists, should be searched as
a unit, and the search results should include all items that use one word or the other. The
results will then be limited to those items that contain the word women. If you decide to
use parentheses for appropriate searches, make sure that the items contained within them
are related in some way. With or, as in our example, it means either of the terms will work.
With and, it means that both terms will appear in the document.

Type both of these searches in Google Scholar (scholar.google.com) and compare the re-
sults. Were they the same? If not, can you determine what happened? Which result list
looked better?

Here is another example of a search string, using both parentheses and two Boolean
operators:

                            entrepreneurship and (adolescents or teens)

In this search, you are looking for entrepreneurial initiatives connected with people in their
teens. Because there are so many ways to categorize this age group, it makes sense to in-
dicate that either of these terms should appear in the results, along with entrepreneurship.

However, this search string isn't perfect. Can you pick out two problems with the search
terms?

The third Boolean operator, not, can be problematic. Not is used to exclude items from your
search. If you have decided, based on the scope of the results you are getting, to focus only
on a specific aspect of a topic, use not, but be aware that items are being lost in this search.
For example, if you entered

                     entrepreneurship and (adolescents or teens) not adults

you might lose some good results. Why? If you would like to see graphical representations
of the effects of Boolean operators, take a look at the Scope chapter in this book.

There is a good overview of Boolean operator use at http://libguides.mit.edu/content.

Other Helpful Search Techniques

Using Boolean operators isn't the only way you can create more useful searches. In this
section, we will review several others.

                                                38
The Information Literacy User's Guide      Chapter 3: Plan

Truncation

In this search:

Entrepreneurs and (adolescents or teens) you might think that the items that are retrieved
from the search can refer to entrepreneurs plural or entrepreneur singular. If you did, you
spotted a problem. Because computers are very literal, they usually look for the exact terms
you enter. While it is true that some search functions are moving beyond this model, you
want to think about alternatives, just to be safe. In this case, using the singular as well as the
plural form of the word might help you to find useful sources. Truncation, or searching on
the root of a word and whatever follows, lets you do this.

So, if you search on

                             Entrepreneur* and (adolescents or teens)

You will get items that refer either to the singular or plural version of the word entrepreneur,
but also entrepreneurship.

Look at these examples:

                                                adolescen*

                                                  educat*

Think of two or three words you might retrieve when searching on these roots. It is impor-
tant to consider the results you might get and alter the root if need be. An example of this
is polic*. Would it be a good idea to use this root if you wanted to search on policy or policies?
Why or why not?

In some cases, a symbol other than an asterisk is used. To determine what symbol to use,
check the help section in whatever resource you are using. The topic should show up under
the truncation or stemming headings.

Here is the same search terms worksheet you saw earlier, but with truncation acknowledged:

Phrase Searches

Phrase searches are particularly useful when searching the web. If you put the exact phrase
you want to search in quotation marks, you will only get items with those words as a phrase
and not items where the words appear separately in a document, website, or other resource.
Your results will usually be fewer, although surprisingly, this is not always the case.Try these
two searches in the search engine of your choice:

                                               "essay exam"

                                               essay exam

                                       40
The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 3: Plan

Was there a difference in the quality and quantity of results? If you would like to find out
if the database or search engine you are using allows phrase searching and the conventions
for doing so, search the help section. These help tools can be very, well, helpful!

Advanced Searches

Advanced searching allows you to refine your search query and prompts you for ways to
do this. Consider the basic Google.com search box. It is very minimalistic, but that mini-
malism is deceptive. It gives the impression that searching is easy and encourages you to just
enter your topic, without much thought, to get results. You certainly do get many results.
But are they really good results? Simple search boxes do many searchers a disfavor. There is
a better way to enter searches.

Advanced search screens show you many of the options available to you to refine your
search, and, therefore, get more manageable numbers of better items. Many web search
engines include advanced search screens, as do databases for searching research materials.
Advanced search screens will vary from resource to resource and from web search engine to
research database, but they often let you search using

          Implied Boolean operators (for example, the "all the words" option is the
              same as using the Boolean and)

          Limiters for date, domain (.edu, for example), type of resource (articles, book
              reviews, patents)

          Field (a field is a standard element, such as title of publication or author's
              name)

          Phrase (rather than entering quote marks)

Let's see how this works in practice.

    Exercise: Google Searches

      Go to the advanced search option in Google. You can find it at http://www.google.
      com/advanced_search

      Take a look at the options Google provides to refine your search. Compare this to
      the basic Google search box. One of the best ways you can become a better searcher
      for information is to use the power of advanced searches, either by using these more
      complex search screens or by remembering to use Boolean operators, phrase searches,
      truncation, and other options available to you in most search engines and databases.

      While many of the text boxes at the top of the Google Advanced Search page mirror
      concepts already covered in this chapter (for example, "this exact word or phrase"
      allows you to omit the quotes in a phrase search), the options for narrowing your
      results can be powerful. You can limit your search to a particular domain (such as .edu
      for items from educational institutions) or you can search for items you can reuse
      legally (with attribution, of course!) by making use of the "usage rights" option. How-
      ever, be careful with some of the options, as they may excessively limit your results. If

                                                41
The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 3: Plan

you aren't certain about a particular option, try your search with and without using it
and compare the results. If you use a search engine other than Google, check to see if
it offers an advanced search option: many do.

Subject Headings

In the section in this chapter on advanced searches, you read about field searching. To
explain further, if you know that the last name of the author whose work you are seeking is
Wood, and that he worked on forestry-related topics, you can do a far better search using
the author field. Just think what you would get in the way of results if you entered a basic
search such as forestry and wood. It is great to use the appropriate Boolean operator, but oh,
the results you will get! But what if you specified that wood had to show up as part of the
author's name? This would limit your results quite a bit.

So what about forestry? Is there a way to handle that using a field search? The answer
is yes (why else bring it up?). Subject headings are terms that are assigned to items to
group them. An example is cars--you could also call them autos, automobiles, or even
more specific labels like SUVs or vans. You might use the Boolean operator or and string
these all together. But if you found out that the sources you are searching use automobiles
as the subject heading, you wouldn't have to worry about all these related terms, and could
confidently use their subject heading and get all the results, even if the author of the piece
uses cars and not automobiles.

How does this work? In many databases, a person called an indexer or cataloger scrutinizes
and enters each item. This person performs helpful, behind-the-scenes tasks such as as-
signing subject headings, age levels, or other indicators that make it easier to search very
precisely. An analogy is tagging, although indexing is more structured than tagging. If you
have tagged items online, you know that you can use any terms you like and that they may
be very different from someone else's tags. With indexing, the indexer chooses from a set
group of terms. Obviously, this precise indexing isn't available for web search engines--it
would be impossible to index everything on the web. But if you are searching in a database,
make sure you use these features to make your searches more precise and your results lists
more relevant. You also will definitely save time.

You may be thinking that this sounds good. Saving time when doing research is a great
idea. But how will you know what subject headings exist, so you can use them? Here is a
trick that librarians use. Even librarians don't know what terms are used in all the databases
or online catalogs that they use. So a librarian's starting point isn't very far from yours. But
they do know to use whatever features a database provides to do an effective search. They
find out about them by acting like a detective.

You've already thought about the possible search terms for your information need. Enter
the best search strategy you developed, which might use Boolean operators or truncation.
Scan the results to see if they seem to be on topic. If they aren't, figure out what results you
are getting that just aren't right, and revise your search. Terms you have searched on often
show up in bold face type, so they are easy to pick out. Besides checking the titles of the

                                                42
The Information Literacy User's Guide      Chapter 3: Plan

results, read the abstracts (or summaries), if there are any. You may get some ideas for other
terms to use. But if your results are fairly good, scan them with the intent to find one or two
items that seem to be precisely what you need. Get to the full record (or entry), where you
can see all the details entered by the indexers. Here is an example from the University at
Albany's Minerva catalog, but keep in mind that the catalog or database you are using may
have entries that look very different.

Once you have the "full" record (which does not refer to the full text of the item, but rather
the full descriptive details about the book, including author, subjects, date, and place of
publication, and so on), look at the subject headings (they may be called descriptors or some
other term, but they should be recognizable as subjects) and see what words are used. They
may be identical to the terms you entered, but if not, revise your search using the subject
heading words. The result list should now contain items that are relevant for your need.

This chapter presents a strategy for developing a successful search. This figure reviews the
key points:

The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 3: Plan

It is tempting to think that once you have gone through all the processes around the circle,
as seen in this diagram, your information search is done and you can start writing. How-
ever, research is a recursive process. You don't start at the beginning and continue straight
through until you end at the end. Once you have followed this planning model, you will
often find that you need to alter or refine your topic and start the process again, as seen here:

                                                44
The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 3: Plan

This revision process may happen at any time, before or during the preparation of your
paper or other final product. The researchers who are most successful do this, so don't ignore
opportunities to revise.

So let's return to Sarah and her search for information to help her team's project. Sarah
realized she needed to make a number of changes in the search strategy she was using. She
had several insights that definitely led her to some good sources of information for this
particular research topic. Can you identify the good ideas she implemented?

    Exercise: Reviewing Search Strategies

                             Take this quiz online!

1. Now that the team has a draft thesis statement, the next step would be to:
        a. Enter the thesis statement into a database, rather than the catalog
        b. Select keywords and enter them into Google
        c. Dissect the thesis statement to determine key terms, related terms, and Boolean
        operators or other searching techniques

2. If you are interested in the use of social media such as Twitter by college students for
research purposes, which of the following is the best general search strategy:

        a. (social media and Twitter) and research and college students
        b. Social media and college students and research purposes
        c. (social media or Twitter or Facebook) and research and college student*
3. The best place to start the search online is:
        a. An online guide on the library's website
        b. Google
        c. The library's catalog
4. When searching a subject-specific database, it is especially important to...
        a. Use any search refinements they provide that make sense
        b. Check for the best subject headings to use
        c. Both a. and b

5. Sarah realized that the order for doing the best research most often includes these steps:

        a. Select topic, select keywords, do search, read and understand results, create
        product

        b. Select topic, select keywords, do search, read and understand results, revise search
        and return to the process as needed, create product

        c. Check for online assistance on the library's website, do the search, revise the

Scenario

Harry Dosital is feeling overwhelmed by one of his class assignments. Harry would have
been happy if the assignment was to write a traditional research paper but his professor
has asked the class to solve a real life problem. The professor has asked the class to imagine
a small city undergoing a natural disaster such as a flood or a tornado. Each group in the
class is required to plan a hypothetical information command center for this city. The pro-
fessor explains that the government needs to obtain accurate, up-to-date information on
the scope of the damage and injuries sustained due to the disaster. This information is vital
for the city to be able to provide adequate emergency and medical assistance to its citizens.
Harry can see that this is an important function for any city in the midst of a crisis but he
is not sure about where to get reliable information to help him construct a plan for the city.

Harry and his classmates do some brainstorming and decide to approach this assignment
as if they were actually producing a research paper. Their first step will be to research recent
disasters. They reason that this will provide some information about the way some cities
have gathered information during disasters. If an information gathering strategy worked
for other cities, it will work for their hypothetical city. There certainly have been a lot of
natural disasters recently, so it shouldn't be too hard to find some information. Super Storm
Sandy and Hurricane Irene are two recent events that immediately come to mind. The
group starts to research Super Storm Sandy with Google and Wikipedia.

Harry and his classmates are engaging in the Gather pillar of the Seven Pillars of Informa-
tion Literacy model. Just as municipalities needed to gather reliable information in order
to provide vital services to their citizens, Harry and his group members need to gather
information that will help them complete this assignment.

These information needs are components of the Gather pillar, which states that the infor-
mation literate individual understands

          How information and data are organized
          How libraries provide access to resources

Information Formats and the Internet

Traditionally, information has been organized in different formats, usually as a result of
the time it took to gather and publish the information. For example, the purpose of news
reporting is to inform the public about the basic facts of an event. This information needs
to be disseminated quickly, so it is published daily in print, online, on broadcast television,
and radio media. More in-depth treatment of information takes longer to research, write,
and publish, and traditionally was published in scholarly journals and books.

Today, information is still published in traditional formats as well as in newly evolving
formats on the Internet. These new information formats are loosely defined as Web 2.0
formats and can include electronic journals, books, news websites, blogs, Twitter, Facebook,
and location postings. The coexistence of all of these information formats is messy and
chaotic. The process for finding relevant information is not always clear.

One way to make some sense out of the current information universe is to thoroughly
understand traditional information formats. We can then understand the concepts inherent
in the information formats found online. There are some direct correlations such as books
and journal articles, but there are also some newer formats like tweets that didn't exist until
recently.

Let's look at the news industry. Many traditional newspapers are shutting down and
those that remain are retrenching. While there are many reasons for this, one of the major
trends has been the rise of the Internet. In the United States, more than 50 per cent of the
population reads the news online (http://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/oecdexaminesthefu-
tureofnewsandtheinternet.htm).

Indeed, online news sites provide a different and, some might argue, a more relevant experi-
ence for the reader. They offer video and sound, up-to-the-minute updates on breaking
news, and the ability to interact with the content by posting comments. Another important
feature of online news is that search engines can deliver content from the site in response
to a query. In other words, readers don't have to visit a site such as the New York Times in
order to read its content.

This has both positive and negative consequences. The positive consequence is that readers
can quickly and conveniently obtain information from a variety of sources on a topic or
event. The negative consequence is that it is more difficult to evaluate the credibility of the
sources. The Evaluate chapter in this book provides some good strategies for evaluating
information sources.

For Harry and his group, all of this means they will have to research many different kinds
of information resources in order to create an effective information command center.

                                       50
The Information Literacy User's Guide      Chapter 4: Gather

Twitter and Blog Postings

Many of the group's Google results are Twitter feeds and blog postings. These did not
provide a lot of information. After all, a tweet consists of only 140 characters. However,
these resources did help Harry's group by suggesting key people, cities, technologies, and
other resources associated with Super Storm Sandy to research. Often a blog posting will
provide a link to a longer, more useful resource. The students' review of blogs and tweets
also provided an otherwise unthought-of insight. As Harry and his group were reviewing
Twitter feeds posted during Super Storm Sandy, they noted that people were using Twitter
to inform their friends and relatives about their whereabouts, their health, and the condi-
tions of their surroundings. Since electricity was not available, most televisions and radios
did not work, but mobile technologies like Twitter served as effective communication tools.
Once Harry realized this, a Twitter feed was quickly incorporated into his command cen-
ter's communication plan.

Newspaper Articles

One of the members of Harry's group suggested they should consult a newspaper to see
what role the newspaper played to help the city understand the destruction caused by the
storm. The group chose the New York Times. The New York Times can be accessed online
and articles from the day of the storm can be viewed. However, the group found that more
useful information was published in the New York Times in the days after the storm. Harry's
initial search of the New York Times for articles containing the phrase super storm Sandy
published on October 29, 2012 resulted in some blog postings from reporters and many
stories about damage from the storm. But when Harry reentered his search without a date
limit, he retrieved articles that analyzed how the region's municipalities performed during
the storm. It takes time to conduct this type of analysis, so looking for information that was
published days, weeks, or months after the storm took place was a good strategy.

Many other newspapers can be accessed online or at a local library in microfilm. Microfilm
is a film image of the print version of a newspaper. Most libraries hold many years of news-
paper issues on microfilm. A microfilm reader is required to view the microfilm version of a
document. Libraries that own newspapers on microfilm also provide the microfilm readers.

Primary Sources

Another member of Harry's group recalled that he had cousins in New York City who
experienced Super Storm Sandy firsthand. He offered to interview his cousins about their
experiences during the storm. This type of information is known as a primary informa-
tion or source. Primary sources are accounts from a person or persons who have firsthand
knowledge of an event. Speeches, photographs, diaries, autobiographies, and interviews are
all primary sources.

                                       51
The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 4: Gather

In this case, the primary source is still alive and is accessible to Harry's group. However,
some researchers are not so fortunate. If this is the case, primary sources can still be found
in a variety of locations and formats. There are many online sites that have created digi-
tized collections of copies of diaries and letters from historical events. It is important to
remember that primary sources are not limited to a single format. You may find them in
books, journals, newspapers, email, websites, and artwork.

Scholarly Journal Articles

The results of the research that Harry and his group has done are useful, but Harry is
concerned that there might be too much focus on Super Storm Sandy. He wants to find
more information on crisis and disaster management in general. Harry thinks that there
might be general standards or practices that should be incorporated into his group's plan.
Journal articles and books might provide this information.

Harry starts his search for journal articles by using a multidisciplinary database because he
is not sure which specific disciplines will cover the information he seeks. He constructs and
executes a search query and finds that the abstracts included in the results help him choose
several peer-reviewed, or scholarly, articles to read.

Scholarly journal articles usually include an abstract at the beginning of the article. An
abstract summarizes the contents of the article. In an abstract, key points as well as conclu-
sions are briefly described. Abstracts are often included in the database record. Researchers
find this information helpful when deciding whether or not to retrieve the whole article.

Most of the articles that Harry chooses are available in PDF format from the database,
but there are a few articles that look very relevant that don't have links to a PDF. Harry
really wants to read these articles so he decides to try to find out if there is another way to
obtain the full text. He consults a librarian who instructs him to look for the title of the
journal (not the article) in the online catalog. The catalog record will provide information
on whether the journal is available online from another database or if it is available in print.

Journals, and the articles they contain, are often quite expensive. Libraries spend a large
part of their collection budget subscribing to journals in both print and online formats.
You may have noticed that a Google Scholar search will provide the citation to a journal
article but will not link to the full text. This happens because Google does not subscribe
to journals. It only searches and retrieves freely available web content. However, libraries
do subscribe to journals and have entered into agreements to share their journal and book
collections with other libraries. If you are affiliated with a library as a student, staff, or
faculty member, you have access to many other libraries' resources, through a service called
interlibrary loan. Do not pay the large sums required to purchase access to articles unless
you do not have another way to obtain the material, and you are unable to find a substitute
resource that provides the information you need.

There is one more feature Harry found while searching in databases: some offer the option
of an alert service. This feature allows Harry to enter the most productive search strings, as

                                                52
The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 4: Gather

well as his email address. When new items are added to the database that fit his search, he
receives an alert. Harry found this to be a great way to keep up to date with new articles on
his topic without having to initiate a new search.

Books

Next, Harry's group looks for books on the topic. They search the library's online catalog
using search terms that were successful in their database searches. They find some great
titles and head to the library stacks to retrieve them.

Most academic libraries use the Library of Congress classification system to organize their
books and other resources. The Library of Congress classification systems divides a library's
collection into 21 classes or categories. A specific letter of the alphabet is assigned to each
class. More detailed divisions are accomplished with two and three letter combinations.
Book shelves in most academic libraries are marked with a Library of Congress letter-
number combination to correspond to the Library of Congress letter-number combination
on the spines of library materials. This is often referred to as a call number and it is noted
in the catalog record of every physical item on the library shelves.

Harry uses the call numbers to locate some books that he found in the catalog. He is happily
surprised to find that there are also some really useful books sitting on the shelf right next
to the books he previously identified. This is a handy way to find additional information
resources on a topic. It is more efficient to first search the online catalog to locate relevant
resources and then search the shelves.

Citations

As Harry's group starts to read and digest all of the information they have gathered, they
notice that many articles and books contain references to other articles and books. Even
Wikipedia entries contain references. These consist of citations to resources that authors
have quoted or paraphrased in their work or have used to research for their publications.
Some of these citations look like they would provide great information. But the group is
confused. They don't know if the citation is to a book or an article or something else.

Citations can be confusing. There are many different citation styles and not many hard and
fast rules about when to use a particular style. Your professor may indicate which citation
style you should use. If not, the general rule of thumb is that the Social Sciences and
Education disciplines use APA (American Psychological Association) citation style, while
the Humanities and Arts disciplines use MLA (Modern Language Association) or the
Chicago style. You can find detailed information about how to format a citation in these
styles by consulting the latest Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association,
for APA citations, the most recent copy of the MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers,
or the current Chicago Manual of Style. You should be able to find copies of these publica-
tions in the reference section of your library. You can also obtain guidance on formatting
citations in the APA and MLA style from the University at Albany's Citation Fox, available
online at http://library.albany.edu/cfox.

However, just knowing what citation style is used doesn't always clear up the confusion.
Each different information format is cited differently. The most common formats that you
will encounter are books, chapters in books, journal articles, and websites.

Take a look at the citations by clicking the button below or looking at the images in the
following pages. You can see that there are differences between citation styles. You can also
see that each information format contains different elements. When you try to determine
whether a citation is for a book, book chapter or journal, think about the elements inherent
in each of these formats. For example, a journal article appears in a journal that is published
in a volume and issue. If you see volume and issue numbers in the citation, you can assume
that the citation is for a journal article. A book chapter is usually written by a different
author from the editors of the whole book. A whole book is often the easiest citation to
decipher. It contains the fewest elements.

Sharing Information

Harry had a chance to talk with members of some of the other groups in his class about the
hunt for information. This was initially done informally before class started, but he wished
there was a more formal process, since it was so helpful to all the groups who participated.
Harry's group shared some of what they'd learned, and also found out about some strate-
gies others had used. The students lamented that the professor hadn't set up some sort
of electronic forum where they could share tips and resources, but then decided to do it
themselves! They set up a wiki on PBWorks. It felt a bit strange at first, being collaborative
in this way, rather than competitive, but it really helped everyone. One group was strug-
gling to find information that met their needs, but between working with a librarian and
consulting the wiki, they succeeded with their project.

Conclusion

Harry and his classmates have spent time gathering information to help them create a
realistic and accurate crisis command center. They accessed and used Web 2.0 informa-
tion sources in the form of Twitter feeds and blogs. They used online newspapers and
online journal articles. They even gathered some very useful hard copy books. During this
process, the students learned about different ways that information is organized including
the Library of Congress classification system. Harry was amazed at the wealth of quality
information he was able to gather. It took him a while and the process was more compli-
cated than just searching the web, but Harry now feels more confident about acing the
assignment. He also feels that he learned more than how to set up a command center. He
learned how to engage in academic research!

    Exercise: Comparing Search Strategies

      Find a newspaper article about a national event, such as the 2013 Boston Marathon
      bombing. Make note of your search strategy.

      Next find a newspaper article about a local event, for example, a flood in your area or
      a local crime or election. Make a note of your search strategy for this search.

      Compare the two strategies. How are they alike? How are they different? Which
      newspaper article was easier to find? Why?

Introduction

In 2010, a textbook being used in fourth grade classrooms in Virginia became big news
for all the wrong reasons. The book, Our Virginia by Joy Masoff, had caught the attention
of a parent who was helping her child do her homework, according to an article in The
Washington Post. Carol Sheriff was a historian for the College of William and Mary and
as she worked with her daughter, she began to notice some glaring historical errors, not the
least of which was a passage which described how thousands of African Americans fought
for the South during the Civil War.

Further investigation into the book revealed that, although the author had written text-
books on a variety of subjects, she was not a trained historian. The research she had done to
write Our Virginia, and in particular the information she included about Black Confederate
soldiers, was done through the Internet and included sources created by groups like the
Sons of Confederate Veterans, an organization which promotes views of history that de-
emphasize the role of slavery in the Civil War.

How did a book with errors like these come to be used as part of the curriculum and who
was at fault? Was it Masoff for using untrustworthy sources for her research? Was it the
editors who allowed the book to be published with these errors intact? Was it the school
board for approving the book without more closely reviewing its accuracy?

There are a number of issues at play in the case of Our Virginia, but there's no question
that evaluating sources is an important part of the research process and doesn't just apply
to Internet sources. Using inaccurate, irrelevant, or poorly researched sources can affect the
quality of your own work. Being able to understand and apply the concepts that follow is
crucial to becoming a more savvy user and creator of information.

The Evaluate pillar states that individuals are able to review the research process and com-
pare and evaluate information and data. It encompasses important knowledge and abilities.

Distinguishing Between Information
Resources

Information is published in a variety of formats, each with its own special considerations
when it comes to evaluation. Consider the following formats.

Social Media

Social media is a quickly rising star in the landscape of information gathering. Facebook
updates, tweets, wikis, and blogs have made information creators of us all and have a strong
influence not just on how we communicate with each other but also on how we learn about
current events or discover items of interest. Anyone can create or contribute to social media
and nothing that's said is checked for accuracy before it's posted for the world to see. So
do people really use social media for research? Currently, the main use for social media
like tweets and Facebook posts is as primary sources that are treated as the objects under
study rather than sources of information on a topic. But now that the Modern Language
Association has a recommended way to cite a tweet, social media may, in fact, be gaining
credibility as a resource.

News Articles

These days, social media will generally be among the first to cover a big news story, with
news media writing an article or report after more information has been gathered. News ar-
ticles are written by journalists who either report on an event they have witnessed firsthand,
or after making contact with those more directly involved. The focus is on information that
is of immediate interest to the public and these articles are written in a way that a general
audience will be able to understand. These articles go through a fact-checking process,
but when a story is big and the goal is to inform readers of urgent or timely information,
inaccuracies may occur. In research, news articles are often best treated as primary sources,
especially if they were published immediately after a current event.

Magazine Articles

While news articles and social media tend to concentrate on what happened, how it
happened, who it happened to, and where it happened, magazine articles are more about
understanding why something happened, usually with the benefit of at least a little hind-
sight. Writers of magazine articles also fall into the journalist category and rely heavily on
investigation and interviews for research. Fact-checking in magazine articles tends to be
more accurate because magazines publish less frequently than news outlets and have more
time to get facts right. Depending on the focus of the magazine, articles may cover current

The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 5: Evaluate

events or just items of general interest to the intended audience. The language may be more
emotional or dramatic than the factual tone of news articles, but the articles are written at
a similar reading level so as to appeal to the widest audience possible. A magazine article
is considered a popular source rather than a scholarly one, which gives it less weight in a
research context but doesn't take away the value completely.

Scholarly Articles

Scholarly articles are written by and for experts in a field and generally describe formal
research studies or experiments conducted to provide new insight on a topic rather than
reporting current events or items of general interest. You may have heard the term "peer
review" in relation to scholarly articles. This means that before an article is published, it
undergoes a review process in order to confirm that the information is accurate and the
research it discusses is valid. This process adds a level of credibility to the article that you
would not find in a magazine or news article. Scholarly articles tend to be long and feature
specialized language that is not easily understood by someone who does not already have
some level of expertise on the topic. Though they may not be as easy to use, they carry a
lot of weight in a research context, especially if you are working in a field related to science
or technology. These sources will give you information to build on in your own original
research.

Books

Books have been a staple of the research process since Gutenberg invented the printing
press because a topic can be covered in more depth in a book than in most other types of
sources. Also, the conventional wisdom for books is that anyone can write one, but only the
best ones get published. This is becoming less true as books are published in a wider variety
of formats and via a wider variety of venues than in previous eras, which is something to be
aware of when using a book for research purposes. For now, the editing process for formally
published books is still in place and research in the humanities, which includes topics such
as literature and history, continues to be published primarily in this format.

Choosing Materials

When choosing a source for your research, what criteria do you usually use? Gauging
whether the source relates to your topic at all is probably one. How high up it appears on
the results list when you search may be another. Beyond that, you may base your decision at
least partly on how easy it is to access.

                                                67
The Information Literacy User's Guide      Chapter 5: Evaluate

These are all important criteria, to varying degrees, but there are other criteria you may want
to keep in mind when deciding if a source will be useful to your research.

Quality

Scholarly journals and books are traditionally considered to be higher quality information
sources because they have gone through a more thorough editing process that ensures the
quality of their content. Generally, you also pay more to access these sources or may have to
rely on a library or university to pay for access for you. Information on the Internet can also
be of a high quality but there is less of a quality assurance process in place for much of that
information. In the current climate, the highest quality information even on the Internet
often requires a subscription or other form of payment for access.

Clues to a source's level of quality are closely related to thinking about how the source was
produced, including what format it was published in and whether it is likely to have gone
through a formal editing process prior to publication.

Accuracy

A source is accurate if the information it contains is correct. Sometimes it's easy to tell
when a piece of information is simply wrong, especially if you have some prior knowledge
of the subject. But if you're less familiar with the subject, inaccuracies can be harder to
detect, especially when they come in subtler forms such as exaggerations or inconsistencies.

To determine whether a source is accurate, you need to look more deeply at the content of
the source, including where the information in the source comes from and what evidence
the author uses to support their views and conclusions. It also helps to compare your source
against another source. A reader of Our Virginia may not have reason to believe the infor-
mation the author cites from the Sons of Confederate Veterans website is inaccurate, but
if they compared the book against another source, the inconsistencies might become more
apparent.

Relevance

Relevance has to do with deciding whether the source actually relates to your topic and, if it
does, how closely it relates. Some sources may be an exact match; for others, you may need
to consider a particular angle or context before you can tell whether the source applies to
your topic. When searching for relevant sources, you should keep an open mind--but not
too open. Don't pick something that's not really related just because it's on the first page or
two of results or because it sounds good.

                                       68
The Information Literacy User's Guide      Chapter 5: Evaluate

You can assess the relevance of a source by comparing it against your research topic or
research question. Keep in mind that the source may not need to match on all points, but
it should match on enough points to be usable for your research beyond simply satisfying a
requirement for an assignment.

Bias

An example of bias is when someone expresses a view that is one-sided without much
consideration for information that might negate what they believe. Bias is most prevalent
in sources that cover controversial issues where the author may attempt to persuade their
readers to one side of the issue without giving fair consideration to the other side of things.
If the research topic you are using has ever been the cause of heated debate, you will need
to be especially watchful for any bias in the sources you find.

Bias can be difficult to detect, particularly when we are looking at persuasive sources that
we want to agree with. If you want to believe something is true, chances are you'll side with
your own internal bias without consideration for whether a source exhibits bias. When
deciding whether there is bias in a source, look for dramatic language and images, poorly
supported evidence against an opposing viewpoint, or a strong leaning in one direction.

Reputation

Is the author of the source you have found a professor at a university or a self-published
blogger? If the author is a professor, are they respected in their field or is their work heavily
challenged? What about the publication itself ? Is it held in high regard or relatively un-
known? Digging a little deeper to find out what you can about the reputation of both the
author and the publication can go a long way toward deciding whether a source is valuable.

You can investigate the reputation of an author by looking at any biographical information
that is available as part of the source. Looking to see what else the author has published
and whether this information has positive reviews is also important in establishing whether
the author has a good reputation. The reputation of a publication can also be investigated
through reviews, word-of-mouth by professionals in the field, or online databases that keep
track of statistics related to a journal's credibility.

Credibility

Credibility has to do with the believability or trustworthiness of a source based on evi-
dence such as information about the author, the reputation of the publication, and how
well-formatted the source is. How likely would you be to use a source that was written by
someone with no expertise on a topic or a source that appeared in a publication that was

                                       69
The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 5: Evaluate

known for featuring low quality information? What if the source was riddled with spelling
and formatting errors? Looking at sources like these should inspire more caution.

Objectively, credibility can be determined by taking into account all of the other criteria
discussed for evaluating a source. Knowing that some types of sources, such as scholarly
journals, are generally considered more credible than others, such as self-published websites,
may also help. Subjectively, deciding whether a source is credible may come down to a gut
feeling. If something about a source doesn't sit well with you, you may decide to pass it over.

Identifying Key Points and Arguments

Evaluating information about the source from its title, author, and summary information is
only the first step. The evaluation process continues when you begin to read the source in
more detail and make decisions about how (or whether) you will ultimately use it for your
own research.

When you begin to look more deeply at your source, pay close attention to the following
features of a document.

Introduction

The purpose of the introduction to any piece that has one is to give information about what
the reader can expect from the source as a whole. There are different types of introductions,
including forewords and prefaces that may be written by the author of the book or by
someone else with knowledge of the subject. Introductory sections can include background
information on why the topic was chosen, background on the author's interest in the topic,
context pertaining to why the topic is important, or the lens through which the topic will
be explored. Knowing this information before diving in to the body of the work will help
you understand the author's approach to the topic and how it might relate to the approach
you are taking in your own research.

Table of Contents

Most of the time, if your source is a book or an entire website, it will be divided into sections
that each cover a particular aspect of the overall topic. It may be necessary to read through
all of these sections in order to get a "big picture" understanding of the information being
discussed or it may be better to concentrate only on the areas that relate most closely
to your own research. Looking over the table of contents or menu will help you decide
whether you need the whole source or only pieces of it.

The Information Literacy User's Guide      Chapter 5: Evaluate

List of References

If the source you're using is research-based, it should have a list of references that usually
appear at the end of the document. Reviewing these references will give you a better idea of
the kind of work the author put into their own research. Did they put as much work into
evaluating their sources as you are? Can you tell from the citations if the sources used were
credible? When were they published? Do they represent a fair balance of perspectives or do
they all support a limited point of view? What information does the author use from these
sources and in what way does he or she use that information? Use your own research skills
to spy on the research habits of others to help you evaluate the source.

Evaluating Your Findings

In the case of Our Virginia, the author used a biased source as part of her research and
the inaccurate information she got from that source affected the quality of her own work.
Likewise, if anyone had used her book as part of their research, it would have set off a chain
reaction, since whatever information they cited from Our Virginia would naturally have to
be called into question, possibly diminishing the value of their own conclusions.

Evaluating the sources you use for quality, accuracy, relevance, bias, and credibility is a good
first step in making sure this doesn't happen, but have you ever thought about evaluating
the sources used by your own sources? This takes extra time, but looking at the reference
list, bibliography, or notes section of any source you use to gauge the quality of the research
done by the author of that source can be an important extra step.

Knowing When to Stop

For some researchers, the process of searching for and evaluating sources is a highly en-
joyable, rewarding part of doing research. For others, it's a necessary evil on the way to
constructing their own ideas and sharing their own conclusions. Whichever end of the
spectrum you most closely identify with, here are a few ideas about the ever-important skill
of knowing when to stop.

                                       71
The Information Literacy User's Guide      Chapter 5: Evaluate

You've satisfied the requirements for the
assignment and/or your curiosity on the topic

If you're doing research as part of a course assignment, chances are you've been given a
required number of sources. Novice researchers may find this number useful to understand
how much research is considered appropriate for a particular topic. However, a common
mistake is to focus more on the number of sources than on the quality of those sources.
Meeting that magic number is great, but not if the sources used are low quality or otherwise
inappropriate for the level of research being done.

You have a deadline looming

Nothing better inspires forward motion in a research project than having to meet a dead-
line, whether it's set by a professor, an advisor, a publisher, or yourself. Time management
skills are especially useful, but since research is a cyclical process that sometimes circles
back on itself when you discover new knowledge or change direction, planning things out
in minute detail may not work. Leaving yourself enough time to follow the twists and turns
of the research and writing process goes a long way toward getting your work in when it's
expected.

You need to change your topic

You've been searching for information on your topic for a while now. Every search seems
to come up empty or full of irrelevant information. You've brought your case to a research
expert, like a librarian, who has given advice on how to adjust your search or how to find
potential sources you may have previously dismissed. Still nothing. It could be that your
topic is too specific or that it covers something that's too new, like a current event that hasn't
made it far enough in the information cycle yet. Whatever the reason, if you've exhausted
every available avenue and there truly is no information on your topic of interest, this may
be a sign that you need to stop what you're doing and change your topic.

You're getting overwhelmed

The opposite of not finding enough information on your topic is finding too much. You
want to collect it all, read through it all, and evaluate it all to make sure you have exactly
what you need. But now you're running out of room on your flash drive, your Dropbox
account is getting full, and you don't know how you're going to sort through it all and look
for more. The solution: stop looking. Go through what you have. If you find what you need
in what you already have, great! If not, you can always keep looking. You don't need to find
everything in the first pass. There is plenty of opportunity to do more if more is needed!

From Theory to Practice

Looking back, the Our Virginia case is more complicated than it may have first appeared.
It wasn't just that the author based her writing on research done through the Internet. It
was the nature of the sources she used and the effect using those sources ultimately had
on the quality of her own work. These mistakes happened despite a formal editing process
that should have ensured better accuracy and an approval process by the school board that
should have evaluated the material more closely. With both of these processes having failed,
it was up to one of the book's readers, the parent of a student who compared the informa-
tion against her own specialized knowledge, to figure it all out.

Now that you know more about the theory behind evaluating sources, it's time to apply
the theory. The following section will help you put source evaluation into perspective using
something called the CRAAP test. You'll also have the opportunity to try out your new
skills with several hands-on activities.

Evaluating Resources in Practice

When you begin evaluating sources, what should you consider? The CRAAP test is a series
of common evaluative elements you can use. The CRAAP test was developed by librarians
at California State University at Chico and it gives you a good, overall set of elements to
look for when evaluating a resource. Let's consider what each of these evaluative elements
means.

Currency

One of the most important and interesting steps to take as you begin researching a subject
is selecting the resources that will help you build your thesis and support your assertions.
Certain topics require you to pay special attention to how current your resource is--because
they are time sensitive, because they have evolved so much over the years, or because new
research comes out on the topic so frequently. When evaluating the currency of an article,
consider the following

          When was the item written, and how frequently does the publication it is in
              come out?

          Is there evidence of newly added or updated information in the item?
          If the information is dated, is it still suitable for your topic?
          How frequently does information change about your topic?

                                                73
The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 5: Evaluate

Exercise: Assess Currency

Assessing currency means understanding the importance of timely information

Imagine that you are writing a paper for a Political Science class on Japan's envi-
ronmental policy since the Kyoto Treaty. Identify one resource that you would find
helpful in your research, and one resource that you would find less helpful. Write one
sentence explaining why you would or would not use each resource, paying special
attention to the currency of each item.

Relevance

Understanding what resources are most applicable to your subject and why they are ap-
plicable can help you focus and refine your thesis. Many topics are broad and searching
for information on them produces a wide range of resources. Narrowing your topic and
focusing on resources specific to your needs can help reduce the piles of information and
help you focus in on what is truly important to read and reference. When determining
relevance consider the following:

          Does the item contain information relevant to your argument or thesis?
          Read the article's introduction, thesis and conclusion.
          Scan main headings and identify article keywords.
          For book resources, start with the index or table of contents--how wide a

              scope does the item have? Will you use part or all of this resource?
          Does the information presented support or refute your ideas?
          If the information refutes your ideas, how will this change your argument?
          Does the material provide you with current information?
          What is the material's intended audience?

    Exercise: Find Relevant Sources

     Relevance is the importance of the information for your specific needs

      You are researching a paper where you argue that vaccinations have no connection
      to autism. Which of these resources would you consider relevant? Why or why not?

Authority

Understanding more about your information's source helps you determine when, how, and
where to use that information. Is your author an expert on the subject? Do they have
some personal stake in the argument they are making? What is the author or informa-
tion producer's background? When determining the authority of your source, consider the
following

          What are the author's credentials?
          What is the author's level of education, experience, and/or occupation?
          What qualifies the author to write about this topic?
          What affiliations does the author have? Could these affiliations affect their

              position?
          What organization or body published the information? Is it authoritative?

              Does it have an explicit position or bias?

    Exercise: Identify Authoritative Sources

     Authority is the source of the information--the author's purpose and what
     their credentials and/or affiliations are.

Accuracy

Determining where information comes from, if evidence supports the information, and if
the information has been reviewed or refereed can help you decide how and whether to use
a source. When determining the accuracy of a source, consider the following:

          Is the source well-documented? Does it include footnotes, citations or a
              bibliography?

          Is information in the source presented as fact, opinion or propaganda? Are

        biases clear?
    Can you verify information from referenced information in the source?
    Is the information written clearly and free of typographical and grammatical

        mistakes? Does the source look to be edited before publication? A clean,
        well-presented paper does not always indicate accuracy, but usually at least
        means more eyes have been on the information.

Purpose

Knowing why information was created is a key to evaluation. Understanding the reason or
purpose of the information, if the information has clear intentions, or if the information is
fact, opinion or propaganda will help you decide how and why to use information

          Is the author's purpose to inform, sell, persuade, or entertain?
          Does the source have an obvious bias or prejudice?
          Is the article presented from multiple points of view?
          Does the author omit important facts or data that might disprove their

              argument?
          Is the author's language informal, joking, emotional, or impassioned?
          Is the information clearly supported by evidence?

Conclusion

When you feel overwhelmed by the information you are finding, the CRAAP test can
help you determine which information is the most useful to your research topic. How you
respond to what you find out using the CRAAP test will depend on your topic. Maybe you
want to use two overtly biased resources to inform an overview of typical arguments in a
particular field. Perhaps your topic is historical and currency means the past hundred years
rather than the past one or two years. Use the CRAAP test, be knowledgeable about your
topic, and you will be on your way to evaluating information efficiently and well!

Now that you have gone through the processes involved to find and evaluate information,
the next step is to start working with it. This is where the Manage pillar comes in: it focuses
on the need to organize information professionally and ethically.

Individuals understand
          Their responsibility to be honest in all aspects of information handling and
              dissemination (e.g. copyright, plagiarism, and intellectual property issues)
          The need to adopt appropriate data-handling methods
          The role they play in helping others in information seeking and management
          The need to keep systematic records
          The importance of storing and sharing information and data ethically
          The role of professionals, such as data managers and librarians, who can
              advise, assist, and support with all aspects of information management.

They are able to
          Use bibliographical software if appropriate to manage information

          Create appropriately formatted bibliographies
          Demonstrate awareness of issues relating to the rights of others including
              ethics, data protection, copyright, plagiarism, and any other intellectual

It is wonderful to have access to information. It empowers us humans, with data and
knowledge that leads us throughout our busy days and helps us organize our leisure time
more efficiently. GPS devices and mobile phones help us get to unfamiliar destinations.
We can find places to eat, to stay, and to get entertainment. All of this information is at
our fingertips due to modern technology. We all take advantage of this technology to some
degree and use this information to our advantage.

But there is another type of information--not just the kind that provides directions. We
seek such information when we are ill and need to look up medical advice. We also seek
information when in school--very few subjects require only the use of a textbook. We need
to search for information and then use it in our intellectual work, because every paper or
project produced in college is a product of someone's creativity.

So how should we handle this product of creativity (a.k.a information)? Let's think about
a simple example: apple picking in the fall. It is a popular thing to do, especially here in the
Northeast where most of the authors of this textbook live. People come to the farm, get
bags or baskets, gather apples, and then line up to weigh them and pay. The farmers' hard
work is being rewarded.

Now imagine a different situation. You worked hard and wrote a very good paper and your
roommate just copied a couple of paragraphs and inserted them into her own paper because
the topics were related. Was this fair? How were you rewarded for your hard work? Nobody
is saying that your roommate should have paid you, as you would pay the farmer for apples.
But she should not use your intellectual capital without attribution to you! What she did
was an act of plagiarism--you will read more about it soon!

You might publish an article in your college newsletter. This article is your intellectual
personal property and you hold the copyright, which means that no one has the right to
reproduce all or any part of it (i.e. copy it) without your permission. If your roommate de-
cides to use some information from your article in her paper, she should provide a citation
(the information that will help the reader identify and find your article should they decide
to do so). If she is using direct quotes from your article, again, she would need to put double
quotes around your words and provide information about the author (you, in this instance)
to avoid plagiarism. Keep reading to find useful information about avoiding plagiarism.

Copyright and plagiarism are just two aspects of intellectual property that you need to deal
with. You have to respect copyright, i.e. the rights of the author and avoid plagiarism. How-
ever, there are more aspects to it. Have you heard of patents? If you are planning a career
in science and technology-related fields then you also have to learn more about patents.
Patents deal with creators' rights to their invention of new machinery or processes. Plants
and design can also be patented. You can find useful information at the United States
Patent and Trademarks Office (USPTO) http://www.uspto.gov/patents/law/. Trademarks
and trade secrets are other aspects of intellectual property that you may have to deal with.

In addition to being aware of plagiarism, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets, you need
to be mindful of open access issues, which relate to valuable research data and academic
publications posted online for everybody to read. However, you cannot always just use the
data from open access sources. You often need to ask the author for permission. Many open

access publications use Creative Commons licensing. You can read more about open access
in the Science Literacy chapter.

There is a lot to learn about using information legally and ethically, but this knowledge will
empower you in your academic work and ultimately allow you to succeed. The following
examples and tips will get you off to a good start.

Unintentional Plagiarism

Have you ever thought about why teachers and professors seem to spend way too much
time urging everyone to be sure to cite all of their sources properly? You've heard it all
before: footnote this, endnote that, put this in the bibliography, capitalize this word, where
are the italics, the commas, periods, hanging indents, yada yada yada! It's enough to make
you give up and just wing it. But hold on a second while you gather your thoughts. Why do
your professors always spend so much time urging you to do something that seems to have
little practical purpose?

Scenario

Jackie was working on her 10-page research paper at the last minute. It was 3:30 am and
her paper was due in class at 9:00 am. She finished the last sentence at 5:15 am, did a
spellcheck and voila! Done! Groggy yet awake she went to class, turned in the paper and
waited for her grade. She received an email from her professor that read, "There are some
major issues with your research paper that I need to discuss with you. Please see me." Uh
oh. What could it be?

When she nervously went to see him, Professor Muntz told Jackie that she hadn't cited any
of her sources, and because she included a lot of direct quotes in her paper, she was guilty of
plagiarism. She received an F on her paper and may be referred to the school administration
for academic dishonesty.

Was she really guilty of something that bad? In fact, yes she was. In this chapter we will
discuss the importance of managing your information sources and some tips on how to
easily and effectively avoid Jackie's pitfall.

Real World Cases

Students often feel that they are being singled out in regard to plagiarism and academic
dishonesty. But that is far from the case. There are numerous examples of scholars and
other professionals who have been caught plagiarizing. One such person is Doris Kearns
Goodwin, a famous historian who wrote the noted Team of Rivals: the Political Genius of
Abraham Lincoln (2006). She included material in an earlier book, The Fitzgeralds and the
Kennedys (1987), from three other sources without citing it, according to an article written
by Michael Nelson.1

Although she has since published other works, her reputation has been tarnished, and
people may not take her work as seriously because of this. Unfortunately, as Nelson points
out in his article, she is not the only well-known historian caught plagiarizing.

Another example, with a dramatic outcome, is that of Eugene Tobin. He was the president
of Hamilton College in New York State, when it was discovered that he had included pla-
giarized material in speeches he had given over the course of almost a decade. He resigned
from his position as the head of this prestigious institution, admitting his guilt.2 Other
college presidents and administrators have also been caught violating academic trust: if you
try a search using the terms plagiarism and college president, you may be dismayed at the
number of results.

Like some of the historians Nelson cites in his article, many students fall into a trap when
they do research because they fail to mention where they found all of their information.
Thousands of students in schools, colleges, and universities are guilty of committing plagia-
rism, but often they don't know they are plagiarizing.

Let's look at plagiarism and how to avoid it, and then continue on to some other intel-
lectual property issues you may need to deal with.

What is Plagiarism?

In short, plagiarism is when you use words, thoughts, or ideas that belong to someone else
without giving them credit. In the classroom (and in the world of publishing), documenting
your information sources is the only way others can tell how thorough and careful you've
been in researching your topic. If you don't tell readers where your information came from,
they may think (and many do) that you either made up the information or "stole" it . Failing
to cite your sources is plagiarism.

The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 6: Manage

By managing the sources in your papers, you encourage others to do the same and you can
be a go-to expert for your friends and classmates when they need help with how to find out
how to cite sources properly. The information and advice you impart may help them avoid
serious difficulties. Some students truly don't know that they are doing something wrong
when they paraphrase information without citing the information source. They might feel
that paraphrasing the words of someone who is clearly an expert on the topic is the best
way to write an accurate paper. And because they aren't quoting it directly, it doesn't need
quote marks or attribution, does it? While the penalties they receive might (and this is a
big "might") be less severe than someone who buys a paper online or copies and pastes big
sections of material into their work, the penalties could still be substantial. Raising your
friends' awareness so they won't face this situation would be a kind thing to do.

Keeping Track of Your Sources

Try this the next time you do research. If you find some great articles on your topic, collect
the following information about each as soon as you realize they will be helpful resources:

          Author name(s)
          Title of the article
          Name of the journal
          The volume number
          The issue number
          The date of the issue
          The name of the database where you found the article

Or, if you found a book, note the following once you think it might contain useful
information:

          Author name(s)
          Title of book
          Place of publication
          Publisher's name
          Year of publication

Or, if you found a website you want to use, collect the following details before you leave
the site:

          Author name(s)
          Title of article or webpage
          Title of overall website
          The date of the webpage (if any)
          The URL (or web address)

                                                83
The Information Literacy User's Guide      Chapter 6: Manage

You might be able to get some of this information with a simple screenshot, but be sure to
fill in any missing elements.

This information is often referred to as bibliographic information or metadata. It consists
of essential information that identifies the information resource used to inform a research
project.

You may not use every single item that you found when you gathered your sources, but
having a list of all of the sources you considered will help you keep track of everything you
use for your paper.

As you read each source, write down any of the authors' ideas, quotes, or thoughts you want
to use and be sure to write down page numbers, if the source provides them. When you put
your paper together, you will then have all the information you need to properly cite any
quote, idea, or thought that came from each source.

Reference Management Software

Many researchers take the time to gather all of this information before they start writing.
However, when they are ready to compile their footnotes or bibliography they can't find
their preliminary notes. It may be the case that some notes are in one notebook, other notes
are in a file in their computer and still others are missing entirely. Fortunately, software has
been developed that helps researchers manage their source material. You may have heard of
some of these reference management products. Endnote, Refworks, Mendelay, and Zotero,
among others, all help manage the information gathering and retrieval process.

In addition to providing one central location for all of your references, these reference
managers can

          import bibliographic information directly from a library catalog database,
          provide additional space for personal notations,
          create a bibliography or list of references in a variety of citation styles such as

              APA, MLA, Chicago, and more.

Some academic libraries provide access to Endnote or Refworks. If your library does not,
Zotero is available free for use with the Firefox browser and Mendelay is also available at
no charge from www.mendelay.com.

When to Cite

Now that you have gathered all of your information resources, you need to be mindful
about how you used them in your research project. There are some very firm rules about
what constitutes plagiarism:

          If you copy a sentence or paragraph verbatim (exactly) from a book, article,
              website, blog posting, or anywhere online or in print, you must provide
              information on the author and the publication in which the sentence or
              paragraph appears. This is known as "citing a source."

          If you use some of the exact phrases in a sentence or paragraph, even if you
              are not copying the whole sentence or paragraph, you must cite your source.

          If you use original information that you have obtained from an interview or
              conversation with someone, you must cite your source.

          If you do not use the exact sentence or phrase but paraphrase it, or use the
              ideas inherent in the exact sentence or phrase, you must cite your source.

          If you reprint images, maps, diagrams, charts, or tables, you must cite your
              source.

          If you embed video files or audio files into your work, you must cite your
              source.

    Exercise: Plagiarism Quiz

      The following paragraph is from an article titled, "Hydraulic Fracturing Overview:
      Growth of the Process and Safe Drinking Water Concerns" in the March 1, 2012
      issue of Congressional Digest.

                The use of hydraulic fracturing continues to increase significantly, as more
           easily accessible oil and gas reservoirs have declined and companies move to de-
           velop unconventional oil and gas formations. Hydraulic fracturing is used for oil
           and/or gas production in all 33 U.S. states where oil and natural gas production
           takes place. According to industry estimates, hydraulic fracturing has been ap-
           plied to more than 1 million wells nationwide. (p. 71)

      Which of the following sentences does not plagiarize?

      a. As of March 2012, hydraulic fracturing has been applied to more than 1 million
      wells nationwide.

      b. Hydraulic fracturing has become more prevalent nationwide. More than one mil-
      lion wells have been created.

      c. According to the Congressional Digest, more than one million wells in the United
      States use hydraulic fracturing (Congressional Digest, 71).

      d. None of the sentences contain plagiarism.

Citation Styles

Citing sources and avoiding plagiarism should always be an author's intent, but it is easy to
get confused about how to cite. Citation styles were introduced in the Gather chapter, but
it is worth repeating that there are many different citation styles. The three styles that are
used most often are APA (American Psychology Association), MLA (Modern Language
Association), and Chicago. There are no hard and fast rules about when to use each style.
Professors often have a preference for one style over another, so make sure that you check
with your instructor about which style they prefer.

Creating properly formatted citations has become easier in recent years with the introduc-
tion of reference management software and citation generators. A citation generator is
software that will help to correctly format your citations. Some popular citation generators
are Noodlebib and Easybib, both are available for a fee. There are also free citation genera-
tors available online. You can search the web to retrieve them. These generators are handy
to use but they often contain errors so it is important to check the results for accuracy. The
following resources are useful tools for all writers.

          Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, 6th edition for
              APA citations

          MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers
          The Chicago Manual of Style
          Citation Fox (available at the University at Albany, University Libraries

              website)

You should be able to locate the three manuals in the reference section of your library.
Citation Fox is available at http://library.albany.edu/cfox.

Where to Go For Help

Even if you are a very organized person and have diligently collected bibliographic infor-
mation on all of the information resources that you consulted during the research process,
you may misplace essential information on a resource. You may think that since you can't
find this information, you will be unable to use it. But there is another option--consult a
librarian. Librarians have comprehensive knowledge about how information is organized
and retrieved. They also have a wealth of information resources at their fingertips. Even
if you can't retrace your steps to find the missing data, it is likely that a librarian will be
able to help you find the bibliographic information you need. Librarians can also help you
determine when and how to cite your work. They may even be able to help you navigate
citation generators and reference managers. Librarians at your library are available to help
you in person, by telephone, and via email and chat. Consult your library's website for
contact information.

Ethical Issues and Intellectual Property

The Manage pillar includes the practice of professional and ethical use of information.
Ethical treatment of information assumes that you are treating an author's rights appro-
priately and avoiding an act of academic dishonesty such as plagiarism. As a creator of
information yourself, you should understand the importance of respecting other authors'
rights and following the general rules set forth in legal documents (see the Useful Links
about Intellectual Property section for citations to some of these documents).

There are many examples of intellectual property issues that you can find in the media. For
example, in June 2013 as the authors were working on this textbook, the Supreme Court of
the United States overturned the law that had previously allowed gene patenting. It might
sound strange, but up until now if you were a scientist who studied the human genome and
happened to discover a new gene, under the earlier law, you could patent it, thus assuring
that whenever a person needed to have a medical test involving the gene they would have
to pay you as a patent holder. These types of tests usually weren't covered by insurance
companies and were very expensive.

As an information creator, you want to be respectfully treated by others. That is why you
should constantly strive to improve your ability to practice fair treatment of other authors'
works, including being cognizant of copyright, patents, and other issues associated with
intellectual property.

Academic Integrity

You have already learned about plagiarism, often enemy number one when it comes to
academic success involving research and writing. But there are other issues under the larger
umbrella of academic dishonesty. First of all, every academic institution has a set of aca-
demic regulations that explain what is expected of students. Students are required to make
themselves familiar with these rules.

Other examples of dishonesty that are mentioned in academic regulations are multiple
submissions (one may not submit one project for two different classes), cheating on exami-
nations, and forgery. Professors are dismayed when they have to talk to the students about
these issues because, inherently, every teacher wants to believe that her students are honest.
Unfortunately, plagiarism is so common that educators have begun using plagiarism detec-
tion software, such as Turnitin (see the Useful Links section). You obviously don't want to
be identified as committing plagiarism by this software.

It is imperative to understand that everybody has to be accountable for their own work and
respectful of the work of others. Future scholarship depends on the accuracy and integrity of
prior scholarship. That is why, when doing research one must use the information produced

                                                87
The Information Literacy User's Guide      Chapter 6: Manage

by other people responsibly, i.e. provide citations within the text and a list of references at
the end of the paper with full citation information that will allow retrieval of the document.
Remember what you have learned in this chapter about managing your sources and citation
style. If you are diligent about applying this knowledge and careful about giving credit
where credit is due, you should have no worries.

Scenario

Norm Allknow from the Identify chapter has done a lot of work since the last time we
saw him. His research supports his thesis statement and he's got something to say. Now he
needs to figure out how to say it.
He writes a 10-page paper starting with his thesis statement, followed by some facts from
his research, and then briefly concludes that he has proved his point. He hands it in to his
teacher and he's finished. Except that he starts to feel like he just did an awful lot of work
for an audience of one person. Who else might be interested and how might he reach them?
How can he communicate his message in ways other than a straightforward paper? How
can he get the most out of his effort?

Presenting the Results of Your
Research

In earlier chapters we discussed how to identify a research topic and how to focus in on
specific questions that we hoped to answer. Then we discussed ways to search for, organize,
and evaluate information that would help to answer those questions. Now it's time to think
about the best way (or ways) to present the information.
Individuals adept at the Present pillar can apply the knowledge they have gained. They can
present the results of their research, synthesize new and old information and data to create
new knowledge, and disseminate their work in a variety of ways.
They understand

Processing What You Find

In many or even most cases, during the process of finding a variety of information
sources, you will begin to develop an answer to your research question. Even if you feel
that you've already found the proof you need to support your thesis, it is still important
to review the information and data you have to be sure you're clear about what it is (and
isn't) telling you. Be careful not to let your own opinion lead you into a misinterpretation
of your sources.

One useful way to consolidate the information you've found is to summarize what you
think it says, and then find a definite source for each specific item in your summary. You
can start by filling in the final box in the chart below, from the Identify chapter.

   What do you     What do you Want        information on     What have you
  already Know       to know about           your topic?   Learned about your
about your topic?       your topic?
                                                                    topic?

KWHL2

However, an expanded version of this same box can tell you a lot more about where the
information is from, and will also prove useful when you need to cite a specific bit of
information in your bibliography. In the left column of the following box, list what you
have learned, bit by bit. In the right column, list where you found it. If it was found in
more than one source, list them all and think about which one you find to be the most
reliable or useful. Depending on where and how you present your findings, you may be
called upon to defend your sources, so it pays to be prepared for this.

                                       92
The Information Literacy User's Guide                                     Chapter 7: Present

     What have you learned             Where did you learn it?
         about your topic?

KWHL3

This exercise is just one way to process your information and may not be the best way for
everyone. Summarizing in paragraph form is another way to accomplish the same task,
with the added benefit that what you write in the summary can often become part of your
final product. Just be careful that you aren't using paraphrased material without properly
citing the source it came from. Verbally summarizing your findings, and especially your
arguments in favor of your conclusions, to a friend, classmate, or teacher is an excellent way
to confirm your mastery of the topic. While the means of summarizing can vary, the key
at this point is to make sure you understand what you've found and how it relates to your
topic and research question.

Now that you're confident in your knowledge of your topic, you can formally answer your
original research question when you present what you've found. Did your original thesis/
hypothesis turn out to be true? If so, say so! If not, why not? Be sure you're able to state the
specifics that prove or disprove your projections. Was anything a surprise? Do any of your
findings suggest future research possibilities?

One of the most satisfying parts of doing research is having something to add to a topic's
base of knowledge. Think about what you found in relation to your original research ques-
tion and compare it to all of the sources you examined on your topic. Did you discover
something new? If your research involved experiments, you may have new results or data
sets that others can use. Even if you didn't generate new data, maybe you saw new connec-

                                                93
The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 7: Present

tions between existing sources that no one has written about before. Think about this as you
begin to put together the presentation of your findings, you may have something to share!

Choosing How to Present

The way you finally present your research findings is largely dependent on your original
goals. If you were doing the research for a class project, it's likely that the teacher provided
you with fairly specific requirements and it would obviously be a good idea to stick to them.

Even if you did initially do the research for a class project though, you may find yourself in a
situation similar to Norm at the beginning of the chapter, wanting to share your work more
widely. You've already done the work, so why not get all the benefit you can?

Some of the more common ways of presenting information are discussed below, but the
descriptions of them are not exhaustive and remember that these are not nearly all of the
options. In addition, you can often combine more than one method of presentation to
highlight different elements of your findings or to reach multiple audiences.

Written

Writing is the most established way to share your research findings. Benefits of writing
include the ability to proofread, edit, and rewrite to get your presentation exactly right.
Done skillfully, writing can hold your audience's attention and effectively deliver informa-
tion. Done poorly, it can confuse or bore your audience to the point that they stop reading.
To avoid this second possibility, if at all possible, have someone read your writing before
you give it to the final audience. Take constructive criticism to heart, so that your voice is
clearly heard.

Traditional Paper

One of the most common ways to present research findings, especially for students, is
in a short paper written as a class assignment. The way this type of paper is formatted is
determined by the teacher, and is fairly straightforward. The goal is usually to demonstrate
to the teacher that you have understood the topic and can draw some conclusions from
what you've learned.

Thesis/Dissertation

At higher levels of education, you may be called upon to write a thesis paper or even a
dissertation. At this point, you are entering the realm of high level professional or schol-
arly expertise, and will be expected to produce original ideas and the necessary supporting

                                                94
The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 7: Present

research to contribute to your field. The type of writing in theses and dissertations varies
depending on the subject area, but generally these manuscripts are longer and more detailed
than a traditional class paper. They also use more discipline-specific language, and can take
several years to complete.

Scholarly Journal Article

Articles published in scholarly journals undergo a peer-review process (see the Evaluate
chapter) to ensure that they are reliable and significant additions to the literature on a topic.
If you get to a point in your research where you feel you have a contribution that others
could use, investigate the possibility of submitting an article for publication, especially if
your research is relevant to your intended career. It can be difficult to determine which
journal to submit your article to, so don't hesitate to ask teachers, colleagues, or even the
editor of the journal if your article's content is appropriate.

Blog/Tweet/Other Social Media

A relatively new option for getting your information out to a wide audience is to use social
media tools. If you have your own blog or website you can easily publish your findings for
the entire world to see (getting people to actually look at it is another issue, with many
possible solutions). You can also use Facebook, Twitter or other tools to let people know
what you're working on and to direct them to more detailed information that you've posted
elsewhere online. While this may seem unusual, it is becoming more and more popular
for researchers to share work online as it progresses, so that other interested parties can
contribute and ask questions, making the final product more robust, whatever form it ends
up taking.

Spoken

Presenting information verbally might seem easier than writing or terrifying, depending
on your experience and personality. Ideally you will be thoroughly prepared and able to
clearly explain your findings, while also being able to respond effectively to unanticipated
questions. It takes practice and a deep knowledge of your topic to do this--even the best
speakers get flustered once in a while. Don't be afraid to say you don't know the answer and
always offer to follow up on a question.

Class Presentation/Speech

As with the class paper, a class presentation is one of the first experiences most students will
have with verbally presenting their research. One great benefit of this type of presentation is
that you will most likely receive detailed feedback on how well it was received and perhaps
even get some suggestions on how to improve your delivery. Your fellow students will also
be faced with the same task and can even provide this type of feedback before the actual
presentation takes place.

The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 7: Present

Conference Presentation or Poster Session

As your expertise on a topic grows, you may want to reach a wider audience. You will also
want to reach an audience that is interested in your topic. An excellent place to find this
audience is at a professional conference in your field. Aside from the many other benefits of
attending professional conferences, presenting at a conference will help you begin to make
yourself known to other researchers in similar subject areas. Responding to audience ques-
tions will give you the chance to prove that you really know your material or, alternately,
can point out gaps in your knowledge that may lead to new research opportunities. Poster
sessions are a great way to get your feet wet, as your poster will be available for you to refer
to and the atmosphere is not quite as overwhelming as standing in front of a full audience
for a presentation.

Audiovisual

Visual images can have an immediate impact on how your audience reacts to and under-
stands your presentation. Choose them wisely and use them at appropriate times! You can
read more about how different visualizations of information affect the way that information
is received in the Visual Literacy chapter. Below are just a few brief thoughts about how you
might use visuals in your presentations.

Powerpoint/Prezi/Other Presentation Software

Powerpoint has been around long enough that most everyone knows it. For many purposes
a slideshow that you speak over, or even a slideshow that is posted online for individual
viewing, can succinctly get your point across. Newer presentation tools such as Prezi (prezi.
com) use a similar underlying idea but enable you to create more dynamic presentations di-
rectly online. Keep in mind that in most cases, tools such as these are meant to accompany
a speaker and to use them effectively takes forethought and practice.

Images

Images can be powerful tools to grab attention, condense information, and tell your story.
Different types of images can be useful in different contexts. In an art class you may use
reproductions of famous paintings or drawings, or images you've created on your own. In a
business class, graphs and charts may be more appropriate. Just make sure the images you
choose actually make your presentation more effective rather than distracting attention
from your main point.

Song

Keeping your audience in mind, don't be afraid to present your material in an unusual
manner. If you can create a song (as one example), you may make your audience curious
enough to stay around for more detailed information later!

The Information Literacy User's Guide      Chapter 7: Present

Video

With the tools available now, it is possible to create a quality video product to present your
information without extensive training or a lot of money. New online tools are constantly
being introduced (and retired, unfortunately) which enable you to enter your content (words,
images, video, etc.) and have it processed into a completed video in a short amount of time.
Your library is also likely to have tools available for you to use to create video and audio
projects, including not only the editing software, but often the video cameras, microphones,
and hard drives you'll need to create original content. Don't hesitate to ask a librarian for
both access and help using these resources. Many libraries also offer introductory courses
on the software they provide to get you off to a running start.

Choosing a Presentation Format

The examples above give you an idea of the variety of presentation venues available, but its
up to you to decide which is most appropriate at a given time. If you're unsure, experiment.

    Exercise: Present Your Information in Different Formats

      Take what you've learned about your topic and express it as a written paragraph, a 140
      character tweet, and a Prezi. Try to draw a picture that clearly explains your findings.
      Which of these seems most complete? Which seems most effective? Which seems
      most attention grabbing? Which was the hardest to do? Attempting this exercise
      might help you to make your decision about which format to use, although there are
      other things to consider first, particularly your intended audience.

Audience

Who you plan to present to affects how, when, and what you will present. If you're presenting
your findings in a paper that only your teacher will ever see, you will focus exclusively on
what that teacher has asked for. When you're presenting for a less well-defined audience
however, you must imagine what they may already know (or not) about your topic, as well
as what might interest them and what forms of presentation might be most appealing to
them.

How do the different audiences affect what you might or might not include in your pre-
sentation abouEtxyeorcuisret1opic? How do they affect the ways you might choose to present the
information?

Many times you will present to an audience composed of various groups or unknown groups
(particularly if you're posting the presentation online). If you've considered a number of
different audiences and chosen the content and methods most likely to appeal to most
of them, your chances of success will be higher than if you only include what is most
interesting to you.

Your Role in Creating and Sharing
Information

When you finally do publish the results of your research, there are some things to think
about in terms of what happens next.

                                                98
The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 7: Present

What will you do with the information now that you're finished with it? If you've written a
paper for a class there may be only one copy. Do you save it and the associated notes you've
made in case you need them later or do you throw it away once you get the grade? It can be
difficult to project what may be useful in the future.

If you've published more widely, there are likely to be more copies, either physical or digital.
Who is responsible for maintaining those copies? In a more formal situation such as a schol-
arly journal, the article will be maintained as part of the archives of that journal. (However,
there are some questions about online-only journals. What happens if the journal goes out
of business? Some journals have contingency plans for this, but not all.) If you've given a
speech, do you keep the notes? If you've published on a blog, are you archiving the blog, or
will it disappear once you stop using it? Even if you decide to save absolutely everything,
unless you have a plan for organizing it, you may not be able to find a specific item when
you need it.

Another consideration about what happens after your work is shared is what the reac-
tion to it might be. This depends on the audience, but if you've created something really
interesting or important, you may find that there is follow-up to be done. You might just
be responding to comments on a blog posting or you could find yourself presenting your
findings at conferences and continuing to develop your research on the topic. There may be
negative feedback as well, and this is where thinking ahead about how you can support each
of your arguments is important. Online, of course, there may be everything from kudos
to spam and you'll have to decide how seriously to take all of that feedback. As time goes
by, you may find that your work is being cited by other researchers, which is a wonderful
validation of your efforts.

You are a Creator of Information

During the research process, at times it can feel as if you are just collecting what others have
written or said, and that your presentation is just going to repeat what is already known on
the topic. While this may be true for introductory-level papers, once you know a little more
about your topic, you will be synthesizing what you've discovered, and drawing your own
conclusions. Once you publish these conclusions you will have created new information.

Before the advent of online tools, publishing your new information was difficult and often
expensive. It was hard to reach a large audience because of the physical limitations of pro-
ducing and distributing paper copies of publications. Now anyone can publish anything
and make it available to the entire Internet-connected world in a matter of seconds. This
means that you have a great opportunity to share your ideas and to communicate with
people around the world who are interested in similar topics. It also means that you have
to carefully consider what you publish because anyone, even an unintended audience, can
find what you've published.

                                                99
The Information Literacy User's Guide       Chapter 7: Present

In addition to being able to share information freely, you also have access to tools to create
and edit audio and video materials that were prohibitively expensive to create or adapt not
too long ago. You can now share more interactive and engaging material with a wider audi-
ence than ever before. This is a great opportunity and a great responsibility-- use it wisely!

Wider Connections

When you begin to share your own work, you gain insight into the processes of producing
and publishing information, which will help you the next time you need to find sources for
a research project. Now that you know what it took for you to produce information in a
given format, you know what other creators had to do to produce their work. This can help
you decide which sources will be most reliable and valuable for your own research.

Presenting your information is usually considered the final step in the research process. You
tell the audience what you've found out and you go home. However, as we've seen, some-
times in the process of presenting or preparing to present, you uncover new questions and
need to Identify that new information need. Or you may discover that what you thought
was a reliable source was not so reliable and you need to Evaluate a little more. The research
process is not linear, but a continuous cycle with various entry and exit points that change
depending on your goals, topic, and methods. Ideally, for those who enjoy it, it never ends!

            Visual Literacy

Scenario

Louis was recently hired as an office assistant for an advertising firm. His first project is to
create a presentation to describe the firm's services to potential clients. His boss specified
that it should be as visual as possible and be designed for a large projector screen. If the
firm likes the work, it will be adapted into both a website and a printed pamphlet. Louis has
some experience with creating PowerPoint presentations for school and has used Pinterest
and other image-related tools, so he figures this will be a piece of cake.

Introduction

This chapter is different from most of the others in this textbook, in that it does not focus
on one particular aspect or pillar of information literacy. Instead, it looks at a specific area of
information literacy: visual literacy. So, while each of the previous chapters looked closely at
only one pillar, this chapter will look at each pillar as it relates to the field of visual literacy.

Visual literacy has never been more critical. The Association of College and Research Li-
braries states,

         The importance of images and visual media in contemporary culture is changing
    what it means to be literate in the 21st century. Today's society is highly visual, and
    visual imagery is no longer supplemental to other forms of information. New digital
    technologies have made it possible for almost anyone to create and share visual
    media. Yet the pervasiveness of images and visual media does not necessarily mean
    that individuals are able to critically view, use, and produce visual content. Individuals
    must develop these essential skills in order to engage capably in a visually-oriented
    society. Visual literacy empowers individuals to participate fully in a visual culture.1
Currently, most models of information literacy do not include visual literacy elements.
Emerging models such as transliteracy and metaliteracy do incorporate aspects of visual
1 Visual Literacy Task Force, 2012, 1
The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 8: Visual Literacy

literacy, but these models have not yet become mainstream information literacy approaches.
Because of this gap, the authors of this textbook agreed on the need for a separate chapter
dedicated to the subject.

A note on the lack of images in this chapter: You may find it surprising that the chapter
about visual communication has very few pictures. This has to do with the high level of
copyright restriction for publishing images; unlike text, one cannot quote a visual work and
simply cite it without permission (more on this later). We requested consent to use several
of the images referenced in this chapter, but at the time of publication, the permissions
were not yet granted. The images we do use are within the public domain, and links and
references have been provided for others so that you can view the images' external sources.

Definition of Visual Literacy

Visual literacy is the ability to identify, gather, evaluate, manage, use, create, and share visual
material in an effective, ethical, and self-aware manner. Over the years, individual disci-
plines have created widely varying definitions that emphasize only one particular aspect
of visual literacy. This chapter aims to take the broadest possible view, using an inclusive
definition that can be applied to any field.

Brief History of the Term

  The history of visual communication goes back to the cave paintings 30,000 years ago; the
  description of it only 2,500 years. . . .Visual literacy is 2,500 years old (as a skill) and 30 years
  young (as a term). 2

The idea of visual literacy is not new. Using images to communicate precedes the use of text
by many thousands of years. Discussions about the concept of visual language have been
around for quite a while as well. Perhaps most famously, Sir Francis Bacon discussed visual
literacy in the 1600s.3 Subsequent scholars in areas ranging from art history and apprecia-
tion to philosophy and psychology have continued to grapple with the concept. The field of
photography has a long relationship with visual literacy. Henry Holmes Smith, an author
and professor of photography at Indiana University in the 1950s, is credited with coining
the term visual literacy.4 Smith described it as "a visual language, one that probably cannot

The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 8: Visual Literacy

be taught until it is codified. . . . I can hardly wait to read some general principles on picture
reading...."5

Several years later, in 1969, a group of scholars and artists from a wide range of disciplines
founded the International Visual Literacy Association, bringing the concept and the term
into the mainstream. IVLA continues to be the standard bearer for visual literacy, pub-
lishing a journal and sponsoring an annual international conference.

Value of Visual Literacy

  If students aren't taught the language of sound and images, shouldn't they be considered as
  illiterate as if they left college without being able to read or write? -George Lucas6

We live in an increasingly visual society. Since the creation of the computer desktop icon,
there has been an exponential shift toward communicating with images. Whether for re-
search, employment, or social interaction, visual literacy has never been more important. It
is especially critical in the workplace, and will only become more so. Increased visual lit-
eracy also makes us smarter! Studies have shown that becoming more visually literate leads
to greater overall intelligence and is correlated to greater performance in technical areas.7

Use of images has advantages for communication as well. One study found that humans
process visual images several thousand times faster than text,8 while other research has
shown that information conveyed with images is more intuitively understood and better
recalled.9 Visual literacy is also unusual in its ability to span cultures and languages in a way
that text does not.10 It is also remarkably conducive to metacognition. Literary theorist John
Zuern states,

         Visual materials engage us in a dialogue with those ideas out of which we gain an
    understanding based less on memorization and mastery than on critical, intellectually
    supple inquiry. Moreover, visualization can spark invaluable `ah-ha' experiences that
    push learners' understanding of concepts beyond an instrumental `application' of ideas
    in a particular discipline . . . and open them to philosophical reflection on their own
    social, cultural, and political lives.11

A well-known example of this is the photograph, Flower Power, taken by Bernie Boston in
1967. This is the famous image of a Vietnam War protester placing a flower in the barrel of
a rifle held by a soldier. For many, this photograph came to symbolize the national divide
between those who were for and against the war, in ways that no amount of words could.12

Many feel that the increase of photojournalism during this era was a significant catalyst in
changing public opinion and speeding the United States' withdrawal from Vietnam.13

Visual Communication Challenges

Many think, as Louis first does, that we are all naturally skilled in visual literacy. But visual
communication is in fact more difficult to learn and use than text. Part of this difficulty is
related to the subtleties of visual communication. Whereas we know whether we can read
a given word, it is easy to unwittingly misread an image. It is also much harder to copy or
create images than letters.14 Using visual imagery to communicate a specific message is not
simply a matter of a clear substitution of images for words, but is instead a complex process
with no agreed-upon rules. Standards of image use and interpretation vary by discipline
and there is no singular alphabet or grammar.15 So, becoming visually literate involves not
only learning how to find and use images but also understanding the range of meanings
they may have in different contexts.16

With this in mind, let's check in to see how Louis is doing.

At first things went smoothly. Louis created a basic presentation and then looked online
for pictures to add. He found many websites that had most of the images he was looking
for and he was able to copy and paste from these sites into his presentation. But now he is
having some trouble. For one thing, some of the images don't look great when he zooms
in, and he is worried about projecting them. Also, he would like to be able to change some
of the images by adjusting brightness and colors and, for one, he wants to take out the
background. Finally, he feels that the presentation is still pretty boring: there are a lot of
facts and figures to share, and the slides are filled with lists and tables of data. He is sure
there are tools to improve all of these issues, and probably places to look for examples, but
he doesn't know where to start.

Applying the Seven Pillars

Identify

This pillar focuses on understanding one's information needs so that a research question
or goal can be formulated. What does this look like when applied to visual literacy? Let's
start with Louis. He needs visual materials for a business presentation. This sounds simple,
but there are many important details that he did not stop to consider. He needs to consider
the audience: what is their culture? Is there a specific dialect of images--certain logos or
symbols that have special meaning? Are there images to avoid because of their particular
meaning either within the company or the broader industry? The intent is also important.
In this case, the purpose is both to inform and persuade; each will influence which images
are chosen and how they are used. There are also technical aspects: the presentation will be
given in multiple formats, each with its own set of best practices and considerations. This
includes ethical and legal aspects, which vary depending on the purpose and venue, and
should especially be considered for any commercial use of images.

Based on these factors, Louis' research goal seems to be: find images in a variety of formats
and resolutions that he can legally use for both in-house and public marketing. In general,
tools for this stage can include subject manuals and magazines, websites of peer organiza-
tions, previous publications created by the institution one is working for, as well as relevant
physical spaces. For Louis, it would make sense to look at the company website and all
other materials, any previous presentations used, the product itself, the company offices
(including architecture and even dress codes), as well as competitors' work.

Scope

This pillar centers on knowing your own knowledge and gaps, and being aware of what
information is available. For visual literacy, this starts with your current ability to find and
create images, and your awareness of what tools are available for these tasks. Finding and
creating aren't just digital skills, but can include looking through magazines and books,
creating collages, taking photographs, drawing, and more. Knowledge of available resources
includes knowing where to discover more material, a process greatly aided by knowing your
own gaps in knowledge and experience. In Louis' case, he knows that he does not have
photo editing skills. This knowledge will help him direct and focus his search: he needs to
either find images that don't need adjusting or he has to find and learn how to use photo
editing tools. The awareness that images can be altered is also a critical aspect of the scope
of visual literacy. Besides knowledge of tools, it is critical to know what types of images
exist, what their particular qualities are, and how these influence usability and accessibility.
Specific examples include photographs, paintings, videos, cartoons, and icons, to name a
few. Also, one should discover existing formats and their differences and advantages. There

105
The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 8: Visual Literacy

are numerous physical and digital formats each with distinct and important differences in
resolution, size, adaptability, and accessibility.17

Many resources are available to assist with this stage of the process. There are countless
physical and digital image repositories, including libraries, museums, galleries, and websites
such as Picasa, Flickr, Pinterest, and many more. And, there are just as many tools for ma-
nipulating visual materials, including paint, scissors, scanners, software such as Photoshop,
and several excellent programs that can be used online or downloaded for free. It is also
possible to find classes offering help in using these tools, frequently offered by area schools,
libraries, or community centers.

    Exercise: Observing the Visual Landscape

      Go to Google Images and study the results for searches using each of these terms:

                                                 professor

                                                 librarian

                                                   baby

      Now, reflect upon what you found:
         What patterns did you notice?
         What assumptions underlie, or are promoted by, these images?
         How do you think Google Images finds the pictures?

Plan

This pillar involves choosing the best search tools and developing effective search strategies.
Plan is closely related to the Gather pillar described next: you will find yourself going back
and forth between these two pillars in the course of your research. In the gathering stage,
as you enact the strategies you formulated in the planning stage, you will naturally find
yourself revising your strategies and creating new plans. In this chapter, we will focus on the
thinking components of Plan and the action elements of Gather. For Plan, concerns specific
to visual literacy begin with knowing where to look for various types of visual materials. In
addition to the previously mentioned sites, there are excellent dedicated image collections
available through the Library of Congress, New York Public Library, and ARTstor (which
requires a subscription). It is important to keep in mind that most of these images are NOT
copyright free; they cannot be freely used for some purposes without permission. Several
online resources do exist for images that are free to use (with attribution), even for com-
mercial purposes. Some standouts include Stockfreeimages, Openphoto, Imageafter, as well
as Pixelperfectdigital and Morguefile, which all have excellent advanced search options.
Flickr also offers an advanced search that has the added feature of allowing you to view
only images with Creative Commons licenses supporting reuse. For classical art, two good

                                               106
The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 8: Visual Literacy

online resources are Art Resource (which displays artworks from hundreds of museums
around the world) and Web Gallery of Art (notable for its many high-resolution images).

Image searching can be challenging because subject terms for images have not been stan-
dardized. Most sites don't offer advanced searching, leaving it up to the researcher to find
the best strategies. What works best for one repository often does not suit another, so part
of this stage involves learning the internal logic of each resource. Thankfully, there are some
techniques that allow for searching across several sites. Conducting a Google image search
is currently the best method, due to Google's excellent advanced search option that allows
for limiting by size, format, usage rights, and more. Google also allows you to search using
an image as your search term, which can be terrifically helpful since it bypasses the problem
of variations in words used to describe images. This is a perfect example of visual literacy:
using one image to describe another image! This method can also be used to find informa-
tion about an image you have, such as the species of a bird you photographed or the artist
for a particular painting.18

Before we proceed, let's check in again with Louis.

Louis has decided to start fresh. He realizes that his project should focus on a clear goal,
and that he wants to find images that clearly communicate his topic right from the begin-
ning of his presentation--rather than adding them at the end as an afterthought. Knowing
that he has limited experience in manipulating images, he attends a free Photoshop course
taught at a local library. There, he learns some basic editing skills, as well as the differences
between formats such as JPG and PNG, and what sizes and resolutions work best for
different purposes. Armed with this new knowledge, Louis identifies several online image
repositories that he plans to use. Once he finds the most appropriate images, he will down-
load them and possibly alter some to better suit his needs. His next step is to start searching
for and downloading images.

Gather

This pillar concentrates on using the strategies outlined in the planning stage to locate and
access information. This is a particularly challenging process for visual literacy, although
it may initially seem easy. While a vast amount of visual material is available online, and
some good tools for finding it exist (as identified in Scope), conducting specific searches is
quite difficult. Finding a precise image often requires hours of trial and error, and exploring
multiple resources, and even when advanced searching is possible it may not yield the
desired results. Often, descriptions for images are user-generated tags that lack consistency
(even within a repository) and that change over time as new tags are added.This means that
determining accuracy is quite difficult: is that actually a picture of Karl Marx, or is it Santa
Claus as one tag says? Finding specific formats and resolutions is similarly challenging. For
one, most images freely available online are not of high enough resolution or proper for-
mats to be used for publications or large projections. And finding those that are is difficult
because of inconsistencies in terminology. A few representative examples: JPG and JPEG
are both used to describe the same format, while dpi and ppi are not the same but are often

18 Klosowski, 2013

                                               107
The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 8: Visual Literacy

used interchangeably--and these are some of the most-used formats and considerations
for digital images!

Accessing images is equally challenging, at multiple levels. There is a wide range of the level
of accessibility for visual materials, from watermark-protected images for sale (and often
requiring signup to access) to high-resolution images that are easily accessed and legally
free for all to use (quite rare). Often, the difference between the two is not immediately
apparent: pop-up screens demanding payment often appear only once you have searched
for and selected an image that you want to use. Now, reading the previous sentences, you
may have thought, "But I get images easily all the time! Flickr, Pinterest, Google Images:
just Right-Click and it's yours!" This brings us to the other key aspect of online image
accessibility: copyright. While it is true that one can often easily and instantly download
an image, this is almost always in violation of copyright. From an earlier example: if you
search online for Flower Power Bernie Boston, you will find links to hundreds of webpages
posting this photograph. Most of these sites are doing so illegally, without permission of
the copyright holder, which in this case is the Worcester Art Museum. Many websites
seem specifically designed for open use, such as Pinterest, but nearly all of the postings are
illegal while being firmly within the site's stated intent.19 For images, it is often up to the
researcher to make sure he or she is on ethical and legal solid ground. We will discuss this
further in the sections on managing and presenting.

For visual materials, another important aspect of access involves saving copies. Because
you will often want to use an actual image, rather than merely quoting or referencing it as
you might a text, it will be necessary to have a copy of the image to use. This could mean a
photocopy, scan, tracing, hand drawing, photograph, or, more often, a digital reproduction.
Besides knowing how to copy or save an image, it is important to have a detailed record of
its source. This can help you find the original image again later and has other benefits we
will discuss in the Gather and Present sections of this chapter.

Evaluate

This pillar focuses on the evaluation of information in an ongoing review of one's research
process. Key elements related to visual literacy include determining quality, bias, and ac-
curacy, as these are all especially tricky to determine for visual materials.

Quality

Quality in this case refers both to the substantive value and the visual strength of an image.
An example to demonstrate the difference between the two: a deer crossing sign is quickly
and universally understood (high substantive value), but does not achieve its purpose if it is
faded (low visual strength). Evaluating for substantive value is as important for visual ma-
terials as any other resource type and involves many of the same considerations, including
looking critically at key elements and identifying subjects, relationships, context, and pur-
pose (including intended audience). Visual strength is equally important and includes such

19 Newman, 2012

                                               108
The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 8: Visual Literacy

qualities as brightness, clarity, contrast, hue, and saturation. These are important elements
to consider both for evaluation and image creation. The size and format of an image also
affect visual strength since what looks good in one venue may not in another; that wallet
size photo of your sweetheart will probably be quite grainy if you make it into a poster.
Some of these factors will be immediately apparent, as with the faded sign, but others
require looking at the metadata for an image to determine file type, image size (which is not
the same as the displayed size), resolution, and more. Legality is another key area of quality
to assess. Who is allowed to use this image and for what purposes? There is a wide range of
possible permissions and it is critical to determine whether your intended use is permitted.
Many people have been sued--and fined or even jailed--for using images outside of a
creator's intent. If you cannot determine what type of image reuse is allowed, you are better
off not using the image.

Bias

Bias can be particularly hard to identify for images. Often it is not the image itself but its
context or description that displays a bias. Sometimes it is what is not shown that reveals
bias, as when something is cropped or left out of the frame for a specific intent. Other
times the very fact of an image being used is revealing, as when the Danish newspaper
Jyllands-Posten printed caricatures of Mohammed despite knowing this would be offensive
to many Muslims. (In a remarkable added twist that highlights the many layers of visual
literacy, when Yale University published a book about this incident it chose not to include
any of the images.)20

Accuracy

Accuracy is especially important to consider when evaluating images, since they can be
easily altered in ways quite difficult to detect and are also often incorrectly described. The
first step in assessing for accuracy involves looking carefully to see whether an image is
believable and whether the captions seem to match the contents. One should consider both
internal consistency (Does it look right, without strange shadows or edges or elements that
seem off ?) and external probability (Is this depicting a plausible thing or event?). Look for
areas that appear too perfect or appear to be exact replicas of another area; tool marks left
by software such as an unnaturally straight line, or a sudden break in color. As with any
resource, consider the source: who published the image and why? It is also important to
examine the metadata, ranging from the written caption to the digital information hidden
within the image. Is this information consistent with the image, are the dates and descrip-
tions correct? If the image is not original and is being reused, is it properly cited? A warning
sign that an image is not a reliable resource is when there is no citation but the visual
material is clearly from some other source.

All evaluation should be done in relation to your research goal: the most critical concern
should be whether an item fits in the project context. Evaluation can inform your research
process, with the search both responding to and suggesting adjustments to the original
research question or desired product. Similarly, it is important to critically appraise your

20 Cohen, 2009

                                               109
The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 8: Visual Literacy

own role in the process, looking for your own biases or habits that could limit results.
Comparing your perceptions with others through discussion and mutual review can also be
very revealing.

     Exercise: Accuracy and Bias

      Look closely at the following maps: what differences do you see?

Now, compare these maps to a current globe.
   Are all three equally accurate?
   What implied messages could be interpreted by some of the visualization
       choices made?

                                         110
The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 8: Visual Literacy

 The map on top is from 1942, and the bottom map is from 1999, both printed
    in the United States. How might these facts be reflected in the layout of each
    map?

Manage

This pillar relates to information management--organizing your findings to aid compre-
hension, preservation, and retrieval. As with any other area of information literacy, for visual
literacy information management begins with collecting your materials. We discussed the
importance of recording source information when copying or saving; at this stage you will
want to make sure that information stays linked to the correct image. There are a number
of ways to do this, ranging from including it in the file name (AnselAdamsYosemite.jpg)
to simply pasting the image and its identifying information in a word document. Many
image processing programs will allow you to embed this information within the image
itself. Whatever method you use, it is essential to do so in a consistent manner to support
effective organization. It is also very helpful to name images in descriptive and clear ways
that distinguish them, such as YellowLightningBoltBlackBgrnd.png. Additionally, you may
want to create folders for different subjects or image types.

Citation

Citation for visual materials can be tricky, but it is critical for both managing and presenting
your findings. Using an established citation format facilitates organization of images both
within a publication and also for your own use. It also maintains a connection of the source
information to the image, which will be important when you want to use or reference the
image later. It is important to be able to create a bibliography in at least one citation format,
since both professors and publishers will require you to document your sources. There are
several programs that work for textual and visual materials, to assist you with this process,
as well as print and online guides specifically for image citation (one is linked in the Ad-
ditional Resources list).

Another management tool that can be very useful is keeping a research journal or similar
record of your process. Documenting where and how you sought information (including
specific search terms and strategies) and what you found can be very helpful. A research
journal can help you with future searching and also supports sharing your process and
helping others with their research. Many of the best tools available today were created from
a previous searcher recording and sharing their experience: there is nothing stopping you
from contributing! Doing so also brings you into conversation with other scholars who can
help you substantially improve your work.

Now let's look again at what Louis is up to.

Because his work will be used commercially, Louis narrowed his search to only sites sup-
porting this type of use. He performed focused searches for specific images, making sure
they had high enough resolutions for large projection and could legally be reused com-
mercially. He carefully evaluated each image for relevance to his project, and for accuracy,

                                               111
The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 8: Visual Literacy

and originality. One image looked familiar, so he used it to do a reverse image search that
revealed that the Flickr user who posted it was not, in fact, the image creator.The image was
not free to use, so he wisely chose to exclude it from his presentation. He kept a running log
of his process and recorded citations for each image that he collected. He also pasted a copy
of each image into a Word document. He then made folders for different types of images
and sorted the files in them by format type. He now has a searchable pool of images to use
in creating his presentation.

Present

This pillar focuses on summarizing, synthesizing, and communicating your work to others.
This is the pillar with the widest range of connections to visual literacy. Many books have
been dedicated to this topic alone. In this chapter we will highlight the central aspects
of Present, and share some methods and tools you can use. As mentioned in the Present
chapter, a fundamental aspect of this pillar is recognizing that we are all information cre-
ators. This is also true for visual communication, although we may not be as aware of our
creator role in using visualized information. Have you ever used an emoticon? Created a
doodle? Sent someone a photo you found online? Made a collage? All of these involve
creation and imaginative reuse of images. These activities also require the ability to under-
stand and communicate using visual language, which in many ways is the essence of visual
literacy.21 Now let's look at the basic components of Present.

Summarizing & Synthesizing

For visual materials, the line between summarizing and synthesizing is often blurred, be-
cause one often does both when presenting information visually. The act of visualization is
itself a form of synthesis. It is important for you to be aware of what data came from where,
and to note your own contributions, including your commentary (intended or not). It is
very easy to forget a source and then fail to provide a citation, thinking all of the project
is original work. You can also easily fail to recognize your own bias and believe your work
is just an objective summary. For these reasons, we strongly recommended that you have
others review your work and provide critical feedback before publication. Citations are also
important for summarizing and synthesizing, because they will help with both remem-
bering your sources and giving credit to the creators. However, as mentioned throughout
this chapter, providing citations does not protect all or even most image reuse: always make
sure to look carefully at the copyright information for any visual material.

Communicating

Communication begins with determining your purpose and then selecting images and
presentation methods that best support your objectives. When you plan to use visual com-
munication, it is helpful to work visually from the start and use tools designed for that
purpose. Concept mapping is a widely used visualization method that involves drawing
concepts and connections on paper (or a computer screen), which can be helpful in get-
21 Avgerinou & Ericson, 1997

                                               112
The Information Literacy User's Guide               Chapter 8: Visual Literacy

ting free of verbal/intellectual patterns and starting to think visually. In this process one
often finds that a certain visual logic arises, an intuitive sense of arc and layout that guides
what content is chosen and how it is used. This is an important stage, because it involves
immersing yourself in the internal rules and logic of the world of images.22 These activi-
ties should align with the final research goal and take into account the purpose of the
project. The character of your intended audience should inform presentation style and type,
image selection and size, and color schemes, as well as the tools and processes you use for
editing images. For instance, while you might show large cartoon images zooming around
a circus-themed background when presenting to young children, this likely would not be
the best way to reach a worker's union. An added consideration that is often neglected is
when not to use images. While visual communication is powerful, using an image to make
every point may not be the best strategy: imagine learning that your partner is breaking
up with you via emoticon and I'm sure you will agree. In any case, many excellent tools
exist for every stage of presentation, ranging from concept mapping tools such as Bubbl.
us and Mindomo to a vast array of editing and presenting tools. Some notable examples
include presentation software such as PowerPoint and Prezi; timeline generators Dipity
and Tiki-Toki; online photo editors Microsoft Publisher, Photoshop, Pixlr, and Splashup;
and flexible and dynamic word cloud generators Wordle and Tagxedo.

Data visualization, which involves creating graphical displays of information or infographics,
is another important area of visual communication. Using graphical displays is not new,
but with many designers shifting from presenting information in traditional graphs and
number tables to more inventive depictions in which every aspect including shapes and
colors add significance, data visualization has recently gained significant traction. Info-
graphics can be simple, such as pyramid-shaped graphs about ancient Egypt, or complex,
multi-layered presentations such as the IVLA's Periodic Table of Visualization Methods.
The massive infographics on the Kulula Airlines fleet of airplanes is a wonderful and novel
example of using data visualization.23 It is important to point out that it is easy to mislead
with graphics, both intentionally or inadvertently. You should always check and re-check
any infographic you develop for accuracy and bias. Soliciting external feedback can help
you verify your work. (For a real-world example of misleading data visualization, go here.)
As for the creation process, there are several helpful tools, including Microsoft Excel,
Hohli Charts and Google Charts for making a variety of graphs; Gliffy for making flow-
charts, Venn diagrams, etc.; and Visual.ly, Piktochart, and Infogr.am for making dynamic
infographics.

An often overlooked component of presentation is the presenter him or herself. Many visual
literacy scholars consider facial expression and body language to be key aspects of visual
communication,24 with some including broader performance aspects such as object use and
placement.25 How you present has significant impact. You should give careful thought to
attire, stance, gestures, and expressions--especially when presenting to audiences of nation-
alities that may have different cultural associations from your own.

Exercise: Putting it All Together

   First, type out a thesis statement and three supporting arguments.

   Next, determine your audience.

   Now, using only images (which cannot contain text), demonstrate both your
       thesis statement and three supporting arguments. You can create images, use
       found images, or both.

   Each component can be either a single image (if this clearly communicates the
       thesis or argument) or a multimedia project (such as a Prezi) linking multiple
       images.

   Create correct citations for any image you did not create, using the APA or
       MLA style.

   Share your work by emailing it to a friend, using it for a class, or publishing it
       online in a blog or elsewhere.

Going Forward

Many believe that we are living in the most visual era yet, with today's students being the
most visually immersed generation the world has seen. Visual literacy has never been more
critical, and is considered a key workplace skill26 viewed by employers as on par with the
ability to read and write.27 Now, more than ever, it is critical to become aware of your own
visual communication skills, to actively practice and improve them, and to create new work.
There has never been a greater need, or potential, for creators to actively and ethically reach
out and share their work with others. In this chapter, we have tried to give you an outline
for using images, as well as some resources to help you on your way. We have walked,
along with our friend Louis, through the landscape of visual literacy. You may wonder how
everything worked out with him, but we intentionally left this open, because that question
is for you to answer. Now it is your turn to go out and share your voice: there is a world
waiting to be read and be visualized.

Henry Holmes Smith

Symbol systems and symbolic action constitute not only the greatest perils, but also the
greatest hopes of mankind.29

Philip Yenawine

[Visual literacy] involves a set of skills ranging from simple identification--naming what one
sees--to complex interpretation on contextual, metaphoric, and philosophical levels. Many
aspects of cognition are called upon, such as personal association, questioning, speculating,
analyzing, fact-finding, and categorizing. Objective understanding is the premise of much
of this literacy, but subjective and affective aspects of knowing are equally important.30

Tad Simons

'Seeing is believing' goes the old saying, but this axiom has never been less true than it is
today. We live in an age where photos, video, and film can be digitally altered to represent
any reality imaginable...so it has never been more important to acquire the intellectual skills
necessary to distinguish between visual fact and fiction, information and manipulation,
reporting and propaganda.31

Roger Fransecky and John Debes

When developed, [visual literacy skills] enable a visually literate person to discriminate and
interpret the visible actions, objects, symbols, natural or man-made, that he encounters in
his environment. Through the creative use of these competencies, he is able to communicate
with others. Through the appreciative use of these competencies, he is able to comprehend
and enjoy the masterworks of visual communication.32

           Science Literacy

This chapter is devoted to the concept of science literacy. You have probably heard of
specific types of literacy: computer literacy, visual literacy, media literacy, and many more.
Science literacy is yet another, and, as you can probably guess, it is related to the natural
sciences. To better explain science literacy let's begin with a story that goes back to 1986.
April 26, 1986 was the day of the worst accident in the history of nuclear energy. This is
when there were several explosions at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine, then
part of the Soviet Union. The explosions caused a fire that released radioactive fallout into
the surrounding atmosphere. When this event took place, the author of this chapter was
studying electrical engineering at Lvov Polytechnic Institute in Ukraine, which is about
300 miles from Chernobyl. The news of the disaster was kept from the Soviet public for
several days, so as not to cast a shadow over approaching May Day celebrations. However,
we engineering students learned about the disaster almost immediately, as some of our
fellow students returned from Chernobyl where they had been doing student internships.
The stories they told were frightening, but at that time nobody knew exactly what to expect,
as a disaster of this scale had never occurred.

When the accident was finally officially announced, chaos ensued. No one knew how to
react or what to do. What exactly was radiation? How dangerous was it? How far could
radioactive clouds travel, and where was this cloud headed? A lack of accurate information
and an overabundance of rumors did not help people cope with the situation. People shut
their windows against the hot May weather for fear of letting in radiation. Air condi-
tioners were practically non-existent at that time (and still are nowadays in Ukraine, for
that matter). Someone said that iodine helped fight radiation, so supplies of iodine quickly
disappeared from pharmacies. We drank tea with iodine, we put it into water, and it wasn't
pleasant.

Let's investigate which coping strategies were effective and which were not. Let's begin
with radiation. Does it travel through the air? Sure, it does. Does it help to close the win-
dows to stay safe? Not really--radiation can get through glass and brick. Only heavy metals
like lead can stop it. What about iodine? Does it really counteract the effects of radiation?
This answer is not easily determined without some investigation. Of course, physicists,
especially those specializing in nuclear physics, would know, but what about members of
the general public?
The Information Literacy User's Guide       Chapter 9: Science Literacy

Exercise: Iodine Case Study

  1. Go to Google (or any other search engine such as www.bing.com or www.
      exalead.com) and type in iodine and radiation. Usually search engines do
       not need the connector and (nor that it necessarily be typed in upper case)
       as it is assumed that you want both of the terms to be present. When you do
       your searches online you may use different connectors (so-called Boolean
       operators--check the explanation in Plan chapter). They are or, and, and not.
       However, Google makes an exception for or--you should type it in upper case
       for it to be recognized as a connector. This strategy is useful when you expect to
       find limited information in a search on an unusual topic. The operator or can be
       very helpful to connect synonyms thus assuring better results.

  2. Examine the results carefully. You most likely will find articles from popular
       media such as newspapers and online news websites. Watch for sources that
       have the.gov (stands for government) domain: do you see one from the Centers
       for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)? Let's take a look.

  3. The page you're looking at has the following URL: http://emergency.cdc.gov/
       radiation/ki.asp. This is a page from the "Emergency and Preparedness Re-
       sponse" site. If for some reason you do not have it in your results, just type in
       the URL or click on the link in this text. From this site we can learn some quick
       facts:

        The chemical name for iodine is potassium iodide (KI). It's actually a salt of
            stable (not radioactive) iodine.

        In the case of a radioactive event the radioactive iodine is released into the
            air and can be absorbed by the thyroid gland. To counteract the absorp-
            tion, you can take potassium iodine (not radioactive). The non-radioactive
            iodine will be absorbed first, thus preventing thyroid from absorbing more
            (in this case radioactive) iodine in the next 24 hours.

        It is important to take iodine only on recommendation of the doctor or
            public health official who is dealing with the consequences of the radioac-
            tive spill.

  4. Among the results of our Google search you may see a short article from Los
       Angeles Times http://articles.latimes.com/2011/mar/14/news/la-heb-io-
       dine-tablets-radiation-quake-nuclear-plant-20110314 ( June 25, 2013), which
       quotes the International Atomic Energy Agency about distributing "230,000
       units of stable iodine to evacuation centers" near the Fukushima Daiichi and
       Fukushima Daini nuclear power plants in March 2011, when a tsunami struck
       the coast of Japan and damaged two nuclear plants.

  5. Now back to the question--was it useful for people in Ukraine to take iodine
       after several days passed from the disaster? The answer is no, because it would
       only have been beneficial within first 24 hours after the exposure to radioactive
       iodine.

Defining Science Literacy

Now we are ready to discuss general science literacy, which means knowing enough about
science to make good decisions in situations like the one just described. This ability is
referred to as science literacy or scientific literacy. Science literacy can be measured thanks
to Jon Miller, a political scientist who conducted research on how to measure this ability.
Miller has published his findings in several books and articles, which are listed in the
recommended readings on science literacy list at the end of this chapter. Unfortunately,
his results were not encouraging: the number of American adults who met his criteria for
science literacy was quite low, 28%.1 On the other hand, the United States rated higher
than several of the other nations included in Miller's study.

The number of adult Americans who are scientifically literate may be attributed to the un-
dergraduate general education requirements at colleges and universities in the U.S.: higher
education requirements that are unique to this country. Every college undergraduate has to
take a certain number of science courses even if they are not majoring in the sciences. In
fact, Miller found that the strongest predictor of science literacy in adults is completion of
three to four science courses in college. The second strongest predictor of science literacy is
having a college degree.2 In other words, if you're in college (and there is a good chance you
are, since you are reading this textbook), your chances of becoming science literate are al-
ready much better than those of your high school classmates who chose not to go to college.

Now we're ready for the definition of science literacy:

Science literacy is being well versed in all matters pertaining to basic science and scientific
laws, to the extent that one is able to make sound decisions concerning their wellbeing and
the wellbeing of their families, communities, and society as a whole.

This definition may look too broad; after all, it suggests that everything from our personal
well-being to that of entire nations rests, at least in part, on science literacy. But proponents
of science literacy make this very point by distinguishing five different types of science
literacy: civic, cultural, practical, aesthetic, and consumer.

Civic Science Literacy

This is regarded as one of the most important science literacies, as it speaks to people
knowing enough science to relate scientific laws and discoveries to matters of government
and legislation. Someone with civic science literacy understands enough about science to
comprehend the likely consequences of legislation involving scientific matters. For ex-
ample, let's return to our conversation about nuclear disasters. It's no secret that the world
needs sources of clean energy, taking into consideration how industrial pollution harms
the environment and contributes to global warming. Nuclear energy is considered clean;
there are no residual pollutants released into atmosphere through the production of energy

                                               122
The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 9: Science Literacy

using nuclear power. However, it is also common knowledge that nuclear energy can have
disastrous effects on human health and the environment.

The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II made this abundantly clear.
Growing up in the former Soviet Union, we were shown images of Japanese children with
leukemia making origami and told that this was something that should never happen again.
And yet it did happen again, and right in Ukraine. The Chernobyl disaster released four
hundred times more radioactive material into the atmosphere than the nuclear bomb that
was dropped on Hiroshima. More recently, in 2011, a tsunami caused a reactor meltdown
at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant in Japan. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster
was the worst since Chernobyl and received the same severity rating on the International
Nuclear Event Scale.

You may be thinking, OK, I get it. Nuclear power is potentially dangerous. But what do I
do? Well, if you are a model of civic science literacy, you investigate the pros and cons of
nuclear power to form an opinion as to whether we need this type of power generation.
Once you form your own opinion, you can communicate with your congressmen and sena-
tors, and tell them what you think. You can exercise your power as a citizen by participating
in decision-making that requires some knowledge of science. This is what civic science
literacy is all about: using science to be an active and informed citizen. Hydraulic fracturing
(also called fracking) is another example of an issue that calls for civic science literacy.

Practical Science Literacy

Practical science literacy entails knowing enough about scientific and natural laws to make
decisions about one's day-to-day life and livelihood, as opposed to government and legisla-
tion. For example, a friend of mine who works as a landscape designer and permaculture
gardener spent several months in the mountains of India studying the local residents' agri-
cultural practices. She learned that they had developed specific farming methods that make
the best use of the local terrain and climate, such as irrigating the fields in spring with the
melting snow that runs down from the adjacent mountains. These people are applying prin-
ciples of permaculture-- adopting the most effective and sustainable agricultural methods
for their particular ecosystem-- and, in so doing, demonstrating sound practical science
literacy.

Consumer Science Literacy

Consumer science literacy is related to practical science literacy. It refers to a person's ability
to know enough science to make sound consumer choices whether he or she is shopping
for food, medications, clothes, electronic devices, automobiles, or other items. For example,
there are many recent publications in public media about genetically-modified organisms
(so-called GMOs) and whether they are safe to consume. In order to make a decision about
whether to buy genetically modified vegetables, one needs to understand basic processes
that involve genetic engineering.

                                               123
The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 9: Science Literacy

Cultural Science Literacy

This type of science literacy is the scientific knowledge that is generally assumed to be
possessed by someone who is culturally literate, that is, someone familiar with the general
knowledge and idioms that make up the dominant culture of his or her society. In other
words, being culturally literate entails a mastery of certain scientific concepts and principles.
For example, when you read an article about nutrition in a popular newspaper or magazine,
you don't expect the author to explain what vitamins, protein, and calories are; these are
things the author assumes you already know. And, of course, you do. Or do you? What are
calories? How would you find out?

Aesthetic Science Literacy

Aesthetic science literacy refers to the ability to appreciate the beauty of scientific ideas.
An avid proponent of science literacy, James Trefil provides an excellent explanation of this
type of science literacy in his book, Why Science?. Dr. Trefil, a physics professor, writes that
he finds it helpful to bring the attention of friends to certain natural phenomena that, if
unexplained, might go unnoticed or would not be appreciated in full, such as the very rare
sight of a triple rainbow or sun dogs, two spots of light that sometimes are seen next to the
sun. His friends, he says, are usually very grateful for the experience of uniting science and
natural beauty in one great story.3

Citizen Science

So-called citizen science is a great way to improve general science literacy, especially for
adults. Citizen scientists are science enthusiasts who help scientists in various disciplines
conduct their research, primarily by collecting data. For example, there are citizen astrono-
mers who watch the sky on a regular basis studying various celestial objects and phenomena,
from stars and planets to galaxies. They take pictures of celestial objects and events, and post
them online so that professional astronomers can download them and use them in their
research. In other words, researchers mine the visual data collected by citizen scientists and
then develop scientific theories and discoveries based on them. Another example is amateur
bird watching. Birdwatchers provide valuable data--for example, about where certain spe-
cies are migrating--to professional ornithologists who might otherwise lack this data, as
it takes many people to conduct this type of research. And not only do citizen scientists
provide data to the professional scientific researchers; in the course of their data collection,
they also increase their own knowledge and improve the overall science literacy of their
community. Another way science literacy is increased is through museums. Have you ever
been to a science and technology museum, a nature preserve, or a conservancy on a school
trip? If you have, you may remember how much you learned about science during those
trips.

Creating and Disseminating Scientific
Information

Scientific publications come in many different forms such as books, conference proceed-
ings, technical reports, and peer-reviewed, or refereed, articles. Primary research articles are
especially important in the world of scientific information. Such articles, often referred to
as primary sources, are written by the scientists who actually conducted the research being
described or reported in the article. Not every scholarly article published in the natural
sciences is a primary research article, and it's important to be able to tell these primary
sources from articles that summarize or comment on scientific research conducted by
others, so-called secondary sources. Good examples of secondary sources are the articles
published in the science section of the New York Times or Scientific American; such popular
articles report on recent scientific breakthroughs and discoveries, and generally cite primary
research articles published in scholarly journals like Science and Nature.

Popular articles are written by science journalists, whose job is to make scientific research
intelligible to people who are not scientists by profession. These journalists typically indi-
cate where the research they are describing can be located, so that interested readers can
track down the original study by searching the catalogs and databases at their local public
or college libraries. All they need are the names of the authors who wrote the article and the
journal in which it appeared. You can practice this in the following exercise.

    Exercise: Tracing a Primary Research Article From Secondary
    Publications

        1. Browse through one of the popular scientific publications such as the science
             section of the New York Times (comes out on Tuesdays) or Scientific American.
             Find a short article that looks interesting and is easy to understand.

        2. Look for the following:

              an article that is reporting about a recent study that has been published in
                  a scholarly journal;

              the title of the journal;

              the name of the author(s); and

              an indication of when the original study appeared: sometimes the sec-
                  ondary source will say that the research was published in a latest issue of
                  Science or Nature.

        3. Once you find some of these facts (journal title and the authors should be suf-
             ficient), you can start to search for the primary source in the resources provided
             to you by your school-- the library catalog or databases.

        4. Catalog search: in a catalog search, you can find out whether your school sub-
             scribes to a particular journal by searching for the journal by title.

        5. Best case scenario: your library has it! The next step will be to figure out the
             available article format(s). You might have several options:

                                       125
The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 9: Science Literacy

 Electronic version--great! It means you can access it right away. Once
    you get to the online (or electronic) version of the journal, you are given
    a choice of searching within this publication. An author search should be
    sufficient to locate the article.

 Print version--good! You can search in databases or a discovery service
    tool such as eDiscover for your article by entering the journal title and the
    authors. Once you locate the record about the article, which will include
    volume and issue number, page numbers, the article title, you can also find
    the call number and take a walk to the shelves where you will find the issue
    of the journal that includes your article.

 Microform version--still good! Again, after searching databases and lo-
    cating the exact information about the article, you should be able to locate
    the appropriate microfilm reel or microfiche on the shelf. Before the wide-
    spread and easy access to online versions of materials, microforms were
    used to save space by photocopying and preserving documents on film.
    Libraries are equipped with microform readers--if you need help using a
    reader, ask the library staff.

Open Access

Perhaps you have already heard of open access--after all, this book is an open resource!
Many researchers in different disciplines, including the natural and social sciences and the
humanities have agreed to make their research available online and free of charge. You can
find a lot of good material in such publications. The Public Library of Science (PLoS) is
one of the largest collections of open access publications. You can check it out at http://
www.plos.org/.

Science.gov and More

Did you know that a good deal of scientific research is financed by the United States gov-
ernment? Check out the Statistical Abstract of the United States and you will see how much
money is budgeted for research and development in the areas of life sciences, engineering,
and many other scientific fields. This research has to be made available to the public because
it is paid for with tax dollars. That is why it is possible to search through various databases
using the government gateway to scientific information, Science.gov., and to access full text
at this site on topics in the fields of health and medicine, physics and chemistry, applied
science and technology, and natural resources and conservation.

Another good way to look for scientific information is to browse through the websites
of individual government agencies such as the Department of Energy, or the National
Library of Medicine (NLM) and PubMed (also listed under the registered trademark
MEDLINE--you will see the two terms used interchangeably). The NLM database con-
tains many of the latest publications in various medical fields. If you are searching for

                                               126
The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 9: Science Literacy

information for class projects or personal needs, you can find some surprising results in
these databases.

Data Repositories

Researchers accumulate a lot of data in the course of their work, and not all of this data
is used in their publications. Sometimes this data just sits in filing cabinets waiting to be
discovered; in the worst case scenario, it may get lost for good. Now scientists can preserve
their data and make it available to other scholars by using digital data repositories. Data
repositories can be either institutional or private, depending on their creators and hosting
entities. The SUNY Digital Repository--a fairly recent initiative--allows researchers from
all SUNY campuses to deposit their data into one warehouse where it can be accessed by
anybody. Some data repositories are discipline-specific, such as the NCBI (National Center
for Biotechnology Information) from the National Institutes of Health. It is another ex-
ample of information which is provided for free by the federal government. You can find it
at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/.

Science Zines

Our discussion up until now has primarily focused on scientific information consumption;
the different ways of learning what others already know about science. But it's important
to bear in mind that you are a creator as well as a consumer of information. When you
produce your own writing and social media projects, you are creating unique information
entities that other people can use, especially if you publish them for free on the web. The
realization that information dissemination takes place at both large and small scales led to
the development of science zines. Science zines are small pamphlets, usually created on 8.5"
x 11" sheets of paper, and folded into small booklets. They are distributed "guerilla style" in
places like coffee shops and hair salons, where people are likely to be looking for something
to read. In the following exercise, you will create a science zine of your own.

    Exercise: Science Zine

      Science zines are small pamphlets (made out of a single 8.5" x 11" sheet of paper) that
      provide basic information about a particular science topic. They can address a broad
      range of audiences, from kindergarteners to a college-educated, adult population. A
      science zine's goal is to bring science information to the general public in an uncon-
      ventional way, making it a "cool" and easy (and unlikely) way of spreading science
      literacy. Science zines are often left at bus stops, hair salons, and cafes in hopes that
      they will be picked up and read. You can start thinking of unlikely places to put your
      zine!

      It is important to find software that can provide an appropriate and easy-to-use
      template, which will allow placing all of the zine pages on a single 8.5" x 11" sheet.
      Microsoft Publisher is a good example of such software. Most schools provide appro-

                                               127
The Information Literacy User's Guide  Chapter 9: Science Literacy

priate tools to help students with their projects--check with information technology
services on your campus or ask at the library to see what is available at your school.

Step 1

Think about your prospective audience: who would you like to read your zine? Your
dorm neighbors? Your parents? Your little brother or sister? Perhaps you volunteer at
a summer camp?

Select a topic and conduct preliminary research (identify, scope and plan):

Identify will help you figure out what you don't know about your topic and how to
proceed.

Scope will help you figure out how much you need to find out about your topic in order
to have enough information for your zine.

Plan will equip you with some helpful tools that you might use in your research.

Your research should include basic definitions, any controversy there may be about
the topic, and why it is important for the public to become familiar with this topic.
It is also important to have your personal opinion about the topic or issue, because
you will be collecting information and formatting it for publication. It has to look
persuasive.

Step 2

Create a page-by-page outline of your zine, with visual and written scripts. You can
make drawings by hand to illustrate your topic. You can also use computer software to
produce images; insert clip art, drawings, and photographs--anything that will help
communicate your key points. Depending on who your audience is, you can even
make it look like a comic book. See some good examples at http://smallsciencezines.
blogspot.com/.

Important! Make sure you provide appropriate credits for all images that you're using.
You will find plenty of useful advice in Manage chapter of this textbook.

Time to put it all together and print it out. Then get the scissors and a stapler and...
Congratulations! You created your own zine!

Lifelong Learning

Our knowledge base changes constantly. We learn new things that others have gone to a lot
of trouble to discover. We also forget things, some of these things are probably not that im-
portant anyway (and some are). Sometimes we learn that previous discoveries were wrong
and that there is new, updated knowledge for us to learn and use. Seventy years ago, most

The Information Literacy User's Guide       Chapter 9: Science Literacy

educated adults did not know about DNA, but this doesn't mean that they weren't science
literate; science literacy is maintaining familiarity with the knowledge base of one's era.
But this base is always evolving. We must always be prepared to learn about new scientific
discoveries. It may be challenging, as Jon Miller, who conducted the science literacy study,
points out, but it is possible and necessary. It will involve a critically important skill--life-
long learning. You can see it prominently featured in the information literacy pillars Identify
(being information literate involves developing a learning habit so new information is being
actively sought all the time) and Gather (the need to keep up to date with new information).

Having a basic understanding of science and the ability to influence our lawmakers in all
matters related to science is crucial to participating in our democracy. Ten years ago, legisla-
tors and policy makers were addressing stem cell research; today, it is hydraulic fracturing.
We don't know what scientific issue will demand our attention ten years from now. But if
we hope to be able to make informed decisions, we must cultivate and maintain our science
literacy. You can do this by reading popular scientific publications like Scientific American,
Discover, and the New York Times science section. Check the web--all of these publications
extend their reach online with blogs and discussion boards where everybody is welcome
to comment and ask questions. Keeping an eye on the latest scientific news will help you
understand the latest trends in science and technology, and how they are likely to impact
the future. You can make a difference by being proactive and making your voice heard.

Good luck and happy science literacy trails!

    Review of the Seven Pillars

At the beginning of this text, you learned about the Seven Pillars of Information Literacy
and how each of these pillars represents a set of understandings and abilities that will help
you become a better researcher and a more savvy citizen of the information world we live
in. We have also covered Visual Literacy and Science Literacy to further enhance your
knowledge.

When you first started reading this book, you may have already been skilled in some of
these areas while other concepts may have been totally new to you. Developing these skills
is not necessarily a linear process that starts in one place and ends in another. The process
also won't end after you've finished reading this book. You will continue to grow as a re-
searcher as you take on more challenging research projects. These skills will serve you not
only in your academic life, but also in your professional and everyday life.

Here is a quick review of the main points from each of the chapters.

Identify

Identifying your need for information is a crucial first step in your research process. Navi-
gating the current information environment requires critical thinking, and the ability to
investigate what is available and whether it is presented in a clear and straightforward
manner. Properly identifying your information needs makes the search process more pro-
ductive and improves the quality of your results. Defining your research question is a key
step in the process and may require several topic revisions depending on your investigation.
The Identify chapter contains useful exercises for you to practice.

Scope

Determining the scope of your research entails not only knowing what you need to know
about your topic, but also knowing what information is available and which forms of that
information will be most relevant to you. Information exists in a variety of formats, in-
The Information Literacy User's Guide       Conclusion

cluding books, articles, and government documents, and it can be found using tools that
are both basic and specialized.

Plan

Planning your research step by step is vital to a success of your project, whether you're
trying to find information for your personal use or working on a class assignment. You can
ensure success by closely following several steps. Self-reflection at the beginning stage of
the planning process helps you reassess your own attitudes toward the research process and
identify the areas unknown to you. The selection of appropriate research tools, whether
library catalogs, databases, or authoritative web sources, will help to save time. Another
time-saving trick is consulting an expert, such as a librarian. The final step in this process is
determining the best search concepts and keywords for your research. Once you determine
your search concepts and keywords you will soon begin to see results.

Gather

Gather helps you with the actual process of collecting information after you've mastered
your skills within the Identify, Plan, and Scope pillars. The Gather phase concentrates on
the importance of understanding that there are different types of information and dis-
tinguishing between them. It also emphasizes the importance of critical evaluation. The
Gather chapter includes tips on searching library catalogs and databases as well as advice
on understanding the Library of Congress classification system. The chapter also reviews
another important skill for a college student: being able to write a proper citation in the
publication style required by a professor, whether it is MLA, APA, or another style.

Evaluate

In the process of gathering your sources, it's important to evaluate them on criteria such as
how relevant they are to your topic, the quality of the information in the source, the author's
credentials for writing on the topic, and other characteristics that may be relevant to your
research. Different types of sources play different roles in the research process and may
need to be evaluated in different ways. Knowing when to stop searching for and evaluating
sources in order to meet deadlines and avoid becoming overwhelmed is also an important
part of this pillar.

The Information Literacy User's Guide  Conclusion

Manage

Managing information is concerned with being able to organize information both ethically
and professionally. Much of the information that is out there is someone's intellectual prop-
erty, which means when you use the information, you have a responsibility to acknowledge
that person's contribution, usually through citation. Citation helps to avoid plagiarism.
Plagiarism is the intentional or unintentional use of someone else's ideas without giving
proper credit; examples of plagiarism are not limited to the academic world. Style manuals
for each of the most common citation styles (APA, MLA, and Chicago) are likely to be
available at your library. You can also use a citation generator as a reference or ask for help
from a librarian.

Present

Presenting the results of your research is important as it sums up the long journey during
your information quest. An early step for presenting the information you have found is
to decide who your audience is, whether it's your friends, family members, classmates, in-
structors, or an even wider audience. Your research can be presented in a wide variety of
ways, including written, verbal, or visual formats. Examples include written materials such
as research papers or blog posts, verbal modes such as presentations or songs, and visual
methods such as photographs or flowcharts. It is important to keep your intended audience
in mind.

Visual Literacy

This chapter addresses the application of information literacy to visual materials. It begins
with an historical overview and definition of visual literacy and then looks at each of the
Seven Pillars in relation to this. Particular attention is given to the difficulty of finding and
accessing images, evaluating these images for accuracy and resolution, and the citation of
visual materials. The Present pillar is discussed at length, with multiple examples of tools
and approaches given for creating and sharing your work. This chapter concludes with a
series of relevant quotations and additional resources relating to visual literacy.

Science Literacy

Science literacy is related to one's ability to understand basic concepts and laws of science
and to use this knowledge in everyday life. There are several types of science literacy: civic,
cultural, practical, consumer, and aesthetic. The chapter presents an overview of each of
these types and provides an overview of other science-related concepts and movements that
are all related to information. The chapter also addresses creating and disseminating sci-
entific information, the open access movement, citizen science, and lifelong learning as an
important component of science information literacy. Keeping up with the latest scientific

discoveries after graduating from college will help you remain scientifically literate. Case
studies and exercises emphasize a practical approach to science literacy.

Further Reading

As you continue to develop your research skills and knowledge, you may wish to do further
reading on information literacy. These resources may not use the Seven Pillars of Informa-
tion Literacy as a lens, but they will all help you become a more knowledgeable researcher.

    Exercise: Reviewing Search Strategies [Answer Key]

1. Now that the team has a draft thesis statement, the next step would be to:

    a. Enter the thesis statement into a database, rather than the catalog [If the team
         enters a long string of words, such as a thesis statement or a whole topic or research
         question, into a database, catalog, or search engine, it will try to find items that
         contain that exact phrase. This type of search won't be very successful.]

    b. Select keywords and enter them into Google [Using keywords is a good approach,
         but Google won't provide results that are academic in nature, so it is not the best
         place for the team to turn. In addition, some thought needs to go into selecting the
         keywords.]

    c. Dissect the thesis statement to determine key terms, related terms, and Boolean
         operators or other searching techniques. [Yes, you are right--this is what the team
         should do. They can then develop a good search to start off with.]

2. If you are interested in the use of social media such as Twitter by college students for
    research purposes, which of the following is the best general search strategy:

    a. (social media and Twitter) and research and college students [There is a problem
         with one of the Boolean operators.]

    b. Social media and college students and research purposes [This doesn't capture the
         potential search terms. In addition, using "research purposes" might miss a lot of
         good sources because it might not always be phrased that way.]

    c. (social media or Twitter or Facebook) and research and college student* [This is
         the best strategy of those presented here. Facebook, as you know, is a very popular
         social network tool, and should be included in the list. If you are searching in a
         web search engine, use the phrase "college student*" (with quote marks). This isn't
         needed for most databases.]

3. The best place to start the search online is:

    a. An online guide on the library's website [Yes, if there is one available, this would be
         a great place to start. The librarian who created the guide will provide tips for how
         to proceed. This will help you with your planning.]

    b. Google [Google might provide a few good sources, but it will require a lot of
         sifting to find them. There are far better places for the team to start.]

    c. The library's catalog [The catalog might provide some good sources. Keep in mind
         that because library catalogs contain a limited number of entries, the team might
         need to consider a broader search than it would use in a database.]
4. When searching a subject-specific database, it is especially important to...

    a. Use any search refinements they provide that make sense[Yes, this is important, but
         the team shouldn't stop with this strategy.]

    b. Check for the best subject headings to use [Yes, this is important, but the team
         shouldn't stop with this strategy.]

    c. Both a. and b [The team members will get the best results if they use both of these
         search strategies.]

5. Sarah realized that the order for doing the best research most often includes these steps

    a. Select topic, select keywords, do search, read and understand results, create product
         [The first steps are fine, but most often, it is not a straight shot from topic selection
         to product creation, as implied by this set of activities. Try again.]

    b. Select topic, select keywords, do search, read and understand results, revise search
         and return to the process as needed, create product [This is a great strategy to follow.
         It is important to realize that topics and search strategies are revised throughout
         the process and this has an effect on searching for and finding information. The
         best researchers don't skip this part of the process.]

    c. Check for online assistance on the library's website, do the search, revise the search
         as needed, create product [A number of steps are missing in this strategy. Look for
         a better one.]

1. Where would you find a speech by Franklin Delano Roosevelt in which he said, "The
    only thing we have to fear is fear itself."?

    a. Web site of Presidential Speeches [It is true, it should be here, but where else
         would it be found?]

    b. Newspaper article dated Oct. 29, 1941 [It is true, it should be here, but where else
         would it be found?]

    d. All of the above [Yes, you are right. All three would contain the speech.]

2. Which of the following sources is the most likely to contain an interview with Steven
    Spielberg about his film "Lincoln," produced in 2012?

    a. Article from a news magazine dated November 23, 2012 [Yes, this is quite likely]

    b. A blog written by a fan of Steven Spielberg [This might be possible, but there is a

         of the original.]

    b. The Southern Historical Collection, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
         [Yes, you are right!]

    c. Local public library's collection [This is unlikely.They might have a later reprinting,
         if the diary was published, but not the original.]

    d. All of the above [You will want to pick the best answer of the other three choices]
4. Which of the following is a primary source?

    a. A review of the film "Lincoln" by Steven Spielberg [Because a review is a com-
         mentary on a primary source, the review isn't primary (but the film itself would be!)
         Try again to determine which is primary.]

    b. A nonfiction book about the Civil War titled The Fall of the House of Dixie : The
         Civil War and the Social Revolution that Transformed the South [The author would
         have used primary sources when writing this book, but the book itself is secondary.
         Try again to determine which is primary.]

    c. The Facebook privacy policy [Yes, you are right. Facebook wrote their own privacy
         policy (it is worth taking a look at), so it would be primary]

    d. A reporter's article about an event that happened yesterday, written from informa-
         tion gathered from bystanders [The reporter's article itself is secondary. He used
         primary sources (the bystanders) as background material for the article. Try again
         to determine which is primary.]
