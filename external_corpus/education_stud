The history of AIRS

The AIRS program has played a pivotal role in shaping research skills development at QUT for more
than 35 years.

In 1988 Prof Christine Bruce (then librarian), redeveloped a series of undergraduate level information
literacy workshops to meet the needs of postgraduate engineering students. Titled Advanced Infor­
mation Retrieval Skills (AIRS), the program was adopted as a mandatory condition of undertaking an
Engineering doctorate.

As momentum gathered around the necessity for all higher degree research (HDR) students to
develop research skills and capability, QUT Library successfully championed the full accreditation of
AIRS. In 1989, IFN001: Advanced Information Retrieval Skills (AIRS) was introduced as a unit of course-
work study attached to the doctorate program. Until 2024, IFN001 remained a 4-credit point course-
work requirement of enrolment for HDR students at QUT, the first and only mandatory unit of its kind
in Australian higher education.

In 2011, QUT Library commissioned an external review of the unit to assess its capacity to respond to
the dynamic research landscape and meet the needs of contemporary researchers. Based on the rec-
ommendations of the review, QUT Library undertook the AIRS redevelopment project in 2012. By 2014,
IFN001 had undergone a comprehensive redesign, transforming its pedagogical foundation from an
instructivist approach to an active, blended learning experience. These changes, along with a more
defined scope of learning, were reflected in the updated unit name: Advanced Information Research
Skills.

The AIRS website was developed in 2012 to make learning resources openly available under a Creative
Commons license, offering current students, QUT alumni, researchers, research students at other insti-
tutions, librarians, and research professionals the opportunity to access the content and to reuse or
adapt the materials for further application.

In 2023, another significant review of IFN001 AIRS was conducted to ensure the unit continued to meet
the evolving needs of QUT's higher degree research (HDR) student cohort, remained aligned with QUT
strategy, policies, and guidelines, and complied with external accreditation requirements. This review
also aimed to deliver sustainable service improvements that reflected contemporary approaches to
learning and teaching and student engagement.

Following this review, the QUT University Research Board approved the replacement of IFN001 with a
new unit, IFN006, which commenced in 2024. Having celebrated 35 years of AIRS in 2024, the program
continues to set the standard in research skills training for HDR students, providing valued contribu-
tions to the QUT research community, the broader Australian higher education sector, and the national
research context. It remains a current, relevant, and essential program that engages students through
innovative, high-quality learning and teaching strategies.

QUT Library continues its commitment to open access and the provision of open education resources
with the redevelopment and publication of the AIRS program by QUT Open Press in QUT's Pressbooks
platform. As before, learning resources remain openly available and licensed for reuse and adaptation.
It is hoped that access to AIRS through the Pressbooks platform will provide new and improved oppor-
tunities for engagement with training for researchers in the effective use of information for research.

1.1 The purpose of AIRS

Advanced Information Research Skills (AIRS) prepares learners for research by systematically introduc-
ing the theories and practical applications of information literacy. It emphasises the development and
transferability of these skills across disciplines and fields of study. It will support researchers to create
new knowledge by engaging deeply with a wide range of information sources. Learners will acquire
strategies to find, organise, analyse, and evaluate information. These information skills are essential for
scholars operating in a contemporary, digital research environment. They facilitate the capacity for crit-
ical evaluation of a field of research and enable personal information skills development during the
research degree and beyond.
What this means is you will develop the advanced skills and techniques to search for relevant and qual-
ity information. You will learn how to manage that information to ensure efficient access in the future
and you will develop strategies for continuing to build your knowledge and maintain current aware-
ness of research in your field. These practices will be a strong foundation for building solid critical think-
ing and academic writing skills, leading to quality research outputs and publications.
Establishing sound information searching and management practices will form part of the essential
groundwork you will need to do for any research project going forward, regardless of your career path-
way or source of employment.

     QUT only

     If you are a QUT higher degree research (HDR) student, the AIRS open program provides early access to
     foundational research skills training materials before you formally begin the IFN006 unit.
     AIRS is a general open education resource designed to support all HDR students, while IFN006 is a QUT-
     specific, credit-bearing unit with tailored content, assessment tasks, and support aligned to QUT's
     research environment.
     Once enrolled in IFN006, you should transition to the IFN006 Canvas site, which includes additional mate­
     rials, activities, and assessment requirements specific to your QUT research degree.
     As you progress through this resource, remember to keep in mind the differences between AIRS and
     IFN006:

Learning approach

AIRS is a self-paced, online learning resource comprising text, multimedia, and interactive learning
objects.

You will engage with a variety of content including pre-recorded videos, readings, learning activities,
and knowledge checks to develop your understanding of the theory underpinning information skills
in your discipline. You will have opportunities to practice these skills, thereby building your capability
for practical application in your field of research. Your work in these activities should be relevant to the
problem or questions you are investigating in your research project.

The Pressbooks platform allows you to progress through the AIRS program in sequential modules, and
once you've completed a full read-through, you can easily revisit specific topics using the table of con-
tents links.

Each module begins with an overview and clearly defined learning objectives. A Knowledge check,
delivered as an online quiz, provides an opportunity to confirm your understanding of the module con-
tent. Following this, the Reflecting on your learning section invites you to consider guiding questions
to help consolidate and apply what you've learned. Finally, the Module summary confirms the comple-
tion of the module and your readiness to move onto the next section.

As you work through the modules you will find coloured text boxes to direct your attention to tasks to
complete and how to do them. These are as follows:

GABRIELLE HAYES, DR SAL KLEINE, MEEKA MOESSNER, PETER SONDERGELD

Module learning objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:
 1. Understand the role of a literature review.
 2. Make a start on your systematic plan for information searching.
 3. Unpack your research question to shape your search strategy.
4. Identify types of literature and determine which are appropriate for your research needs.
 5. Consider appropriate databases and other search tools to find literature.

Learning plan

In this module, we will:
  · Discuss the search process in the context of a literature review.
  · Discuss why you need advanced information searching skills as a researcher.
  · Deconstruct a research question to identify keywords for information searching.
  · Discuss the benefits of a systematic approach to searching the literature using a search method-
      ology.
  · Outline some of the available search tools and resources.

                                                                                                                      Module 2 Preparing to search for information | 13
2.1 Getting started

This module supports your research journey as you progress toward confirming your project and for-
mulating one or more research questions.
In this initial stage, you explore, organise, and analyse literature relevant to your topic as part of the lit-
erature review - an evaluative summary of research in your field. The review serves both as a process
and an output, enabling you to identify and become familiar with existing studies and information in
your research area.
One of the questions you may have as you commence this process is how to conduct the review in a
systematic and efficient way that covers all sources and ensures you don't miss any key information
or publications. This module will explore this question by discussing in more detail what the literature
review is, why it is important, and how to get started. The remainder of the module will cover preparing
to search for the literature that will inform your review.

       It's important to familiarise yourself with the expectations and requirements of your chosen review
       type before you begin. Depending on the type of review you are conducting, you may need to follow a
       specific guideline or framework to ensure methodological rigour and transparency. For example, sys-
       tematic reviews in health disciplines often use the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
       and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to structure the review process and reporting. In business
       research, however, you might use the Population, Concept, Context (PCC) framework to shape your
       review question and search strategy.
       Not sure which approach meets your needs? Explore Which Literature Review is Right for You?

     QUT only

     For help with formulating research questions, work through the QUT self-paced online module, Writing
     Your Research Proposal (QUT access only) or participate in the Write Your Research Questions activity
     (QUT access only).

2.2 The literature review

       "A literature review is an integrative summary of published research on a specific topic. The
       literature review seeks to synthesize what is already known about the topic, and sometimes,
       explicitly state what is not known, or not well understood."

                                                                                                                                                                Dermody et al. (2024).

A definition

The literature review is both the process of analysing existing research and the written evaluative sum-
mary of literature related to your chosen area of study. The review should describe, summarise, analyse,
synthesise, and clarify the existing literature. This will establish a foundation for your research and pro-
vides a clearer understanding of its scope and direction.
Conducting and preparing the literature review allows you to demonstrate advanced skills in the areas
of information-seeking, evaluation, and critical appraisal. It will also provide a mechanism by which you
will become familiar with who has said what and when in the evolution of research for your specific
topic and in related fields or areas of research.

Why conduct and prepare a literature review?

           "A literature review provides a comprehensive review of the literature in a specific area of

                                                                                                                                                      2.2 The literature review | 15
         interest. It is an integral part of doing research, necessary to learn about the current state of
                                                              knowledge of a topic."

                                                                                                                                    Southern Cross University Library (2025).

Beyond meeting the requirements for your higher degree research milestones and final thesis, con-
ducting, writing, and sometimes publishing a literature review is widely regarded as valuable and best
practice for researchers.

A literature review can:

  · be a framework for grounding and focusing a research project
  · provide a means of justifying a research project
  · help to avoid the selection and application of inappropriate research methodologies and instru-

      ments
  · assist researchers to identify themes for sense-making
  · refine research questions
  · create a framework for comparison
  · establish a collection of descriptive data
  · provide guiding questions for preliminary data collection
  · prompt questions during data analysis
  · confirms findings or demonstrates how they reveal gaps, inaccuracies, or limitations in the exist-

      ing literature
  · suggest strategies for presenting your research findings and demonstrating the potential impact

      of your work.

What does a good literature review look like?

Conducting a literature review deepens your understanding of the topic, highlights existing knowl-
edge, and positions your research within the broader academic context. Once you have your sources,
you will read and critically evaluate them to determine their credibility and relevance to your topic.
As you review and synthesise the literature, look for recurring themes and significant issues. This
approach will help you create a well-rounded and insightful analysis.

A literature review should:

  · locate existing literature in your research field
  · identify subject matter experts in your field
  · identify major seminal works
  · identify main methodologies in your field and research techniques
  · group studies into schools of thought
  · discuss what studies agree on
  · discuss what studies disagree on
  · identify the gaps in the literature
  · critically evaluate assumptions and reasoning in existing research
  · provide context for your own research
  · be organised using clear headings and subheadings.

  · A research question summarises the significant issue your research will investigate.
  · The title consists of the topic and outcome of a research project.
  · The research problem defines the knowledge gap your study addresses.
  · A hypothesis is a testable prediction based on prior research that answers the research question.
  · A research focus specifies the scope or domain of inquiry.
A good research question is clear, focused, concise, arguable and doable. It provides a structure for your
searching and will help you to construct a logical argument.

       What if you don't have a research question yet? If you haven't decided on your question, there is no need to
       panic. While it can be beneficial to use your own research question for learning how to search, it doesn't need
       to be finalised.

2.3 Preparing to search

Pause before you start...

A high-quality literature review requires an effective and extensive literature search. The process of
developing an effective search methodology will help you to complete a literature review for your
research project.
When you start searching, your aim is to find relevant and high-quality literature to inform a compre-
hensive and critical analysis of your topic. Applying a systematic approach to searching that carefully
considers and documents the search steps will ensure you get the results you need. This approach
requires some preparation before searching, but it also allows you to continue gathering and scoping
literature as new material becomes available throughout your project.
Finding information is rarely a linear process and you will probably need to revise your search multiple
times before getting it right. This can feel messy, even uncomfortable, particularly for those new to
research. While this does ease as you gain experience, it also pays to become comfortable with the idea
that you may need to revisit earlier parts of the search process to capture all the information you need.

Stepping through the search process

Depending on the stage you are at in your research, or your search objective, a variety of different
types of searches may be appropriate. Consider the search process below as a way to ensure systematic
and effective searching. As this module is about preparing to search, we will focus on unpacking the
research question, identifying information types and considering where to search, with the remaining
steps covered in more depth in Module 3 Finding information for research.

                                                                                                                                                       2.3 Preparing to search | 19

20 | 2.3 Preparing to search
2.4 Unpacking the research question

You will commence the search process by unpacking your research question to identify the discreet
research concepts in your question. Next, you will look for the associated keywords for each of those
research concepts. Some of these keywords may be the same or similar to the words identified for your
research concepts in your question. After that, consider any synonyms and related terms for each of
those keywords. Finally, you can include any subject headings or controlled vocabulary that could be
used to search for those research concepts. You may even find some of these subject headings or con-
trolled vocabulary terms are the same words you identified as your research concepts or may be more
appropriate research concepts for your research question. All these search terms will be used to con-
struct your searches. We will look at these steps in more depth below.

1. Identify research concepts

Your research concepts are the most important words in your research question. These concepts will
form the basis of the keywords, synonyms and related terms you use to start constructing your search.
One of the best ways to quickly understand what you are researching is to identify the concepts in your
research question. These concepts describe the kinds of information you need to investigate to answer
your question. You will do this by analysing your question to identify the exact things you want to know
more about and then documenting those concepts in a list, table, or visual map, and showing how
they relate to one another in order to guide your searching.
Maintain flexibility, as your research question may evolve with growing knowledge in your field, emerg-
ing terminology, and advances in related research.
In this example question, the research concepts have been identified to help construct a search to find
related literature.

                                                                                                                                  2.4 Unpacking the research question | 21

2. Finding keywords, synonyms and related terms

After identifying your research concepts, you will explore keywords, relevant synonyms, and related
terms. Naturally, some of these will be the same or similar to the words in your research concepts. This
helps refine your search strategy within the theoretical framework of your topic and ensures you cap-
ture all pertinent research, even when different terminology is used.
To begin this process:

  · list keywords for each research concept
  · list synonyms that come to mind for each keyword
  · list any related terms for each keyword
  · include singular and plural forms of the words
  · include alternate spelling variations.
You might like to use a dictionary to explore the meaning of terms or look for synonyms in a thesaurus.
Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can be a useful tool to help you brainstorm synonyms and
related terms for keywords in your research question. Whether you use AI functionality within a data-
base or a stand-alone tool designed to support this type of activity, you should use the generated terms
as words as a starting point for your own exploration of the topic.
Next, consider more broad associations with other words and concepts that have a highly relevant and
contextual relationship to your research question. For example, when looking for information about the
common cold, it could help to include the term virus because a type of virus causes the common cold.
Similarly, if you are researching heart attacks, you might wish to include the related term emergency

room as many people who experience a heart attack will attend hospital. These additional words will
become your related search terms.

     Identifying your key terms and synonyms
     Try using a GenAI tool to identify keywords, synonyms, and related terms based on your research con-
     cepts. Did the tool provide useful responses? Did you have to further evaluate the outputs?

Concept mapping

To help expand your search terms, you can create a concept map or mind map, like the example near
the top of this page, which situates the research question in the centre of the map and graphically rep-
resents the associated research concepts. This can help you to clarify the logic of these concepts and
illustrate their relationships with your keywords, synonyms, and related terms.
Alternatively, you may like to organise the information in a table as demonstrated below with our
example research question:

                                                                                                                                  2.4 Unpacking the research question | 23

3. Subject headings instead of keywords

Up to this point, we have focused on identifying keywords, synonyms, and related terms for searching.
However, in some cases, it can be beneficial to explore advanced features available in certain tools,
such as subject heading searching.
Subject headings are standardised terms (specific words or groups of words) used to describe the
content of articles/books. They are assigned by trained experts called indexers (some tools also allow
keyword searching). These use a controlled vocabulary and are also referred to as subject terms. One
example of controlled vocabulary is Medical Subheadings (MeSH). Subject headings can be easily
selected using library search filters, and MeSH terms can be explored individually for relevance within
field-specific databases. Searching with subject headings will be covered in more depth in Module 3.3
Types of searching.
Review subject headings before beginning comprehensive searches to improve effectiveness.

2.5 Determining the types of
information you need

Identify information types

After identifying the research concepts, keywords, synonyms, and related terms from your research
question, you want to consider the types of information needed to inform your research.
In today's complex information landscape, just about anything that contains information can be con-
sidered a potential source. Being able to categorise a source helps you understand the kind of informa-
tion it offers. This can guide you in deciding whether it meets your information needs, where to look
for it, and how you can use it to find similar sources.
One of the most often used categorisations of information sources is by the expertise of their intended
audiences. Broadly speaking, information can be scholarly or popular. A scholarly or academic resource
is generally written by experts in the field for experts in the field and contributes to the body of knowl-
edge in that discipline area. Scholarly sources can be useful for researchers, students, and other people
who want a deep understanding of a subject. An example of scholarly information is an article written
by an academic at a university published in a journal aimed at other researchers within that discipline.
Trade publications commonly report industry news and trends aimed at a specific sector, industry, or
trade. They are aimed at practitioners and are not necessarily written by scholars or experts in a spe-
cific field.
Popular information is more typically written by authors who are not experts in a particular field and
are targeted towards a more general audience. Popular information could be an article in a magazine
or a newspaper. While they may be reporting current information, they are written for entertainment
rather than knowledge generation.

Primary, secondary and tertiary sources

It is important to understand the difference between primary, secondary and tertiary sources so you
can determine what you need for your research.

Note that the meaning of these source types may vary across disciplines. For example, in legal research,
primary sources are case law and legislation.

Types of publications

There are many kinds of publications that you may need for your research. The range will vary depend-

                                                                                                            2.5 Determining the types of information you need | 27

       What is grey literature?
       Grey literature is research and information that has not been commercially published and may not be
       available in academic databases or discoverable by general search engines.
       This type of literature is often produced by government bodies, businesses, industry groups, or acade-
       mic institutions, which might be how you recognise them. Examples could include policy documents,
       theses, conference papers, patents, government reports, and unpublished clinical trial data.

More about journals

Journals are one of the most commonly used types of publications for research. Depending on your
topic and discipline, you may need to access one or more types of journals. Scholarly journals provide
original research and commentary on recent developments in specific disciplines. They:

  · are published regularly (weekly, monthly, biannually, etc.) by an academic institution, research
      body, professional organisation, or scholarly press

  · contain journal articles written by researchers or academics in a particular field
  · are specific to a discipline or subject area
  · can be found in print and online formats
  · are often peer reviewed.
Scholarly journals publish different types of articles:
  · Empirical articles report on original research using data collected from experiments or observa-

      tions. Also known as research articles.
  · Review articles summarise existing research from multiple empirical articles or studies. Also

      known as literature reviews, systematic reviews, or book reviews.
  · Case studies report on specific examples of a particular phenomenon as a means of demonstrat-

      ing a research problem or a solution to a research problem.
  · Methodologies present new or improved research methods, tests, or procedures.
  · Short reports or letters. Also known as brief communications.

28 | 2.5 Determining the types of information you need
What about peer review?

Peer review is a rigorous approval process used by scholarly journals, where one or more experts eval-
uate manuscripts before they are accepted for publication. This process ensures the article is accurate,
well-researched, and contributes to the body of knowledge in a field. Peer reviewed is also known as
refereed. You will learn more about peer review in Module 6.2 Evaluating scholarly journal articles.

2.6 Considering where to search

Deciding where to search for literature is another important part of your preparation. This decision is
heavily influenced by the types of information you need. Using appropriate search tools is key to find­
ing relevant and accurate information and might include searching across library catalogues, data­
bases, and online search tools.
It is likely at this point you might also be thinking about how GenAI tools can support your literature
searching. When used ethically and responsibly, these tools can be used to supplement some research
activities, including finding relevant literature. There's more information on this in Module 2.6.3 Consid­
ering where to search - what about generative AI tools?

specialist databases

In most cases you will find the literature for your research project in specialised databases but there
will be exceptions for certain disciplines and projects.

A database is a regularly updated collection of online resources and may contain journal articles,
ebooks, conference papers, maps, videos, and other electronic resources. Databases can be related to
specific subject areas or cover multiple subjects (multidisciplinary). Identifying and using discipline rel-
evant databases is very effective for finding information on a topic.

Databases can be used for many different aspects of your research, including developing your
research proposal and research question, completing your literature review or research activities, writ-
ing up your results, and discussing the significance and impact of your research.

mation. If your research question is cross-disciplinary, remember to look at all relevant database lists
for related topic areas.

Become adept at searching many databases

For comprehensive searching (covered in Module 3 Finding information), it is recommended to use
more than one database to access a broader range of resources as a single database will not index all
the literature on a specific topic. Searching multiple specialist databases will ensure you find all the lit-
erature to inform your research.

Become familiar with the databases relevant to your research area
and how they work

Even if they cover the same topic areas, individual databases are developed to do different things.
Many databases offer full-text access, but there are index and abstract-only databases that provide just
bibliographic details and the abstract of the resources. These consolidate a broad range of resources
within a subject area and additional useful functionality that is specific to the field, such as a thesaurus
or subject headings.
Some of the specialised databases may be categorised as citation indexes. These databases, such as
Web of Science or Scopus, tend to be cross-disciplinary in nature and only include high quality, peer
reviewed journals. Over time you will learn which databases are most relevant to your field of study.

Evaluating databases - strengths and limitations

Being aware of the strengths and limitations of a database will help to maximise their potential as well
as decide when it is time to select or move to another. Click on the arrows in the accordion below to

other search tools

What about other search tools for finding information for research?

While academic databases are essential search tools for finding research information, there are others
that are also important to help you find the information you need. See below for resources that will
complement your database searching.

Library searching

Searching your library's holdings is a great starting point to look for a range of information sources.
This option is ideal for general searches, especially when you are beginning a new search, and it is
good for known item searching - such as textbook titles.
The library search tool brings together results from many databases and covers different types of
sources, including print books and other physical resources, ebooks, journals and journal articles, DVDs,
newspaper articles, and much more.

QUT Library Search also enables searching for specific types of information via facets, such as the Aborigi-
nal and Torres Strait Islander Search Facet, where you can find books and eBooks, videos, music, audio
recordings, and theses by, and/or about, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.

Search engines

Academic search engines are known for delivering comprehensive coverage and include most jour-
nals. They are particularly useful if you are looking for information sources that are other than scholarly
in nature, such as working papers or grey literature. As an example, Google Scholar searches for schol-
arly papers including journal articles, conference papers, theses, technical reports, limited eBooks, and
has significant coverage of open access publications.

                Searching using academic search engines

Advantages to using academic search engines                  But, keep in mind...

· There can be comprehensive journal coverage                · Full-text may not be searchable
· They are useful for finding other information              · You may experience poor search functionality
                                                             · You may find unreliable and inaccurate records
   sources, such as working papers, grey literature
   (conference papers, reports, policy documents), or
   preprints
· They will link to open access versions of full-text
   where available
· You can set up Google Scholar to show you when
   full-text articles are available in a database
   through your own library and link directly to them

Preprint servers

A preprint is a version of a paper that has been made publicly available but has not yet been submitted
to an academic or scholarly journal for formal publication. Preprints servers or repositories provide
access to new research that may not yet be available or are behind a paywall. Sharing approved manu-
scripts (i.e. early versions of research papers) on a preprint server or repository can expose your research
to a broader audience. Some examples include arXiv. SSRN, OSF Preprints.

· They assign a public time stamp so that
   researchers can be acknowledged for their work
   earlier than traditional publishing allows

· They create a citable output with a DOI
· They enable searchers to identify emerging

   research topics
· They provide opportunities to identify weaknesses

   and gaps in research outputs, which can then be
   eliminated or improved before publication

Open repositories

Open repositories provide free access to discover, read, and download research papers, datasets, and
non-traditional research outputs, without paywalls and subscription fees. These repositories cover out-
puts from different disciplines, with the sciences typically being better represented than other areas.
Open repositories increase the transparency of research and facilitate the reproducibility of studies by
making content available to use, share, and track.

Some examples are arXiv (a preprint server and open repository), QUT ePrints, Dryad, Figshare, Open
Science Framework.

2.6.3 Considering where to search -
what about generative AI tools?

Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is a form of artificial intelligence that uses predictive
modelling to create new content by learning from vast amounts of existing data. GenAI uses algo-
rithms to identify patterns in datasets to generate content, such as written text, images, videos, or
music, based on the input it receives.
AI has the potential to streamline some aspects of research when used ethically and appropriately. For
example, some GenAI tools can efficiently generate basic explanations of broad and complex topics or
summarise and synthesise bodies of literature (although not always accurately). Their strength lies in
producing highly structured responses to highly structured tasks. There are tools specifically designed
to identify literature and make suggestions about related scholarly material. Many of these tools are
particularly useful in the exploratory research phase, where you are scoping the range and depth of
available resources on your topic.

                                Note: Image generated using Microsoft Copilot, 2025 (https://copilot.microsoft.com/).
38 | 2.6.3 Considering where to search - what about generative AI tools?
Prompt: `Create a wordle image with names of GenAI tools that are useful for searching for research or academic literature.'

It is important that you choose the right tool for your purpose. Microsoft Copilot, ChatGPT, and Perplex-
ity AI are examples of GenAI that can engage in text-based discussion and can assist with the gener-
ation of foundational explanations and ideas. This differs from other AI tools, such as Elicit, Research
Rabbit. and Scite.ai, which focus on finding and synthesising scholarly literature in response to plain
language queries.

Some traditional databases are also introducing AI powered natural language searching. Depending
on the database, you can enter your search as a question or statement, which is then interpreted by
the tool based on the context and intent of the query. Some tools also display the equivalent Boolean
search statement to provide additional clarity around how it has been processed by the large language
model. Take a look at the functionality offered by your preferred databases and read the help informa-
tion they provide.

While technologies offer significant advantages for supporting research, using GenAI also carries risks
and ethical implications. You are responsible for understanding the laws, policies, and codes that gov-
ern the ethical use of AI in research. In many cases, the scope and legality of datasets used to train large
language models (LLMs) is unclear and may include diverse sources, such as scholarly articles, web-
sites, and social media posts, some of which are openly accessible, while others are commercially pub-
lished and copyright-protected. To ensure compliance and transparency, discuss your approach with
your supervisor and maintain a detailed log of when and how you use AI prompts throughout your
research process.

Evaluating GenAI tools for research

Artificial intelligence is just one tool a researcher has at their disposal, but unlike a human, it has no
sense of morality or reason. AI can only combine and recombine the data it has been given in ways that
potentially satisfy a given prompt; it is up to you to make sense of the answers. It is important to think
critically and evaluate the reliability, accuracy and context of the content generated and the dataset
used. Developing your own knowledge and understanding of your research domain will enable you to
effectively augment your research with GenAI or other AI tools.
To assist you with evaluating both the tool and outputs, you can apply a rubric to document your evalu-
ation and decision making. There are several openly licensed rubrics that have been developed for this
purpose, including the Evaluating AI Tools for Research Rubric prepared by QUT Library and adapted
from Evaluative information literacy rubric for AI tools by Caico et al., (2024) and Evaluating AI Tools and
Output by University of Texas Libraries (CC BY-NC).
Completing a rubric like this, before you input anything into a tool, will help minimise risk and save you
from potentially using a tool that is not fit for purpose and will end up costing you time rather than
saving it.
The rubric requires you to answer specific questions related to factors such as purpose, relevance, cur-
rency, transparency, reproducibility, legal, and ethical considerations. It will help highlight if something

  · Explain and demonstrate what effective information searching looks like.
  · Outline search techniques (syntax) to develop effective search statements.
  · Practise preliminary and comprehensive searching across a range of databases and other tools.
  · Explain how to determine if your search is effective.
  · Identify additional strategies for finding information, such as cited reference searching.
  · Provide information about accessing and retrieving information from libraries.

46 | Module 3 Finding information for research
3.1 Comprehensive searching

Once you have a good understanding of your research question and the types and sources of infor-
mation you might need, it's time to begin searching for information for your literature review. You will
search across many different tools and adapt your search strategy based on your results, the notes
from your reading, and what you learn about your topic. Depending on the scale of your research, you
may exhaust your searching within hours if you have a very clearly defined or narrow topic or you may
continue searching for literature over many weeks or months for higher degree research level literature
reviews.

Building your search strategy

As we covered in Module 2 Preparing to search for information, the first step in the search process is
to identify the concepts from your research question or search objectives. These concepts describe the
kinds of information you need to investigate in order to answer your research question.
To perform a search, the concepts that have been identified need to be arranged in a way that a data-
base can understand. While search engines like Google are great at understanding a natural language
search, which is where you would use language like you were speaking with another person, databases
require structured input to locate relevant results. The following sections cover how to construct an
effective search.

                                                                                                                                             3.1 Comprehensive searching | 47
3.2 Develop an effective search

An effective search uses correctly applied search language in an appropriate database. This involves
using one or, more commonly, a combination of the following techniques collectively known as search
syntax:

  · search (Boolean) operators
  · phrase searching
  · truncation and wildcards
  · nesting terms
  · proximity operators
  · limiters (or filters).
Search syntax can change across databases. This section uses the most common syntax for each of
the search techniques. Check specific database or search engine help guides for any variations to the
syntax before searching, as the syntax could be applied differently, use different words and symbols, be
irrelevant due to automated search behaviour, or the functionality isn't available.

Search (Boolean) operators

Search operators form the basis of database logic. They connect your search words together to either
narrow or broaden your search. The three main search operators are AND, OR, and NOT.

The `AND' operator

Use the AND operator to connect groups of search terms for each of your different research concepts.
Using AND directs the database to show results that include all the search terms that were included in
the search. The more search terms connected by AND, the more specific your search will be, and fewer
records will be retrieved.

48 | 3.2 Develop an effective search
                           Example: productivity AND writing

The `OR' operator

Use the OR operator to connect keywords, synonyms, related terms, alternate spellings, or abbrevia-
tions together that relate to a single research concept. Using OR broadens the search to include all
records that contain any of the terms linked together using OR. Each time you add another term with
the OR operator, you are potentially increasing the number of records that will be retrieved.

                           Example: productivity OR efficiency

The `NOT' operator

Use the NOT operator to exclude certain words from your search. Using NOT narrows the search by
excluding specific terms. Be aware that this is a powerful search operator and may also exclude impor-
tant records. This operator is best used when paired with a field filter, such as excluding a term from
only the title or summary fields.

                         Example: productivity NOT production

     Watch the video below for a visual overview of Boolean operators.

Phrase searching

Some databases assume that a string of words will be searched as a phrase, whereas others will search
on each individual word. Phrase searching tells the database to look for two or more words in the exact
order they are entered. Most databases use quotation marks (" ") to enclose a phrase.

                                                                                                                                          3.2 Develop an effective search | 49
                                      Example: "right to disconnect"

                                                                   Phrase searching(QUT YouTube video, 38s).

Truncation and wildcards

Use truncation symbols to look for the root or stem of a word. The most commonly used truncation
symbol is the asterisk (*). Be careful to use a word stem that relates to your meaning, to ensure your
search doesn't become cluttered with irrelevant results.

Example: The search creat* will retrieve create, creates, creator, creative,
                                            creativity etc.

   Example: The search polic* will return policy and policies, as well as
                                       police and policing.

A wildcard symbol is used to substitute for a character either within a word or at the end of a word. This
symbol is particularly useful for American or British variations or when you're unsure about the spelling
of the word.

      Example: The term organi?ation will find both `s' or `z' spellings.

Truncation and wildcard symbols vary between databases and search engines, and their compatibility
with other search techniques may vary, so check the help section of each database to make sure your
search syntax has been applied correctly.

Nesting terms

Nesting search terms within parentheses or rounded brackets ( ) controls the logic of the search so you
can group synonyms in sets. The part of the search within the parentheses is performed first.

Example: The search (policy OR governance) AND "right to disconnect"
       finds articles about policies or governance around the right to
                                             disconnect.

Proximity operators

Proximity or adjacency operators allow you to locate one word within a determined distance from
another. Words that are close to each other are more likely to be related than those that are further
apart. Using proximity operators will limit your search returning a smaller group of results. Proximity
operators differ between databases. Check the database help screens to find out which operators are
appropriate for the database you are using.

Limiters

You may also use limiters or filters to narrow your search. This is often best done in the results screen
to increase the relevancy of results after a comprehensive search. Limiters can include:

  · subject
  · format
  · date
  · institutional affiliation
  · geographic region
  · publication source
  · full text or peer reviewed articles.
Search engines such as Google have their own limiters including:
  · domain - restrict to a country, type of organisation or information provider (.au; edu or .gov for

      Australian, educational or government information)
  · format or file type - such as PDF, PPT, Excel, audio or video files to focus your search
  · region
  · last updated.

3.2.1 Linking search terms

Before commencing comprehensive searching, you can test your keywords, synonyms and terms with
some preliminary searches using some of the techniques that have been introduced so far in this mod-
ule.
Preliminary keyword searching helps you determine if you are on the right track with your terms by
conducting basic searches to scope the available literature. You may find thousands of results or none,
depending on where and what you are researching. This process will help to confirm if you are using
appropriate search terms (including keywords, synonyms, and related terms) for your research con-
cepts.

Testing your search terms

Below is a simple search statement based on the example question covered in Module 2, "Does
the experience of moving interstate to commence first-year university have an influence on estab­
lished study routines for school-leaving teenagers?"

     (moving OR re-locating) AND (university OR tertiary) AND "study
                                    routine" AND Australia*

This search statement (also referred to as a search string) shows how we are beginning to link our
search terms with Boolean Operators, nesting the related terms, and applying truncation and phrase
searching.
The terms you include in each search will appear somewhere within the sources that are retrieved
(e.g. within the title, abstract, author keywords, or subheadings). Beginning your search in this way will
retrieve resources where the author(s) used the specific terms you have identified as being important
to your research. As you review the results, you can identify further search terms by highlighting, under-
lining, or circling the main ideas from the more relevant sources you find.
Remember to test and recheck each of your search terms to ensure that they are not too broad or too
narrow. Figuring this out takes practice and may differ with each search. You will begin to see which
terms are more relevant for your research question or project as you undertake preliminary keyword
searching and preliminary reading.
As you conduct these preliminary searches, aim to record basic details of each search, i.e. the database
or search tool used, the search statement used, and your results. This record will help to save time and
frustration when it comes to more in-depth searching and when managing large number of results.

3.3 Types of searching

As you develop more comprehensive searches, we recommend using a combination of strategies, such
as keyword, field and subject searching. Each approach offers unique strengths and produces differ-
ent results, helping you achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness.

Keyword searching

Most databases search keywords or words anywhere unless you choose another type of search. The
database looks for a match for your keyword in any field in the record. This means that your search will
retrieve more information or have higher recall but be less precise than other searches.

     Watch

     See the video below for information about keyword and subject searching.

Field searching

Some databases allow searching in specific fields, such as title, author, abstract, or subject. By using
field searching, you can increase the precision of the search so that it retrieves fewer results.

56 | 3.3 Types of searching
                Example: Searching for bank in the author field retrieves results by authors called `Bank',
                while searching for bank in the keyword field might retrieve results about financial insti-
                tutions or rivers.
                Example: Searching for constructivism in the article title field is a quick way of finding
                articles about that theory, rather than articles that merely mention it in passing.

Subject searching

As discussed in Module 2.4 Unpacking the research question, if a database provides subject headings,
you can use these to perform a subject search that will increase the relevance of your results. Subject
headings are a set of standardised terms or controlled vocabulary that are defined and used by index-
ers of a database to describe a subject so it can be easily found. Often, a single concept may be referred
to by a variety of terms; using subject headings aims to bring these like terms together under a single
term or phrase.
Subject headings may also go by other names, such as descriptors, Subject headings, or index terms.
Check the help pages of a database to confirm whether subject headings or their equivalent are avail-
able.

                                                                                                                                                        3.3 Types of searching | 57

Search facets

Search facets help with finding specific information. Search facets organise information into pre-
defined subsets of library holdings. For example, QUT Library Search includes the Aboriginal and Tor-
res Strait Islander Search Facet where you can find books and eBooks, videos, music, audio
recordings, and theses by, and/or about, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.

Searching by discipline

We've taken you through some of the generic searching techniques that many databases use. Addi-
tionally, there are a lot of specific and more advanced features available to take your searching to the
next level. You should familiarise yourself with the search techniques specific to any of the databases
you use.
We recommend consulting a liaison librarian, preferably with discipline or subject-specific knowledge.
If one is not available, seek the advice of your research supervisor, other members of your research sup-
port team, or your peers.

3.4 Performing the search

In practice, searches are rarely conducted using a single method. Instead, the search will typically com-
bine multiple techniques to improve the precision and comprehensiveness of the results. Below, we
will look at how these techniques can be used together to enhance your search strategy.
There are two general ways in which you can prepare to search:

  · using a single search line or basic search
  · using an advanced or multi-tiered search.
Many academic databases, search engines, and other search tools offer both options.

Single search line or basic search

The basic search function is often the first option you see on a search tool. It requires you to create your
search statement in a single string or line.
The example below uses five techniques simultaneously, including:

  · Boolean operators [AND, OR, NOT]
  · truncation
  · nesting
  · phrase searching
  · peer reviewed limiter or filter.

Advanced or multi-tiered search

The advanced search function is often found via a link from the search tool's home page. In the above
example, you can see the Advanced Search link above the search box. This way of searching provides

60 | 3.4 Performing the search
additional search boxes as needed to allow you to separate elements of your search strategy while still
searching them all at once.
The example below uses six techniques simultaneously, including:

  · Boolean operators [AND, OR, NOT]
  · truncation
  · nesting
  · phrase searching
  · field searching [Abstract]
  · subject searching.

                                                                                                       "Design & Applied Arts Index (DAAI) basic search" © Pro-
                                                                                                                                              Quest

Building a search from search history

In addition to basic and advanced searches, you can also create a thorough and comprehensive search
strategy by performing individual searches on each of your research concepts. Once you have run your
searches on each unique concept to identify the breadth of information available, you use the search
history function found within many databases to combine them. This is particularly useful when con-
structing complex searches, as it lets you focus and evaluate your search on one concept at a time.
See below for an example of building a search strategy based on a search history from the database
Medline (Ebscohost). The search lines also use an array of search techniques, including searching by:

  · MeSH Subject Headings
  · proximity
  · truncation
  · wildcard
  · limiting by publication date.

                                                                                                                                                   3.4 Performing the search | 61

Using GenAI to build your search

Using GenAI can make the searching process more efficient. There are tools that can help you define
your research concepts and also create and refine your search strategy. By specifying your keywords
and terms and the database you are using, you can ask a GenAI tool to assist with crafting an effective
search. Importantly, using GenAI tools should not replace your own understanding of the search
process and critical evaluation of the results, which was covered in detail in Module 2.6.3 Considering
where to search - what about generative AI tools?

Activity

Practise using the above search techniques with your search terms.
    1. Select a relevant specialist database or an academic search engine and practise creating searches.
   2. Identify if your chosen search database or tool doesn't have certain functions or requires you to use
        different steps to use advanced features or filters in order to expand or narrow your results.

                                                                                                                                            3.4 Performing the search | 63
3.5 Documenting your search process

Translating your search

Comprehensive searching will involve searching across a number of different databases and search
tools, to ensure that you find all the relevant information. However, you can't always just copy and paste
a search from one database directly to another without revision.

Some ways that databases differ can include:

  · proximity, truncation and wildcards: some databases might use different symbols or operators for
      advanced techniques, and some databases might not support them at all. In particular, proximity
      operators can vary widely between databases (n/, w/, NEAR/, etc.)

  · subject headings and any controlled vocabulary could be unique for each database
  · filters and limiters can vary as well, depending on the database and the type of information they

      contain
  · the sophistication of the search interface: are you searching in an academic database, with an

      array of features and limiters to choose from, or are you searching in a platform with a simpler
      search interface?

Recording your search methodology

For some tasks, such as preparing a systematic or systematic-like review, documenting your search
methodology is an important part of the research process, particularly for large projects. This record
can help you:

  · evaluate your searches and identify the best combination of keywords and tools to look for your
      information

  · retrace the steps you took to find results
  · keep track of what you've searched and where, and record which keywords you found useful and

      those that provided irrelevant search results
  · report your search in your writing, including the methodology or an appendix if necessary
  · translate your search across different databases and platforms
  · develop search alerts from the most effective searches.

The type of information useful to record can include:

  · date the search was conducted
  · databases searched
  · search strategy used, including any filters that you applied
  · number of results retrieved
  · notes on the effectiveness of the search.

64 | 3.5 Documenting your search process
Tracking your searches

Creating effective search strategies takes time and practice. Every topic and every search tool is differ-
ent, which means you will spend a lot of time experimenting with various keywords and , synonyms,
related terms, search techniques, and syntax. It's important to document your searches, effective or
otherwise, to show your process and avoid unnecessary duplication of work in the future.
You can use the template below to set up your own search tracking record. Delete the example records
before you add your own data.

                                                                                                                                3.5 Documenting your search process | 65
3.6 Evaluating your search

                                                                                Researching is an iterative process. You will have
to spend time reviewing your search results and refining your search strategy to find the best and most
relevant results for your topic or task.

When reviewing your search results, consider the following questions to determine your own `evalua-
tion toolkit.' Select the questions that are relevant to the search you are performing, as some may not
be applicable in certain circumstances.

Did it retrieve too few or too many results?

There is no such thing as an ideal number of search results. Depending on your research, you may
identify many relevant sources of information. Conversely, if your topic is emerging or niche, you may
discover that there is very little material available.

As you get to know your topic, use the table below to `troubleshoot' the possible issues described and
try the recommended solutions (if applicable) to see if your results can be refined. These steps can help
you learn what the information landscape looks like for your topic.

Problem          Possible issues  Troubleshoot the search
                                                                    Solution
Low number of
search results   · Incorrect keywords                      · Correct or adjust keywords
                 · Little or no synonyms included          · Identify and include additional synonyms
                 · Incorrect database                      · Changing discipline-specific database or

                                                              switch to a multi-disciplinary database

Large number of  · Keywords are too broad                  · Adjust keywords to be more specific
search results   · Search operators not correctly applied  · Remove irrelevant synonyms
                                                           · Select a subject-specific database
                    to database                            · Reviewing use of search operators to
                 · Database selected is not specific
                                                              identify any errors in search syntax
                    enough

You shouldn't have to spend hours sifting through results, but neither should your search retrieve 0
results. If this is proving difficult, consider contacting a librarian in your institution or at your local library
for assistance.

66 | 3.6 Evaluating your search
Does it include information types that aren't suitable for the topic
being researched?

The type of resource you are looking for will depend on your topic. Consider whether your topic
requires the use of non-scholarly sources, like newspaper articles or opinion pieces, or if you should
focus on scholarly material like journal articles.

Once you have considered the type of resources you are focusing on, you'll need to ensure that you
are using the appropriate language to match. For example, a scholarly paper might use the term ura­
nium fission, while a news article may use the term nuclear power. Review your keywords each time
you begin searching for different types of information to ensure a match.

Finally, you will need to select an appropriate location to search for the type of resource you're focusing
on. For example, high quality scholarly sources are often found on academic databases, while govern-
ment reports could be accessible through search engines like Google. While there will always be excep-
tions to the rule, such as news articles being available via databases or the news providers' website, use
your best judgement to decide which tool matches your research needs.

Are the results relevant to the topic?

In databases, examine the title, subject headings, table of contents, abstract, and summary to deter-
mine the relevance of your results to your topic. In search engines, examine the title and summary
information (text or other media from the search result). Seeing your keywords and synonyms in your
search results list can help to confirm your search effectiveness.

If you cannot see your keywords in these areas and the results being returned are not relevant, consider
using advanced search functionality (where available) to identify resources that have your keywords in
the title, subject heading, table of contents, abstract, and/or summary.

Are the authors credible?

Look through the search results to identify if key researchers or other expert sources are the authors of
the resources listed. Seeing authoritative authors in your search results list, whether that be individuals
or organisations, can confirm your search effectiveness.

For all authors, consider if they are the most appropriate source for the topic being discussed. Check
whether the individual or organisation publishing the material has the correct expertise to discuss the
topic, or if their expertise may alter their perception.

       Example: Both a dermatologist and a cosmetic chemist would be appropriate sources to dis-
       cuss sunscreen efficacy; however, a dermatologist may be better suited to discuss its effect of
       reducing skin cancer, while a cosmetic chemist would be better suited to discuss improving for-
       mulations.

       Example: When discussing solutions to youth crime, a police department may reach different
       conclusions regarding a solution compared to youth support services.

                                                                                                                                                  3.6 Evaluating your search | 67
Also keep in mind that while some authors publish well-researched, evidence-based material with
proper referencing, others may provide content with minimal supporting evidence. These patterns can
often serve as indicators of an author's overall credibility.

Are the publications or publishers reputable?

Check if the publications or publishers are recognised in your research field or discipline as reputable
publications with appropriately qualified or knowledgeable authors. This applies to both scholarly and
non-scholarly sources.
For academic sources, recognising highly ranked journals and known publishers or conferences in your
search results list can confirm your search effectiveness.

Are the search results current?

Check that the publication dates of the search results reflect current research. Depending on your
research field and discipline, you may need to ensure that the information you find is cutting edge and
published very recently, such as in the last two years or five years. For other disciplines, this may not be
essential, but recency should still be considered.
Don't forget that important or seminal contributions to research in your field may be older. You can
identify these to explain their inclusion in your search results, if recent research would usually be more
appropriate.

Does the search need revising?

After reviewing your search results, you may decide that you need to revise your search to find more rel-
evant, reliable or credible resources. To broaden your search, try adding other synonyms, spelling varia-
tions or try a different database or tool. To reduce the number of irrelevant results, try phrase searching
or subject searching. You can also use filters to refine your results. For example, you might exclude non-
scholarly sources or limit your search to online news outlets, depending on your research needs. There
are many other strategies you can apply to improve the effectiveness of your search, but this process
of refining will take time.

Have all the relevant information sources been found?

Knowing when you have exhausted all the relevant literature can be challenging at first. A common
indicator that you have exhausted the literature is when your searching starts to retrieve the same or
similar information sources each time.

Cited reference searching

Cited reference searching is the process of tracking research through time to situate it in the wider
context of the field. It is also known as snowballing.
Cited reference searching can look backwards in time, examining the sources that informed a work, or
forwards in time, to see how the article has been used and built upon by other researchers.
Citation searching allows you to track research strands to current practice, identify gaps in the research,
and see how often an author or work has been cited. Knowing how often an author has been cited can
give an indication of their standing in the field and may help you discern the quality of a paper. Use
cited reference searching for a quick set of results with great currency for your literature review, or for
advanced analysis, comparison, and tracking.

Cited reference searching in practice

In practice, cited reference searching can feel chaotic, as you jump backwards and forwards in time,
trying to figure out the connections and scholarly conversation between the different articles and
resources in your field. There are three different types of cited reference searching that many data-
bases will allow you to perform:

  · backwards citation tracking
  · forward citation tracking

There are a number of search engines and databases that allow searching by citation, including:

  · Google Scholar allows linking under any item listing to `Cited by' articles and has a `Search within
      citing articles' option.

  · Scopus allows a simple `Cited by' as well as advanced options.
  · Web of Science allows a simple `Times Cited' as well as a comprehensive cited reference search.
  · IEEE Xplore, for electrical engineering, computer science and electronics, provides `Cited by'

      searching and `Citation Map' navigation.
  · CiteSeer focuses primarily on literature in computer and information science fields. CiteSeerX pro-

      vides autonomous citation indexing, statistics and context.

Databases are only able to show citations from within their database, so you may find that different
databases will show a different citation count or point to some different articles. It is important to check
across a range of databases when cited reference searching to make sure you are capturing the full
breadth of information available.

GenAI tools have strengths in citation mapping and analysis. Like databases, the mapping only cap-
tures literature indexed by the tool, so be mindful that gaps may exist in what they find, and results can
potentially include hallucinations. If the use of GenAI is appropriate and permitted for your research
project, use it as one of many methods employed for finding and tracking literature.

MODULE 4 MAINTAINING CURRENT
AWARENESS

LYNDELLE GUNTON, THOMAS MULLINS, EMMA NELMS

Module learning objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:
 1. Develop strategies for maintaining awareness of current literature in your field of research.

Learning plan

In this module, we will:
  · Explain the importance of keeping up-to-date about emerging research, publications and com-
      mentary in your field of research.
  · Discuss some different approaches and tools that you can use to do this efficiently.
  · Practice setting up table of contents, citation and search alerts.

78 | Module 4 Maintaining current awareness
4.1 Why bother?

You have started to map the current literature, gaining insight into the state of research in your field,
identifying key contributors, and understanding the approaches they are taking. As part of this process,
you may also be working on your initial literature review, which will represent a moment in time.
But what happens when you progress onto other parts of your research, such as data collection and
analysis? When you become immersed in that work, it is sometimes challenging to find time to keep
across all the emerging work going on around you and across your field of research.
When it comes to writing up your findings, it will be necessary to include an up-to-date review of the
literature. This can feel like a huge task, almost as if you're starting the literature search all over again.
This doesn't have to be the case! By putting some systems in place and using digital tools to auto-
mate your searching, you can keep informed, gather and collate information about new publications,
research outputs, commentary, and other information sources in your field. This means when you are
ready to update your literature review, you have the information you need to proceed.

                                     "Office stress work business" by mrkaushikkashish via Pixabay, Pixabay licence

It can also seem like there is so much information and so much research happening, you would be for-
given for feeling overwhelmed about how to find it and keep track of it all. This is an excellent reason
why setting up systems and scheduling regular time for attending to current awareness is valuable.
Key reasons for maintaining current awareness are:

                                                                                                                                                                 4.1 Why bother? | 79

     Keeping up with the literatures
     Read this short blogpost by Professor Pat Thomson from the University of Nottingham. Pat shares seven
     tips for what they call their keeping-up reading routine. While reading this blogpost, consider which
     strategies might be useful for your own current awareness practice.

80 | 4.1 Why bother?
4.2 Setting up alerts for keeping
up-to-date with literature

What is an alert?

New research on your topic will continue to be published as you are writing your thesis. Keeping up
to date with the latest research is essential. Automating this process by setting up alerts will save time
and effort and assist you to stay up to date with research in your area of expertise. An alert is an easy
and effective way to find out about and access recent publications in your research area. Depending
on the kind of alert, you may be able to receive it via email or by accessing an RSS feed.

Periodic or regular searching

For databases that don't have an alerting service, you will need to consider how best to monitor the
literature. For example, you could add a new worksheet or tab to your search tracking spreadsheet (see
the example we introduced in Module 3.5 Documenting your search process), with a column for best
relevant searches and the date you last ran each search.
You can use the searching plan template below for maintaining current awareness. Delete the example
records before you add your own data.

84 | 4.3 More strategies for keeping up-to-date
For those journals that don't have Table of Contents (TOC) alerts, you can set a note in your diary to
check the latest issues for articles pertinent to your research. By adopting an organised approach to
searching, you reduce the possibility of missing important work, increase your efficiency, and reduce
research anxiety.

                                                                                                                         4.3 More strategies for keeping up-to-date | 85

MODULE 5 MANAGING INFORMATION
FOR RESEARCH

ZACHARIAH DOMINELLO, GABRIELLE HAYES, DR SAL KLEINE, ELLEN THOMPSON

Module learning objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:
 1. Develop an organisational strategy to store and manage literature and associated notes.
 2. Recognise and select key tools and systems to manage information effectively.
 3. Understand effective techniques for reading and notetaking.

Learning plan

In this module, we will:
  · Discuss available tools, systems and software for storing and managing bibliographic data and
      associated notes throughout your research.
  · Identify a range of approaches for reading literature and taking notes.

88 | Module 5 Managing information for research
5.1 Why does an intentional approach
to information management matter?

                                                  `Organising information' adapted by QUT Library via © Canva.

As you undertake your research, you'll be collecting, reading, and recording large quantities of infor-
mation. Over time, this may include hundreds or even thousands of references, files and notes that will
inform your writing. To manage this effectively, it's essential to establish a system for recording, storing,
and retrieving information and references when needed. This will help you efficiently handle the vol-
ume of information typically involved in a literature review.
Once your information management system is in place, you can begin engaging with the literature,
that is, reading, taking notes, and coding sources to identify their relevance to your research question.
This process will also support the development of an annotated bibliography, if required.
The key is to be intentional in how you read, take notes, and organise your materials. You might choose
to use one or two consistent strategies across all your readings or adapt different approaches depend-
ing on the context. This will help you stay in control of your research, synthesise research concepts, and
draw meaningful connections between ideas.
The level of complexity and the range of tools you use to manage this information is up to you. You
might prefer using separate software for storing notes and another for managing references. Alterna-
tively, you could opt for an all-in-one solution like EndNote, which allows you to store, annotate, and cite
your readings in one place. Whatever approach you take, establishing consistent systems and practices
early in your research project, and maintaining them throughout will help ensure your work progresses
smoothly and efficiently.

                                                                       5.1 Why does an intentional approach to information management matter? | 89

90 | 5.1 Why does an intentional approach to information management matter?
5.2. Organising your folders and files

Organising the information and literature you identify during your search will support easier access
and retrieval later in your research process. Taking the time to name your folders and files appropriately
can have a significant impact on your ability to locate and use resources when you begin reading, note-
taking, and writing.
By implementing a few key strategies early on, you can work more efficiently and stay focused during
the later stages of your research project. This can include:

Creating a logical structure

It can be useful to start with broad categories for your top level folders and then create sub folders.
For literature, you could organise your folders by information type (e.g. journals, books, grey literature)
with subfolders for different themes (e.g. housing policy, economic theory, environmental impact) or
status (to read, review in progress, reviewed), or even a combination of both.
For notes, folders organised by purpose might be more appropriate, such as annotated bibliography,
quotes, reflections, and summaries.

Naming your files

Your institution may have a recommended format for naming your files. Whatever you decide, your
goal is to make your files searchable and discoverable. As you will likely be collating large volumes of
information, it is important that your naming conventions are practical and consistent.
Depending on the type of information you might include:

  · author name
  · publication date
  · brief description of the content/title
  · version number.

Choose descriptors that make sense to you and will help you to locate resources later on. This will save
you time and stress when trying to find that really important article you know you read early on in the
literature review!

Saving and backing up

Backing up your work is important for ensuring continued access to your files. In the unfortunate event
of file corruption, accidental deletion or hardware issues, you can avoid significant stress and save time
and effort by setting up a regular back up schedule. You can back up your files on local hard drives,
cloud storage locations, or other secure options provided by your institution. While these files should

                                                                                                                                   5.2. Organising your folders and files | 91

ital research data.

5.3 Reading strategies

A well-designed reading strategy enhances the quality of your literature review by guiding you through
the process of selecting, analysing, understanding, and synthesising relevant sources. A reading strat-
egy will save you time and help you focus on the readings that are most relevant to your literature
review while being able to identify and put aside readings that are irrelevant or inappropriate for the
purpose of your project.
There are various strategies you can employ to enhance your comprehension, critical thinking, and syn-
thesis while reading. Remember that different strategies work best for different types of reading mate-
rial and learning styles. Experiment with these strategies and find the ones that work most effectively
for you. You can read below about two of the most recognised reading techniques. These can save you
a lot of time and frustration as you explore and categorise literature for your research.

                    https://qut.pressbooks.pub/airs/?p=1184#h5p-75

Skimming

Skimming is a rapid reading technique used to quickly get an overview of a text's content without
reading every word. It's particularly useful when you want to assess whether a text is relevant to your
needs, identify the main ideas, and decide whether to invest more time in detailed reading. Skimming
involves looking at headings, subheadings, introductory and concluding paragraphs, and other visual
elements to extract essential information.
Remember that skimming is not about reading every word but about quickly grasping the structure
and main ideas of the text. It's a strategy to help you decide if the text is worth reading in detail or if
you can move on to another source. Skimming is particularly helpful when you have a limited amount
of time and a large volume of material to go through, such as conducting research or preparing for a
presentation.

Scanning

Scanning is another rapid reading strategy that involves quickly searching for specific information
within a text without reading every word. This technique is particularly useful when you're looking
for specific details, keywords, or phrases in a text. Scanning is more involved than skimming as you
are engaging with the text more deeply to identify specific information.Scanning allows you to locate
information efficiently and saves time compared to reading the entire text.
Scanning is especially valuable when you have limited time and need to locate specific facts quickly.

Effective notetaking will save you time and help you make connections between readings and identify
themes and gaps. Notetaking strategies can help you summarise and synthesise ideas and retain infor-
mation more effectively.
There are various note-taking strategies that you can use to capture and organise information. Some
are described briefly below.

5.5 Notetaking software

Using an electronic system for notetaking allows you to manage your notes more efficiently through
the use of tags, keywords, or metadata. These tools establish a consistent format that allows you to eas-
ily distinguish your own thoughts and ideas from quotes or ideas of others. They become searchable
databases for your notes and original ideas.
Using these tools in combination with specific notetaking systems can be a useful strategy for man-
aging your notes from reading the literature and notes from attending research seminars or meetings
with your supervisor or research team.
Select the arrows in the accordion below to see some popular examples of some digital tools that you
might like to consider for your notetaking and managing notes.

Digital tools to support notetaking

All of these platforms can be formatted to support notetaking methods such as the LATCH system, the
Cornell Note Taking System or Templates and Literature Grids. However, it's important to review the
privacy and security policies of any tool you use. Avoid uploading sensitive information or licensed PDFs
to platforms that permit model training. Keep metadata, such as article title, authors, publication, and
date, in your reference manager, and store full-text documents only where licensing allows.

Some bibliographic or referencing management tools (e.g. EndNote, Mendeley, Zotero) include addi­
tional functionality, enabling you to add notes on each reference, code or tag references, group them
thematically, and mark up stored PDFs. We will cover bibliographic management tools in Module 5.7
Citation and reference management.
Whatever reading or notetaking strategies you use will depend upon the type of information you are
managing and your personal preference. Whether you stick with one reading and one notetaking
technique and/or tool for all your work or use a combination of methods and tools for different pur-
poses, having a reading and notetaking strategy in place will make managing the information associ-
ated with your literature review much easier.

5.6 Coding the literature

Coding the literature is a crucial step in the process of conducting a literature review, especially when
dealing with a large number of sources. Coding not only helps you synthesise the literature but also
provides the foundation for analysis, synthesis, and the generation of insights in your literature review.
Coding involves categorising, organising, and extracting key information from the literature to identify
patterns, themes, and relationships.
There are many coding methods available for use. Select the arrows in the accordion below to read
about these techniques.

     Categorising and coding your literature
     Using literature or other resources you have already collected:

         1. List the different categories of literature or other information. For example, frameworks, policy,

100 | 5.6 Coding the literature
     empirical studies.
2. Define and assign simple and meaningful codes. Try using short labels (e.g., FRA, POL, EMP) for each

     category.
3. Tag your literature as you read or in your referencing management tool (e.g., EndNote). Label each

     source with relevant codes.
4. Review and refine. Adjust categories or codes as patterns emerge.
5. Search for all the literature with the same tag. Was this an efficient way of locating and retrieving the

     literature?

                                                                                                                                           5.6 Coding the literature | 101
5.7 Citation and referencing
management

Referring to and citing your sources are essential aspects of scholarly writing. This is a matter of aca­
demic integrity for avoiding plagiarism and for effective academic communication. In your research
thesis the number of sources used may be very large, perhaps amounting to in the hundreds. It is
important to develop practices or employ systems to manage these and the information about them
effectively and efficiently for all the uses you will make of them.

Referencing management software was developed to store and manage large amounts of citation
data about sources. The software allows you to create centralised, well managed collections of citation
data for the essential referencing tasks in your documents. There will also be additional information
organisation features. Some of these could assist with literature reviewing tasks.

Features may include:

  · easy importing of records of sources from databases and search engines
  · inserting of citations and references in documents using referencing styles' formatting rules
  · storing PDFs with source records to build and manage your collection of literature
  · organising references in groups or folders for task processes, topic hierarchies, chapters, or pro-

      jects
  · coding with colours and numerical or text tags of references to organise the literature
  · PDF viewing and document mark-up, such as highlighting, underlining, or comments
  · note taking add-ons
  · sharing of reference libraries or subsets for collaboration.

Referencing software will apply formatting rules but does not control the quality of source data. Source
data will still need to be proofed and corrected. To be able to do this, it remains necessary to first be
proficient in referencing.

     QUT only

     QUT does not mandate a specific software so select what is best for your situation.
     QUT provides an introductory guide to citing and referencing for a number of referencing styles called
     cite|write, which also points to more comprehensive authorities for the styles. You can view more informa-
     tion regarding avoiding plagiarism at QUT on the QUT HiQ website.
     In addition, the Graduate Research Centre (GRC) provides HDR students with access to the text matching
     software, iThenticate. You can use iThenticate to identify information in your work that may still require
     acknowledgement. You will learn more about these in Module 7 Using information responsibly and ethi­
     cally.

Available software

When considering which tool to use to manage your citations and referencing, consider the following
questions:

  · What does my supervisor recommend?
  · What do other researchers in my area use?
  · Does the software easily work with the databases I need to use?
  · Do I need the software to work easily across multiple devices?
  · Do I have need for features beyond thesis referencing, for example for collaboration or storage?
  · What support do I need or is available from peers, the university or the software vendor?

                                                                                                                        5.7 Citation and referencing management | 103

     Consider the features, strengths and weaknesses of a range of tools in relation to your own circumstances.
     Remember to look at the specific product information for any tool you select for current features and con-
     ditions of use.

          · RMIT University: Choosing a reference manager - what to consider

     QUT only

     QUT learners can read information about the most commonly used tools at QUT for managing your refer-
     ences. They include EndNote, Mendeley, Paperpile, Zotero, and for a small group of specialised users, Bib-
     TeX.
     QUT pays for licensed versions for you for EndNote, Mendeley, and Paperpile. Free versions are available for
     Zotero and BibTeX. For all of these, there are links to self-help resources. There is a comparison table show-
     ing features as well as the benefits and challenges of the different tools. Consider what tool might best
     meet your referencing management needs.

   EndNote support

     Along with Mendeley, EndNote is the most fully featured referencing software paid for by QUT for use by
     students and staff. It is also the most fully supported, including:

          · Availability on lab computers, for installation on QUT machines, or download to personal devices.
          · Hands-on EndNote Essentials and Advanced training.
          · QUT EndNote online instructions guide.
          · Installation and IT help from HiQ.
          · Clarivate EndNote instructions, FAQs and support.
          · Individual how-to assistance and guidance from QUT Liaison Librarians.

     Activity

         1. Ask your supervisor whether they have a recommendation for referencing management software.
        2. Ask peers in your research area about which software they use and why.
        3. Compare the different software options available to you.
        4. Explore the introductory training resources available through your institution or from the vendor to

106 | 5.7 Citation and referencing management
             evaluate the software.
        5. If considering EndNote and training is available to you, register for an EndNote workshop or enrol in

             an online module.

Manual reference management

Referencing management software is efficient and comes with off-the-shelf functionality. It is techni-
cally possible to replicate some of the functionality of full systems manually, using a spreadsheet for
bibliographic data in columns, and then manually building references in the appropriate style in your
documents.
As well as exporting to referencing software, it is possible to export publication information in CSV for-
mat to be opened in a spreadsheet. And just like as part of notes tags or fields in referencing software,
it could be possible to use the spreadsheet to collect quotations or page numbers or organise a litera-
ture grid by theme or code manually.
You might choose to develop a manual method if you don't expect to have a lot of literature to scope
or review. However, this would not be usually recommended for researchers or HDR students and is
probably more suited to undergraduate and coursework programs level papers and projects with small
numbers of references.
You are encouraged to select a referencing management tool early and spend time developing a work-
flow and upskilling yourself in the software. This is an essential step prior to, and as a basis for, starting
to collect a large volume of literature and performing literature review tasks.

                                                                                                                        5.7 Citation and referencing management | 107

MODULE 6 EVALUATING INFORMATION
FOR RESEARCH

LYNDELLE GUNTON, DR SAL KLEINE, CAMERON RUTTER, ALICE STEINER, STEPHANIE VILLIS

Module learning objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:
 1. Critically analyse and evaluate the quality and credibility of information sources.
 2. Develop and apply skills to prepare an annotated bibliography.

Learning plan

In this module, we will:
  · Identify and apply criteria for evaluating information.
  · Use tools to evaluate the credibility and quality of information.
  · Discuss the purpose of and how to prepare an annotated bibliography.
  · Practice evaluating literature.

                                                                                                                     Module 6 Evaluating information for research | 111
6.1 The basics of evaluating
information

Evaluating the information sources you find is an essential step in producing high-quality research.
While checking for accuracy and relevance is important, higher degree research often requires a
deeper analysis of the credibility and influence of a source. This section introduces key frameworks to
help you make informed decisions about which sources to trust and use.

     Watch

     See the video below for advice about what to consider when evaluating information sources.

                          One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view
                          them online here: https://qut.pressbooks.pub/airs/?p=448#oembed-1

                                Evaluating literature and information to determine research relevance(QUT YouTube video, 0m50s).

For advanced research, it's also important to consider the impact of a source within its field. Indicators
such as publication metrics and journal rankings, can provide valuable context for your evaluation. For
practical strategies on locating and interpreting these indicators, refer to Module 10: Finding and using
indicators of research impact.

Criteria for evaluating information

Not all information you find will be suitable for your research. To help you evaluate sources effectively,
there are a number of frameworks available to help you. These may differ depending on the type
of information or sources you are considering. Over the next few pages, you'll find several options to
explore and apply.

     Watch the video below for an introduction to the how to evaluate information.

                          One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view
                          them online here: https://qut.pressbooks.pub/airs/?p=448#oembed-2

One set of criteria you can use is the CRAAP Test. This framework considers the elements of:
  · Currency
  · Relevance
  · Authority
  · Accuracy
  · Purpose

The CRAAP Test prompts consideration of each element to inform your evaluation of a source in the
context of your intended use. For example, most sources will provide a publication date, which enables
you to determine the currency of the information and inform your decision on whether the informa-
tion provided in the source material is appropriate to use based on your purpose.
Select the hotspots on the image below to find out more about each element of the CRAAP test for
evaluating information.

                    An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it online here:
                    https://qut.pressbooks.pub/airs/?p=448#h5p-47

In the remainder of this module, we will focus on evaluating journal articles, websites, and content gen-
erated by artificial intelligence. Use the criteria that best aligns with your needs and the type of infor-
mation you are assessing.

       Evaluating quality is important, but understanding a source's impact can strengthen your research

                                                                                                                             6.1 The basics of evaluating information | 113

114 | 6.1 The basics of evaluating information
6.2 Evaluating scholarly journal
articles

Journal articles are scholarly papers that report research findings or review research developments
within a subject area. Articles frompeer-reviewed journals go through a process of review by one or
more experts in the subject area who are recognised as having academiccredibility.

Peer review

The quality of information may vary according to the source where the information is published. Infor-
mation in magazines and newspapers may have less academic credibility than information in peer
reviewed journals and research reports. Peer reviewed journals - also known as refereed or scholarly
publications - require that the information is reviewed by several experts in the field.
As we mentioned in Module 2.5 Determining the types of information you need, peer review is a strict
approval process applied to scholarly journals with one or more experts reviewing the manuscripts
before they are accepted for publication. This process ensures the article is accurate, well-researched
and contributes to the body of knowledge in a field. Peer reviewed is also known as refereed.
Other publications require that the information is reviewed only by an editor. Be wary of publications
that undergo no review process at all.

How do you know if a journal is peer reviewed?

Find the publisher's website by doing a Google Search for the journal title. Use quotation marks
around the journal title to force a phrase search. The publisher should make clear if the journal is peer-
reviewed.

Evaluation criteria for journal articles

When evaluating scholarly journal articles, you can use the following criteria.
  · Peer-review
  · Authority
  · Accuracy
  · Objective
  · Referencing

For example:

                                            "Evaluation of journal article by Duan et al." by QUT Library, CC BY 4.0
     Activity
116 | 6.2 Evaluating scholarly journal articles
Search for a journal to identify whether it is peer reviewed.
   1. Go to Google Scholar and conduct a sample topic or title search on e.g., "nursing research"
   2. Select a journal article, then find the publisher website for that journal using Google
   3. The journal website provided by the publisher should indicate whether the journal is peer-reviewed.

                                                                                                                        6.2 Evaluating scholarly journal articles | 117
6.3 Evaluating online information
sources

Information found online may be published by anyone and might not undergo peer review or editorial
oversight. It may be incomplete, inaccurate, or written by non-experts, and can be unstable and
changeable. It may be aimed to sell ideas, products, or services.
Considerauthor and authority, accuracy and completeness, stability, bias and misrepresentation, pro­
paganda, and commercial agendaswhen evaluating online information.
Select the arrows in the accordion to read more about some of the key considerations when evaluating
online sources.

Conference papers and proceedings

Some disciplines rely more heavily than others on conferences and conference proceedings as a
means for speeding up the publication and distribution of scholarly research.
In addition to other considerations in evaluating the quality of a conference paper, you can look at the
quality of the conference at which the paper was presented and from which it was published as part
of its proceedings.

118 | 6.3 Evaluating online information sources
6.4 Evaluating outputs from
Generative AI tools

GenAI tools have the potential to be powerful supplementary resources in our professional and per-
sonal lives. However, GenAI can only work with the data it has been trained on, which often results in
inconsistent, unreliable, biased, inaccurate, or even nonsensical outputs. Critical thinking is essential to
evaluate the authenticity and accuracy of what has been generated.
When reviewing content generated by AI, you should evaluate the output as you would with informa-
tion from a Google search or academic database. Tools such as the CRAAP test, that was covered ear-
lier in this module, and other criteria for evaluating information can be useful when applied to GenAI
content as they allow you to question the information with which you have been provided.
An AI-specific test, the ROBOT Test, allows you to specifically evaluate GenAI content. ROBOT stands
for Reliability, Objective, Bias, Ownership, and Type. The test encourages users to question and assess
the information but also to evaluate specifically the technology itself.
An outline of ROBOT and the questions it prompts you to ask can be found below:

  "Evaluating GenAI" by Southern Cross University Library adapted from "Separating artificial intelligence from science fiction:
              Creating an academic library workshop series on AI literacy" by Hervieux, S., & Wheatley, A., CC-BY-NC-SA 2.0
                                                                                                                 6.4 Evaluating outputs from Generative AI tools | 119
This is a rapidly changing space, and equal measures of enthusiasm and caution are desirable when
considering the potential of generative AI tools to source information. As with any technology, ethical,
critical, and appropriate use is key. For more reading recommendations about this, go to Additional
Resources in the Module 6.7 Module Summary.
As mentioned in Module 2.6.3 Considering where to search - what about generative AI tools?, QUT
Library's evaluation rubric is designed to help you to assess GenAI tools and the outputs they provide.

     Activity

     Identify an appropriate framework for evaluating information sources
         1. Select an information source you have already found.
        2. Consider that source in light of the different frameworks presented above and on the previous page.
        3. Determine which one(s) works best for that source.
        4. Note down the acronym or details for the framework so you can quickly refer to it when needed (you
             may decide you need more than one framework, depending on the types of information sources
             you use).

6.5 Evaluating literature through
annotation

"How to prepare an annotated bibliography" by Research & Learning Services, Olin Library, Cornell University Library, Ithaca, NY,
                                                                               USA. CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

                                      "Books smartphone hand keep mobile" by geralt via Pixabay, Pixabay licence

Why annotate the literature?

Annotating the literature supports a structured approach to reading, note-taking, and critical engage-
ment with research. It enhances your ability to evaluate scholarly work by providing a framework for
identifying methodologies, limitations, gaps, quality, and relevance, which are key elements in assess-
ing academic literature.
The annotation process strengthens your ability to speak and write about your topic with clarity and
confidence. This can be used to contribute to your preparation of a literature review, which may be
used for your research milestone or thesis documents, and maybe a manuscript for publication in the
future
Annotating the literature will:

  · bring together your searching and evaluation skills
  · give you a framework for identifying, summarising, and evaluating literature for any research pro-

      ject in the future
  · provide a systematic strategy for recording notes about any information source
  · develop the necessary foundational skills for preparing a literature review

                                                                                                                      6.5 Evaluating literature through annotation | 121
  · help you to synthesise information to build your knowledge base about research in your field.

       A word of caution!
       While some GenAI tools can help you to locate and evaluate information sources, they should be used
       to support - not replace - your own thinking. If you want to become an expert researcher and con-
       tribute original research, take care to avoid shortcuts that bypass the intellectual effort required. Don't
       make the mistake of assuming they can do the critical thinking or synthesising for you; that's your role
       in the research process.

What does a good annotation look like?

       "Many scholarly articles start with an abstract, which is the author's summary of the article to
       help you decide whether you should read the entire article. This abstract is not the same
       thing as an annotation. The annotation needs to be in your own words, to explain the rele­
       vance of the source to your particular assignment or research question."

                                                                                                                                                    CSUN University Library, 2025.

The annotation must provide:
 1. the full citation for the source you are annotating
 2. a summary of the main arguments or ideas presented by the author, which may include mention
      of methodology and findings/conclusions
 3. an evaluation of the quality of the source - assess its currency, authority (or credibility), accuracy
      (or reliability), and purpose, and compare it with other sources you have used
4. a reflection on the significance of the source to the research field and how you are using or intend
      to use the source in your research and usefulness it is in answering your research question.

7.1 The basics of using information
ethically

Once you've found and evaluated suitable information sources, the next step is knowing how to use
them effectively. This includes not only integrating the information into your writing but also applying
it ethically.

What is ethical use of information?

Ethical use of information is the thoughtful and considered application of all forms of information
throughout your research, be it in your reading, thinking, writing, publishing or in your research data
collection, analysis, management, and dissemination. Ethical use of information is one aspect of acad-
emic integrity.
QUT is committed to creating and fostering an environment that encourages and rewards academic
integrity, and ensuring that students and staff have clear guidance and support so they may follow
these principles.

What are the principles at QUT

QUT students are expected to maintain high academic standards to protect the value of QUT qualifica­
tions for all graduates. In practice, this means ensuring that all assessment items are approached and
completed with the highest standards of academic integrity. Any actions or practice that defeats the
purpose of assessment is regarded as a failure to maintain academic integrity. This involves represent­
ing another person's ideas or work as your own (plagiarism), including resubmitting their own work for
another assessment item (self-plagiarism) or cheating in examinations.

     QUT only

     All QUT HDR students are required to to complete the Research Integrity Online training and quiz tofur­
     ther develop your research skills and help you fulfil your obligations under the Australian Code for the
     Responsible Conduct of Research 2018.

128 | 7.1 The basics of using information ethically
Academic misconduct - plagiarism

This involves representing another person's ideas or work as your own. It may also include resubmitting
your own work for another assessment item. Common forms of plagiarism include:

  · direct copying, summarising, or paraphrasing another person's work without appropriate
      acknowledgement of the sources

  · using or developing an idea or hypothesis from another person's work without appropriate
      acknowledgement

  · representing the work of another person as your own work
  · copying non-word based material (such as diagrams, plans or audio-visual materials) and present-

      ing them as your own work
  · using another person's experimental results as your own or without appropriate acknowledge-

      ment.

Plagiarism detection

Some higher education institutions provide access to plagiarism detection software for researchers
and HDR students. Some may require students to submit their milestone documents and/or final the-
sis through such a platform. Enquire with your research supervisor or your institution's research sup-
port services about plagiarism detection software available to you.

     QUT only

     For the purpose of QUT coursework, assessment will need to be submitted via the Turnitin submission
     portal in your Canvas unit site for the purpose of checking for plagiarism and AI writing. See information
     on the HiQ website about using Turnitin when submitting your assessment.
     QUT HDR students have access to iThenticate for lodging milestone documents, including final thesis for
     examination, and manuscript checking.
     See the HiQ website for more information about avoiding plagiarism for HDR students.

Why is detecting plagiarism important?

Plagiarism, intentional or otherwise, compromises the integrity of coursework and research assess-
ments. It means you are not providing appropriate evidence of the learning you've undertaken and the
knowledge you have acquired in your degree. As members of an academic community, students are
expected to contribute to and uphold the standards of scholarly work. Engaging in plagiarism under-
mines the credibility of the institution, diminishes the value of its qualifications, and can negatively
impact the reputation of fellow students and graduates.

                                                                                                                       7.1 The basics of using information ethically | 129
Allowing you to obtain a degree with plagiarised assessment lowers the overall quality of graduates
and undermines the value of the qualifications offered and the achievements of other students.
Awarding a degree based on plagiarised work devalues the achievements of others and the quality of
academic programs. Maintaining academic integrity is essential to preserving the trust, respect, and
recognition associated with your qualification.

What about the use of generative AI tools?

As a research student, you are responsible for the integrity, rigour, and originality of your research, irre-
spective of any tools used. Ensure you familiarise yourself with your institution's policies and guidelines
about the responsible use of GenAI. Most importantly, talk with your research supervisor before you use
any GenAI or AI tools and clarify how use of specific tools is and is not appropriate. Review any informa-
tion or license agreements.

Acknowledging the use of AI tools

Your institution likely has policies and guidelines for acknowledging the use of Gen AI or AI tools in aca-
demic work. You may be required to include an acknowledgement statement in your thesis or publica-
tion, outlining how the tool and its outputs were used ethically and responsibly. This could also involve
providing the original prompt or chat history. Keep in mind that this is different from citing or refer-
encing AI-generated content within your text.
For example,

       I used AI to:
       (i) generate ideas or structure suggestions, for assistance with understanding core concepts, or
       other substantial foundational and preparatory activity for the assessment. I used Consensus
       (https://consensus.app/search/) and Scite (https://scite.ai/) to find relevant academic literature
       and ExplainPaper (https://www.explainpaper.com/dashboard) to help understand the argu­
       ments in the sources.

     Please note the requirements on the HiQ website for HDR students in relation to the use of generative AI
     tools in theses and other research milestone documents and research outputs.

Case study: Ethical use of AI for study
Read the short case study below about the use of GenAI for study purposes in QUT's accredited unit,
IFN006.

Case Study: Ethical Use of AI for Study

Tool: NotebookLM is a Google tool that uses AI to help users understand information. It can summarise
documents, generate explanations, and answer questions based on the provided documentation. It can
also create personalised guides and "Audio Overviews" that summarise documents in a podcast-like for-
mat.
Use: Educators used NotebookLM, to provide an alternative way for students to access assessment task
information. The team uploaded the assessment task sheet and marking rubric into NotebookLM. The
tool scraped those documents to answer questions, create FAQs, and even generate audio overviews in a
podcast-like format, thereby providing an additional mode for students to use for learning.
Ethical considerations: Educators ensured that all uploaded information and documentation were owned
by QUT, Creative Commons (CC) licensed or public domain and not copyrighted by a third party or other
creators. This careful selection of materials avoided any issues related to intellectual property rights. The
terms and conditions of the tool were also checked and considered, to ensure intellectual property rights
would not be contravened. The team clearly acknowledged how the AI-generated content was created.
Conclusion: This application of AI demonstrates how technology can be used ethically to support and
enhance educational experiences. By ensuring the use of QUT-only materials and CC licensed or public
domain materials, maintaining transparency, and distinguishing AI-generated content, the team upheld
ethical standards while providing valuable resources to students in an accessible, efficient, and engaging
learning environment.

Activity

Consider the following questions in relation to the case study above.
    1. What ethical considerations should be taken into account when using AI in education?
   2. How did the AIRS Coordination team ensure intellectual property rights were not violated?
   3. How can we maintain transparency when using AI to create content?
   4. Why is it important to distinguish AI-generated content from human-created content?
   5. What parallels can be drawn between this case study and an ethical approach to using AI in
        research?

                                                                                                                  7.1 The basics of using information ethically | 131

7.2 Citing and referencing

Academic writing is a significant part of any higher degree research program. Writing in a scholarly
context involves the essential practice of acknowledging the work of others in your research. In the
academic context, that acknowledgement takes the form of citing and referencing.
Learning to reference accurately and appropriately is very important as it is an indication that you
understand the audience and the expectations of scholarly behaviour. Referencing gives you, as the
author, a way to demonstrate how widely you have read in your field of research and it provides a map
for the reader to understand what, who, and where the author has read. The citations provide direc-
tions or links for the reader to be able to access those sources.
The two components to academic referencing are in-text citations and the reference list.

                    https://qut.pressbooks.pub/airs/?p=1837#h5p-54

In-text citations

An in-text citation must be provided for every direct quotation, paraphrase or summary of another's
work or idea.

Quoting

Quoting is using the exact words of another author. If you use a quotation, the in-text citation should
include the page (or paragraph) in which the words were found. Short quotations should be enclosed
with single (` `) or double quotation marks (" "). See the APA 7th example below.

       Example: "Kind and new acts, performed daily over as little as 10 days, can increase life satisfaction"
       (Buchanan & Bardi, 2010, p. 236).

Long quotations should be indented. Quotation marks are not necessary. See the example below.

                                                                                                                                                 7.2 Citing and referencing | 133
       Example:
       Some of the difficulties in carrying out competitor analysis are described by Hussey (2001):

                 Without sound analysis and creative strategic thinking companies are unlikely to produce
                 world-beating strategies. Creativity is about insight and the use of imagination and adaptability.
                 It is also about harnessing personal creativity to corporate ends (p. 212).

Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is writing the ideas of another author in your own words. If you paraphrase another
author, or authors, you still need to provide an in-text citation.
Paraphrasing is a skill that takes time to perfect.

Summarising

Summarising involves condensing a large amount of text, or an author's work as a whole, into a
few sentences. This is often an entire book, book chapter, or journal article. An in-text citation is still
required for summaries, but a page number is not, unless you can identify a specific page or passage
that the idea has come from.

       Note about in-text citations
       In-text citations can be formatted differently depending on the referencing style. For example, APA is
       an author-date style, which means that the in-text citation includes the author and date of publication
       within the body of the text. In numbered styles, such as Vancouver, the in-text citation consists of a
       number (either in brackets or superscript), which corresponds with the same number in the reference
       list.

Reference lists and bibliographies

In addition to in-text citations, you must also provide an accurate list of references for everything you
use to prepare your assessment or write your manuscript. A reference provides the reader with all the
information needed to accurately identify the original source of the authors you have cited in-text.

Did you know that reference lists and bibliographies are different?

Reference lists are lists of sources you have cited within a piece of writing and are a requirement of
correct referencing. Bibliographies will also list these sources but, in addition, will include details of any
other information sources you may have read or consulted during the research process, but haven't
cited. Always check with your Unit Coordinator or supervisor if you aren't sure what is required.

7.3 Copyright and using information

In this section, you will be introduced to the fundamentals of copyright and how it applies when using
copyrighted materials in your thesis and other research outputs.

What is copyright?

Copyright is a form of Intellectual Property and is the automatic legal protection given to all origi-
nal work that we create in a material form. In Australia, copyright law is governed by the Copyright Act
1968 (Cth).
Copyright protects materials, such as literary, artistic, dramatic and musical works as well as film, tele­
vision, sound recordings and broadcasts. Works can include books, conference papers, web pages,
computer programs, journal articles, play-scripts, artworks (including book jackets and album covers),
videos, and music recordings.
Copyright does not apply to ideas or concepts, methods, styles, or techniques. So,it is the protection
given to theexpressionof an idea, not the ideas themselves.
In Australia, you do not have to apply or register to be recognised as a copyright owner of your own
work. There is no requirement to put a copyright notice on your work, nor is there a need to formally
publish the work for copyright to apply. A copyright owner has an exclusive right to copy or reproduce
the work and (if applicable) to perform it publicly. A copyright owner can sell rights to, or prevent others
from, reproducing or performing their work. As a general rule, you cannot reproduce (copy) anything
for publication, entertainment or sharing purposes, unless you have the copyright owner's permission.
This includes any images or text you may find on the internet. Just because something is `freely avail­
able' it doesn't mean it is free from copyright.

Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property and copyright

Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property (ICIP) refers to the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander peoples over all aspects of their heritage and culture. This encompasses cultural practices, tra-
ditional knowledge, and resources and knowledge systems developed by Indigenous people as part
of their Indigenous identity (Terry Janke and Company, 2018). Unlike Australian copyright law, which
protects individual creators and works fixed in material form, ICIP ownership can be communal, inter-
generational, and governed by customary law. Many forms of cultural expression or knowledge that
constitute ICIP may not exist in a material form due to existing as oral or performance-based traditions
(Terry Janke and Company, 2018). Copyright may protect the expression of ICIP, but does not protect
the underlying ideas, stories and knowledge behind the work. As such, copyright law and other intel-
lectual property rights are limited in their ability to recognise and protect ICIP.
Researchers must go beyond legal compliance and engage ethically with ICIP. This includes seeking
free, prior, and informed consent from Traditional Custodians, respecting cultural protocols, and ensur-
ing appropriate attribution and benefit-sharing. ICIP rights do not expire and may include knowledge
that is sacred or restricted. Responsible research practice means embedding ICIP principles through-
out the project lifecycle and prioritising Indigenous self-determination and cultural safety.
Many organisations, including universities, across Australia have developed ICIP protocols to provide
guidance on how to respectfully engage with Indigenous Australians and their ICIP.

Copyright and your thesis

Under the `fair dealing' exceptions within the Commonwealth Copyright Act 1968 (Cth), individuals are
allowed to reproduce limited portions of copyright materials for the purpose of criticism, review, study,

                                                                                                                                  7.3 Copyright and using information | 139
research, parody, or satire without permission. Fair dealing for research or study covers the use of copy-
right materials in the writing and submission of your thesis for examination purposes.
After your thesis has been examined and approved, a digital copy will be made publicly available online
via your institutional repository (e.g. QUT ePrints). At this stage you will need to consider obtaining
copyright permission from the rights holder for the inclusion of any third-party works (e.g. images, fig-
ures, tables) in your thesis.
Check your university's copyright policies and guidance for more information.

     QUT only

     More copyright information for QUT HDR students is available on the HiQ website.

Publishing agreements and copyright

Authors often sign publishing agreements that may involve transferring copyright to the publisher.
Authors should take the time to read and understand the implications of these agreements and con-
sider what rights are retained.
Open access publishing offers authors the opportunity to retain their copyright, while allowing others
to access and reuse their work in line with the terms of the Creative Commons licence applied. Funding
bodies such as the Australian Research Council (ARC) and National Health and Medical Research Coun-
cil (NHMRC) also require open access to funded research outputs, which may influence the publishing
decisions of researchers.
See Module 9 for more information about publishing your research.

Copyright and research data

Data can present unique copyright and licensing challenges to researchers and organisations and
must be considered at the planning stage of the data lifecycle. Copyright and licensing considerations
are particularly relevant when reusing existing data and publishing and sharing your research data.
See Module 8 for more information about managing research data.

DATA

PHILIPPA FRAME, MARVIN VAN PROOIJEN

Module learning objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:
 1. Understand your obligations as a researcher to manage research data ethically and responsibly.
 2. Better understand the various factors to consider when managing research data effectively
      throughout a research project.
 3. Understand the importance of research data management planning and begin to plan how you
      will organise, store, and manage your research data.

Learning plan

In this module, we will:
  · Broadly define research data and identify relevant types of research data.
  · Outline the major aspects relevant to managing your research data effectively and responsibly.
  · Identify what is required of a data management plan (DMP).

This module includes content adapted from the chapter, Managing research data in QUT's 23 Schol­
arly Communication Things, CC BY-SA 4.0.

8.1 What is research data?

Most research organisations will have their own research data management policy informed by
national policies, laws and codes, including the Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of
Research 2018, which may include their own definition of research data.
At QUT, research data is considered in a broad sense as all the things that a researcher might use to
provide evidence for their research. The QUT Management of Research Data and Primary Materials Pol-
icy defines research data as:

       "...data in the form of facts, observations, images, computer program results, recordings, mea­
       surements or experiences on which an argument, theory, test or hypothesis, or other research
       output is based. It relates to data generated, collected, or used, during research projects, and in
       some cases may include the research output itself. Data may be numerical, descriptive, visual
       or tactile. It may be raw, cleaned or processed, and may be held in any format or media."

                                                                                                                                                                    QUT, 2024, sect. 10.

Research data may be any combination of the above, depending on the nature of your field of research
and the stage of your research project. As you work through this module, consider the various types of
research data with which you may come to be working with.

  · data created in a digital form (`born digital')
  · data converted to a digital form (digitised)
  · primary materials or physical items.

                      that this is a brainstorming activity and the actual type of data that you work with will evolve as
                      you start to plan your research project.

148 | 8.1 What is research data?
8.2 What is research data
management?

Research data must be properly managed because the data, and the primary materials from which
they are derived, are valued assets and outputs for researchers as well as the institutions with which
they are affiliated.
Research data management is all of the activities involved in storing, protecting, organising, and docu­
menting your research data, a valuable asset both to yourself and to your organisation. Well managed
research data can enable:

  · verification of findings
  · reproducibility and transparency
  · protection against loss of research data
  · protection of sensitive or confidential information
  · data reuse (for yourself and others)
  · compliance with the Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research 2018 and institu­

      tional policies, procedures, and codes of conduct
  · statutory retention, funding body and publisher policy compliance.
Other benefits of managing your data include:
  · Increased research efficiency, saving time and resources.
  · Facilitating future research by allowing others to build on or add to your research data.
  · Increased citations of research data and of publications based on that data.
Planning for how data will be managed throughout a research project ensures these benefits are
realised. Data management planning usually follows a research data lifecycle approach.

                                                                                                                          8.2 What is research data management? | 149
8.3 Your research data responsibilities

Most research institutions or organisations will have a research data management policy. It will apply
to the management of all research data created by researchers associated or affiliated with the insti-
tution, including by postgraduate students engaged in research activities. Researchers are responsible
for appropriately managing research data and primary materials throughout the research data lifecy-
cle, by addressing issues of confidentiality, security, ownership, storage, recordkeeping, retention, and
re-use. Each of these aspects should be included in your Data Management Plan where relevant.

Confidentiality

A dataset may contain confidential or classified information that should not be released to the public.
If this is the case, you have a responsibility to guard against unauthorised access by using physical
locks or digital encryption/password controls. Authorised access should be managed via the use of a
signed confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement. Non-disclosure agreements are also used to pre-
vent potentially patentable information from being leaked into the public domain.
For more information, see the ARDC Research Data Rights Management Guide.

Privacy

If your data includes personally identifying information, such as names and addresses, health infor-
mation about identifiable individuals, or information about the movements of identifiable individuals,
privacy restrictions will apply. Any personal information should be kept secure. Before collecting and
using personal information in your research, you should seek consent from the person to whom it
relates or use a process of de-identifying the data, so it no longer reveals their identity.
See the ARDC Research Data Rights Management Guide and the ARDC resources on identifiable
data and sensitive data for more information.

Contracts

When a funding body or industry partner externally funds research, there may be conditions attached
to the funding and/or obligations related to ownership, access, and dissemination. This information will
be recorded in a contract that will be signed by the Chief Investigator, but the obligations apply to all
researchers involved in the project.

Ownership of data

In general, the institution or university is the owner of any research data and primary materials gener-
ated in the conduct of research at the University. Research students can retain a copy of the research

150 | 8.3 Your research data responsibilities
data and primary materials for future use, subject to any contractual, statutory, ethical, or funding body
requirements (Management of research data and primary materials - Ownership and custodianship).

     QUT only
     QUT's Management of research data and primary materials policy states that:

            "researchers should apply the FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable)
            and CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance (collective benefit, authority to control,
            responsibility, ethics) to their data and primary materials, subject to any constraints or considera­
            tions related to the funding body, contractual, commercialisation, ethical, cultural, privacy or con­
            fidentiality requirements."

                                                                                                                                                                                   QUT, 2024, sect. 1.5.

8.4 Introducing the research data
lifecycle

Effective research relies on sound data management practices. It is important to plan how you will
manage your data from the beginning of your project and throughout the research data lifecycle.

               "The QUT research data lifecycle" by QUT (adapted from `The life cycle of research data' by ARDC, CC-BY 4.0.

The research data lifecycle signposts the different stages your data goes through, from the beginning
of the research project right through to publishing and reuse. It is important to note that data often has
a longer lifespan than the research project that creates them, such as a PhD or MPhil. For example, a
researcher might continue to work on aspects of their data after they've completed their thesis; follow-
up projects might arise in which they re-analyse their data or combine it with other data. Their data
might also be re-used by other researchers who pursue related research projects long after their thesis
has been accepted. Well organised, well documented, and properly preserved data is easy to access,
review, and share. As such, it is invaluable to the advancement of knowledge.
Having a good understanding of all phases of the lifecycle will help you to plan to manage your data
effectively. In the next sections of this module, you will learn about the different stages of the lifecycle.

8.4.1 Research data lifecycle: plan and
design

Researchers at Australian universities are required to collect, manage and retain their research data
and primary materials in accordance with relevant legislation and University policies, which are consis-
tent with the Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research 2018.
The Code strongly encourages the development of a Data Management Plan (DMP) as early as possible
(see the NHMRC's supporting guide on Management of Data and Information in Research)(PDF,
281KB).
To understand the value of DMPs, consider the following benefits:

                                                    "Benefits of data management" by CESSDA, CC BY-SA 4.0

Some key considerations in the planning stage include:
  · Consult relevant policies, procedures and legislation to ensure you understand your responsibili-
      ties and obligations as a researcher, including your responsibilities in relation to confidentially, pri-
      vacy, contracts, and ownership of data.

154 | 8.4.1 Research data lifecycle: plan and design
· Determine whether you will be collecting your own data or relying on a secondary dataset or a
   combination of both.

· Complete a DMP using the tools available at your research organisation.

                                                                                                                 8.4.1 Research data lifecycle: plan and design | 155
8.4.2 The Data Management Plan

A Data Management Plan (DMP) is a document that records information about how you are going to
manage your research data throughout your research project. It is a dynamic document that can be
added to and further developed as you progress in your research so if you are unable to provide all of
the information to begin with, do not despair. Use it as a springboard to investigate further and to dis-
cuss elements with your supervisor to ensure that all aspects of research data are well managed.

The information you put into a data management plan can be considered metadata (data about your
data). It should include details such as:

  · What is the research project about, and who will be working on it?
  · Will you be working with primary or secondary data? If the latter, what confidentiality, privacy, or

      contractual and licensing requirements need to be considered?
  · What ethics considerations and compliance with policies and legislation will apply to the data?
  · Who will own and have access to the data?
  · Where will you store the data and what level of security or protection will it require?
  · What support infrastructure, such as equipment and facilities, will you need?
  · How will you organise your data files and folders for ease of access and efficiency?
  · Will you be able to share your research data to enable further re-use?
  · How long will you need to retain your data and will it need to be preserved in particular formats?

Universities will provide tools, processes, and services to assist you with research data management
planning. Guidance is available to help researchers align their practice with the principles set out in
the Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research 2018 and in other international consen-
sus policies, such as the F.A.I.R. Data Principles and CARE principles.

     QUT only

     QUT's Data Management Planner
     QUT provides the Data Management Planner (DMP) to support data management planning and ensure
     that your research data and primary materials are managed effectively during the course of your research
     project. It also helps you to comply with your obligations as per the QUT Management of Research Data
     and Primary Materials Policy. It helps you plan, start conversations with your supervisor, and facilitates the
     creation of data management plans through QUT-specific advice, resources, and contacts.
     Stage 2/Research Proposal and your Data Management Plan
     As a researcher, you need to be confident about the data you are collecting, ensuring that you store it in a
     way that complies with the requirements of your project, confidentiality considerations, and potential
     access requirements. As part of your Stage 2/Research Proposal, you are required to indicate whether you
     have completed your Plan.

156 | 8.4.2 The Data Management Plan
8.4.3 Research data lifecycle: collect
and create

In this stage of the research data lifecycle, researchers must ensure that all research data is stored
securely and backed up regularly.

Data storage

Data storage solutions available to researchers will differ between institutions, who will most likely pro-
vide their own guidance on which of these they endorse and support. It is up to you to determine the
most appropriate solution for the type of data with which you are working.
Care should be taken when storing and sharing research data. Consider who you may need to share
data with, whether they are internal or external parties, and what level of security or protection is
required to ensure any privacy, sensitivity, confidentiality, contractual, or legal obligations are met.
As an example, here are the solutions available to QUT researchers. The table highlights some of the
considerations you need to think about when choosing where to store your research data.

                                                                                                                 8.4.3 Research data lifecycle: collect and create | 157

     Activity

     Consider the research data options presented above. Investigate which options available to you at your
     own institution. How are they similar or different?

Backing up

To protect against possible loss or damage to digital files, ensure that you back up your research data
files and folders regularly. One rule often applied is the 3-2-1 rule: Keep 3 copies of your data in 2 dif­
ferent locations, with 1 copy at an offsite location.

  · Master copy: Keep at secure location
  · Working copy: Keep on a reliable/safe device or locations
  · Back up copy: Keep off-site
Network drives may be accessible to a large number of people or can be configured for use by a single
user or group of users. In addition, personal cloud storage options or portable storage devices are not
recommended for the storage of master copies of research data.

     QUT only

     You can view an extended list of storage options under Store digital research data.
     At QUT, the Research Folder on the U Drive is recommended for the storage of master copies of
     research data. Contact HiQ for more information.

158 | 8.4.3 Research data lifecycle: collect and create
8.4.4 Secondary datasets

Before you begin your research project, consider whether secondary datasets are appropriate to
answer your research question.
Secondary data refers to existing data collected or created by someone else for a different purpose and
is reused for new research or analysis. Secondary datasets are sourced through indirect methods of
data collection.
With more research data being made openly available for further research and analysis through data
repositories and archives, there is a real possibility that useful datasets may be available to either fully
or partially answer your research question. This could save you time and effort rather than collecting
your own data.
There are different approaches possible:

 1. Secondary analysis will rely on data that has been collected or produced by another researcher to
      answer a different research question.

 2. Alternatively, you might use secondary data but engage in ancillary study, to add one or more
      additional measurements, for example, adding a questionnaire to an existing dataset or study.

     Secondary datasets case study
     QUT researchers, Kaveh Deilami, Md. Kamruzzaman, and John Hayes used secondary datasets from
     NASA's Landsat program to test causal relationships between land cover/use and surface urban heat
     islands. Why use Landsat?
     "... Landsat images are freely available for download, and their extended temporal coverage enabled the
     researchers to obtain datasets meeting some specific criteria", including five-year differences. To obtain
     images with similar air temperatures, data from Archerfield airport weather station was used to identify
     relevant dates for searching in Landsat. In addition, Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) socio-demo-
     graphic datasets, IKONOS images and Google Earth images were used in the research.
     Refer to:

When sourcing secondary datasets, there are many options, including government websites such as
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data, discipline-based data repositories, or institutional reposito-
ries such as QUT Research Data Finder, for datasets published by QUT HDR students and researchers.

                                                                                                                                                  8.4.4 Secondary datasets | 159

        2. Consider the datasets and repositories available to you through your own institution or in the QUT
             guide for datasets in social science or the QUT guide for datasets in health and STEM.

        3. Identify one or two that you can investigate for your own project.
     You can ask your supervisor(s) for relevant repositories or archives that are prominent in your discipline/
     subject area.

160 | 8.4.4 Secondary datasets
8.4.5 Research data lifecycle: process
and analyse

Research students and staff may have access to a number of resources to process and analyse research
data, as well as access to research infrastructure including:

  · advanced computing and storage facilities, including supercomputing (including for high perfor-
      mance computation), virtual workstations, and cloud computing

  · support for tracking, collecting, and analysing dynamic digital data
  · a range of allied facilities off-campus
You may also need to undertake additional training at your own institution, or through an external
training provider to upskill in using data and digital tools and techniques. This may be free or fee-for-
service. For example, training offered by the Queensland Cyber Infrastructure Foundation (QCIF) is free
to participating Queensland universities (QUT research staff and HDR students can access QCIF ser-
vices for free). Other free and paid training that may be suitable is listed by Digital Research Skills Aus-
tralasia (DReSA).
It is recommended that working data (the copy of your master data that you are using for analysis) is
stored for processing and analysis in a separate location from the master copy. This could be another
folder on the same drive or a cloud storage solution e.g. QUT OneDrive.

                                                                                                              8.4.5 Research data lifecycle: process and analyse | 161
8.4.6 Research data lifecycle: publish

Further into your research journey, you may consider publishing your data. This may be:

  · a portion of your raw data shared to further research in your field
  · an aggregated dataset that underpins a publication you have written
  · a dataset published to meet funder requirements.

Publishing your data and citing its location in published works allows others to replicate, validate,
and ensure accuracy of results. It increases the impact of your research as well as your visibility as a
researcher.

Some research data would be impossible to collect again (e.g. recordings of a specific seismic event).
Sharing data improves the scientific record and increases scientific integrity. The Australian Code for
the Responsible Conduct of Research 2018 advises that researchers should share their data wherever
possible.

To support best practice in publishing data, many institutions have adopted the F.A.I.R data principles
to make research data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable. The benefits of sharing data
publicly include:

  · increase scientific integrity (replicate, validate and correct results)
  · satisfy funding bodies/publisher requirements
  · preservation for future use (reduce duplication efforts)
  · increase impact and engagement (increased citation rates of up to 69%)
  · defend validity (also new research methodologies)
  · support applications for promotion, tenure and grants
  · facilitate collaboration and networking with industry partners.

Care should be exercised when sharing data that is sensitive, confidential, or subject to privacy legisla-
tion. It may be possible to share such data through mediated access arrangements, however, relevant
legislation and the conditions of any commercial agreements and ethics approvals must be adhered
to. For more information, see the ARDC's Publishing Sensitive Data Guide.

Repositories

Consider sharing your completed datasets or subset with other researchers, publishers, and the public
via a research data repository. Research data repositories may be general, discipline specific, or insti-
tutionally based. A data repository stores data along with metadata, whereas a data registry acts as a
catalogue or index of research data and only stores metadata.

Some general repositories are specifically designed for the publishing of datasets to accompany jour-
nals that have data policies (such as the PLOS data policy). These repositories make the data underly-
ing scholarly publications F.A.I.R, and include:

  · figshare - A repository where users can make all of their research outputs available in a citable,

162 | 8.4.6 Research data lifecycle: publish
      shareable, and discoverable manner.
  · Dryad - An international disciplinary repository of open data underlying scientific and medical

      publications.

Examples of discipline-specific databases include:

  · DataONE
  · GenBank
  · PANGAEA
  · Scientific Data (Nature's data journal)
  · Australian Data Archive (social sciences)
  · TERN (terrestrial ecosystem data)

Source code:

  · Github
  · Git
  · BitBucket
  · SourceForge

     Activity
     Working with research data repositories

         1. Identify two repositories that are relevant to your area of research.
        2. Identify one dataset within one of these repositories. Select one that is of interest and relevant to

             your research.

164 | 8.4.6 Research data lifecycle: publish
8.4.7 Research data lifecycle: preserve

Data preservation refers to the processes of curating your research data and metadata, converting it to
appropriate formats or media, storing it in a safe and supported archive, and creating documentation
to ensure that your research data is well protected and also available for re-use in the future. See Curtin
University's Preservation tips.

Research data retention

You are obligated to retain research data and research records for as long as required by legislation,
statutory requirements, funding agency guidelines, and contractual arrangements with research part-
ners. It may seem a long way off but being aware of how long to retain your data beyond your research
project, or whether you may need to dispose of certain data due to legal, confidentiality, or privacy rea-
sons, can help you to plan other aspects of your project, such as collecting consent and managing con-
tractual obligations. This should be documented early in your DMP.
Data retention periods vary depending on the kind of data involved, its significance to the research
discipline and the public, and whether it may be of interest to future researchers for re-use. Retention
periods are defined in section 2.1 of the Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research 2018.
In Queensland, the Queensland State Archives University Sector Retention and Disposal Schedule
specifies the statutory retention periods for research data (see section 601.2/A50). It is recommended
that researchers in other Australian states or international locations, consult their own relevant data
retention and disposal authority for statutory retention periods.

     Activity

     Identifying your data retention responsibilities.
         1. Find and read your institution's data retention policy.
        2. Identify how your current and future research data relates to the policy.
        3. Confirm your understanding with your supervisor and/or other research support services at your
             institution.

                                                                                                                               8.4.7 Research data lifecycle: preserve | 165
8.4.8 Organising and documenting
your research data

Data formats

When planning to store your research data, consider what data formats will be used. The choice of for-
mat will determine how the data may be used, analysed, backed up, stored, and retained for reuse in
the future.

     Read

     See the UK Data Service page on File formats for further information on what to consider when choosing
     a file format.

Towards the end of your project you will need to think about the preservation of your research data in
its various forms. You may need to transpose your data into more durable formats, or standard inter-
changeable formats that most software is capable of interpreting. Even though it may seem a long way
off, consider some of the recommended file formats for long-term preservation, listed by the UK Data
Service.

     Activity

     Identifying the formats of your research data
         1. Brainstorm and list the data formats you think you might be working with, as well as any software
             you plan to use and the formatting and access requirements it relies on.
        2. Add this list to your DMP. This list will likely develop over time so update the details in your plan as
             needed throughout your project.

166 | 8.4.8 Organising and documenting your research data
Organising your research data

Wherever you store your research data, well organised and clearly described research data will make
your data more findable and will benefit you in the long term as you will save time and effort.

Activity

Organising your research data
Keeping your research data well-organised is essential for efficiency and collaboration. Here's how you can
start:

    1. Discuss with your supervisor. Talk to your research supervisor about recommended practices for
        organising files and folders. They can guide you on what works best for your discipline and project.

   2. Explore institutional guidelines. Check if your university or research organisation provides templates
        or standards for data organisation. These resources often include folder structures and naming con-
        ventions tailored to your field.

   3. Create a system that works for you. Based on these discussions and resources, design a folder and
        file structure that suits your project. Make sure names are clear and meaningful so you can easily
        find and share your data.

Describing your research data

As you begin to collect and capture your research data, and through all stages of the research data life-
cycle, documenting your research data and creating metadata (data about the data) will enable you
and others to find, access, interpret, validate, and reuse the data. Documentation should provide con-
textual information for the data so that it can be understood in the future - a gift to your future self and
others.
Document your methods of data processing and analysis and capture metadata along the way
throughout the project. Do not leave it to the end of the project to do this as the finer details of what
you've done at each step will be forgotten.
A simple way to capture metadata during the working phase of your research is to create a readme.txt
type file. This is a collection of simple metadata that describes the details of the datasets and improves
the long-term usability of the data. Save the readme.txt file with the data files in the same folder within
your research storage.

8.4.9 Research data lifecycle: access
and reuse

Copyright

Whether copyright exists in research data is often a grey area. In most circumstances, raw data will not
attract copyright because there is no "recognised human authorship and originality" involved (ARDC,
2019, p. 2). Once data is manipulated with intellectual input, copyright may apply.
Compilations of data are protected by copyright law as `literary works', provided the compilation
involved intellectual effort, was not copied from another source, and supplies `intelligible information'
(i.e. is human/machine readable).

             "So, does copyright subsist in your data?" from Research Data Rights Management Guide by ARDC, CC BY 4.0.

In Australia, it is usually the case that copyright protection will arise once the threshold tests of original-

                                                                                                                  8.4.9 Research data lifecycle: access and reuse | 169
ity, authorship, and creativity are met. For research data, the thresholds are most often reached when
intellectual activity is directed at expressing the data, as opposed to collecting, creating, or inputting
the data. As it is sometimes difficult to determine whether copyright subsists in a dataset, it is recom-
mended that you apply a copyright licence.

     Creative Commons licensing case study
     QUT post-doctoral researcher Christopher Noune has assigned a CC-BY-ND licence to his dataset, which
     means that others may use, copy and redistribute his work, even for commercial purposes, so long as they
     give appropriate credit. If they remix, transform or build upon the work, they may not distribute the modi-
     fied material without seeking permission from Christopher.
     See the datasets: HaSNPV-AC53 Genotyping and Abundance Datasets.

     QUT only

     At QUT, students retain the copyright ownership of their data unless assigned otherwise, and for staff,
     unless assigned otherwise, QUT retains ownership of the copyright in their research data.

Licensing data

In the interests of open science, researchers are encouraged to make research datasets available via
open access or controlled access with research partners, collaborators, or requestors, for reuse by other
researchers. In some cases there may be specific and valid reasons for needing to restrict access of a
privacy, confidentiality, or legal nature. Applying a license can make the terms and conditions of re-use
clear.
If you decide to share your data when you have completed your research, you may use a Creative Com-
mons (CC) licence to specify the conditions that apply to reuse. When you apply a CC licence to your
data, you retain ownership of the data but specify how others can use the work on liberal terms.
Licences can be exclusive or non-exclusive. An exclusive licence means that only the recipient (licensee)
has the right to use the data in the manner covered by the licence - to the exclusion of the copyright
owner. A non-exclusive licence means that the recipient (licensee) has the right to use the data in the
manner covered by the licence - but not to the exclusion of the copyright owner who is free to use the

170 | 8.4.9 Research data lifecycle: access and reuse
data in the same manner and to grant non-exclusive licences to other licensees. Data owners generally
grant non-exclusive licences to repositories and other end-users of their data.
Some licences or agreements allow researchers to place their work in the public domain. When apply-
ing these to works, note that all rights and the protections offered by copyright, including the right to
be credited as the creator, will be waived. This may have an impact on data citation counts, for which
tool and standards are developing and which can be an important metric for research impact. If they
are required by an archive or repository to use a copyright waiver of public domain dedication, find out
whether any "community norms" statements can be applied. These will not be legally binding but can
signal researchers' wishes to potential re-users, where this is practical.
Some researchers create specialised software to analyse their data. They may wish to publish their soft-
ware and source code to allow their analyses to be reproduced by others. For more information, see the
ARDC's Research Software Rights Management Guide.

     QUT only

     QUT recommends a Creative Commons licence, which allows data owners to specify the limits that apply
     to the reuse of their work. The four licence elements - Attribution, Noncommercial, No Derivative Works,
     and Share Alike - can be combined to create the required licence.

FAIR data principles

The FAIR data principles describe how research data should be managed so they can be more Find-
able, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. They are designed to support knowledge discovery and
promote the sharing and reuse of research data.
FAIR data should be:

  · Findable: published in a repository with rich, descriptive metadata and a persistent identifier
      (DOI) and citation.

  · Accessible: able to be retrieved by both humans and machines using standardised protocols and
      procedures (e.g. authentication and authorisation) that clearly communication who can access
      the data and how.

  · Interoperable: stored and described in a manner that connects it to other systems and data
      assets including use of standard vocabularies/ontologies and formats.

  · Reusable: have clear license conditions for access and reuse, and thorough description relating to
      data provenance.

These principles encourage openness and re-use. FAIR data doesn't mean the data necessarily needs
to be open access. Rather, it should be as open as possible, and as closed as necessary. FAIR data

takes account of the type of data you might be working with and the obligations you might have as
a researcher to meet contractual, legal, ethical, cultural, or privacy requirements. This could include,
for example, keeping patient confidentiality, protecting endangered species by restricting knowledge
of where the data was collected, or considering the rights and interests of indigenous peoples over
research data about or involving them.

CARE principles

Complementing the FAIR principles, the CARE principles for indigenous data governance (GIDA)
acknowledge the rights and interests of indigenous populations over research data that involves them
or is about them, including historical content.
While the FAIR principles are about making it easier to share and reuse data, the CARE principles aim
to ensure that data is used ethically. It promotes the following aspects of research data management
of indigenous research data:

  · Collective benefits: Data ecosystems shall be designed and function in ways that enable Indige­
      nous peoples to derive benefit from the data.

  · Authority to control: Indigenous peoples' rights and interests in Indigenous data must be recog­
      nised and their authority to control such data be empowered.

  · Responsibility: Those working with Indigenous data have a responsibility to share how those data
      are used to support Indigenous peoples' self-determination and collective benefit.

  · Ethics: Indigenous peoples' rights and wellbeing should be the primary concern at all stages of
      the data lifecycle and across the data ecosystem.

Researchers should familiarise themselves with Indigenous Data Governance and Sovereignty prin-
ciples, guidelines, and frameworks, which outline Indigenous peoples' right to govern the collection,
ownership, and application of data about their communities, peoples, lands, and resources. See the
Lowitja Institute's `Indigenous Data Governance and Sovereignty' (PDF, 1.4MB), the Global Indigenous
Data Alliance's Overview of the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance and the Indigenous
Data Network for further information.

MODULE 9 PLANNING TO PUBLISH

PAULA CALLAN, SANDRA FRY, KATE HARBISON

Module learning objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:
 1. Recognise the main publication types and publishing models.
 2. Create a basic publishing plan.
 3. Select an appropriate journal for your paper.
4. Professionally communicate with publishers about your work.

Learning plan

In this module, we will:
  · Define different types of publications and publishing models.
  · Identify tools that can assist when choosing where to publish.
  · Explain how to identify and avoid deceptive publishers and journals.
  · Learn how to promote your research to a broad audience.

                                                                                                                                           Module 9 Planning to publish | 179
9.1 The basics of getting published

In this section, you will learn about the different forms of academic publishing and look at how they
may align with your overall publishing plan. We will also guide you through the process of choosing
the right journal for your article and introduce some useful tools to support you in making that choice.

9.2 Defining different publication
types and publishing models

Publication types

Publishing takes many forms, each exhibiting different characteristics and offering both opportunities
and challenges. Research is typically published in two main ways, scholarly literature and grey lit-
erature. However, the publishing landscape also includes options, such as social (or other) media,
including blogs and plain language summaries of your research. There are advantages and limitations
associated with each type, and all may have a role to play in your publishing plan.

Scholarly publishing

Scholarly literature includes:

  · peer-reviewed journal articles
  · published conference papers
  · chapters in edited books
  · research monographs (books).

While scholarly publishing typically reaches a more limited but targeted academic audience, it carries
significant weight, especially on a resume, because of the rigorous review process involved. Publishing
in this space often involves collaboration with other researchers, which can be a valuable learning expe-
rience. However, one drawback is that the time between submitting your work and seeing it published
can be quite long.

Grey literature

Grey literature includes:

  · material such as government or corporate reports

Like scholarly literature, grey literature tends to have a limited but targeted audience, and often reflects
current or emerging research. One of its key advantages is that authors usually have more control over
the publication process, and, while some review may occur, it is generally less formal. Grey literature
can still be a valuable addition to your resume. However, it does come with some limitations, for exam-
ple, it may be influenced by author or funder bias, it lacks the rigorous peer review of scholarly publica-
tions, and is not necessarily archived in a way that ensures long-term access.

                                                                                         9.2 Defining different publication types and publishing models | 181
Self-publishing

Self-publishing can include:

  · blogs
  · social media posts
  · digital news media stories
  · plain language summaries.

These formats offer the fastest publication process, with the author generally controlling when and
how the work is shared. This option is particularly useful for communicating research to a wide audi-
ence. However, many of these types of publications are not independently reviewed and may not carry
the same academic weight on your resume as scholarly works.

Publishing models

Traditional subscription publishing

In the subscription publishing model, academic libraries or individual readers must pay the publisher
for access to the articles in the journal. The fees cover the cost of publishing and, if the publisher is a
commercial enterprise, provide a profit.
Downsides of the subscription model:

  · the article may not be read, used, or cited as much as it would be if there were no barriers to
      access

  · authors are generally required to transfer their copyright to the publisher despite this often being
      the work product of their jobs as researchers in institutions

  · authors and/or their institution are not paid by the publisher for their work.

This model is generally unpopular with the institutions and funding bodies who have funded the
research as they want to maximise the potential impact of the research they have funded by allowing
as many people as possible to access it.

Open access publishing

When a paper is published under an open access publishing model, the published article is immedi-
ately accessible, free of charge, to anyone with access to the internet. These articles are generally pub-
lished under a Creative Commons Licence, which means they can be redistributed and re-used under
the terms of that licence, mostly ensuring the authors are attributed as the creators and the original
publication source is acknowledged. Often the unlock symbol in orange (see below) lets you know the
research is open access.

                          "Benefits of Open Access" by Kingsley, D. & Brown, S. , CAUL Open Research Toolkit, CC BY 4.0

Under the Article Processing Charges (APC) (Gold Open Access) model, where there are no paid sub-
scriptions, the publisher must find an alternative source of funding to cover the publication costs. Most
Open Access journals are funded by APCs, which may be covered by the author's institution. Authors
should consider this model carefully before proceeding and seek advice from library staff or scholarly
publishing specialists where available. Consider tools like `Think, Check, Submit` and quality criteria,
such as the DOAJ index of OA journals, which only includes journals aligning to best practice (read
more about this in Module 9.5 Identifying deceptive publishers, journals and conferences and Module
9.6 Tools for selecting journals).

Hybrid journals

Some subscription journals have a fee-based, open access publishing option. This means that some of
the articles in the journal will be open access while others will be behind the publisher paywall. Manag-
ing the billing and payments associated with APCs is challenging for both publishers and institutions.
This has led to a new type of contract between publishers and institutions - the institution pays the

                                                                                         9.2 Defining different publication types and publishing models | 183
publisher an annual fee that covers both `read access' and open access publishing fees. These are com-
monly called `Read and Publish' agreements. They bundle together access to the publisher's journals
(the read component) with open access publishing options for the university's researchers (the publish
component) free of any article processing charges.

9.3 Publishing plans

As a HDR student, being strategic about where you publish can help to build your academic reputation
and further your research career.
Your publishing goals are likely to evolve throughout your research project. In the initial stages, you
might seek feedback on your methodology. Later, you may aim to formally document your research
findings before anyone else (also referred to as establishing priority for a discovery), share your results
with a broader audience, or strengthen your reputation within your discipline. Being aware of these
changing objectives can help you make strategic publishing decisions at each stage and direct your
publishing plan.
Creating a publishing plan can help you stay organised, make informed choices, and ensure your work
reaches the right audience. As you prepare your plan, consider the following questions:

  · What are your publishing objectives?
  · What do you want to achieve by publishing?
  · Who is your target audience?
  · What are the relevant publication types or channels for your work?
A strong publishing plan includes a mix of formats, recognising that each has its own strengths and
limitations. In some fields, conference proceedings are standard, while in others, peer-reviewed journal
articles are the primary and preferred mode of scholarly communication. If timely dissemination is a
priority, considering preprints in your plan can help you share your findings quickly.
Your plan should also reflect your intended audience and communication goals. If you aim to reach
audiences beyond your peers, consider incorporating non-specialist platforms, such as The Conversa-
tion. Sharing plain language summaries of technical articles can further enhance the accessibility of
your work. Finally, collaborate with your co-authors to confirm that your chosen formats align with
shared goals and expectations.

                                                                                                                                                          9.3 Publishing plans | 185
9.4 Deciding where to publish

Deciding where to publish your research is a key part of your publishing plan. Scholarly journals are the
most common format for disseminating original research. Books and book chapters may be appro-
priate for in-depth work. In some fields, conferences are highly valued for communicating emerging
ideas and receiving early feedback. Preprints offer a way to share your findings quickly while awaiting
formal peer review and may also offer open access pathways, which can help maximise the visibility
and impact of your work.

Choosing a journal

Publishing in a scholarly journal is a common way to share original research with the academic com-
munity. Journals typically offer peer review, which strengthens the credibility and rigour of your work,
and many are indexed in major databases, increasing the visibility and potential for citations.
Consider these questions when choosing a journal for your article:

  · Do you and your colleagues read and cite this journal?
  · Do experts in your field publish in this journal?
  · Does the journal publish articles (similar subject and type) like yours?
  · Do your more experienced colleagues hold this journal in high esteem?
  · Can you find the journal in the major citation databases (Scopus or Web of Science), improving

      their discoverability?
  · Does the journal use identifiers (DOIs for articles, ORCiDs for authors) to ensure works are cor-

      rectly attributed and trackable?
  · Have you compared the journal's metrics with others in the same subject area?
  · If the journal is open access, have you confirmed it is listed in the Directory of Open Access Jour-

      nals (DOAJ) to ensure it is legitimate, ethical, and peer reviewed?
  · Have you checked if publishing fees apply? If yes, can you cover these fees?
  · If the journal is not open access, is open access publishing available under a Read and Publish

      Agreement?

Other factors may influence your decision to publish in a specific journal. Click on the arrows in the
accordion below to learn more about these factors.

186 | 9.4 Deciding where to publish
Books or book chapters

In some fields, such as the social sciences, publishing a book or book chapter can be more appropriate
than a journal article or other publication type. This option can capture broader audiences including
students, practitioners, and policy makers.

Consider these questions when choosing to turn your thesis into a book or publishing a book chapter:

  · Where will the book be published, online or print only?
  · For a print book, what is the distribution plan?
  · Will the book or chapters be indexed in Scopus or Web of Science or another index?
  · If a book chapter, who are the other authors and editors?
  · Will the university be able to purchase institutional copies of an ebook?

Conference papers

Presenting your paper at a conference in your discipline can be a great way to share your work and
meet other researchers in your field. Conferences provide opportunities for researchers to get involved
with discipline specific networks. Good quality conferences publish their proceedings giving authors
an opportunity to publish easily and quickly. These proceedings may be published as a book or a spe-
cial issue of a journal. Conference papers are a common publishing method in computer science and
engineering where new technologies and methodologies emerge very quickly in computer science
and engineering. Much of the scholarly publishing in these disciplines is via conference papers.

Consider these questions when planning to submit a paper to a conference:

  · Are the papers peer-reviewed?
  · Will papers be allocated a DOI to identify, locate, and track the output?
  · Are the papers or proceedings indexed by Scopus or Web of Science or, if in a niche field, indexed

      in discipline specific databases?
  · Has the conference been running for a long time?
  · Who are the organisers and who is on the editorial board/committee?
  · Are previous papers or proceedings being cited?

Preprints

Preprints are research papers that have not been subject to peer review and are added to online public
databases called preprint repositories. Often, they are published to get an idea or theory out into the
public view and have a crowd sourced review process. The author can receive feedback from other
researchers about their paper and make any changes which they think will improve the research. In
some cases, preprints are picked up by journals and published in the traditional way. Please check jour-
nal policies regarding preprints as some journals may not accept preprints for peer review.

There are a variety of preprint repositories you can consider, many of which are discipline specific.

                                                                                                                                          9.4 Deciding where to publish | 187
9.5 Identifying deceptive publishers,
journals and conferences

Deceptive (predatory) publishers and journals use misleading or even deceitful practices to encourage
you to submit to your manuscript. This includes making fraudulent statements about their editorial
board, their peer review process, impact factors, and/or indexing. As the peer review process is either
poor or non-existent, the articles published by these journals are often very low-quality and not indexed
by major databases. As a result, the articles can be difficult to find, receive very few readers, and are
rarely cited.
Be mindful of behaviours and activities that may indicate predatory practices. The following factors can
help you identify a deceptive journal:

  · Time frame between submission and publication is too short to allow for genuine peer review.
  · Journal contact details do not include a named Editor.
  · Journal is not indexed by reputable sources (e.g. Scopus or Web of Science).
  · Impact factor claims are not backed up by evidence.
  · Invitation to submit includes bizarre flattery.
  · Journal name or journal scope is very broad.
  · Top scholars in the discipline do not publish in it.

Increasingly, early career researchers are being targeted by deceptive book publishers offering to turn
their thesis into a book. They are also known vanity publishers because they appeal to researchers
who have recently finished their PhD and might have limited experience in publishing, or are eager to
get published. These publishers are mostly print-on-demand services, only printing books as they are
ordered.
Indicators of a deceptive publisher include:

  · unsolicited email telling you how great your research is
  · email requesting any payment at all for publishing your book
  · publisher is not a scholarly publishing company and doesn't offer usual scholarly publishing ser-

      vices such as editing and peer review
  · publisher does not provide information about print runs or where the books will be sold
  · no marketing or promotion plan for your work.

Researchers are often targeted by predatory conferences. These conferences may look legitimate
based on a professional website, but you should be prepared to dig quite deep to determine whether
they are credible. These conferences are hosted purely for profit, and it is likely you will be delivering
your paper to a group of other unsuspecting researchers in unrelated fields.
Ask questions and actively seek information, such as:

  · Can you contact the conference review committee directly?
  · Are there any familiar names on the conference editorial committee? If so, email them via their

      institutional email address to check they are still on the committee.
  · Are the conference proceedings peer reviewed & published?
  · Are the conference proceedings indexed with a reputable source?
  · Most legitimate conferences provide presenters with free attendance - if you are solicited to pre-

      sent, always check this.
  · Check how long the conference has been running.
  · See if you can find conference proceedings & citation data in Scopus or Web of Science.

Using tools to help select a journal for publishing your research can help streamline the decision-
making process by matching your manuscript to journals that align with your research topic and
scope. This can save you significant time and effort. Many of these tools also provide information
about specific journals, such as readership, citation impact, acceptance rates, and publication time-
lines. Incorporating these tools into your selection process might also help you avoid predatory journals

9.7 The publication process and peer
review

In this section, we will explain the stages involved in the peer review and publication process, so you
know what to expect. You will learn some more publishing tips as well as how to promote your article
to a broad audience.

Preparing to submit

Before submitting your manuscript to the selected journal, refer to the `guidelines for authors' to review
the specific formatting requirements, including word count and citation style. These requirements can
differ between publishers, so authors are advised to carefully follow the guidelines to ensure their work
meets publication standards. You will need to make sure your research aligns with the journal's mission
statement, editorial perspective, and audience. Check the open access arrangements of the journal as
many publishers now have Read and Publish Agreements that enable immediate open access with-
out a fee.

Professionally communicate with publishers about your work

After focusing on your academic work for so long, you now need to adapt your writing skills to profes-
sionally communicate your research to publishers. This correspondence will primarily be in the form of
cover letters to individual journals where you are seeking publication or writing abstracts for confer-
ence proceedings.

Cover letters

A cover letter is more than just a request for your research to be included in a journal; it is the first
opportunity you have to have impact on the editorial decision. A concise and well written cover letter
should highlight the importance and significance of your research.
Before you start writing your cover letter, it is vital to look at the journal website and review the scope,
aims, and audience of the journal. If your research doesn't fit these parameters, your paper will likely
be rejected immediately. These submissions not only waste your time, but they also waste the time of
very busy editors and journal managers.
It is important to follow the journal guidelines for authors - these have been written precisely to ensure
your content can fit the criteria of the journal and include things such as word count and citation for­
mat. These can vary significantly across publishers and authors are recommended to comply with the
sometimes very specific requirements in order to meet publication requirements.
Your cover letter should always include:

192 | 9.7 The publication process and peer review
  · editors name - check & double check
  · journal name
  · your article title
  · type of article, for example, review, case study, original research
  · date of submission
  · brief background of article
  · brief overview of methodology
  · brief description of your findings
  · brief explanation of why the paper is important and why it will be of interest to the journal's read-

      ers. Think about its significance to academia and the broader community
  · if your article is based on your thesis, you must mention it!

Things to avoid:

  · don't use jargon
  · don't embellish your findings
  · don't inflate the significance of your findings.

Abstracts

In addition to your cover letter, you will need to provide the abstract for your manuscript with your
cover letter. Your abstract should include the objectives of the research, the methodology used, and a
summary of the findings and conclusions. Some tips for preparing your abstract include:

  · Make your abstract compelling, it should entice readers to want to know more.
  · Follow the requirements of the journal or conference proceedings regarding length or style.
  · It should include these five elements:

         your research problem and why it matters
         research objectives - use terms such as investigate, test, analyse, and evaluate to describe

            what you set out to do
         methods used to do this and what you did
         summary of key results highlighting most important findings
         your answer to the problem and your conclusions.
  · The readers should finish with a clear understanding of the central point that your research has
      proved or argued. In essence, what your research set out to do, how you did it, and the conclu-
      sions you reached. This should be written independently from your research with fresh language
      and should be well structured and concise with a logical flow.
  · Don't include too much detail.

Submitting

When you are ready to submit, upload your manuscript via the instructions on the journal's webpage.
You will navigate through a workflow that includes confirming that your manuscript has only been
submitted to that journal and ethical clearance has been granted for your research (if required). You
must never submit a manuscript to more than one journal at the same time.

                                                                                                                      9.7 The publication process and peer review | 193
Waiting for a response

Once submitted, you will need to be patient as the approval process takes time. Editors read man-
uscripts to screen out unsuitable submissions and share submissions with peer reviewers, usually
researchers or practitioners in a similar field of research. Quality journals may go through a "double
blind" peer review, which means that the author's name or names does not appear on the paper going
to the reviewers and the names of the reviewers are not made known to the authors.
Reviewers are generally given between three weeks to three months to review a manuscript. Once all
reviews have been returned, editors make a final decision, consolidate the reviewers' feedback, and
respond to authors. If you have not heard from the editor after six months, it is reasonable to contact
the journal to enquire about the progress of your submission.

Responding to peer review and resubmitting

The peer review process is a valuable form of quality control. The process can be confronting and
uncomfortable when you first view the feedback but be assured that, while the process may identify
weaknesses in your writing, methodology, or argument, the aim is to improve your research output.
Many journals will respond with a "revise and resubmit" letter to their manuscript submissions.
Peer review is a great opportunity and, if you use the reviewers' comments to methodically and pro-
ductively revise your manuscript to incorporate suggested changes, there is a strong chance that your
updated manuscript will be accepted for publication.
It is recommended that you respond quickly and respectfully to the recommendations of editors and
reviewers. Where you disagree with comments or the advice of different reviewers appears to conflict,
indicate that you have considered each suggestion carefully and respectfully.
When resubmitting, include an extensive cover letter and ensure that you:

  · thank the editor and reviewers
  · identify the main points of revision
  · demonstrate how you have revised the manuscript to address concerns
  · explain areas not revised with substantial evidence to defend the original submission.

9.8 Social media and promoting your
research to a broader audience

If you want your research to be noticed, read, and cited, there are other approaches you can employ.
One of the most effective ways to engage an audience is storytelling. Consider writing a plain language
summary of your article covering what your research is about, what you did, what you found, and why
your research is important. You can then upload it to a site, such as KUDOS, or The Conversation, or you
can use it as a blogpost.

Social media

Social media is another valuable way to promote your research. You could mention your latest publi-
cation on a social media channel that is popular in your field to raise the profile of your work and your
own academic profile.
Use the social media channels that are popular within your discipline to tell people about your
research. Include a link to the article (a DOI is best as the attention you generate can be tracked by Alt-
metrics). If you haven't used social media for professional communication before, make sure you follow
the rules or guidelines of the site channels, chat groups, or applications you follow. Most will include a
request for respectful and constructive communication and will not tolerate unprofessional or critical
posts. Be an observer on the group and see how it runs, the kind of content it shares, and the tone of
the communications before posting.
As a researcher it is almost as important to stay in touch with the latest discipline related social media
as it is with the latest research. Research blogs and apps, such as LinkedIn and Bluesky, can keep you
updated with what other researchers in your discipline are doing.

     QUT only

200 | Module 10 Finding and using indicators of research impact
10.1 What is research impact?

This section introduces the concept of research impact - what it really means, why it matters, and how
it can be measured. Many people are familiar with the concept of impact within academia, which can
involve the use of indicators like publication metrics (citations, publication counts etc.) in addition to
qualitative indicators, such as peer review. It is important to distinguish publication metrics, and other
measures of impact within academia, from the concept of research impact. Understanding impact
goes beyond counting citations. It's about recognising the broader influence of research on knowl-
edge, policy, and practice. Research impact is sometimes called societal impact, in that it considers the
impact of academic research in the "real world", outside of academia.

Research impact

In its Research Impact Principles and Framework, the Australian Research Council defines impact as:

        "the contribution that research makes to the economy, society, environment or culture, beyond
       the contribution to academic research"

                                                                                                                                                                      ARC (n.d.), para. 7.

Measuring and showing evidence of the impact of academic research is becoming an everyday event
in institutions across Australia and the world.
Types of research impact include:

  · health impact - improvements in health outcomes and health systems
  · economic and societal impact - evidence that the research has been taken up and used by poli­

      cymakers, and practitioners, or has led to improvements in services or business.

Examples of research impact include:

  · policy decisions or changes to legislation, regulations or guidelines which have been informed by
      research evidence

  · costs of treatment of health care have changed as a result of research-led changes in practice
  · growth of small businesses in creative industries through the development of new products and

      services.

As a researcher, knowing how to find and interpret these indicators not only helps you showcase your
own work but also strengthens your ability to choose high quality, influential information sources for
your research.

Quantitative indicators

Publication metrics are quantitative measures, based on publication and citation data that are often
used within academia to assess the influence of research outputs. They can be used to analyse the

                                                                                                                                            10.1 What is research impact? | 201
published output of authors, institutions, and regions, as well as an indicator of journal quality. Publica-
tion metrics are often considered as part of research assessment exercises and university rankings, and
are often used by researchers in grant and promotion applications. Publication metrics can be calcu-
lated at the individual article level, author level, and journal level and some metrics are used to assess
multiple entities. For example, citations can be calculated at an article, author, and journal level.

Some examples include:

  · Article-level metrics, such as citations, provide an indication of the influence of an individual pub-
      lication.

  · Author-level metrics provide an indication of the influence of a researcher's output. They include
      the h-index, average citations per publication, field-weighted citation impact, and published out-
      put.

  · Journal-level metrics are an indicator of a journal's quality and include metrics, such as the Jour-
      nal Impact Factor and Scimago Journal Rank.

Bibliometrics are based on a researcher's published output; a researcher must have published several
publications to be able to measure the possible influence of that research.

Qualitative indicators

Qualitative indicators can provide valuable evidence of impact, both in academia and in the "real
world". They can provide greater context than numbers, explaining how and why academic research
has made a contribution outside of academia and what was the significance of this contribution. For
some non-traditional research outputs, such as creative works, expert assessments, such as reviews,
are the most appropriate method of assessment, while invitations to speak at conferences can demon-
strate a researchers esteem and standing within their field. Qualitative indicators can include:

  · peer review
  · letters of recommendation
  · invitations to speak
  · successfully acquitted research grants
  · book reviews
  · feedback from stakeholders and participants
  · evidence of implementation into practice.

Qualitative and quantitative indicators can be used together to provide a richer more holistic view
of the influence of academic research. The evidence you use, whether it is metrics or feedback from
stakeholders will depend upon your purpose and any associated guidelines, for example, assessment
criteria. You can find more examples of both quantitative and qualitative indicators of impact on the
London School of Economics and Political Science's How to measure impact page.

     arly Communication Things and complete the activities to check your understanding.
Indicators of research impact serve two key purposes:
  · to demonstrate the impact and reach of your own research
  · to assess the impact and reach of the research of others.
The latter is particularly useful when selecting credible sources for inclusion in your literature review or
research project. For strategies on evaluating the quality and relevance of information sources for your
research, see Module 6 Evaluating information for research.

                                                                                                                                           10.1 What is research impact? | 203
10.2 Different kinds of metrics

There are a variety of publication and citation metrics available. Some are proprietary, meaning they
can only be found in specific databases, such as the Journal Impact Factor, while others are found
across a variety of sources, such as citation counts. Some metrics have relatively simple calculations,
such as publication counts, while other metrics have more complex calculations, such as Field-
Weighted Citation Impact (FWCI).
This section will focus on a few of the more commonly used metrics, including publication and citation
counts, the h-index, journal metrics, and other field-normalised metrics.

A few simple guidelines and considerations for using metrics appropriately include:

  · Metric values will differ depending on the source. This can be due to a number of factors, includ-
      ing the size of the database and the depth of coverage in different disciplines.

  · Consider what is the appropriate metric or metrics for what you are assessing. Resources such as
      the Metrics Toolkit and the help functionality in the databases can assist you.

  · Where possible, use multiple metrics to provide more context. For example, when using FWCI to
      assess a publication, it can be useful to include the citation count as well.

  · Many metrics should not be compared across disciplines, or used to compare researchers at dif-
      ferent career stages.

  · Be aware there will be situations where publication metrics are not the best method of assess-
      ment and other indicators are more appropriate.

Examples of questions that can be answered by these types of metrics are:

  · What are the higher ranked journals in the field of engineering?
  · Who is citing my articles?
  · How many times have I been cited?
  · Which journal should I publish in?

Types of metrics

Publication counts

The publication count is the number of publications produced by an author.
A basic metric to measure author productivity is the publication count. The number will vary depend-
ing on the source database. It should be noted that a greater volume of output does not necessarily
correlate with greater influence, reach, or research quality. This metric should not be used to compare
authors across disciplines as publishing and citation behaviour vary across disciplines. It should also
not be used to compare authors at different career stages.

204 | 10.2 Different kinds of metrics
Citation counts

Citation counts indicate the usage and engagement with the cited work by other authors.
A citation means that a scholarly work has been cited in the text and reference list of a publication. The
`count' of citations differs according to the citation tool used because different databases have differ-
ent content coverage, including the number of publications and the years indexed. The citation count
has been used as a proxy for quality - with quality indicated by a high level of citations. However, this
is not always the case and citation counts alone as an indicator of influence/quality of an output are
unable to determine:

  · if the citations were viewed positively or negatively
  · the expertise of researchers from different disciplines.
In all disciplines, citations take time to accrue. However, some disciplines (e.g. chemistry and bio-
medical science) have faster peer-review and publication processes and, consequently, higher citation
rates than others (e.g. education, creative industries). Publishing norms and citation patterns can differ
between disciplines. Therefore, this metric should not be used to compare authors across disciplines
or at different career stages.

     Read

     The Lancet retracts Andrew Wakefield's article
     In his article, Steven Novella discusses an example of a highly cited paper that was determined to be sci­
     entifically flawed. The original paper incorrectly claimed that the combined measles, mumps and rubella
     vaccine caused autism in children. The article was later retracted and the lead researcher was investigated
     for unethical research practices.

The message here is not to use citations in isolation - it is just one part of the story.
Consider citation analysis when you want to find:

  · how often an output has been cited (times cited)
  · the total citations and average citation per article for an author
  · the average cited count for articles published in a specific journal
  · additional resources on your topic also called tracking citations; in addition to checking the refer-

      ence lists of papers you find useful, you can also check who has cited the paper.

                                                                                                                                           10.2 Different kinds of metrics | 205
h-index

The h-index is a simple, cumulative indicator of research performance and can be calculated using
citation tools, such as Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar Profile.
The h-index is a variation on the concept of times cited and attempts to measure both the productivity
(number of papers) and the citation impact of a researcher's publications. It provides a mechanism for
the work of individual researchers to be compared with others in the same discipline and at the same
career stage.
Example: If a researcher has an h-index of 4, this means that the researcher has four papers that have
each been cited four times or more.
Uses:

  · It is most appropriate for researchers who are established and have published extensively.
  · It measures "durable" performance, not only single peaks, and avoids skewing by one highly cited

      paper.
  · It is not limited to journal document types and can include conference papers and book chapters.

Limitations:

  · It is not a good indicator for early career researchers or researchers who have taken career breaks,
      as both their publication output and citation rates will be relatively low.

  · It is highly dependent on the length of a researcher's career, meaning only researchers with simi-
      lar years of service can be compared fairly.

  · It provides no indication of peaks and dips in publication performance.
  · It is a less appropriate measure of academic achievement for researchers in the humanities and

      social sciences.
  · It can be inflated by self-citations.

     Read

     The h-index has come under increased scrutiny in recent years.
     Halt the h-index, a blogpost by Sarah de Rijcke, Ludo Waltman and Thed van Leeuwen from Leiden Uni-
     versity's Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS), outlines the limitations of the h-index.

Field normalised citation metrics

Many publication metrics, such as the h-index, do not account for differences in citation and publi­
cation practises across fields. Field normalised citation metrics are designed to mitigate these dif­
ferences.

206 | 10.2 Different kinds of metrics
Metrics, such as Field-Weighted Citation Impact (FWCI) and Category Normalized Citation Impact
(CNCI) compare the number of citations received by a publication to the expected number of citations
for similar publications. Similar publications are usually the same age, publication type (article, review,
conference paper, book etc.), and subject category, but this can differ depending on the field-nor-
malised metric. The world average for these metrics is 1.00 - a number more than 1.00 indicates output
has been cited more than expected, according to the global average for similar publications, less than
1.00 indicates it has been cited less.
While these metrics all have a world average of 1.00, they use different publication data and calcula-
tions to reach this number, so cannot be used interchangeably. The FWCI or CNCI of an author, institu-
tion, or group of authors is based on the mean average of the FWCI or CNCI of their publications. This
means the that for entities with a small number of publications, the metric can be skewed by a few
highly cited publications. These metrics can also vary significantly for newer publications.
Field-normalised metrics can be useful when comparing publications or authors from different fields.

                                                                                                                                           10.2 Different kinds of metrics | 207
10.3 Journal ranking and tools

Journal ranking and metrics attempt to rank and estimate the importance and performance of a jour-
nal in a particular field.
There are a range of tools designed to rank, compare, and measure scholarly journals in a specific dis-
cipline. Journals are allocated to quartiles (Q1, Q2 etc.) based on where they rank by a journal-based
metric. For example, Scimago Journal Rank ranks journals by the metric Scimago Journal Rank and
Journal Citation Reports rank journals by the Journal Impact Factor and the Journal Citation Indicator.

Journal metrics

See below for links to and descriptions of some of these tools.

                    https://qut.pressbooks.pub/airs/?p=4105#h5p-90

Limitations of journal metrics:

  · Journal metrics are designed to assess the journal and are calculated using all (or a subset of) its
      publications for that period. They cannot assess the quality or account for the impact of individual
      articles in a journal.

  · Journal metrics are not designed to assess the contribution of an individual author.
  · In research areas, such as computer science and engineering, where the main form of scholarly

      communication is conference papers rather than journal articles, the journal measures may be
      less relevant.
  · The coverage of a database providing journal metrics may be unevenly distributed across subject
      areas, or not provide measures for some journals at all.
  · Journal metrics are available for only a small number of journals that publish in languages other
      than English.
  · Some journal metrics can be manipulated by self-citations, citation stacking (coordinated
      exchange of citations between authors or journals), and coerced citations, where editors pressure
      authors to cite certain publications.

10.4 Where can you find metrics?

There are a variety of tools, both free and subscription-based, to use for analyses or article, author, and
journal metrics. Citation indexes, such as Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar, track citations to
academic works, showing how often and where they are cited. It helps researchers assess the influence
and relevance of research, discover related studies, and identify influential works and trends within a
field.
Citation indexes facilitate literature reviews, impact assessments, and the discovery of related research.
By analysing citation patterns, scholars can gauge the significance of a research output, identify key
contributors, and explore trends within disciplines.
Commonly used citation indices are:

  · Scopus - an Elsevier product, requires a subscription
  · Web of Science - Clarivate product, requires a subscription
  · Google Scholar - freely available
Databases vary in:
  · the sources indexed (journals, publishers, conferences etc.)
  · the range in years of these sources (depth of coverage)
  · the citation analysis features available.
Research analytics tools, such as SciVal (based on Scopus data) and InCites (based on Web of Science
data), use the citation data collated in citation indexes to provide more in-depth analyses of published
research, generating a greater variety of more sophisticated metrics and insights than what is available
in a citation index. These products can analyse the output of researchers, groups of researchers, and
institutions and can assist in benchmarking activities. This section will not be focusing on these more
advanced tools, but if you would like to learn more, you can access the InCites training website or the
SciVal LibGuide.
In the next sections, you can explore in more detail how to use Scopus, Web of Science, and Google
Scholar as examples of citation indexes available to you to evaluate quality of publications.

10.4.1 Choosing a tool - Scopus

Scopus is a subscription database of peer-reviewed literature, including journals, books, and confer-
ence proceedings. In Scopus you can search for documents, authors, institutions, and journals and find
their associated metrics. Scopus features tools to track, analyse, and visualise research. Access to Sco-
pus will depend upon your institution's subscription.

As Scopus is a subscription product, you will need a login to access the database. The Scopus
LibGuide is a useful resource to get a better understanding of how to search Scopus.

Key facts about Scopus:

  · Coverage in life science, social science, physical sciences, and health sciences. Learn more about
      coverage on the Scopus Content page.

  · Interdisciplinary coverage. Generally better coverage than Web of Science for the disciplines of
      Arts and Humanities, Business, Education, Engineering, Health, IT (conferences), Social Sciences,
      and Law.

  · Updated daily.
  · It provides many metrics, including article citation counts, an author's h-index, and journal met-

      rics, such as CiteScore or Scimago Journal Rank.

To learn how to use Scopus, the Scopus tutorials are short videos or transcripts on the basics of using
this platform. Their Scopus Support Center has frequently asked questions, which go into more detail
on each area. For clarification of the metrics in Scopus, read their page on How are Article Metrics used
in Scopus?

Author profiles in Scopus are automatically generated using an algorithm, but can be managed by an
author, using the Author Feedback Wizard. Each author profile has a unique Scopus Author ID associ-
ated with it. You may have seen Scopus Author IDs listed on researchers' ORCiD profiles, or their staff
profile pages.

     Activity

     Use Scopus to find the following metrics.
         1. Article citation counts: do a title search using the article title, and to the right of the result, note
             the `Cited by' count.
        2. Author h-index: search for the author in the `Authors' tab. Click on the author name to view
             the h-index and more. If the author has multiple profiles, select all relevant results, and select `View
             Citation Overview'.
        3. Journal measure: in the list of results, click on the title of the journal. Note the Scimago Journal Rank
             (SJR) alternatively and search on the Journal title.

10.4.3 Choosing a tool - Google
Scholar

Google Scholar is free to access. Due to its breadth of coverage, citation numbers are generally higher
than in Scopus or Web of Science, however, results should be checked as they may pick up unrelated
citations. Google Scholar Metrics provides information on how to get started, the coverage of publica-
tions, and the inclusions and corrections (or how to make them). To get started with Google Scholar as
an author to track your citations, you can start with Google Scholar Profiles and use the other tabs for
citation related frequently asked questions.
Key facts about Google Scholar:

  · Google Scholar can help you find article citation counts.
  · You can use Google Scholar to track citations over time.
  · Minimal data curation, which means that non-scholarly works can be included.
  · Broad coverage, which can be useful for disciplines not well represented in subscription data-

      bases.

Google Scholar Citations

A Google Scholar Citations profile allows you to keep track of citations to your outputs, increases the
visibility of your work through making your profile public on Google Scholar, and provides others with
a mechanism to create alerts to follow your new articles and new citations to your work.
Searching for others in your field who may have a profile allows you to find potential collaborators and
research that may be of interest.
See an example Google Scholar Citations profile. Note that metrics are usually higher in Google
Scholar, as it indexes a broader range of content. There can also be issues with data quality in Google

10.5 Other indicators of use, value, or
engagement

For many disciplines, traditional citation-based metrics alone will not capture the influence or reach of
their research. This includes authors in disciplines that mainly publish books and book chapters, who
may find that their outputs are not always included in citation indexes, and researchers in fields that
primarily produce what are known as non-traditional research outputs (NTROs).

NTROs can include (but are not limited to):

  · research reports
  · code
  · software
  · datasets
  · creative works (e.g. exhibitions, performances, compositions)
  · architectural designs.

There will also be occasions where traditional citation metrics will not be the best form of evidence, for
example, when demonstrating research impact, such as changes to clinical practice or other impacts
outside of academia.

This section will introduce you to alternative metrics (altmetrics), explaining what they are, what they
indicate, and the databases you can use to find them. It will also cover finding other evidence, such as
library holdings.

Alternative metrics

Alternative metrics, commonly referred to as `altmetrics,' are article-level metrics that were developed
to complement traditional citation-based metrics by capturing the broader and more immediate
impact of research. They include attention in social and traditional media, usage in reference tools, and
citations in patents, policy, and other grey literature. Unlike citations, which take years to accrue and
reflect only academic influence, altmetrics track online engagement, such as social media mentions,
news coverage, policy documents, and blog posts. They can provides an indicator of how the public,
practitioners, and policymakers are engaging with academic research..

Altmetrics can also be a useful indicator for non-traditional research outputs, such as datasets and
software, and tracking downloads and other forms of engagement that can't be capture by traditional
metrics. These non-traditional metrics provide an additional or alternative way to measure attention to,
usage of, and engagement with a published work. It is important to remember that altmetrics com-
plement, rather than replace, traditional metrics.

Altmetrics may include:

  · number of article views
  · number of downloads in an institutional/preprint repository

                                                                                                            10.5 Other indicators of use, value, or engagement | 217
  · number of times an article has been added to an online reference manager (e.g. Mendeley)
  · number of Facebook posts
  · number of mentions in news sources
  · number of patents and patent citations
  · number of data citations
  · number of blog posts from individuals and organisations
  · number of mentions in policy documents.
Benefits of altmetrics include:
  · immediate response to output
  · evidence of interest and engagement with the public, broader society
  · interest outside of formal publishing
  · contextual information about attention via altmetric aggregators
  · improved visibility of your work and your research profile
  · evidence of engagement with your research outside of academia, particularly in the policy space
  · helpful to researchers with non-traditional research outputs, such as those in disciplines, such as

      Creative Industries
  · supports impact and engagement narratives, which is particularly helpful when applying for

      research grants.
Limitations of altmetrics include:

  · measures attention not quality
  · value of metrics generated varies and is dependent on the user groups, measures, and fields of

      research.

10.5.1 Choosing a tool - Altmetric
Explorer

While altmetrics can be gathered from many sources, there are specialist tools, such as Altmetric
Explorer, that aggregate this data from a variety of sources. Altmetric Explorer tracks attention to
research outputs from social media and traditional media, government and policy documents, post-
publication peer review, Wikipedia, clinical guidelines, and podcasts.
Key facts about Altmetric Explorer:

  · Only research outputs that have an identifier, such as a digital object identifier (DOI), PubMed ID
      (PMID), or ISSN, are tracked.

  · Altmetric Explorer pulls data from a wide variety of sources, including social media, traditional
      media, policy, and government organisation, patent offices, and reference managers.

  · Altmetric Explorer data for an article can be accessed for free via the Altmetric badge on a pub-
      lishers website, but a subscription is required for further analysis.

Altmetric Explorer cleans up and normalises the data from these sources then makes it available for
analysis. A key difference between Altmetric Explorer and other social media monitoring services is
that Altmetric Explorer will disambiguate links to outputs. It recognises that even though some social
media posts might link to a PubMed abstract, newspapers to the publisher's site, and blog posts to a
dx.doi.org link, they are all talking about the same paper.
You may have seen the Altmetric Explorer donut on article pages in QUT ePrints and publisher web-
sites. Each colour denotes attention from a different source.

                                "Colours of the donut" by Altmetric, part of the Digital Science portfolio © Altmetric.

The number in the middle of the donut is the Altmetric Attention Score, which is automatically cal-
culated, and is a weighted count of the amount of attention tracked for a research output. It is based

220 | 10.5.1 Choosing a tool - Altmetric Explorer
on three main factors: volume, sources and authors. For example, a mention in a newspaper article is
more heavily weighted than a mention in a blog post. You can learn more about the Altmetric donut
and Altmetric Attention Score. When looking at the Altmetric Attention Score of an output, the infor-
mation provided in the "Attention Score in Context" tab can help you to understand how this output
and its Score in comparison to other outputs in Altmetric Explorer.
While the Altmetric Attention Score may provide an indicator of the attention an output has received,
digging deeper into the sources of attention can be more useful, particularly when looking for evi-
dence of impact on policy, citations in clinical guidelines, or evidence of engagement with end-users.

10.5.2 Other sources of non-traditional
metrics

While tools like Altmetric Explorer offer valuable insights into research impact, a broader scope of non-
traditional metrics exists beyond these platform, providing additional sources of evidence and indica-
tors of reach and influence. The following examples are not exhaustive but offer additional sources you
may wish to explore.

Book holdings

The number of libraries that hold a book is a general indicator of value, proving there is a wide audience
for the publication.

WorldCat

Use WorldCat to find the number of international libraries that hold a book:
 1. In the `Advanced Search', perform an Author and Title search.
 2. In the results, click on the title of the book to open the entry.
 3. Scroll down, and under Find a copy in the Library'. Enter your location as `Australia' and click: `Find
      Libraries'.

The total count of the libraries displayed will now be found directly underneath the location entry box.

Trove

Use Trove to find the number of Australian libraries that hold a book:
 1. Select the `Books & Libraries' option from the `Advanced search' dropdown menu, enter the book
      title and the first author family name, and click `Search'.
 2. Click on the title of the book in the results.
 3. Find the number of libraries by clicking on `Borrow'.

Downloads and pageviews

The number of article views or downloads of a PDF version of an article can indicate interest or popu-
larity. Tools that provide download information might be databases, repositories, or a journal's website,
and include QUT ePrints and PLOS Journals.

Citations in patent literature

Patents are acknowledged as key indicators of innovation and technological progress. Citations to your
research within patent literature can provide evidence of impact. Tools such as The Lens offer patent
citation metrics, with additional sources including Web of Science, Google Patents, Altmetric Explorer,
and SciVal.
The Lens is a free, open-access platform that combines scholarly literature, patents, and biological
sequence data in one space. It is also a citation index, so you can also find citation counts, etc. for arti-
cles and authors. The Lens' strength lies in how it links patent literature to the cited publications, assist-
ing researchers to discover the links between academic research and innovation.

Citations in policy documents

Citations in policy documents and other grey literature are indicators of the influence of academic
research on the policies and decision making of government, non-government, and intergovernmen-
tal organisations. Databases, such as Altmetric Explorer and Overton, track and collate citations to pub-
lications in these documents.
Overton is a global database that tracks how research influences public policy. It collects policy doc­
uments from governments, international organisations, non-government organisations (NGOs), think
tanks, research institutes, and parliamentary bodies worldwide, focusing on materials like reports,
guidelines, and briefs that influence or inform public policy. It then links them to the academic work
they cite.

Citations in clinical guidelines

Citations in clinical guidelines can be an indicator that academic research is influencing clinical prac-
tice. Altmetric Explorer and Overton both index clinical guidelines and can assist in finding citations to
publications. Read more about how Altmetric tracks clinical guidelines.

10.6 Including metrics in your writing

Metrics can be used to support the statements you make in your writing, be that for publication or
for a grant application or a job application. Choose metrics that are appropriate and best support your
statements. When using metrics it is important to include the date they were accessed and the source.
It is a simple format that requires you to name the source and the date when the information was pub-
lished. This can be in the form of the year or the date with dd/mm/yyyy included.

        When you include any kind of metrics in your writing, it is essential that you provide the sources of those met­
                                                                                  rics.

Examples of including sources for identified metrics

For an author's h-index or number of citations for a journal article:

For example, the citation count for an article could be included as one of the following:

 1. "...the article by Naeem and Bhatti (2020) has been cited 214 times (Scopus, 17/07/2024). This indi-
      cates..."

 2. "Scopus (17/07/2024) shows that Naeem and Bhatti's (2020) article has been cited 214 times,
      demonstrating that..."

 3. "Brown has an h-index of 22, which compares favourably to other authors in her field (Scopus, 16/
      11/2025)."

For a journal ranking:

Journal rankings are released annually, usually mid-year. Due to the way the Journal Citation Reports
and Scimago Journal Rankings are calculated, the edition year will always be the year prior to when
they are released, e.g. Scimago Journal Rankings released in 2026 will be the 2025 Scimago Journal
Ranking.
The ranking of a journal in an edition of a journal ranking will not change, for example, if Journal A
is ranked Q1 in its subject category in Journal Citation Reports in 2023, that is its ranking in that edi-
tion. Its ranking may change in subsequent editions, but its 2023 ranking will not change, regardless of
when you access it. The exception to this rule is if you are accessing journal metrics via a database, such
as SciVal, for journal publications in the current year. As the journal ranking for the current year is not
available, the closest available year will be used. When the relevant journal ranking is released in the
following year, the journals ranking may change. In most cases, you will be using the current edition of

                                                                                                                                10.6 Including metrics in your writing | 227
the journal ranking to source metrics for a journal, but, in some instances, you may use earlier editions.
Always indicate the edition of the journal ranking you have used.
For example, the ranking for a journal could be included as one of the following:

 1. "The Health Information and Libraries Journal is a highly ranked journal in the Library and Infor-
      mation Sciences subject category, being ranked in the 1st quartile (2024 Scimago Journal Rank)."

 2. "The Health Information and Libraries Journal had a ranking Q1 for the Library and Information
      Sciences subject category at the time the article was published in 2020 (Scimago Journal Rank)."

You can use the principles in the examples above for including other kinds of metrics in your writing.

10.7 Responsible use of metrics in
research assessment

Bibliometrics are widely used in research assessment. This includes national research assessment exer-
cises, university rankings, and evaluations of individual researchers. Their use has prompted several ini-
tiatives that offer guidance on when metrics should be applied and how to use them appropriately.
These initiatives also suggest alternative ways to assess research.
These include:

  · The San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA), (2013)
  · The Leiden Manifesto, (2015)
  · The Metric Tide, (2015), and the follow up review Harnessing the Metric Tide, (2022)
  · The Hong Kong Principles, (2019).
The principles vary between the different statements, but there are common themes regarding trans-
parency around the use of metrics, an acknowledgement of the limitations of publication metrics, and
the importance of expert assessment. In 2024, DORA released further guidance about the use of quan-
titative metrics in research assessment, outlining five principles:
 1. Be clear.
 2. Be transparent.
 3. Be specific.
4. Be contextual.
 5. Be fair.
While these initiatives are primarily aimed at entities undertaking research assessment activities, it is
useful for all researchers to have an understanding of these frameworks, as they are leading to changes
in research assessment practices. For example, in Australia, the National Health and Medical Research
Council is a signatory of DORA and refers to its guidance on the use of journal metrics in grant guide­
lines, while in 2023, QUT signed DORA and released the QUT Public Statement on Research Assess-
ment (PDF, 86.1KB).

Resources to help you build your research skills training plan

Throughout this program, you have been introduced to the foundational information skills required to
complete your higher degree research. However, every research project is different as are the specific
tasks that will be completed and, therefore, the skills required to competently fulfil those tasks.
While you now know about the basics, you may have need to develop and apply more advanced skills.
Depending on where you are conducting your research, there may be a range of available training to
further support your skills' development. If this is not the case or some of your required training needs
cannot be met in-house, take the opportunity to look at other available training, open access or fee-
for-service. You can start by exploring the following options:

11.2 Building your research support
community

Building your research support community and meeting others who understand your research expe-
rience is an important part of your HDR student journey.
As you continue with research project or studies, you will benefit from identifying who is part of your
research support network and considering the roles each person plays. Ensure you are intentional
about connecting and continue to develop relationships with those key supporters, be they formal and
structured relationships, such as that with your research supervisor, or informal, such as those with
your peers. Define those relationships that are peer-based and those that are mentoring in nature and
give some thought to who you might seek out for different kinds of support. Be sure you understand
how they can support you and be proactive in identifying expectations around communications. Be
aware of the role you can take in supporting others in your research community as well.
Your research support community will continue to evolve during and after your studies. As you develop
skills and gain experience, your support needs may change. Take time to reflect on the makeup of your
community periodically and determine whether changes need to be made.

     QUT only

     There are a number of QUT HDR events, peer support services and groups available to you.

And don't forget to look after yourself!

The research experience can sometimes feel daunting or isolating. Don't hesitate to reach out to others
if you are feeling overwhelmed or just need to talk to someone. There are a number of support services
for HDR students to help you maintain your health and wellbeing or to manage any struggles you are
experiencing relating to your research or personal circumstances.

242 | Module 12 AIRS for supervisors
12.1 What is AIRS?

Advanced Information Research Skills (AIRS), is a research skills training program, primarily aimed at
higher degree research (HDR) students, that is, Doctorate and Master of Philosophy students in higher
education institutions. This module will cover everything you need to know about AIRS as a research
supervisor.
Marking its 36th year in 2025, AIRS is an accredited and mandatory coursework unit for all HDR stu-
dents at QUT. You can read more about the history of AIRS at the beginning of this resource. How-
ever, it is also openly available here to anyone who seeks to develop and expand their information skills
for research - current HDR students, early career researchers, highly experienced research supervisors,
library and information professionals, or library studies students.
AIRS seeks to set the standard in information literacy training for HDR students by providing current,
relevant, and credible learning outcomes, and enables active engagement through quality, innovative
learning and teaching strategies. There is a focus on ensuring AIRS meets the transdisciplinary and
transferable skill needs of contemporary researchers, while continuing to meet organisational priori-
ties, as well as industry and Australian higher education standards.
Some higher degree researchers commence their studies with an advanced understanding of these
important skills. They benefit from being adept at using systems and tools to make effective use of
the information environment. However, many are neither equipped nor aware of the gaps in their
knowledge and skills, or the impact that may have on their progress. To best meet higher degree
researcher needs, the AIRS program focuses on knowledge and skills development that is important
for the early stages of candidature, namely finding, organising, and using information, and embeds the
skills required to effectively scope the initial literature review for the research topic.
Offering AIRS at the commencement of the research degree builds researcher confidence as they
approach the first program milestone. This is evidenced by extensive data showing that most higher
degree researchers achieve strong outcomes in the unit. Research also indicates that information lit-
eracy training attendees are more likely to seek support in later stages of their research degree from
library staff, having developed those connections already. This can clearly have a flow on effect beyond
any training in which higher degree researchers participate (Zhao et al., 2023).

                                                                                                                                                             12.1 What is AIRS? | 243
12.2 What does AIRS content cover?

AIRS comprises of online modules, video recordings, learning activities, and knowledge checks that
step learners through information literacy development in a logical way. This aligns with the research
lifecycle and the journey that higher degree researchers are likely to take during their program. More
specifically, attention is focused on the development of essential skills for finding, evaluating, manag-
ing, and using information relevant to a research topic. This is supplemented by enhancing capabil-
ities in research integrity, research data management, scholarly publishing, publication metrics, and
research impact.
AIRS consists of 11 modules covering the following:

                           Module 1: Getting started with AIRS
                           Module 2: Preparing to search for information
                           Module 3 Finding information for research
                           Module 4: Maintaining current awareness
                           Module 5: Managing information for research
                           Module 6: Evaluating information for research
                           Module 7: Using information responsibly and ethically
                           Module 8: Managing research data
                           Module 9: Planning to publish
                           Module 10: Finding and using indicators of research impact
                           Module 11: Before you leave AIRS
Each module dives into depth to cover all the knowledge and skills that researchers need to success-
fully navigate their research project.

244 | 12.2 What does AIRS content cover?
12.3 Why should higher degree
research students use AIRS?

HDR students enter their research journey at different levels of readiness, knowledge, and skills. AIRS
introduces them to crucial research skills in the critical first months of candidature, ensuring all stu-
dents develop foundational skills to set them up for success. The supportive learning environment
nurtures a community of scholars and helps students develop their researcher identity. AIRS provides
training in advanced search techniques and information and data management. It fosters an environ-
ment that encourages academic honesty and ensures students understand research metrics and the
publication process.
By leveraging these tools and strategies, supervisors can successfully guide their higher degree
researchers to:

  · develop foundational skills for independent and effective information use
  · prepare for their first higher degree research milestone
  · understand and operate in the scholarly publishing environment
  · ensure they have the skills and capabilities to conduct research now and into the future, regard-

      less of the academic, professional, or industry context in which they find themselves
  · explore emerging digital tools, including AI technologies, through a responsible and ethical

      research lens to consider how such tools can support, but not replace, critical thinking and schol-
      arly rigour.
  · develop a robust support network by connecting with library staff, other research support experts,
      and peers where available.

How can students engage with AIRS?

  · Encourage your student to work through the modules with you.
  · Establish a collaborative group of students who support one another with assessments and learn-

      ing, and develop a community of practice.
  · Use the resources for refreshing your own information skills for research.
  · Connect with your library staff to explore further ways to support you and your students with

      AIRS.
  · Use the knowledge checks in each module to confirm learning.

                                                                                             12.3 Why should higher degree research students use AIRS? | 245
12.4 What can you do to prepare your
student for AIRS?

AIRS is designed to meet the needs of students at all levels of research experience and higher edu-
cation backgrounds. However, not all students will recognise or understand the value of developing
these skills. As a research supervisor, encourage your student to understand how advanced informa-
tion research skills can support their research studies and career pathways.

AIRS has shown us that higher degree researchers can develop a stronger skills foundation when
partnering with supervisors who actively engage in their progress and encourage them to cultivate
relationships with key research support staff. That support network will be different depending on indi­
vidual higher degree researchers, the supervisors, and the institution. Further, the development of a
community of learners engaging with information literacy training at the same time is of added bene­
fit, providing peer learning and support, transdisciplinary networking, and opportunities for collabora­
tion.

As such, developing and maintaining professional relationships with research support and library staff
is a way that you can model good networking and collaborative practices. Partnering with colleagues
and library staff can help you to introduce research skills training for higher degree researchers. You
will see longer term benefits from making time to introduce higher degree researchers to key stake­
holders and help them to build their personal learning networks.

As a supervisor, you are ideally positioned to explain the value of setting up systems, and using appro­
priate tools, for managing information to your higher degree researcher. By sharing personal stories
of successes and failures, you can demonstrate the importance of planning and preparing to find,
retrieve, evaluate, store, and use information. You can step your higher degree researcher through the
approaches you have developed and used for managing literature and other information. This may
include a range of analogue and/or digital systems and tools that enable you to effectively record and
access your information throughout a research project. There is no one right way in which to do this.
What works for one may not work for others. Higher degree researchers will find approaches that work
for them, but you can prompt consideration by providing examples of approaches that have worked
for you.

     QUT only

     Information about IFN006 is available for research supervisors on the QUT Digital Workplace.
     For some HDR students, the gap between being admitted to their research program and when they
     begin IFN006 AIRS may be some weeks. Ask your student which teaching period they are enrolled in and
     when they expect to commence. If there is a gap, point them to this AIRS program as a way to support
     them in getting started on developing the skills required to complete their early project tasks.
     HDR students can find out more about the requirements to complete IFN006 and other coursework in

246 | 12.4 What can you do to prepare your student for AIRS?
     their QUT offer and welcome letters, on the HiQ website, in the IFN006 unit outline, in their welcome
     email from the IFN006 Unit Coordinator, and on the IFN006 Canvas site.
If students are new to research or have had a significant break from research, they can prepare for AIRS
by doing the QUT Study Smart modules. These are openly accessible, self-paced online modules that
step through the basics of developing information research and literacy skills for success at university.

12.5 Why is AIRS beneficial to you as a
supervisor?

As a research supervisor, you play a pivotal role in ensuring your HDR students gain the full benefits of
the AIRS program.
By understanding the content throughout the modules, you can guide your students to apply the skills
they develop into their specific research projects and key steps, such as literature reviews or data man-
agement. You can support your students' information literacy, research integrity, and critical thinking
skills, all of which are crucial for long-term academic success.
A key benefit of supervising is what you can also learn from your higher degree researcher. As they
progress through their research journey, they will be exposed to the latest tools, practices, and services
that leverage emerging technologies. As a supervisor, you can access the AIRS units for your own pro-
fessional development. Working through the AIRS modules on an annual basis may be a useful prac-
tice.
An inclusive approach can ensure you gain access to the wealth of knowledge and experience available
from fellow supervisors and other research support experts. Knowledge-sharing between supervisors
and higher degree researchers can create pathways to further training options and support services
that can enhance the effective use of information for research. By using and adapting existing
resources and tools, you can positively contribute to shaping the information literacy of your higher
degree researchers, resulting in improved research outcomes.

     Activity

     In the next meeting with your HDR student, ask them:
         1. Which module most improved your search approach?
        2. Show me one documented search and tell me how you refined it.
        3. Which evaluation framework did you use last week?

12.5 Reflecting on your learning

This module has explored how research supervisors can engage with the AIRS program and support
their students to use it to develop their advanced information skills. To confirm your learning, take a
moment to reflect on the questions provided. Contact your Liaison Librarian if you have any questions
about AIRS.

     Reflect

     Consider:
         1. How can I, as a supervisor, proactively integrate AIRS into my ongoing supervisory practices to
             ensure my HDR students build strong foundational research skills early in their candidature? Con-
             sider how AIRS aligns with your existing support strategies and how it might supplement or
             enhance them.
        2. In what ways might my own assumptions about HDR students' readiness or information literacy
             influence how I encourage (or overlook) AIRS as a developmental tool? Reflect on your experiences
             with past students and whether you adjust expectations based on individual backgrounds.
        3. How confident am I in the areas covered by AIRS (e.g., research data management, scholarly pub-
             lishing, metrics), and how might I use AIRS resources to refresh and expand my own skills as a
             researcher and mentor? Think about your own continuous professional development in relation to
             these evolving topics.
        4. What practical steps can I take to create a culture of research integrity and information literacy
             within my research group or school, using AIRS as a foundation? This might include collaborative
             activities, peer-learning groups, or embedding AIRS milestones into research plans.

                                                                                                                                        12.5 Reflecting on your learning | 249

Glossary

Academic integrity

      Academic integrity refers to the ways in which you conduct your academic activities honestly,
      respectfully, fairly and responsibly.

AIRS

      Advanced Information Research Skills (AIRS) is the program that is delivered as a mandatory
      coursework unit that all QUT higher degree research students must complete upon commence-
      ment of their studies (IFN006). The AIRS learning resources are open and accessible to all through
      this AIRS open education resource (OER).

Altmetrics

      Altmetrics are article-level metrics based on metrics from the social web for analysing and inform-
      ing scholarship. For example, online mentions/attention, mentions in policy or government docu-
      ments, or citations in patents.

Annotated bibliography

      An annotated bibliography is a collection of records of an information source, that includes a cita-
      tion with notes. There are two parts to each annotated bibliography entry, the bibliographic infor-
      mation (the reference) and the explanatory paragraphs (the annotation). The explanatory parts can
      include descriptive and evaluative components.

Annotating

      This is where you underline, highlight, or mark important passages, key phrases, and unfamiliar
      words in a resource, or add notes to a text to summarise or questions specific sections. Annotating
      can be done on physical resources, such as a printed copy of a journal article, or on digital
      resources, such as marking up a digital copy of a journal article using tools such as PDF tools.

Artificial intelligence

      Artificial intelligence refers to technology that has been designed to perform tasks or simulate
      functions that traditionally only humans could do, such as decision-making, problem solving and
      learning,

Author alert

      A notification that is created and issued in a search engine, database or repository when a specific
      author or content creator publishes new work.

Bibliographic information

      Bibliographic information refers to the information you need to collect to create accurate refer-
      ences, such as author, date of publication, journal title, article title, book title, digital object iden-
      tifier (doi), URL, web page name, report number and more. The information required will depend

252 | Glossary
      on the resource type. The format or way in which the information is presented will depend on the
      referencing style used.
Bibliographic management software

      Also known as referencing management software,or referencing tools.
      Software tools that help you track and recall references to relevant literature. Examples include
      EndNote, Mendeley, Paperpile and Zotero.
Boolean operators

      Boolean operators are simple words (AND, OR, NOT) used as conjunctions to include or exclude
      keywords in a search.
Chunking

      A reading technique where you break the text into smaller sections and focus on understanding
      one section at a time.
Citation alert

      A notification that is created and issued when a specific journal article is cited in another publica-
      tion.
Cited reference searching

      The process of tracking research backwards and forwards in time. When viewing an article in a cita-
      tion database, the full citation will list references used by the author to write that paper. From this
      list you can link to any articles indexed in that database. If an article is not indexed in that database,
      it will not be linked.
      Also known as citation searching or snowballing
cite|write

      cite|write is QUT's guide to citing and referencing.
CNCI

      Category Normalized Citation Impact (CNCI) compares the number of citations for a publication
      with similar publications within a specific subject area over time.
Coding the literature

      Coding the literature involves categorising, organising, and extracting key information from the lit-
      erature to identify patterns, themes, and relationships.
Comprehensive searching

      A method of searching the literature systematically and comprehensively by formulating search
      statements using appropriate databases and advanced search techniques to create effective
      search strategies.

                                                                                                                                                                           Glossary | 253
Concept map

      Also known as mind map.
      A visual tool that puts the main topic in the centre of the map and graphically represents the major
      concepts that relate to the main topic. It can be useful for the activity of concept mapping when
      identifying key terms and synonyms in a research question. This activity can be done by hand or by
      using digital tools.
Controlled vocabulary

      A list or index that categorises and defines terms and phrases.
Copyright

      Copyright refers to the laws that define and protect the rights of a creator of a piece of written or
      recorded literary or artistic work, such as sound recording, film, art works or written text.
Critical thinking

      Critical thinking is a questioning process central to writing, reading and learning at university. Crit-
      ical thinking is a skill used to develop new knowledge or understanding about a subject.
Database

      A database is a regularly updated collection of online resources and may contain journal articles,
      ebooks, conference papers, maps, videos, and other electronic resources. Databases can be related
      to specific subject areas or cover multiple subjects. For example, Scopus is a multidisciplinary
      abstract and citation database of scholarly literature.
Descriptor (see Subject heading)
Document delivery

      Document delivery is a service provided by academic libraries that sources articles, conference
      papers, book chapters, books, theses, and other formats of documents that may not be available in
      full-text through existing digital platforms to library members. The name of this service may differ
      between libraries. At QUT Library, the service is Request From Other Institutions. More information
      for QUT students and staff is available on the QUT Library website.
Evaluating information

      Applying a defined criteria to review the information sources gathered based on quality, reliability,
      and relevance to your research. For more information refer to Module 6 Evaluating information for
      research.
Evaluating your search

      The process of reviewing the results of your searches to determine relevance and, where necessary,
      refining, or revising your search to improve the results returned. For more information refer to Mod­
      ule 3 Finding information for research.

254 | Glossary
Field searching

      Some databases allow searching in specific fields such as the title, author, abstract, or subject. This
      type of searching is quite specific and will retrieve fewer results than a keyword search. By using
      field searching, you can increase the precision of the search thereby retrieving fewer results. For
      more information refer to Module 3 Finding information for research.
Filters (see Limiters)
GenAI (See Generative Artificial Intelligence)
Generative artificial intelligence

      A subsection of artificial intelligence where systems using machine learning have been trained
      using large amounts of data to perform, mimic or imitate tasks and create text, images, videos and
      other forms of content. Users can use inputs called prompts to generate content, the nature of
      which is determined by the data on which a particular GenAI tool is trained.
      Also known as GenAI.
      More information about generative AI can be found in the QUT Library guides Using generative
      AI and Generative AI in Research and Teaching.
      https://architecture.digital.gov.au/generative-artificial-intelligence
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence
Google Scholar

      Google Scholar is a web tool by Google that indexes scholarly materials, theses and some types of
      grey literature. Google Scholar is best used in conjunction with discipline-specific databases and
      by adding the links to full-text access where provided by your library via the Google Scholar set-
      tings. See Module 2 Preparing to search for information.
Grey literature

      Grey literature is an umbrella term that describes materials produced on all levels of government,
      business and industry that are not distributed via commercial publishing methods. Grey literature
      may be useful for exploring areas where there is little published evidence, and for finding recent
      and local resources.
h-index

      The h-index is an indicator of research performance. It can be calculated using citation tools such
      as Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar profile, which track the number of papers published
      and the associated number of citations, to generate the author's h-index.
H5P

      Technology that enables users to share interactive HTML content.
Index term (See Subject heading)

                                                                                                                                                                           Glossary | 255
Intellectual property

      Intellectual property generated during your studies, research or work at QUT could be a creation,
      idea, or a name you give to something. Examples include (but are not limited to) patents, trade-
      marks, designs, copyright for original material, inventions, and confidential specialised information.
      For more information refer to Module 7 Using information responsibly and ethically.

iThenticate

      iThenticate is QUT's plagiarism detection software for higher degree research (HDR) candidates.
      All HDRs will automatically be provided with access to iThenticate after commencement of your
      research program. You will be required to submit your thesis through this software.

      See also Plagiarism.

Journal quartile rankings (see Quartiles)

Journal ranking and impact factor

      Journal ranking and journal impact factors are quantitative measures that attempt to rank and
      estimate the importance and performance of a journal in a particular field. For more information
      refer to Module 7.2.1 (Journal ranking and tools).

Keyword

      An important word or phrase that represents a concept in your research question. Some of these
      keywords may be the same or similar to the words identified for your research concepts in your
      question. Identifying keywords informs your searching as they are what you type into the search
      box of a database, library catalogue, or other search tool (as well as synonyms and/or related terms).
      They will appear somewhere (e.g. title, abstract, or author keywords) within the resources you find.

Keyword searching

      Most databases search keywords or terms anywhere by default unless you choose another type of
      search. The database looks for a match for your keyword in any field in the record. You can combine
      keyword searches with other techniques as part of a comprehensive search strategy.

Large language model

      A deep learning or machine learning model that works with big data sets to interrogate, sum-
      marise and generate content in natural language or human-like text.

      Also known as LLM.

      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model

Liaison Librarian

      A term used for a librarian who works in an academic or university library and who partners and
      works closely with a specific discipline, Faculty or School in that institution. They support acad-
      emics, researchers and students within those domains and develop discipline-specific expertise
      about collections, search tools, research and publishing.

      For QUT staff and HDR students, your QUT Liaison Librarian can connect you with the information

256 | Glossary
      and resources you need. To find the Liaison Librarian for your Faculty or School, search the QUT
      Library Liaison Librarians webpage.
Limiters

      Limiters are used in searching to narrow your search. They can also be called filters. This is often
      best done in the results screen of a database or other search tool to increase the relevancy of results
      after a comprehensive search. Examples include limiting by subject, date, format, full text, peer-
      review.

Literature review

      A literature review is an evaluative report of information found in the literature related to your
      selected area of study or research. The review should describe, summarise, evaluate, and clarify this
      literature. It should present a theoretical base for the research and help you (the author) determine
      the nature of your research.
LLM (See Large Language Model)
Medical subject headings

      A controlled vocabulary of medical terms, which functions as a thesaurus organised alphabetically
      by subject, with related sub-categories listed beneath the top-level heading.
      Also known as MeSH.
MeSH (See Medical subject headings)
Mind map (see Concept map)
Nesting

      Nesting is used in comprehensive searching to group synonyms together with the OR Boolean
      Operator. Synonyms are grouped within brackets/parentheses as a set, and this part of the search
      will be performed by the database first.
      For example, ("respiratory tract infection" OR bronchiolitis) and management finds articles about
      the management of either respiratory tract infections or bronchiolitis.
      See also Boolean operators.
Open access

      Open access is the free, immediate, online availability of peer reviewed research publications cou-
      pled with associated licensing rights that specify the use and reuse of these articles. Authors usu-
      ally retain the copyright of open access articles.
Open access journals

      Open access journals provide immediate open access to the full content of each issue. Most open
      access journals publish articles under a Creative Commons licence. Some open access journals
      charge fees (article processing charges) that must be paid by the author or the author's institution.

                                                                                                                                                                           Glossary | 257
Organising the literature

      For AIRS, organising the literature refers to how you manage your source material (e.g., literature
      or other resources) and notes. Organising information might include the notetaking software you
      use or a particular reference management tool to store your references and literature. The strate-
      gies you employ to organise the literature will be individual to you. For more information refer to
      Module 5 Managing information for research.

Paywall

      A paywall restricts access to specific content without a paid subscription or direct purchase.

Peer review

      Peer review is the strict approval process applied to scholarly journals with one or more experts
      reviewing the articles before they are accepted for publication. There are various forms of this
      process. If a research publication is given the status of peer reviewed, it has been through a form of
      this process before being published.

Phrase searching

      Phrase searching is a form of searching that requires a database or other search tool to look for
      two or more words in the exact order they are entered. Quotation marks "xyz" are usually used to
      identify and enclose a phrase. Some databases assume that a string of words will be searched as a
      phrase whereas others will search on each individual word.

Plagiarism

      Plagiarism is the presentation of another person's ideas or work as your own. It may also include
      resubmitting your own work for another assessment item.

      See also iThenticate.

Popular information

      Popular information is typically written by authors who are not necessarily experts in the field and
      are targeting a more general audience. For example, this could be in the form of a blog post or
      newspaper article. For more information refer to Module 2.5 Determining the types of information
      you need.

Preliminary searching

      Initial or preliminary searching helps to establish a basis for later specific or more comprehensive
      searching. Preliminary searching can help clarify the topic and supply basic knowledge upon
      which to develop an improved searching focus. For more information, refer to Module 2 Preparing
      to search for information.

Preprint

      A preprint is an early version of a research paper (known as the author accepted manuscript) made
      available via a preprint server or repository but not yet formally published in an academic journal.

258 | Glossary
Preview reading

      Preview reading is where you read headings, subheadings, and captions to get an overview of the
      content. You might also skim introductory and concluding paragraphs to understand the main
      ideas.

Proximity operator

      Proximity or adjacency operators allow you to locate one word within a determined distance from
      another.

      For example, 'kitten W3 cat' would find the word 'kitten' within three words of 'cat' in the order that
      you search for them. These operators often differ between databases. For more information refer
      to Module 3.2.1.

Publication metrics

      Publication or citation-based metrics are often described in terms of what can be counted. They
      include quantitative methods such as journal impact factors, and individual researchers' rankings,
      such as their h-index, and citation counts.

Quartiles

      Quartile rankings are derived for each journal in each of its subject categories, according to which
      quartile of the Impact Factor (IF) distribution the journal occupies for that subject category. These
      can also be called Journal quartile rankings.

      For example, Q1 comprises the quarter of the journals with the highest values (top 25%) whereas
      Q4 reflects the lowest values (bottom 25%).

Read and Publish Agreement

      Read and Publish (R&P) agreements bundle together access to the publisher's journals (the read
      component) with open access publishing options for the university's researchers (the publish com-
      ponent) free of any article processing charges.

      In Australia, R&P agreements generally involve multiple institutions and are negotiated nationally
      by CAUL. QUT has R&P agreements which cover specific journals from a number of major publish-
      ers.

Related term

      A related term (sometimes called an alternative term) is a different word or phrase that is con-
      nected to one or more of your keywords. They have a contextual but not interchangeable relation-
      ship to the keyword and cannot be used as a substitute for a keyword but in addition to it. They
      expand your search without replacing the original term and are useful because different authors
      may use different language to describe the same concept. They can help to find up useful, adja-
      cent literature.

Research concept

      A research concept is a main idea or core topic within your research question. You will usually have
      three or four research concepts, but you could have more or less. For information searching, these

                                                                                                                                                                           Glossary | 259
      are the essential building blocks of your search strategy. They are the concepts you must include
      for the question to make sense.

Research impact

      Research impact is different to publication metrics and refers to measuring the impacts of
      research, academically, economically, and socially, through the influencing of policy decisions,
      research-led changes in, for example, health practices, and the development of new products and
      services.

Research question

      A research question summarises the significant issue or problem you are aiming to investigate or
      solve in your research. It will guide the research process and will help you focus and conduct your
      literature review. It should be worded as a question in a way that doesn't permit a yes or no answer
      but requires a more indepth response. This usually means starting the question with words like
      how or why rather than does or will.

RSS feed

      Updates using XML-based data files to provide a summary or the full text of a website's content.

Scanning

      Identifying specific information by quickly searching for keywords or phrases.

Scholarly information

      A scholarly resource is generally written by experts in the field for experts in the field and con-
      tributes to the body of knowledge in that discipline area. For more information refer to Module
      2.3.2.

Search alert

      A search alert can be created for a search you have run in a database or other search tool to let you
      know when new material matching your search terms is added. A search alert is an easy and effec-
      tive way to get recent articles in your research area. For more information refer to Module 4.2.2.

Search concept

      Search concepts are the most important words in a research question or questions.

Search statement

      A search statement is used in a database or other search tool to find information. The statement
      is a combination of key words and phrases, from your research question, used in conjunction with
      known search techniques, including Boolean operators, phrase and proximity searching, trunca-
      tion, and wildcards. The construction of a search statement will vary depending on the research
      topic and the database or search tool in which you are searching.

Search strategy

      A search strategy is a systematic plan for conducting a search. It gives consideration to the con-
      cepts from your research question, the keywords, synonyms and related terms in those concepts,

260 | Glossary
      the types of information you need to find, where you need to search, and the search techniques
      you will need to apply. For more information, refer to Module 2.2.

Skimming

      Skimming is the reading technique of quickly looking over the text to identify main ideas, key
      points, and the general structure.

Snowballing (see Cited searching)

Subject heading

      Subject headings are a set of terms and phrases, known as standardised terms, from a controlled
      vocabulary, that are used to describe the content of books and articles and are assigned by cata-
      loguers and indexers.

      Also known as a descriptor or index term.

Subject searching

      Subject searching uses subject headings to search in databases. This type of searching can be
      more specific than a keyword search as you are using the subject field, based on controlled vocab-
      ulary, to limit and define your search. For more information refer to Module 3 Finding information
      for research.

Synonym

      A word, phrase, or term that has the same or nearly the same meaning as a keyword. In search
      strategies, synonyms are used to ensure you capture variations in terminology across disciplines
      and publications.

Table of contents (TOC) alert

      A Table of Contents (TOC) alert is created to notify a reader when a new issue of a journal or serial
      publication is available and usually lists the table of contents. of that latest issue. You can set up a
      journal alert via many databases, or directly from journal home pages. For more information, refer
      to Module 4.2 Setting up alerts for keeping up-to-date with literature.

Thesaurus

      A thesaurus is a resource, such as a book or website, that lists words in groups of synonyms and
      related concepts.

Truncation

      Truncation symbols are used in searching to look for the root or stem of a word. The most com-
      monly used truncation symbol is the asterisk *. For example, in QUT Library Search, typing in gov­
      ern* will return results that include government, governance, governing, governs...

Ulrichsweb

      Ulrichsweb is an online platform that can be used to identify and check for peer-reviewed or schol-
      arly material.

                                                                                                                                                                           Glossary | 261
Wildcard
      A wildcard symbol is used in searching to substitute a letter either within a word or at the end of
      a word. This symbol is particularly useful for American or British spelling variations or when you're
      unsure about the spelling of the word. For example, in QUT Library Search, organi?e will find both
      organise and organize.
