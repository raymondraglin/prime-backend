Errata
All OpenStax textbooks undergo a rigorous review process. However, like any professional-grade textbook, errors
sometimes occur. In addition, the wide range of evidence, standards, practices, data, and legal circumstances in
nursing change frequently, and portions of the text may become out of date. Since our books are web-based, we can
make updates periodically when deemed pedagogically necessary. If you have a correction to suggest, submit it

About Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing

Summary
Because mental health is an important aspect of an individual's total health, every nurse, no matter their work
setting, needs a foundational knowledge of managing patients with psychiatric and mental health conditions.
Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing is designed to support a one-semester psychiatric-mental health nursing course
offered at both two-year and four-year institutions. Serving a student base of both students specializing in
psychiatric nursing and those from other health disciplines, the course integrates evidence-based practices with
practical strategies for communication, readying students to build therapeutic relationships with clients and
caregivers.
2  Preface

   Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing emphasizes the importance of critical thinking and clinical judgment--skills
   essential for making informed decisions and providing high-quality care. Embedded throughout the text are
   opportunities for students to apply the Clinical Judgment Measurement Model to patient cases related to the unit or
   chapter theme. Ethical practice, client safety, and clinical professionalism are central to the narrative, reflecting the
   complex landscapes nurses navigate in mental health care. The text is committed to enhancing ethical awareness,
   patient safety, and clinical competence among nursing students.

   Authentic learning experiences are prioritized to ensure a seamless transfer of theoretical knowledge to practical
   application. Through detailed case studies and real-world scenarios, the text bridges the gap between academic
   learning and the realities of today's medical environments, preparing students for impactful careers in mental health
   nursing.

   Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing invites students to explore the integral role of psychiatric mental health nursing
   within the broader healthcare spectrum. Students will leave the course equipped with the knowledge and skills
   necessary to improve the well-being of individuals and communities through dedicated, informed nursing care.

   Pedagogical Foundation
   Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing uses a logical, thematic organization that breaks content down into manageable
   sections. Each unit is designed to foster a deep understanding of the biological, psychological, and social
   dimensions of mental health. The text helps students make meaningful connections between various psychiatric
   conditions and the corresponding nursing approaches. The text takes a comprehensive approach, integrating
   theoretical concepts with practical applications. By focusing on tailored psychiatric interventions and emphasizing
   patient-centered approaches, Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing equips students with the knowledge and skills
   necessary to navigate diverse mental health settings.

   Organizational Framework
   The table of contents for Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing presents content in 28 chapters, organized into 6
   thematic units.

       · Unit 1 introduces the foundational theories and practices of psychiatric-mental health nursing. It covers the
           evolution of mental health concepts, various therapeutic theories and their applications, and the latest trends
           in mental health care, including the integration of research and evidence-based practices.

       · Units 2-6 explore more specialized topics, each dedicated to different facets of psychiatric nursing:
             Therapeutic Considerations in Mental Health: Discusses the settings, relationships, and
                 interprofessional care crucial for effective mental health treatment.
             Client Rights and Legal Issues: Explores the legal and ethical frameworks that safeguard client rights
                 and outlines the responsibilities of mental health professionals.
             Psychiatric Nursing Practice: Focuses on clinical guidelines, practice standards, and specific disorders
                 including mood, anxiety, and personality disorders.
             Special Populations: Addresses the unique needs of children, adolescents, and older adults within
                 psychiatric care.
             Mental Health Care in the Community: Examines community-based approaches, current trends, and the
                 broader societal impacts on mental health care. The final chapter focuses on the vital role of critical
                 thinking in psychiatric-mental health nursing. The core of this chapter revolves around the application of
                 clinical judgement through the dissection of an unfolding case study. This practical approach helps
                 students see how theoretical knowledge and critical thinking translate into real world problem-solving.

   Nursing Features
   To further enhance learning, Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing includes the following features:

       · Clinical Judgment Measurement Model boxes guide students through the application of the Clinical
           Judgment Measurement Model in psychiatric nursing. The content explores the critical thinking and decision-
           making processes necessary to navigate patient care at different points in the process, from recognizing cues
           to evaluating outcomes.

       · Clinical Safety and Procedures (QSEN) align with the Quality and Safety Education for Nursing competencies
           by providing detailed explanations of safety protocols and procedures specific to psychiatric nursing. This
           feature emphasizes the importance of patient safety and quality care and offers checklists, step-by-step, or

Preface                                                                                                                  3

        tips on various safety practices.
    · Cultural Context boxes explore the impact of cultural factors on psychiatric nursing. This feature offers

        insights into how cultural beliefs, values, and practices can affect the perception and treatment of mental
        health conditions.
    · Life-Stage Context features address the specific needs and considerations of different life stages in
        psychiatric care from childhood to older adulthood. This feature provides age-specific insights and tips for
        adapting psychiatric assessment and interventions according to the developmental state of the patient.
    · Link to Learning features provide a very brief introduction to online resources--videos, interactives,
        collections, maps, and other engaging resources that are pertinent to students' exploration of the topic at
        hand.
    · Psychosocial Considerations explore the social and psychological aspects that affect individuals with mental
        health conditions. The features examine factors like social support networks, socioeconomic status, and
        psychological resilience, and their impact on mental health.
    · Real RN Stories feature firsthand accounts from registered nurses in the field of psychiatric-mental health
        nursing. These stories provide practical insights and real-world experiences that highlight the challenges and
        rewards of psychiatric nursing.
    · Unfolding Case Studies present a hypothetical client scenario that unfolds in three parts throughout the
        chapter, with each subsequent part presenting new information on the same client, to help foster clinical
        judgment. In each part of an unfolding case feature, the scenario is followed by two questions that require
        students to apply their knowledge of evidence-based care and allow them to practice with questions that
        mimic the style of Next-Gen NCLEX. The answers to these questions, with explanations, are included in the
        Answer Key for students at the end of the book.

Pedagogical Features
To support student learning, Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing includes the following standard elements:

    · Learning Outcomes: Every chapter section begins with a set of clear and concise student learning outcomes.
        These outcomes are designed to help the instructor decide what content to include or assign and can guide
        students on what they can expect to learn and be assessed on.

    · Assessments: A variety of assessments allow instructors to confirm core conceptual learning, elicit brief
        explanations that demonstrate student understanding, and offer more in-depth assignments that enable
        learners to dive more deeply into a topic or history-study skill.
          Review Questions test for conceptual apprehension of key concepts.
          Check Your Understanding Questions require students to explain concepts in words.
          Reflection Questions and Competency-Based Assessment Questions dive deeply into the material to
              support longer reflection, group discussion, or written assignments.
          What Should the Nurse Do? and Critical Thinking About Case Study Questions assess students'
              clinical judgment skills using case-based scenarios. Students review either a single case or an unfolding
              case that reveals information gradually. In response to their observations of the patient, students must
              decide how to navigate the Clinical Judgment Measurement Model process. This approach challenges
              them to apply theoretical knowledge to practical situations, determining the most appropriate
              interventions based on the patient's specific circumstances.

    · Answers to Questions in the Book: Assessments are intended for homework assignments or classroom
        discussion; thus, student-facing answers are not provided in the book. Answers and sample answers are
        provided in the Instructor Answer Guide for instructors to share with students at their discretion, as is
        standard for such resources.

    · Chapter Summary: Chapter summaries assist both students and instructors by outlining the primary
        subtopics addressed within the chapter.

    · Key Terms: Key terms are presented in bold text and are followed by an explanation in context. Definitions of
        key terms are also listed in the end-of-chapter glossary.

    · References: References are listed at the end of each chapter.

   Additional Resources

   Student and Instructor Resources
   We have compiled additional resources for both students and instructors, including Getting Started Guides, an
   instructor's answer guide, test bank, and image slides. Instructor resources require a verified instructor account,
   which you can apply for when you log in or create your account on OpenStax.org. Take advantage of these resources
   to supplement your OpenStax book.

   Instructor's answer guide. Each component of the instructor's guide is designed to provide maximum guidance for
   delivering the content in an interesting and dynamic manner.

   Test bank. With more than 1,100 assessments, instructors can customize tests to support a variety of course
   objectives. The test bank includes review questions (multiple-choice, identification, fill-in-the-blank, true/false),
   short answer questions, and long answer questions to assess students on a variety of levels. The test bank is
   available in Word format.

   PowerPoint lecture slides. The PowerPoint slides provide learning objectives, images and descriptions, feature
   focuses, and discussion questions as a starting place for instructors to build their lectures.

   Academic Integrity
   Academic integrity builds trust, understanding, equity, and genuine learning. While students may encounter
   significant challenges in their courses and their lives, doing their own work and maintaining a high degree of
   authenticity will result in meaningful outcomes that will extend far beyond their college career. Faculty,
   administrators, resource providers, and students should work together to maintain a fair and positive experience.

   We realize that students benefit when academic integrity ground rules are established early in the course. To that
   end, OpenStax has created an interactive to aid with academic integrity discussions in your course.

   Visit our academic integrity slider (https://www.openstax.org/r/academic-integrity-slider). Click and drag icons along the continuum to align
   these practices with your institution and course policies. You may then include the graphic on your syllabus, present it in your first course
   meeting, or create a handout for students. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

INTRODUCTION Mental health is a critical component of a person's overall health. All nurses, regardless of the
environment in which they work, must have a foundational knowledge of how to care for clients with a psychiatric-
mental health diagnosis. Nurses working in this specialty area of nursing must use a holistic approach to assess the
client's mind, body, and spirit as one unit that works together. Just as being proactive is important to staying
physically healthy, it is also important to understand protective factors against a decline in mental health. Nurses
should actively assist clients to learn to recognize both physical and psychological triggers in order to safeguard and
bolster their mental health.

    1.1 Mental Health and Mental Illness

    LEARNING OBJECTIVES
    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Compare and contrast psychiatric-mental health to psychiatric-mental illness
        · List standard nursing practices in psychiatric mental health

    It is important for nurses to understand the line between mental health and mental illness. The human body has
    physical and psychological responses to stress that psychiatric-mental health nurses are trained to observe in their
    clients. The nurse's role is to assess, plan, implement, and evaluate, all while collaborating with the client.
    Collaboration between the nurse and the client is an essential part of the mental health-care nursing process.

    Psychiatric-Mental Health versus Psychiatric-Mental Illness

    The term mental health refers to a state of well-being in which individuals realize their own abilities, cope with the
    normal stresses of life, work productively, and contribute to their community. Mental health is an essential
    component of overall health. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines overall health as a state of complete
    physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. Conversely, according to
    the American Psychiatric Association, mental illness is a health condition involving changes in emotion, thinking, or
    behavior (or a combination of these) associated with emotional distress and problems functioning in social, work, or
    family activities (American Psychiatric Association, n.d.).

    It is important that "health services . . . devote as much attention to mental health as they do to physical health
    care" (Happell et al., 2021, p. 560). The World Health Organization's slogan agrees: "There is no health without
    mental health." Yet attitudes toward choosing mental health nursing as a specialty are ambivalent. Nurses should
    receive education that reduces stigma surrounding mental health and its treatment, increases their knowledge
    about mental health/illness, and exposes them to caring for clients with mental health problems in all nursing
    settings.

    As a note, medical orientation to mental health treatment may refer to recipients of care as patients where the
    person is receiving acute treatment or assistance from a medical provider. Client is more often used in the
    community setting in which a person is in a collaborative solution-based relationship with a therapist (Spector,
    2016). In the 1990s, nurses began to use the term client more regularly in an effort to show that the person was
    working in collaboration with their health-care team (American Psychiatric Nurses Association [APNA], 2022). This
    text will, for the most part, use the word client.

    Psychiatric-Mental Health
    The promotion, protection, and restoration of mental health is a vital concern of individuals, nurses, communities,
    and societies throughout the world (Figure 1.2).

    FIGURE 1.2 Mental health and mental illness exist on a continuum. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0
    license)

    Mental health fluctuates over the course of an individual's life span and can range from well-being to emotional
    problems and/or mental illness, as indicated on the mental health continuum. Well-being is on the "healthy" range
    of the mental health continuum, where individuals are experiencing a state of good mental and emotional health.
    They may experience stress and discomfort resulting from occasional problems of everyday life, but they are able to
    cope effectively with the stressors and experience no impairments to daily functioning.

        PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Stress and Physical Response

The body's response to stress, often called the fight-or-flight response, can initiate both physical and psychological
symptoms. The fight-or-flight response is triggered when a stressful situation puts hormones into overdrive. Even if
the stress is not life-threatening, this response has evolved over the years as a survival mechanism against
situations deemed dangerous (Harvard Health Publishing, 2020). This response can entail a person sweating,
enduring chest pain, panic, stomach upset, headache, and an overall sense of doom. Chronic stress can lead to high
blood pressure, insomnia, anxiety, depression, poor appetite or overeating, and substance use. Stress, of course,
does not equal mental illness.

Psychiatric-Mental Illness
Mental illness is common in the United States. Nearly one in five (19 percent) of adults experience some form of
mental illness, one in twelve (8.5 percent) have a substance use disorder, and one in twenty-four (4 percent) have a
serious mental illness (American Psychiatric Association, 2022). Poor mental health increases the risk of chronic
physical illnesses, such as heart disease, cancer, and strokes, and can lead to thoughts and intentions of suicide.
Suicide is a common symptom associated with mental illness and is the second leading cause of death in Americans
aged fifteen to thirty-four (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021a).

Emotional problems become classified as mental illness when an individual's level of distress becomes significant,
and they have moderate to severe impairment in daily functioning at work, school, or home. Mental illness includes
relatively common disorders, such as depression and anxiety, as well as less common disorders, such as
schizophrenia. Mental illness is characterized by alterations in thinking, mood, or behavior. The term serious mental
illness refers to that which causes disabling functional impairment that substantially interferes with one or more
major life activities.

Standards of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing Practice

The American Psychiatric Nurses Association (APNA), the International Society of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurses
(ISPN), and the American Nurses Association (ANA) have established standards of care for psychiatric-mental
health nursing practice. These standards include that individuals with mental health and substance use conditions
should be treated with respect and dignity in a culturally appropriate manner. Health-care professionals should
consider the preferences of people with mental health and substance use disorders and support them, their family
members, and their loved ones in an inclusive manner.

History of Psychiatric Nursing
In the late 1800s, Edward Cowles, a physician at McLean Asylum in Massachusetts, began the first program to train
nurses to care for psychiatric clients (APNA, 2022). Prior to that, the caregivers were called "keepers" (p. 8). In the
early 1900s, Effie Jane Taylor at Johns Hopkins Hospital organized the first nurse-taught course to train psychiatric
nurses. Before that time, physicians trained nurses. The first psychiatric nursing textbook was published in 1920 (p.
8). World War II expanded the need for psychiatric nurses as veterans returned from war with combat-related
mental health problems.

It was in the 1950s that Hildegard Peplau rose to prominence as the "mother of psychiatric nursing" with her
development of the theory of interpersonal relations, a theory and model of the therapeutic nurse-client
relationship that focused on the "therapeutic use of self in promoting the well-being of individuals, families, groups,
and communities" (Haber, 2000, p. 56) (Figure 1.3). Her theory not only helped nurses to become self-aware in their
therapeutic relationships, but also assisted clients to build autonomy in problem-solving due to the support they
received from the nurse while moving forward toward better mental health. Peplau's mission was to redefine the
scope of work of the psychiatric nurse as a collaborative part of the health-care team and not just as the physician's
"handmaiden" (p. 57).

            LINK TO LEARNING

    The National Council of State Boards of Nursing created the Clinical Judgment Measurement Model (CJMM)
    (https://openstax.org/r/77CJMM) to explore new ways of testing clinical judgment in nursing as part of the National
    Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX). The diagram at this site shows the layers of the model.

      CLINICAL JUDGMENT MEASUREMENT MODEL
      What Is the Clinical Judgment Measurement Model (CJMM)?

      Designed by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN), the CJMM measures a nursing licensure
      candidate's ability to exercise sound clinical judgment and decision-making. Grounded in the nursing process,
      the CJMM includes six components: (1) recognize cues, (2) analyze cues, (3) prioritize hypotheses, (4) generate
      solutions, (5) take actions, and (6) evaluate outcomes. Built in layers, the CJMM provides a framework for
      thought processes and actions to take in exercising clinical judgment in a nursing scenario.

    Current Scope of Psychiatric Nursing Practice
    All nursing practice is based on theory and a caring philosophy toward the provision of holistic care. Psychiatric-
    mental health nursing is a specialty practice focused on the client's psychological and emotional responses, level of
    risk, and coping abilities. The client's recovery is the goal, with individualized care as the process. The therapeutic
    nurse-client relationship is key to this process.
    Mental health nursing takes place across settings, in the emergency room, in the community, in schools, in jails, in
    medical offices, in person, and through telehealth. Psychiatric nurses not only assess and provide care for the
    client's health-care needs, but are also involved in education, administration, and research (APNA, 2023, p. 40).
    When evaluating a client's mental health, the nurse uses a variety of assessments in addition to the traditional
    physical examination:

        · performing a mental status examination
        · completing a psychosocial assessment
        · reviewing the client's use of psychotropic medications (drugs that treat psychiatric symptoms) and/or other

            medications that can cause psychiatric symptoms as side effects
        · screening for suicidal ideation, exposure to trauma or violence, and substance misuse
        · incorporating a spiritual assessment while assessing the client's coping status

Nursing assessments related to mental health disorders differ from physiological assessments because they have a
greater focus on collecting subjective data: information provided by the client from the client's point of view or a
description of their experience. For example, prior to administering a cardiac medication to a client with a heart
condition, a nurse will assess objective data, such as blood pressure and an apical heart rate, to determine the
effectiveness of the medication treatment.

Prior to administering an antidepressant, however, a nurse uses therapeutic communication to ask questions and
gather subjective data about how the client is feeling in order to determine the effectiveness of the medication. The
nurse will also observe client behaviors, speech, mood, and thought processes as part of the assessment. Nurses
cannot directly measure a neurotransmitter to determine the effects of an antidepressant, for instance, but they can
ask questions to determine how the client is feeling emotionally and perceiving the world, two factors influenced by
neurotransmitter levels. An example of a nurse using therapeutic communication to perform subjective assessment
is, "Tell me more about how you are feeling today." The nurse may also use general survey techniques, such as
simply observing the client, to assess for cues of behavior. Examples of data collected by a general survey could be
evaluating the client's mood, hygiene, appearance, or movement.

Nurses in any setting holistically observe and process their clients' physical, emotional, and mental health, as well
as any impairments affecting their functioning. They must recognize subtle cues of undiagnosed or poorly managed
physical and mental disorders and follow up appropriately with other members of the interprofessional health-care
team (Figure 1.4).

        CLINICAL SAFETY AND PROCEDURES (QSEN)

Competency: Description of QSEN Competencies

The references to Quality and Safety Education for Nurses (QSEN) competencies throughout this text refer to the
educational repository created through funding by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to provide evidence-based
teaching resources for nursing curricula. This was in response to the Institute of Medicine's call to improve the
quality of healthcare in its report on healthcare safety in 1999. QSEN competencies are aligned with concepts that
14  1 · Foundations of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing

    can be expected to be tested on the NCLEX Next Gen, and with concepts presented in National Patient Safety Goals
    published annually by the Joint Commission.

    The overall goal of QSEN is to prepare future nurses with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) necessary to
    continuously improve the quality and safety of the health-care systems within which they work. QSEN helps nurses
    to identify and bridge the gaps between nursing school and nursing practice. QSEN includes six core QSEN
    competencies, KSAs, teaching strategies, and faculty development resources. The competencies arose after the
    Institute of Medicine (IOM) released a report in 2000 that highlighted the need for health-care system redesign. The
    six QSEN competencies are:

        · patient-centered care
        · teamwork and collaboration
        · evidence-based practice (EBP)
        · quality improvement (QI)
        · safety
        · informatics

    These competencies align with both the components of the NCLEX and the Joint Commission 2024 Behavioral
    Health Care National Patient Safety Goals (Table 1.1). The QSEN Competency of EBP aligns with the NCLEX
    Integrated Process of clinical judgment.

    1.2 Risk and Protective Factors of Mental Health

    LEARNING OBJECTIVES
    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Discuss various risk factors of psychiatric-mental illness
        · Describe various protective factors for psychiatric-mental illness
        · Identify nursing implications associated with risk and protection factors

    A risk factor increases the chances of developing a mental illness, may determine the probability of having a
    psychiatric-mental illness, and can change through the life span. Some risk factors may be modifiable, while others
    may be genetic or biological. Both internal and external environments of the person may pose risk. All of these
    factors can be addressed in nursing assessment. Having risk factors does not necessarily mean that a client will
    develop a disorder, and nurses shouldn't assume that a client is experiencing or will develop a disorder or illness. In
    fact, although risk factors can increase the chances of developing a mental illness, having an array of protective
    factors can decrease that risk. Nurses should help clients understand what these risk and protective factors are and
    potential ways to minimize risk factors and maximize protective factors.

    Risk Factors

    Mental health researchers have developed several theories to explain the causes of mental health disorders, but

1.2 · Risk and Protective Factors of Mental Health                                                                                     15

they have not reached consensus Figure 1.5. One point on which they agree is that an individual is not at fault for the
condition; they cannot simply turn symptoms on or off at will. There are likely several environmental, biological, and
genetic risk factors that, when combined, trigger a mental health disorder (University of Michigan Human Resources,
n.d.).

FIGURE 1.5 Risk factors for psychiatric-mental health conditions include social, biological, and psychological factors. (attribution:

Risk factors from biological, social, and psychological factors can overlap. Some risk factors change over time, such
as age, health history, availability of resources, and psychiatric history. Others are considered variable risk factors
and include "income level, peer group, adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), and employment status" (SAMHSA,
n.d.-a). Current stressors, such as relationship difficulties, the loss of a job, the birth of a child, a move, or prolonged
problems at work can also be important contributory environmental factors (University of Michigan Human
Resources, 2023).

Internal Environment: Physiological
Current research shows that the brain can have an imbalance of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine,
acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), norepinephrine, glutamate, and serotonin, resulting in changes in
behavior, mood, and thought. While causes of fluctuations in brain chemicals aren't fully understood, contributing
factors can include physical illness, hormonal changes, reactions to medication, substance misuse, diet, and stress
(University of Michigan Human Resources, 2024). Organic delirium and infections can also cause changes to mood
and behavior, until these conditions are successfully treated.

Kraybill (2019) found research suggesting that some mental health disorders are accompanied by immune system
dysregulation and inflammation. The immune system can be disturbed by stress and environmental toxins, affecting
human responses, nutritional intake, and immunity. Inflammation develops in the body as a response. Inflammation
is also a trigger for depression (Kraybill, 2019).

Genetics and Medical Comorbidities
There appears to be a hereditary pattern to some mental illnesses. For example, individuals with major depressive
disorder often have parents or other close relatives with the same illness. Huntington disease is another example,
wherein the cognitive and motor impairment can be misdiagnosed as a psychiatric disorder. Researchers continue to
investigate genes involved in specific disorders in order to target treatment to individuals.

People with mental illness may also have medical comorbidities, such as diabetes, endocrine dysfunction,
Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and traumatic brain injuries (TBI) (American Mental Wellness Association, 2023).
Psychiatric symptoms, medication side effects, ability for self-care, and provider focus may influence overall health.

    Intrapartum Complications
    People with a history of mental health issues prior to becoming pregnant are at a 40 percent higher risk of having a
    complication during pregnancy, a 50 percent higher risk for a non-live birth, and double the risk for having a baby
    born with a low birth weight (Witt et al., 2012). Some of these problems are due in part to lower socioeconomic
    status, lower education level, lack of access to medical care, and not being adequately followed to check their
    mental health status during pregnancy.

    Moreover, Ross et al. (2015) reports that drug use among pregnant females aged fifteen to forty-four is at nearly 6
    percent. Though the effects of maternal drug use on the babies differ depending on the drug used, some of the more
    common mental health effects on babies include cognitive delays, behavioral problems, attention-deficit
    hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), increased impulsivity, anxiety, depression, future substance use, and adolescent
    aggression (Table 1.2). Legal substances also are an intrapartum risk factor for mental illness. Tobacco exposure
    while in utero can cause children to develop ADHD, conduct disorder, behavioral disorders like aggression, and
    increased risk of drug abuse problems later on (Ross et al., 2015). Alcohol use in pregnancy can lead to fetal alcohol
    syndrome (FAS), which causes "morphogenic effects on limb and facial development, reduced brain and birth
    weight, and cognitive delays and impairments" (p. 74).

TABLE 1.2 Effects of Maternal Drug Use

Substance Use Disorders and Addictions
In addition to the negative effects that substance use and addiction have on the developing fetus, about half of the
people living with a mental health disorder are also living with a substance use disorder (Medline Plus, 2019). Each
of these things, mental health disorders and substance use disorder, can contribute to the development of the other.
Many people who have mental illness use drugs or alcohol to cope with their symptoms.

Brain Injury
Another internal physiological risk factor for mental illness that can affect children and adults is experiencing a
traumatic brain injury (TBI), a brain injury that can cause short- or long-term problems with thinking, physical
movement, communication, and functional abilities. In some cases, it may result in permanent disability or death. A
TBI "can be caused by a forceful bump, blow, or jolt to the head or body, or from an object that pierces the skull and
enters the brain" (National Institute on Neurological Disorders and Stroke, n.d., para 1). According to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (2022), a TBI in children can affect their development and lead to problems with
learning, thinking, and behavior. These effects can last a lifetime. The most common causes of TBIs are falls, firearm
injury, car accidents, and assaults. Experiencing a TBI can lead to years of medical care, rehabilitation, PTSD from
memories of the event, a decrease in physical and mental functioning, financial concerns, and mental health issues
for partners or family members (Tsur & Haller, 2020).

Internal Environment: Psychological
Factors that affect a person's psychological self include their emotions, coping ability, spirituality, self-concept and
self-esteem, learned and conditioned behaviors, and personality traits. Plus, individual trauma resulting from an
event, series of events, or set of circumstances that is experienced as physically or emotionally harmful can have
lasting adverse effects on the individual's functioning and mental, physical, social, emotional, or spiritual well-being
(U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2020).

Low Self-Esteem, Poor Self-Concept
Having a poor self-concept or low self-esteem can lead to a person having negative thoughts about themselves.
These feelings can lead to a sense of isolation and can cause poor relationships with others. Continued negative
thoughts can lead a person to use substances as they try to make themselves feel better. Low self-esteem can also
be associated with depression and anxiety (Gold, 2016).

Dysfunctional Relationships and Trust Violations
A relationship that is characterized as a dysfunctional relationship is one in which unhealthy behavior patterns
exist among members of a group. These patterns can include poor communication styles, conflict between people in
the relationship, and even emotional and/or physical abuse (Harold, 2023). In families, while it is often the parent
who engages in the dysfunctional behavior, it is the child who suffers the consequences with an increased risk of
developing anxiety, low self-esteem, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance misuse, depression, and
18  1 · Foundations of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing

    problems building healthy relationships. In dysfunctional families, children can lose their ability to trust others
    based on their experiences of not being able to depend on their parents (Martin, 2018).

    One example of dysfunctional relationships is gang affiliation. Gang affiliation is an unsafe environment that
    worsens existing problems. Children brought up in a family setting that includes a parent who uses substances, is
    abusive, or is a gang member themselves are at greater risk of socializing with gang members they meet in school or
    on the streets (Macfarlane, 2018). As children push away from these families, their vulnerability draws them toward
    gang membership. Research has shown that high rates of "depression, psychosis, anxiety, alcohol and drug
    dependence, antisocial personality disorder and history of attempted suicide" (p. 414) occur in gang members.

    External Environment: Social
    Individuals are affected by broad social and cultural factors, as well as by unique factors in their personal
    environments. Social risk factors, such as racism, discrimination, poverty, and violence (often referred to as "social
    determinants of health") can increase the chances of a person developing a mental illness.

    While many social relationships act as sources of support, there are situations where relationships are toxic and can
    potentially increase the risk of mental health problems; fatigue; lack of motivation; difficulty concentrating; and
    cardiovascular, immune, and endocrine problems (André & Baumeister, 2023). Marital problems, demanding or
    intense relationships, and caregiving burnout are examples of relationships that could be toxic.

            CULTURAL CONTEXT

    Cultural Influences on Mental Health and Mental Illness

    The culture of a client influences many aspects of mental health and mental illness. Be mindful, however, that
    general statements about cultural characteristics of a given group may also invite stereotyping. Cultural information
    should not be broadly applied to any individual member of a racial, ethnic, or cultural group.

    In fact, only 66 percent of adults from underrepresented groups in the United States will get help for their mental
    health problems. There are four ways that culture affects mental health: stigma, understanding symptoms, lack of
    support from others in the same culture, and not having resources available that meet cultural needs (Mental Health
    First Aid, 2019).

    Abuse/Neglect, Social Oppression/Victimization
    In 2019, there were 656,000 victims of child abuse and neglect, with a victim rate calculated as nine victims per
    1,000 children across the United States. More specifically, 74.9 percent of victims were neglected, 17.5 percent
    were physically abused, and 9.3 percent were sexually abused (Administration for Children & Families, 2021).
    Neglect is a situation in which a parent or caretaker fails, refuses, or is unable, for reasons other than poverty, to
    provide the necessary care, food, clothing, or medical or dental care, seriously endangering the physical, mental, or
    emotional health of the child. Physical abuse is defined as injury inflicted on a child by other than accidental means.
    Physical injury includes, but is not limited to, lacerations, fractured bones, burns, internal injuries, severe or
    frequent bruising, or great bodily harm. Sexual abuse is defined as sexual intercourse or sexual touching of a child;
    sexual exploitation; human trafficking of a child; forced viewing of sexual activity; or permitting, allowing, or
    encouraging a child to engage in prostitution. Emotional abuse is defined as harm to a child's psychological or
    intellectual functioning, which often results in severe anxiety, depression, withdrawal, or aggression. Emotional
    damage may show up in substantial and observable changes in behavior, emotional response, or learning that are
    incompatible with the child's age or stage of development. All of these types of abuse are considered adverse
    childhood experiences (ACEs).

    It is estimated that 61 percent of adults have experienced early ACEs, such as abuse, neglect, or growing up in a
    household with violence, mental illness, substance misuse, incarceration, or divorce. Chronic stress from ACEs can
    change brain development and affect how the body responds to stress. ACEs are linked to chronic health problems,
    mental illness, and substance misuse in adulthood (National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Division of
    Violence Protection, 2022).

    Adults at risk for abuse are defined as adults who have a physical or mental condition that impairs their ability to

care for their own needs (Wisconsin Department of Health Services, 2018). Older adults at risk are potentially
susceptible to abuse, neglect, or financial exploitation by caregivers or a person they trust (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, 2021b).

        LIFE-STAGE CONTEXT

Older Adult Risk Factors for Psychiatric-Mental Illness

Risk factors for mental disorders in older adults include being female, loneliness, alcohol abuse, lack of education,
financial difficulties, family history of mental diseases, and severe physical disease. In addition, adults with serious
mental illness over age fifty have a high rate of medical comorbid conditions (SAMHSA, 2021).

Social oppression and victimization--bullying, violence, and stigmatization of people from underrepresented groups,
for instance--can occur across the life span and are also significant risk factors for mental illness. It is stereotyping
when someone has a generalized and prejudiced opinion about members of a particular group of people.
Stereotyping can cause the marked population to feel stigmatized, disrespected, and become the target of bullying.
Atunah-Jay et al. (2022) studied the concepts of school-based and electronic bullying in relation to their connection
to an increase in suicidality in a group of North Dakota middle school students, specifically within the American
Indian/Alaska native (AI/AN) population. Results revealed that "compared to other forms of bullying, electronic
bullying is associated with unique and significant negative mental health concerns, including anxiety, depression,
and suicidality" (p. 28).

Lack of a Support System, Loss, Economic Disadvantage
Risk factors for mental illness include the lack of a support system. This could be because the person is not
physically or emotionally close to family members, has few friends, or lives in an area in which they do not feel
connected to others. Loss includes anything that creates a negative effect for a person--loss of a spouse (divorce or
death), loss of a job, and moving away from family are examples. Economic disadvantage can be related to the loss
of a job or not having the skills to work beyond a minimum wage job. While lack of a support system, loss, and
economic disadvantage have always been risk factors for developing mental health issues, the recent COVID-19
pandemic, and the measures taken to mitigate the spread, highlighted new examples of these risks. In particular
was the practice of social distancing and social isolation. While these practices began to keep the public physically
safer, there was a marked increase in anxiety, depression, and self-perceived stress related to loss of contact with
others, loss of family and friends to the illness, sleep difficulties, financial insecurities among those with lower
incomes, and misinterpretation (fake news) of the vast amount of information shared in mass media (Daclan,
Ferreira, & Guzella, 2022).

The Mayo Clinic provides a list of mental illness risk factors (https://openstax.org/r/77riskfactors) with more
information about mental illness symptoms, causes, treatment, and resources.

Protective Factors

There is a link between protective factors and resilience, or the ability to "bounce back," and overcome stressful
barriers to living a healthy life. Protective factors reduce the risk for mental illness, suicide, and other detrimental
behaviors. Some of these biological, social, and psychological factors can be developed over time in the individual,
family, and community (Connect Online, 2023). Examples of protective factors include support received from family
and friends, religious practices, being part of a social group, getting physical activity, eating healthy foods, and using
positive coping skills (Mental Health First Aid, 2022).

Internal Environment: Physiological
Living a healthy lifestyle that includes attention to diet, getting plenty of exercise and sleep, and having access to
regular medical care provides a protective factor against the development of a mental illness. Other protective
factors include avoiding high-risk substance use and receiving appropriate care for medical conditions (American
20  1 · Foundations of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing

    Mental Wellness Association, 2023).

    Exercise is known to reduce all mortality risks, including poor mental health (Prakash, 2020). "Evidence suggests an
    exercise duration of 45 min 3-5 days a week to be optimal for good mental health" (p. 186). Physical activity is an
    appropriate intervention for the prevention of depression symptoms. Diet is also known to affect mental health,
    either positively or negatively. What a person eats can influence the development and progression of mental illness.
    Mental health professionals are encouraged to address nutrition in client care (Prakash, 2020).

            LINK TO LEARNING

    Dietary antioxidants may help to alleviate depression, anxiety, and stress. A study of the Mediterranean and DASH
    diet (https://openstax.org/r/77MedDASH) investigates the relationship between diet and psychological disorders.

    Internal Environment: Psychological
    Other protective factors include having healthy development and good attachment to parents (American Mental
    Wellness Association, 2023). Fei, et al. (2021) found that secure attachment creates comfort with self and was
    associated with higher levels of self-esteem.

    Moreover, having high self-esteem means that a person can see their own value and have that attitude affect their
    social interactions, job satisfaction, and overall sense of well-being (Prakash, 2020). High self-esteem decreases
    anxiety, depression, and attention disorders due to the person using more positive coping skills. Finding a purpose
    in life also acts as a protective factor; it has been found to positively affect depression and anxiety, while
    contributing a 2.4 percent reduction to the chance of developing Alzheimer's disease (Prakash, 2020). High self-
    esteem and having a purpose in life are related to a person's resilience. Also connected to developing resilience are
    task-oriented coping mechanisms. People learn to use these methods, practicing them throughout their lives,
    changing them as needed. The current use of mental health apps provides "on the go" coping mechanisms to people
    who are socially isolated and to the younger generation (Varela et al., 2021).

            LINK TO LEARNING

    University of California at San Francisco offers this resource for recommended, evidence-based apps
    (https://openstax.org/r/77copingresources) for wellness and mental health.

    In, addition, the use of mindfulness techniques--being fully present in the moment, being aware of surroundings,
    environment, and senses--is another protective factor that reduces stress and thereby lowers risk factors for mental
    illness. Examples of mindfulness techniques include meditation and keeping gratitude journals, instead of
    ruminating about the "what-ifs."

    Spirituality, Morals, and Beliefs
    The positive (protective) effects of religion and spirituality include promoting positive behaviors, giving people
    something to believe in, and offering purpose and meaning. The added benefit of the social connectedness that
    comes from being part of a religious community enhances positive health behaviors and outcomes. It is an
    important part of the nursing assessment to ask about a client's religious practices because this information helps
    to build interventions around the client's beliefs in health practices and allows nurses to utilize all of the resources
    that a client may have at their disposal.

            LINK TO LEARNING

    This scoping review of scholarly databases (https://openstax.org/r/77scopingreview) identified a need for spiritual
    care to be included in nursing education programs and in staff development efforts in the workplace. The
    researchers advocate for inclusion of spirituality into nursing practice and call for enhanced overall awareness of
    needs of health-care recipients.

Motivation/Achievement
Intrinsic motivation is the incentive to do something for internal or inherent satisfaction. Extrinsic motivation, such
as working for a paycheck, does not have the same protective factors as intrinsic motivation. Extrinsic motivation
can result in burnout and depression, when external rewards are not achieved. Intrinsic motivation is connected
with more positive outcomes, such as well-being, satisfaction with life, and using ethical judgment (Kotera & Ting,
2019, p. 229). Being motivated by setting a goal and then achieving that goal is rewarding and can boost self-
esteem, contribute to a feeling of fulfillment, and create a more hopeful outlook on life.

Childhood Attachments, Emotional Stability, Coping Skills
Children raised in loving environments are more likely to have good attachments to their parents or primary
caregivers. This attachment decreases the likelihood of the child developing aggressive behavior and promotes their
ability to express empathy as compared with children who were maltreated (FRIENDS National Center, 2023). The
use of positive coping skills to overcome adversity combines cognitive and behavioral techniques that may change
over time as the person experiences different stressors (Varela et al., 2021). These strategies are considered either
task-oriented or emotionally oriented and each has a different effect on the person's ability to get past the stressor.
Being able to have a variety of positive coping skills to use when life gets stressful enhances emotional stability.

External Environment
Social connectedness has been shown to reduce feelings of mental health stigma, to increase feeling supported,
and to enhance the use of positive coping skills (Prakash, 2020). The support provided by a social milieu is helpful
throughout the span of life. It is also helpful when someone is diagnosed with a mental illness because it provides
the support needed to make the person feel validated as they navigate a life that can sometimes be very difficult.
Without social support and connectedness, people become lonely, which has been shown to cause detrimental
outcomes in people with depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia (Prakash, 2020).

Safety, Security, Caregiver Support
Having the support of those around you is an important protective factor. People need to feel secure in their
relationships with family, friends, and caregivers. The safety and security they feel from a healthy, nurturing
relationship provide a lifeline in times of mental distress. Sometimes just knowing there is one person to depend on
makes a difference in being able to overcome a stressful life event. For example, children who are allowed to take
risks with the guidance of a parent learn how to be self-sufficient in a safe environment (Prevention United, n.d.).

Participation in Sports, Clubs, Activities, or Groups
Participation in sports, clubs, activities, or groups is a social support that gives the client the feeling of being
involved with others. Plus, being physically active releases the "feel good" brain chemicals called endorphins.
Endorphins can help reduce depression, stress, and anxiety (Cleveland Clinic, 2023). Doing enjoyable things, such
as laughing with friends, listening to music, meditating, and doing volunteer work also releases endorphins.

When encountering stressful situations, the Mayo Clinic (2023) suggests joining mental health support groups.
These groups provide a safe and supportive environment in which to meet other people/families going through
similar situations. They also provide education and online resources that offer information to help mitigate the risks
of normal stress becoming a psychiatric condition. Such groups are provided by the National Alliance on Mental
Illness (NAMI), which offers fact sheets and search features for local support groups, and the Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA), which offers resources for coaching and connecting.

Access to Medical Care
Having access to health care is a protective factor when it comes to mental illness. According to Mental Health
America (2023), barriers to accessing medical care include lack of mental health coverage in a client's private
insurance plan, the large number of clients assigned to each mental health provider, and not being able to afford
treatment. Public assistance programs, including health insurance, are examples of protective effects of access to
medical care; they lift the barrier people have to getting appropriate prenatal care, thus decreasing the risk of a non-
live birth (Witt et al., 2012). An additional benefit of being enrolled in a public health program is access to the
Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which will increase prenatal and
postnatal nutrition and overall wellness. The support that these people gain through such programs can help to
reduce stress and anxiety during pregnancy.

    Nursing Implications Associated with Factors of Risk or Protection

    As the nurse completes a full assessment of the client, using purposeful questions and active listening are important
    parts of the process. The nurse must maintain a nonjudgmental attitude during the assessment (Higgins et al.,
    2015). The assessment builds a rapport between the nurse and client, creating an environment of trust. This is
    professional intimacy in the therapeutic nurse-client relationship, wherein the nurse gains an understanding of the
    client through respect and empathy, with compassion and recognition of the client's experience. Higgins et al.
    (2015) explains that the nurse uses three approaches to gather information: unstructured clinical judgment,
    assessment tools, and structured clinical judgment. Unstructured clinical judgment includes using critical thinking
    skills, observation, and intuition. Using standardized assessment tools is part of the mental health nursing process
    that provides insight into risk factors. Structured clinical judgment entails using a combination of the first two
    approaches to get an overall picture of the person's risk and protective factors.

    A psychosocial assessment is a component of the nursing assessment process that obtains additional subjective
    data to detect risks and identify treatment opportunities and resources. Learning about the client's risk and
    protective factors will guide the development of appropriate interventions and outcomes. Agencies have specific
    forms used for psychosocial assessments that typically consist of several components (Glasner, Baltag, & Ambresin,
    2021; GW School of Medicine & Health Sciences, n.d.):

        · cultural assessment
        · reason for seeking health care (i.e., "chief complaint")
        · thoughts of self-harm or suicide
        · current and past medical history
        · current medications
        · history of previously diagnosed mental health disorders
        · previous hospitalizations
        · educational background
        · occupational background
        · family dynamics
        · history of exposure to psychological trauma, violence, and domestic abuse
        · substance use (tobacco, alcohol, recreational drugs, misused prescription drugs)
        · family history of mental illness
        · coping mechanisms
        · functional ability/activities of daily living
        · spiritual assessment

    Risk Assessment
    The availability of standardized web-based or paper risk assessment tools can make the risk assessment an easier
    task for the health-care provider or nurse. Ayhan and Ustun (2021) identified eighteen risk assessment tools that
    have been developed since 1970. While these individual tools have all been developed to measure levels of risk,
    each one is based on the client population being assessed. Clinicians must be comfortable with using the correct
    tool for the environment in which they work, whether it be in-hospital treatment, community care, or forensic
    psychiatry.

    Strengths Assessment
    An important question to ask is, "What positive coping skills have you used in the past to get through difficult
    times?" Assessing and reminding a client of their strengths is an integral part of instilling hope in the client. Who are
    their support persons? What do they see as their personal strengths? Engaging the client in thinking from a positive
    standpoint begins the trajectory toward reaching healthy treatment outcomes.

1.3 Mental Health Stigma

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Discuss stigma surrounding psychiatric-mental health and illness
    · Explain the importance of representation and acceptance of mental health in the community
    · Describe the nurse's role in stigma reduction

According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) (n.d.-a), "One in 5 Americans is affected by mental
health conditions" (para 4). Due to the stigma surrounding mental illness, people delay getting treatment for an
average of eight to ten years and less than half will ever seek help (NAMI, n.d.-a). Stigma affects the quality of life
for the millions of people with mental illness. Nurses are in a position and have an obligation to educate the public
about mental illness to reduce stigma, to help create positive change through engagement in public health advocacy
efforts, and to model compassion for those affected by mental illness.

Stigma toward Mental Illness

Despite a recent focus on mental health in the United States, there are still many harmful attitudes and
misunderstandings surrounding mental illnesses that lead people to ignore their mental health and make it more
difficult for them to reach out for help (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021a; Corrigan & Watson,
2002). The term stigma refers to a cluster of negative attitudes and beliefs that motivates the general public to fear,
reject, avoid, and discriminate (Figure 1.6). In this case, the discrimination is against people with mental health
disorders (SAMHSA, n.d.-b).

FIGURE 1.6 There are four main types of stigma surrounding mental health issues. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under
CC BY 4.0 license)

Estimates report that nearly two-thirds of people with diagnosable mental health disorders do not seek treatment
due to the stigma of mental illness. The U.S. Surgeon General's Report in 1999 was a milestone report that sought to
dispel the stigma of mental illness and its impact on those seeking care (Hegner, 2000). This was the first surgeon
general report to discuss mental health and mental illness, the first to put mental health in the spotlight. The
National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) seeks to improve the lives of those with mental illness and reduce stigma
through education, support, and advocacy. NAMI encourages people to share their stories to discredit stereotypes,
break the silence, and document discrimination (Abderholden, 2019).

        PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Stigma

To fully understand the impact of stigma, it is important to understand several types: self-stigma, public stigma, and
institutional stigma. There is also a fourth type of stigma relating to the caretakers of people with mental illness,
internalized stigma or affiliated stigma (Kaggwa et al., 2023). Public stigma includes negative or discriminatory
attitudes that individuals have about mental illness. Self-stigma involves negative attitudes, including internalized
shame, that individuals with mental illness have about their own condition. Institutional stigma is more systemic,
involving government and private organization policies that limit opportunities for individuals with mental illness.
24  1 · Foundations of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing

    Implicit and Explicit Bias
    The term implicit bias refers to prejudice evidenced in attitudes beyond consciousness or control (Stull et al.,
    2013). Implicit bias may be automatic and unintentional. Bias against those with mental health disorders comes up
    in communities, within the health-care sector, and in those with mental illness themselves. Each person's social
    conditioning affects their implicit bias (Cherry, 2023).

    The term explicit bias refers to attitudes people are aware of, endorse, and communicate (Vela et al., 2022).
    Explicit bias interferes with inclusion, equity, and access in health care and negatively affects communication and
    teaching (Vela et al., 2022). Researchers examining bias in health care call for systemic change to address both
    implicit and explicit bias (Vela et al., 2022). It is important to work with and advocate for people who have mental
    illness toward more support and better outcomes for this population. Positive attitudes increase the desire to help
    and influence behaviors, which is especially important in those who are caring for people with mental illness.

    Prejudice
    The term prejudice refers to the beliefs, thoughts, feelings, and attitudes someone holds about a group. A prejudice
    is not based on personal experience; instead, it is a prejudgment, originating outside actual experience. While
    prejudice is based in beliefs outside of experience, experience can lead people to feel that their prejudice is
    confirmed or justified. This is a type of confirmation bias. For example, if someone is taught to believe that a certain
    ethnic group has negative attributes, every negative act committed by someone in that group can be seen as
    confirming the prejudice. Even a minor social offense committed by a member of the group, like crossing the street
    outside the crosswalk or talking too loudly on a bus, could confirm the prejudice.

    Prejudice--as well as the stereotypes that lead to it and the discrimination that stems from it--is most often taught
    and learned. The teaching arrives in many forms, from direct instruction or indoctrination, to observation and
    socialization. Movies, books, charismatic speakers, and even a desire to impress others can all support the
    development of prejudices.

    Discrimination
    Though prejudice refers to biased thinking, discrimination consists of actions against a group of people.
    Discrimination can be based on race, ethnicity, age, religion, health, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.
    For example, discrimination based on race or ethnicity can take many forms, from unfair housing practices, such as
    redlining, to biased hiring systems. Overt discrimination has long been part of U.S. history. In the late nineteenth
    century, it was not uncommon for business owners to hang signs that read, "Help Wanted: No Irish Need Apply."
    And Southern Jim Crow laws, with their "Whites Only" signs, exemplified overt discrimination that is not tolerated
    today.

    Discrimination can be intentional in the way that someone else makes a derogatory comment about another's
    mental illness or treatment, or it can be unintentional when someone is afraid to be close to a person with mental
    illness due to their lack of understanding about the disease (Mayo Clinic, 2023). This type of discrimination extends
    to primary caretakers of people with mental illness who may feel judged and unsupported by society (Kaggwa,
    2023). Discrimination presents barriers for people with mental health conditions obtaining "good jobs, safe housing,
    satisfactory health care, and diverse social interactions" (Stull et al., 2013, para 1).

    Representation and Acceptance of Mental Health in the Community

    Despite the number of people who experience mental illness in any given year, stigma continues to be a social
    problem in the United States (Ma & Nan, 2018). People with mental illness have ongoing problems finding jobs and
    affordable and safe housing and are faced with the public's fear of being in close contact with them. Media
    campaigns can have a positive effect on changing public attitudes. One such campaign is Bring Change 2 Mind
    hosted by Glenn Close. This program has provided educational public service announcements about mental health/
    illness since 2009 (Bring Change 2 Mind, 2023).

    Gender differences play a role in acceptance of mental illness. In 2018, Ma and Nan found that females are more
    likely to have positive attitudes toward and empathy for stigmatized groups than their male counterparts. Males
    have more often been found to want to deal with mental health issues on their own due to fear of stigma (Coveney,
    2023).

Culture and Mental Health
Cultural and ethnic considerations are paramount in perceptions of mental health. Culture and ethnicity not only
influence the way the disease develops, but also the way it is expressed, accepted, and understood (Mizock &
Russinova, 2013). "The explanatory model a culture has for mental illness can both enhance and reduce stigma
faced by people with serious mental illness" (p. 231). Cultural values and beliefs affect how a person views certain
ideas or behaviors. In the case of mental health, it can determine whether or not the individual seeks help, the type
of help sought, and the support available. Every individual has different cultural beliefs and faces a unique journey to
recovery. In general, historically marginalized communities in the United States are less likely to access mental
health treatment, or they wait until symptoms are severe before seeking assistance (Mental Health First Aid USA,
2019).

Four ways that culture can impact mental well-being are (Mental Health First Aid USA, 2019):

    · Cultural stigma: Every culture has a different perspective on mental health, and many cultures have a stigma
        surrounding mental illness. Mental health challenges may be considered a weakness and something to hide,
        which can make it harder for those struggling to talk openly and ask for help.

    · Describing symptoms: Culture can influence how people describe or feel about their symptoms. It can affect
        whether someone chooses to recognize and talk openly about physical symptoms, emotional symptoms, or
        both. For example, members of the Amish community are typically stoic and endure physical and emotional
        pain without complaining.

    · Community support: Cultural factors can determine how much support someone gets from their family and
        community when it comes to mental health. Because of existing stigma, it can be challenging for individuals to
        find mental health treatment and support. Globally, there are different beliefs and practices related to the care
        of mental health problems. Some communities offer support to those with mental illness and others shun or
        ignore its presence. The treatment received by those defined as mentally ill or disabled varies greatly from
        country to country.

    · Resources: When looking for mental health treatment, it can be difficult to find resources and treatment
        options that take into account a specific culture's concerns and needs.

Communication problems interfere with the spread of mental health knowledge from culture to culture when
specific descriptors of diagnoses are not expressed the same ways in different cultures. A solution to this is the use
of Transnational and Inclusive Mental Health De-stigmatizing Education (TIMHDE). This concept involves people
from all different continents, cultures, and lived experience working together to establish a mutual way to present
educational content about mental health (Illingworth, 2021).

Barriers to Mental Health Care
Barriers to mental health care vary. There can be barriers that the client places on themselves by not wanting to
admit that they need help. Barriers can also be connected to fear of stigma from friends and family, cultural biases,
not having health insurance to cover the costs of treatment, and not having adequate information about the mental
health resources available in their community (Heath, 2017).

For those who live in rural areas, finding treatment sources is also not always easy. There may be limited options,
especially in rural areas and low-income urban areas; waiting lists; poor quality of care available for indigent clients;
and financial obstacles, such as co-pays, deductibles, and time off from work. There is also the consideration that in
small rural communities where everybody knows everyone, people may fear getting the help they need because of
the stigma associated with mental health care.

Availability, accessibility, and acceptability (the stigma attached to mental illness) are all problems in rural areas.
Approximately two-thirds of those with symptoms receive no care at all (U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, 2005; Wagenfeld, Murray, Mohatt, & DeBruiynb, 1994). At the end of 2013, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture announced an investment of $50 million to help improve access and treatment for mental health
problems as part of the Obama administration's effort to strengthen rural communities.

    The Rural Health Information Hub provides data and resources, including a Mental Health Toolkit
    (https://openstax.org/r/77MHTookit) for communities in rural areas of the United States. The site is supported by
    the Health Resources and Services Administration of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

    Veterans and military personnel make up a large portion of those who encounter barriers to receiving mental health
    care. Despite the implementation of post deployment screening to help identify signs and symptoms of mental
    health problems in veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, stigma is still present in the military community
    (Warner et al., 2011; Brown & Hardey, 2023). Many veterans remain hesitant to disclose their symptoms for fear of
    it negatively affecting their reputation. Those in the military are trained to be tough, so they fear that "members of
    my unit might view me differently," and "It would hurt my career" (para 13).

    Nursing Implications

    Stigma and negative attitudes toward mental illness can still be found among nurses. Several studies from a variety
    of countries indicated that health-care professionals can be classified in three categories in relation to stigma,
    including "stigmatizers," "the stigmatized," and "de-stigmatizers." Stigmatizers refer to nurses in medical settings
    with stereotypical attitudes toward clients with mental illnesses, psychiatric-mental health nurses, and/or
    psychiatry. Nurses classified as the stigmatized have mental health disorders or perceive stigma regarding their
    roles as psychiatric-mental health nurses. De-stigmatizers actively work to reduce stigma surrounding mental
    health disorders. The authors of the studies found that many nurses share commonly held stereotypical beliefs
    portrayed in the media. For example, clients with mental health disorders have been portrayed in the media as
    dangerous, unpredictable, violent, or bizarre, and these portrayals can cause fearful attitudes. Nurses in the studies
    were concerned about inadvertently saying or doing "the wrong thing" or "setting off" uncontrollable behavior. Many
    nurses in general medical settings felt they lacked the skills to manage behavioral symptoms of clients with mental
    health disorders. The authors of the review reported that their findings support additional mental health education
    for entry-level nurses and practicing nurses to enhance their knowledge base on mental health (Ross & Goldner,
    2009).

    Geographic Location: Texas

    As a board-certified psychiatric-mental health nurse and university-level instructor, I find it important to teach my
    nursing students the importance of accepting all people despite what some might think is a derogatory aspect of
    their being (i.e., diagnosed with a mental illness). In my first class of the semester, I always talk about stigma and
    show two videos available through Bring Change 2 Mind. The first video "Grand Central Terminal" lets the viewer
    meet people talking about the diagnosis printed on their white t-shirt. The second video features Ron Howard, who
    directed "Grand Central Terminal," sharing why he felt this story was important to tell. After we watch these videos
    together, I open up the floor for conversation. I ask if seeing visual representation of stigma helps them to better
    understand this concept. I ask if anyone in class would like to share about a time they may have felt stigmatized. I
    explain that what happens in class is akin to what happens in Vegas--what happens in the classroom stays in the
    classroom; it is a safe space for sharing. I also tell my students to compare educating others about stigma to
    dropping a pebble into a body of water and watching the ripples extend. Much like the ripples in the water, each
    person they educate has the potential to share that knowledge with others, in effect decreasing the stigma toward
    mental illness one person at a time.

relationship. A therapeutic nurse-client relationship is essential in all settings, but it is especially important in
mental health care where the therapeutic relationship is considered the foundation of client care and healing.
Although nurse generalists are not expected to perform advanced psychiatric-mental health nursing interventions,
all nurses are expected to engage in compassionate, supportive relationships with their clients (Ross & Goldner,
2009). This is even supported in the Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice (American Nurses Association,
2021).

Nurses' Self-Care
Nurses spend a lot of time and energy caring for others. Regis College's 2023 article about self-care tips for nurses
highlights five problems that nurses face: "Stress, burnout, bullying, exhaustion, and inadequate sense of support
from employers" (para 4). Self-care is an important part of being able to take care of others. If you do not take time
to take care of yourself, you will have nothing left to give your clients. Some ideas for self-care include maintaining a
sleep schedule as a way to recharge the body, recognizing when to talk to someone about your feelings, making time
for exercise, maintaining a healthy diet, and practicing mindfulness (Regis College, 2023). When at work, nurses
should make a point of taking breaks, eating lunch, mentoring other nurses (this provides an environment of
support), and sharing a laugh with coworkers. In the psychiatric-mental health environment, it is especially
important to practice self-care as the clients are often at their most acute level, staffing ratios can be low, and there
is the constant need to be vigilant in maintaining a safe environment. These factors increase the stress level of the
nurses.

The psychiatric-mental health nurse is taught to be self-aware of their own attitudes toward others and triggers that
may occur with certain clients. This self-awareness can help decrease possible stigmatization. For example, there
may be a client who reminds the nurse of an abusive family member. In this case, the nurse recognizes the trigger
and utilizes reflection and possibly seeks peer or mentor support. By admitting that there are preexisting thoughts
about a certain type of client, the nurse is acknowledging that they may not be able to provide nonjudgmental care
and reach optimum treatment goals for that client. The role of being a nurse is very rewarding and exhausting all in
one. Taking care of self is just as important as the care provided to clients.

1.4 Mental Health Recovery and Wellness

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Discuss principles central to the recovery model
    · Identify stages of psychiatric-mental health recovery
    · List strategies for psychiatric-mental health wellness

Recovery in mental health is a nonlinear process. According to Mental Health America's 2023 survey, over half of the
people in the United States who have mental health disorders, and a staggering 93.5 percent of people with
substance use problems, do not get treatment (para 2). People can get better, but they need to understand what
resources are available. Health-care providers can educate the individual, families, and communities about the
steps of recovery. The goal is to instill hope that with support, the client can maintain wellness throughout their
lifetime. Hope is the basis of recovery (SAMHSA, 2023).

Principles of the Recovery Model

Mental illness is treatable. Research reveals that people with mental illness can get better, and many recover
completely (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021a). The majority of individuals with mental illness
continue to function in their daily lives. The term recovery refers to a process of change through which individuals
improve their health and wellness, live a self-directed life, and strive to reach their full potential (Center for
Substance Abuse Treatment, 2014). Dimensions that support a life in recovery include the following:
28  1 · Foundations of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing

        · Health: Overcoming or managing one's disease(s), as well as living in a physically and emotionally healthy way
        · Home: Having a stable and safe place to live
        · Purpose: Participating in meaningful daily activities, such as a job, school, volunteerism, family caretaking, or

            creative endeavors, and the independence, income, and resources to participate in society
        · Community: Enjoying relationships and social networks that provide support, friendship, love, and hope

    There are ten principles of recovery and five stages of recovery. According to the American Psychological
    Association (2012), the ten principles of recovery are:

      1. Self-direction: The journey to recovery is determined by the person recovering.
      2. Individualized and person-centered: The chosen road to recovery should be tailored and customized to the

            client in terms of ability, background, inclinations, and assets.
      3. Empowerment: Clients participate in the decision-making process.
      4. Holistic: Recovery involves the entire person, including mind, body, spirit, and community.
      5. Nonlinear: Recovery is not linear and may entail setbacks. It involves continuing to grow and learning from the

            setbacks.
      6. Strengths-based: Recovery takes what clients are already good at and enhances it.
      7. Peer support: Support from others enriches recovery.
      8. Respect: Recovery requires acceptance by clients' communities, families, peers, and health-care providers.
      9. Responsibility: Clients must take ownership of their own recovery path.
    10. Hope: The drive to recover stems from hope of getting better and knowing that it is possible (p. 5).

    Additionally, participation in mutual aid groups can be one pathway to recovery. Such groups include twelve-step
    programs, like Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), Narcotics Anonymous (NA), or Gamblers Anonymous (GA), that provide
    support for addictions and compulsions. The twelve steps are guidelines for persons to acknowledge and surrender
    their addiction, and to draw strength from a higher power, as they personally conceptualize that to be.

    Hope
    Hope is the foundation of the recovery process. Hope in this context is the belief that one can overcome their
    challenges (SAMHSA, 2023). The nurse helps clients increase their sense of hope by looking beyond the current
    stressful situation and toward a healthier future. The nurse helps the client identify their "strengths, talents, coping
    abilities, resources and inherent values" (para 3). Hope is "the catalyst for change" (Laranjeira & Querido, 2022, p.
    2). By using a recovery-oriented approach, nurses create a feeling of hope even when the client feels hopeless
    (Dallum et al., 2015).

    Self-Determination, Self-Management, and Empowerment
    Recovery is centered around the client developing their own autonomy in making choices about treatment and
    resources used to achieve their self-directed goal (SAMHSA, 2012). Empowerment begins from the moment a
    person makes the decision to get treatment. With self-determination, a support system, and learning what feels
    right in terms of treatment options, a person's sense of empowerment grows. The adage "knowledge is power" is
    true in recovery. It is here that psychosocial rehabilitation comes into play; it helps individuals develop the social,

            CULTURAL CONTEXT

    Cultural Views of Drug Use in China

    Managed by the courts, compulsory detoxification centers in China have been criticized for human rights violations.
    However, community-based treatment and voluntary treatment with medical management also exist in the country.
    Yang and Giummarra (2021) propose evidence-based treatment while acknowledging the Chinese population size,
    history, and culture.

    Criminalization of drug use in China may be preventing incorporation of drug treatment into the health-care system
    (Yang & Giummarra, 2021).

Advocacy
Advocacy comes in two forms: for the client and for education. A nurse can advocate for the client's needs when
they are in too acute a condition to be able to make decisions for themselves. As the client begins to feel better, the
nurse steps back and begins to let the client advocate for themselves. One of the foundations of recovery-oriented
care is creating safe spaces for healing (Solomon, Sutton, & McKenna, 2021). The high numbers of people with
mental health and substance use problems who do not seek treatment attest to the fact that education is important.
Nurses can advocate for education in communities about the resources available to fight against substance misuse.

  CLINICAL JUDGMENT MEASUREMENT MODEL

  Generate Solutions: Advocating for Clients

  After completing a client assessment and determining a nursing diagnosis, the nurse must then generate
  solutions. These must be individualized interventions to address the problems the client is currently facing. The
  client must be involved in the decision-making process as much as possible in order to have the best chance at
  achieving the projected outcomes. For example, telling a client that they need to eat healthier foods and then
  removing certain foods that are culturally relevant to that client will likely not be a maintainable intervention. To
  make this intervention individualized, it might include advocating for their dietary needs, especially if the
  intervention is occurring in a facility treatment setting.

Five Stages of the Psychiatric-Mental Health Recovery Model

The five stages of recovery include starting treatment, mental illness education, making a change, finding new
meaning, and sticking with recovery (Georgetown Behavioral Hospital, 2023) (Figure 1.7). While each stage builds
on the prior one, it is important to remember that recovery itself is a nonlinear process. In the first stage, the person
realizes that they need help. During the second stage, the person starts gaining education about their illness and
coping skills that can be used during the recovery process. The third stage, making a change, refers to the changes
that a person needs to make in their lifestyle, friends, and environment in which they live in order to be able to
recover and maintain recovery. The fourth stage encourages trying new positive experiences, making new supports,
and finding joy in life. The final stage is planning what recovery is going to look like throughout life: treatment,
therapy, and medication are examples. Each of these stages helps the person learn about "self-care, determination,
and persistence" (para 10).

FIGURE 1.7 In this model, the five stages of recovery have a starting point and a future achievement goal. Stage five is the most difficult
and may require starting again at stage one. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

Acceptance
Learning to accept oneself is an important part of recovery. It helps people let go of the past and move forward
(Linney, 2022). Accepting that they have an illness helps people face mistakes made in the past and adopt a
mindset toward future problem-solving. Part of the process is understanding that recovery will have some rocky
spots, but with support people in place and the use of positive coping skills, it is possible to get through those tough
times.

Nurses and other health-care personnel must also practice acceptance of the clients for whom they are caring.
30  1 · Foundations of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing

    Realizing that the client is a human who comes with a history, individual needs, strengths, and values will improve
    the nurse-client relationship (Solomon, Sutton, & McKenna, 2021).

    Insight
    As the individual and family become more educated about mental illness and substance misuse (psychoeducation),
    they begin to gain insight into how their lives are affected by it. Being taught that there are peer support resources
    available in the community can be invaluable in making the individual feel less alone. Peer support services (see 6.3
    Peer Support) provide the individual with a sense of belonging and acceptance (Dell, Long, & Mancini, 2021).
    Listening to the experiences of the peer support people can help individuals build insight into their own illness and
    recovery. Family education helps family members to be more understanding, supportive, and can increase the family
    bond.

    Action
    One nursing intervention to help individuals take action is to get them involved in illness self-management (ISM).
    Such programs are meant to help the individual design their recovery in a way that works best for them in their daily
    lives. Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP) is one of the most often suggested ISMs due to the way it "enhances
    recovery, self-advocacy, and hope" (Petros, & Solomon, 2021, p. 631). WRAP is led by a trained peer support person
    and usually consists of a small group that meets over eight to twelve sessions. Instilling hope is the basis for this
    ISM. Over the course of the program, participants learn how to enhance or maintain their wellness through self-
    reflecting, being proactive, recognizing triggers, and setting up plans for crisis intervention (Petros & Solomon,
    2021).

    Self-Esteem
    Self-esteem has three parts: (1) the positive and negative thoughts people have about themselves, (2) how people
    rate their self-worth, and (3) evaluating their own abilities and personal characteristics (Hasani, Aung, &
    Mirghafourvand, 2021). Low self-esteem is associated with higher rates of depressive symptoms. On the other
    hand, if a person has a high level of self-esteem, they are more likely to be able to manage stressful events
    successfully.

    The inclusion of self-esteem in Maslow's hierarchy of needs supports the importance of fulfilling this need in one's
    life (Family Addiction Specialist, n.d.). The recovery process helps individuals increase their self-esteem as they
    begin to rebuild relationships, jobs, and their health.

    Healing
    Healing is not immediate. It takes time, patience, and education. The medical model for mental health focuses on
    biology while recovery-oriented mental health focuses on holistic healing (Chisholm & Petrakas, 2021). Medication
    management can be a viable part of the healing process for people with severe mental illness (SMI) as it can
    decrease symptoms and help them feel better (Jessell & Stanhope, 2022). Collaboration between the client and the
    prescriber ensures the client's autonomy in discussing medication options, side effects, and contributions toward
    the person's healing. Healing is not a cure, but is a chance to live a better life than they did before they recognized
    their illness and entered into recovery. The recovery process involves the client and their families. The hope is that
    with education about the illness, family members, too, can heal, thus improving perceptions they may have
    developed about the illness and their loved one (Galimidi, & Shamai, 2022).

    Meaning
    Finding meaning in life provides individuals protection from stressful situations by helping them to effectively cope
    and move beyond that challenge (Prakash et al., 2020). Going through the lows of addiction or severe mental illness
    is sometimes the catalyst for making a positive change (Family Addiction Specialist, n.d.). It is often at the lowest
    point that an individual finds their purpose to move forward. The individual finds meaning from realizing that they
    need to make positive changes in their lives.

    Strategies for Psychiatric-Mental Health Wellness

    Adopting healthier life choices is the most important factor in recovery and working toward/maintaining psychiatric-
    mental health wellness. Prakash et al. (2020) suggest that the difference in mental illness and mental wellness is
    that in illness the focus is on management of the illness while wellness focuses on all the aspects in life that can
    help people live and participate in the world around them. Some wellness strategies include getting good sleep;

eating a diet that includes a balance of fruits, vegetables, lean meats, fish, and whole grains; limiting caffeine use;
exercising three to five days per week for forty-five minutes; and maintaining connections to others.

        PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

What Is Psychosocial Rehabilitation?

Psychosocial rehabilitation helps individuals develop the skills to live happily with the smallest amount of
professional intervention manageable. Psychosocial rehabilitation uses two strategies: coping skills to empower the
client to more successfully handle stressful situations and resource development to reduce future stressors.
Treatments and resources vary case to case but may include medication management, psychological support,
family counseling, vocational and independent living training, housing, job coaching, educational assistance, and
social support.

Focus on the Positive
Focusing on the positive, despite what may seem like insurmountable obstacles, changes one's perspective. The
mindset of always looking at the negative aspects of life can only have a poor effect on one's mental health and hope
for recovery. Encouraging a focus on the positive is one of the interventions that nurses can offer to individuals or as
a part of therapeutic group work.

Practice Gratitude
Practicing gratitude is embraced by twelve-step programs and recovery specialists and can be an intervention
implemented by psychiatric nurses. Encouraging clients to keep a gratitude journal allows them to sit down at the
end of the day and reflect on the things for which they are grateful that day. This changes the focus to positive
events, no matter how insignificant they may seem and helps the client realize that even when everything seems
dismal, there are things to be thankful for in life.

Connect with Others
Learning to have healthy relationships means understanding that sometimes relationships require boundaries in
order to stay healthy. When a person is actively using substances or in the midst of severe mental illness, they often
make bad choices about the people with whom they connect socially. These connections can negatively affect their
mental health. Healthy relationships offer support by increasing one's sense of well-being (Family Addiction
Specialist, 2023). Though it may be a difficult decision to cut ties with people and places, it is a necessary part of
staying healthy in recovery. As individuals work on their recovery, they begin to learn that in order to become a
healthier version of themselves, they need to find and make new friends.

Maintain Physical Health
Physical health and mental health are often connected. Many people have co-occurring diagnoses. For instance,
diabetes and depression often co-occur. Teaching clients the importance of maintaining their physical health is just
as important as watching for signs and symptoms of mental illness. Again, a holistic approach to the client's health
means that mind, body, and spirit are all connected. There are certain things nurses can teach their clients about
maintaining better physical health. These include smoking cessation, recovery from substance misuse, improving
their diet and exercise routines, and getting plenty of sleep.

In Kesavayuth, Shangkhum, and Zikos (2022), several studies showed connections between health and certain
health factors. One study from Nova Scotia reported a connection between having depression and developing
coronary artery disease. This connection is further supported by research showing that people with higher levels of
physical health are also more likely to have better mental health.

    1.5 Integration of Research- and Evidence-Based Standards

    LEARNING OBJECTIVES
    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Identify credible sources of research evidence for psychiatric-mental health nursing
        · Apply concepts of evidence-based practice (EBP) to psychiatric-mental health nursing
        · Locate evidence on representation and acceptance of mental health in the community

    The foundation of any effective nursing practice is the use of evidence-based practice in caring for clients. Research
    completed by nurses contributes to the wealth of knowledge that forms evidence-based practice. Basing nursing
    practice on evidence leads to the most positive client outcomes.

    Credible Sources and Types of Research

    Throughout the nursing process, it is important to be sure to use evidence-based practice (EBP). The term evidence-
    based practice refers to:

          A process used to review, analyze, and translate the latest scientific evidence with the goal of quickly
          incorporating the best available research, along with clinical experience and client preference, into clinical
          practice, so nurses can make informed client-care decisions (John Hopkins Medicine, 2023, para 1).

    In this description, review means locate and study, analyze means determine the meaning, and translate means to
    move the evidence into practice.

    Starting with a professional database is best to locate credible sources. Many databases require a subscription in
    order to access them. If the nurse works at a hospital or a university, then there is likely access to these sources.
    Popular databases include Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) found within EBSCO
    (subscription needed), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) (available for free), MEDLINE (free
    online source), ERIC (provides links to sources available for free), PsychINFO (accessed through a vendor, such as
    OVID), and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (contains free access to reviews).

    The term empirical research refers to scholarly work from actual observation and measurement of experience, in
    contrast to theory. Empirical research is primary research, which means the authors of the study conducted the
    investigation. There are two basic types of research that fall under empirical research: qualitative and quantitative.
    Qualitative research pulls data from the subjective responses of the participants. It asks the questions of who, what,
    where, when, and how. Its goal is to determine how an individual or community feels about and is affected by a
    particular topic. Quantitative research deals with numbers and statistical data (McCusker & Gunaydin, 2015). Some
    studies combine aspects of qualitative and quantitative research called mixed method. The qualitative data can
    provide client insight into the statistical results from the quantitative data. Before selecting a research study for
    evidence-based practice, the nurse must determine which type best fits the problem being investigated.

    Applying EBP to Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing

    Application of evidence-based practice (EBP) concepts to psychiatric-mental health nursing begins with definitions.
    In both the clinical and research settings, defining the question requires delineating a particular problem that has
    been identified by the nurse (Bermudez, 2021). In the research sector, the question arises after performing a
    thorough literature review and finding treatment gaps. In the clinical setting, the nurse develops the question first
    and then performs a literature review. Good research questions can be written using the FINER technique: "feasible,
    interesting, novel, ethical, and relevant" (Bermudez, 2021, p. 71).

    Search Terms and Web Addresses
    Effectively gathering data depends upon the search terms used. When choosing keywords, the focus should be on
    the main words or phrases that describe the research topic (American Psychological Association, 2020). For
    example, if a nurse is searching for information on barriers to care, they might use the words barriers to care,
    access, mental health care, medical care, and community health resources. As the search continues, the nurse can
    hone in on more terms based on what comes up in the search. Sometimes a good article will contain references that
    the nurse can access to find additional information.

    Beyond using a database to locate professional journals and peer-reviewed articles, nurses can perform a general

internet search. Extensions at the end of website names will help the nurse locate good sources. The most common
extension is .com. This delegation is for businesses and news. Nonprofit organizations use .org. Higher education,
such as colleges and universities, will have .edu. Government websites will use .gov. Military sites use .mil. With all
sites, it is best to assess the source and the information for accuracy and bias before deciding to use it as a basis for
research (Central Michigan Libraries, 2022).

Levels of Evidence
The levels of research evidence are organized below as lower-level evidence or higher-level evidence. This can be a
guide for nurses who are beginners working on research and a reminder for more experienced nurses. Information
across the levels can be combined to give a realistic view of the topic. These levels correspond to the types of items
a nurse might find when conducting a literature review Table 1.3.

Lower-level Sources of Research Evidence:                     Higher-level Sources of Research Evidence:

Evidence from a cohort study, observational, nonexperimental  Systematic review/meta-analysis of RCTs
                                                              (highest level)

  Non-research source; expert opinion (lowest level)
  (Note: Expert opinion is valid data, especially in the PMH
  nursing specialty, though this level of evidence should be
  made clear in the research report.)

TABLE 1.3 Levels of Evidence

Evidence-Based Practice in Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing
It is vital for nurses to protect and promote the mental well-being of all individuals and address the needs of
individuals with diagnosed mental disorders (World Health Organization, 2018). The World Health Organization
(WHO) published the Mental Health Intervention Guide for nurses and primary health-care providers. It provides
evidence-based guidance and tools for assessing and managing priority mental health and substance use disorders
using clinical decision-making protocols. Essential principles for providing mental health care include promoting
respect and dignity for the individuals seeking care; using effective communication skills to ensure care is
nonjudgmental, nonstigmatizing, and supportive; and conducting comprehensive assessments (mhGAP
Intervention Guide, 2016). Nurses can provide this care using the three components of EBP: best available research,
tapping into client preferences, and applying their own expertise.

Best Available Research
Nurses may wonder, "How do I know what evidence-based nursing interventions to include in the nursing care plan
regarding mental health care?" Finding the best available research may seem daunting to the new nurse, but it is as
simple as consulting a current, evidence-based nursing care planning resource when planning nursing interventions
individualized to each client's needs. There are several sources nurses can reference to select nursing interventions.
Many agencies have care planning tools and references included in the electronic health record that are easily
documented in the client chart. Additionally, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
(SAMHSA) maintains an evidence-based resource center (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration, n.d.).

Client Preferences
Within the evidence-based practice formula is the process of evaluating how well the new evidence works when
applied to individual clients in a clinical setting. In other words, how do the evidence and the client's preferences
34  1 · Foundations of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing

    connect? It is important for clinicians to realize that although the evidence may point toward making a change, the
    client's preferences may not. What modifications need to be made so that the new information is applicable to the
    client and accords with the client's preferences? As with any nursing-client interaction, the goal is to reach the best
    client outcomes.

    Nursing Expertise
    There are different levels of mental health nursing expertise based on degree and licensing. The bachelor's level
    nurse learns about evidence-based practice (EBP) through their own use of PICOT (Population/Problem,
    Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, and Time) based projects, which translate their research into practice (Grys,
    2022). According to Grys (2022), the PICOT format provides focus to the literature search and is key to clinical
    application of evidence.

    Nurses prepared at the doctoral levels may perform actual research that translates into new approaches and
    changes to the knowledge base (Grys, 2022), as may those with a master of science in nursing (MSN). Nurses may
    become experienced at using the quality improvement (QI) process through the requirements of their degree
    program (Grys, 2022), or in the workplace. As the name implies, QI involves looking at a problem; utilizing data,
    decision-making tools, and testing; and making an improvement--this then becomes the new evidence-based
    practice (QSEN Institute, 2022). The results of QI and EBP research are used specifically at the client care level of
    practice.

    Define a Clinical Question in PMH Nursing
    As stated, professional databases and scholarly resources are available with evidence to answer clinical questions.
    Steps in the process are:

        · Nursing recognition of a problem and nursing inquiry
              What contributes to client readmissions? Do they forget to pick up their medication, or miss their clinic
                  appointments? Would it help for us to call and remind them?

        · Phrase the inquiry as a clinical question
              For discharged clients, would follow-up phone calls result in higher percentage of adherence to post-
                  hospital care?

        · Format the question as PICOT
              P=discharged clients
              I=follow-up phone call within twenty-four hours to check on medications and clinic appointments
              C=no phone call
              O=readmissions reduced by 25 percent
              T=over six months

        · Utilize the question and the PICOT to identify key search terms
              Follow-up phone calls; Readmissions

        · Enter the terms in the Search field of the database
              On CINAHL, enter in the Search fields - nurse follow-up phone call AND reduce readmissions
              Select from the resulting list of articles

    Evaluating Client Outcomes
    After application of the EBP model, the nurse evaluates how the interventions worked for the client. At this time,
    adjustments can be made to the intervention to make the treatment plan most applicable to the individual. Again,
    the goal of the entire process is for the client to have the best possible outcomes based on the best evidence-based
    practice for their situation.

            LINK TO LEARNING

    Often, an evidence-based practice committee responds to client care questions that come up; members are
    assigned parts of the research process and share all of the information in order to make an informed decision. They
    can then base interventions on that new information, try them with the client, and evaluate outcomes for
    applicability and success. Johns Hopkins Nursing's Center for Nursing Inquiry provides an Inquiry Toolkit

Research Evidence on Representation and Acceptance of Mental Health in the Community

Mental health practitioners, including psychiatrists, social workers, nurses, clinical psychologists, and therapists, are
in a position to increase the representation and acceptance of mental health in the community. These professionals
work with people and their mental health on a daily basis. Their job experiences, intellectual knowledge, research,
and involvement in policy change make them "practical experts" (Morant 2006, p. 819) in mental health care.

Morant (2006) reminds us that over the last fifty years, much has changed in the way that society views mental
health, with the move from institutional to community care of mental illness. A review of research in Morant's article
reveals that the differences in care provided can be partly attributed to age and location of the practitioner. Older
practitioners were trained in the years of institutionalized clients so it may be difficult for them to transition to
today's treatment. Comparisons of the way that different communities represent and accept mental health can be
seen across the globe. In France, long-term therapy and lack of community care are the norm, whereas in England,
short-term therapy and lack of financial resources is more prominent. In the United States, it is evident that more
research is needed in the area of mental health due to the increase in symptoms since the COVID-19 pandemic. The
White House Report on Mental Health Research Priorities (2023) details the need for more U.S. research aimed at
inequities, especially in areas with poorer mental health outcomes. This would include research to determine ways
to create more community-based service areas.

Access to Care: Gaps in the System
Research conducted by the White House (2023) has identified several system gaps. The first is the need for better
coordination of mental health and substance use services. The use of "wraparound services" (p. 14) for the acutely
mentally ill client is effective because it involves engaging a multiple disciplinary approach to care. This includes
training providers to be proficient in recognizing the signs and symptoms of mental illness and substance use
disorder. This approach would also focus on the physical effects of substance use disorder across the life span.

The next big system gap relates to adolescents. Research has revealed a connection between mental illness and use
of social media, particularly in the context of body image. More research is needed to determine ways that social
media could be used to positively impact mental health of both individuals and communities. School systems have
potential to create mental health teaching programs that would address the needs of children from elementary
school through college, so there is a need for research on how to implement and what to include in such programs.

Societal View
Although stigma still exists surrounding mental health, there are more programs and resources available to educate
the public. Through these efforts, it is becoming more widely accepted that prevention and early symptom
recognition have positive effects on community mental health. Holt and DeTore (2021) share that the most
promising preventive mental health efforts have been school-based. One such program is the Sandy Hook Promise
(2023), which was developed after the December 2012 shootings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in
Newtown, Connecticut. This important program teaches young people to know the signs of potential gun violence.

Some workplaces have Employee Assistance Programs, which provide access to facilities providing time-limited free
mental health services. Public service announcements on TV, radio, and social media provide information and
resources to help reduce depression, anxiety, and suicidality. All of these resources help to increase general
knowledge, decrease stigma, and promote a more positive societal view of mental health.

36 1 · Summary

Summary

1.1 Mental Health and Mental Illness

Nurses working in all settings must understand the difference between mental health and mental illness. Nurses will
come across clients in various stages of the mental health continuum in every setting, age group, and community.
Gathering both subjective and objective data during the nursing assessments is an important part of nursing
practice. A nurse uses therapeutic communication to ask questions and gather subjective data about how the client
is feeling in order to determine the effectiveness of the treatment plan. Psychiatric nurses not only assess and
provide care for the client's health-care needs, but are also involved in education, administration, and research.
Developing therapeutic nurse-client relationships is a core element of the scope of the psychiatric-mental health
nursing practice.

1.2 Risk and Protective Factors of Mental Health

Familiarity with the many risk and protective factors for mental illness is an important part of the nursing process in
caring for individuals with potential or diagnosed mental health disorders. While some risk and protective factors
are biological and/or genetic, others are caused by psychological and external circumstances and characteristics,
such as level of self-esteem, resilience, healthy behaviors, level of activity, social support system, religious/cultural
beliefs, substance use, childhood development, and chronic illness.

Nursing assessments must include the use of standardized tools to determine risks and strengths in each client. The
nurse-client therapeutic relationship should feature active listening while gathering client data, and the use of
critical thinking in order to piece together an appropriate treatment plan.

1.3 Mental Health Stigma

Stigma is still pervasive in attitudes surrounding those with mental illness. In fact, nearly two-thirds of people with
diagnosable mental health disorders do not seek treatment due to the stigma of mental illness (Hegner, 2000). Self-
stigma, public stigma, and institutional stigma each affect people in the way they seek treatment and look at
themselves in relation to the world around them and influence their ability to function on a daily basis. Prejudice and
discrimination can cause barriers to accessing health care, finding safe and affordable living, getting a job,
maintaining social relationships, and feeling like a contributing part of society.

Nurses can model acceptance in the care they provide. They can also educate individuals, families, caregivers, and
communities about the detrimental effects of stigma and ways to increase positive awareness. Nurses should also
take the time to perform self-care because without taking care of themselves, they will not be able to provide the
best care for others.

1.4 Mental Health Recovery and Wellness

Recovery is an overarching term that covers both physical and mental health. It is continuous but nonlinear in
nature. The steps in the recovery process assist the client in making choices to determine their own life course.
Acceptance, hope, insight, and taking action have a positive effect on increasing one's self-esteem. The higher the

and focus on the positives all help to maintain wellness through and beyond the recovery journey.

1.5 Integration of Research- and Evidence-Based Standards

Research is an important nursing role and tool that provides the foundation for evidence-based practice. The main
types of empirical research performed are qualitative, quantitative, and sometimes a mixed method. It is imperative
to use credible databases and websites to gather the information for a literature search based upon the evidence
pyramid. Although evidence-based practice is the basis of good nursing practice, the nurse must evaluate how
evidence-based interventions work with specific clients. If the evidence is not applicable to the client being served,
it will diminish the chance of a positive outcome. There are several levels of nursing expertise and each one takes on
a different kind of research--PICOT, QI, and new research--that lends knowledge to evidence-based practice.

What Should the Nurse Do?

    1. An experienced psychiatric RN is caring for a 60-year-old male client without a home who just arrived on a
        hospital behavioral health unit. The nurse has asked the client to describe in his own words his reason for
        seeking care. The client has shared that he is often bullied on the streets due to his unkempt appearance. The
        nurse notes that in addition to body odor, the client smells of alcohol and urine. The client relates that he
        wasn't always homeless; he used to have a good job, a house, and was married. He lost his job due to a layoff,
        and then everything else seemed to fall apart. His wife left him after the bank took the house when he could
        no longer make the payments. He did not have any close friends or family who he could stay with long-term.
        He found that he quickly wore out his welcome of sleeping on their couches. He tells the nurse he began
        drinking alcohol to cope with his losses. He cannot give the nurse an exact number of drinks that he takes per
        day.
        What additional aspects of the psychosocial assessment should the nurse explore?

Competency-Based Assessments

    1. Look at the mental health continuum and give examples for each level of functioning.

    2. View the video Why Students Should Have Mental Health Days (https://openstax.org/r/77mentalhealthdays).
        Write two paragraphs connecting this video's main focus on overall health (that includes taking time to
        protect your own mental health) to what you could teach a client about taking care of their mental health.

    3. Search the internet and find two local resources that you could share with a client who needs a safe place to
        receive mental health care.

INTRODUCTION Clinical professions are evidence-based and founded in theory. The professional specialty of
psychiatric-mental health (PMH) nursing addresses brain-based behaviors. Therefore, it seeks theoretical
foundations in biological and psychosocial theories. Psychiatric-mental health nursing follows established
guidelines based upon the client's state of health. Multiple theories have been developed to account for how the
client comes to be in that state. Nurses must understand the different theoretical concepts and interventions to
apply in care of the client experiencing mental health alterations. Comprehension of classic and established theories
and therapies relevant to psychiatric-mental health nursing provide a foundation for professional nursing practice.
Further, this understanding develops the nurse's ability to plan client care that is person-centered. Nurses also
benefit from self-awareness, which can come with understanding the impact of psychosocial factors on health,
illness, and recovery.

    2.1 Psychoanalytic Theories and Therapies

    LEARNING OBJECTIVES
    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Define psychoanalytic theories and therapies
        · Identify nursing applications of psychoanalytic theories and therapies

    Dr. Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) was the founder of psychoanalysis and noted for his theory that provides
    explanation of mental health, associated influences, and treatments (Mcleod, 2024b). Freud's work on the ego
    defense mechanisms contributed significantly to the nurse's work in therapeutic communication with clients.

    Definitions

    Freud's psychoanalytic theory reaches into several areas of mental health and illness. Each area influences the
    client's experience and leads the practitioner to investigate or assess the areas where distress originates, such as
    components of the personality and levels of consciousness. The nurse's understanding of personality development
    can bring insight to nursing approaches and provide the basis for person-centered care.

    Personality Development and Levels of Consciousness
    Freud theorized that personality develops between the first and fifth years of life and believed that the person's
    manner of being was set by this age. Freud thought the personality was controlled by the mind and that the mind
    had a structure that included three elements: the id, the ego, and the superego. Each element has a specific
    function.

    Freud often used the description of an iceberg to visualize the mind; only a tenth of the mind is conscious, while the
    other 90 percent of the mind is unconscious. The awareness of one's own existence, sensations, thoughts, and
    surroundings is consciousness. It is the part of the mind comprising psychic material of which the individual is
    aware. Whereas, unconsciousness is all the repressed memories, thoughts, and unacceptable feelings a person
    may have. The unconscious cannot be recalled without a trained therapist. Between these areas, Freud
    conceptualized the preconscious mind where thoughts and feelings are available to the conscious mind though not
    currently being applied (Mcleod, 2024b).

    Id
    The id is the part of the personality that is the most primitive and exists in infants. The id drives the instincts,
    reflexes, and needs. It lacks logic and cannot solve problems. It is often manifested by instinctive behaviors that all
    humans have to communicate and relieve stress and discomfort. Examples are crying, gagging, laughing, and
    coughing. The id strives to have all needs in check or to reach a sense of pleasure. Once the needs are met, the id-
    driven behaviors cease. There are other tensions or stresses that cannot be satisfied by these instinctive measures,
    such as anxiety. At the point of personality development, around the age of two, the ego takes over (Erwin, 2002).

    Ego
    The ego is both physiological and psychological and maturity often emerges around the fourth or fifth year of
    development. The ego is the part of the personality that experiences, reacts to, and negotiates with the outside
    world and thus mediates between the primitive drives of the id and the demands of the social and physical
    environment. Freud labeled this process that the ego goes through reality testing, meaning that it satisfies the id
    through manners that are appropriate and it weighs the positives and negatives of an id demand before reacting.

    When the id surfaces that a person is hungry, for example, and wants to be fed to satisfaction, their ego enters and
    staves off the id with delayed gratification. The ego then synchronizes the id, reality, and the superego to manifest
    behaviors that are expressive. The ego therefore negotiates with the id to please the superego and is a learned
    component of the personality that contributes social expectations to meeting demands of reality.

    Superego
    The superego is the moral compass for the personality, the conscience of the person. The superego is the part of the
    personality representing the conscience, formed in early life by internalization of the standards of parents and other
    models of behavior. It echoes the good and bad learned from the primary caregiver from birth on. The problem with
    the superego is that it projects the ideal, not the realistic, striving for perfection in modeling learned responses. If a
    person has a strong superego, they may exhibit this through perfectionistic tendencies by being critical of

superego relate to each other.

unconscious mind. The ego and superego exist in both the conscious and unconscious areas of the mind. (modification of work from

the learned morality of the superego. (modification of work from Psychology, 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC

Another area of Freud's theory is the psychosexual stages of development, which proposes that childhood
experiences shape the adult personality and can underlie mental health problems. Freud created these stages and
believed every human developed through these stages. It is important to understand these stages as nurses care for
children and adults to assess development. The stages of psychosexual development are summarized in Table 2.1.

    Psychoanalytic Theories Related to Stress Response
    In Freudian theory, a defense mechanism--a thought, words, or a behavior prompted by the unconscious
    mind--surface when demands of reality cannot be met by the person. Defense mechanisms are essentially stress
    responses. In the short-term, defense mechanisms reduce anxiety and provide a buffer to stressful situations. If
    relied upon longer term, however, defense mechanisms can result in ineffective coping and contribute to mental
    illness (Ito & Matsushima, 2017).

    Freud believed that all defense mechanisms were rooted in anxiety. The environments in which all humans live have
    stressors that threaten, create pain, or create tension. The defense mechanism seeks to decrease the threat, stress,
    pain, or tension. Defense mechanisms like denial or distortion of reality keep reality less threatening. While some
    defense mechanisms are necessary to live in a healthy emotional manner, too many can cause problems with
    healthy adjustments and personal growth. Table 2.2 summarizes common ego defense mechanisms.

Two other areas of Freud's psychoanalytic theory that are helpful to nursing are the concepts of transference and
countertransference. An unconscious feeling the client has toward another (such as a health-care worker) that is
originally based on a childhood experience with an important person in their life is transference. For example, the
nurse's mannerisms may prompt unconscious recall for the client of positive or negative experiences from a past
relationship, which influences the client's response to the nurse. In nursing practice, the nurse should consider the
concept of transference when recognizing and analyzing cues during client interaction. Whereas
countertransference is the unconscious feeling the health-care worker has toward the client. If the client reminds
the health-care worker negatively of someone they know, this can cause a problem with therapeutic communication
and relationship. The nurse may also feel protective or affectionate toward the client, based on unconscious feelings
from a past relationship. Feedback from nursing peers and mentors is very important, as is the nurse's need for self-
reflection and supervisory assistance so that the therapeutic relationship remains strong and client care is optimal.
In all nurse-client interactions, nurses should strive to avoid personalizing clients' behaviors and remarks.

Nursing Application of Psychoanalytic Theories

Because Freud's theory discusses the complex human personality and how it is influenced by past events, it is
helpful in nursing practice. It can provide a more in-depth comprehension of client behavior, emotions, development
throughout stages of life, and motivations, which will improve the therapeutic relationship and enhance provision of
care. By delving into unconscious processes, nurses are able to be more at one with clients, better understand their
nonverbal behaviors, and clue into foundational mental health challenges. The theory reinforces the notion that
humans and their environments are intermingled and that nurses should look at their clients in that broader context.
The theory also emphasizes the need for focused listening, which can help nurses recognize the use of defense
mechanisms as cues to the client's feelings. The nurse can then reflect on what the client is saying to help them
process their thoughts and emotions. Nurses also benefit from awareness of transference and countertransference
in their interactions with clients, which improves nursing practice.

2.2 Interpersonal Theories and Therapies

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Define interpersonal theories and therapies
    · Identify nursing application of interpersonal theories and therapies

Interpersonal theory, first described by Harry Stack Sullivan (1892-1949), holds that human behaviors can be
explained through relationships with others. Influences from these relationships shape personality, ability to cope
with stressors, and, ultimately, survival. Interpersonal theory is substantiated by data obtained through observation
and investigation.

These theories enable the nurse to develop person-centered care, become aware of reasons behind client
responses, interpret behaviors, avoid judgment, and, ultimately, teach clients self-awareness. This section will
explore interpersonal theories of Harry Stack Sullivan, Hildegard Peplau, and Erik Erikson.

Definitions

Interpersonal theories posit that personality development and mental health depend upon relationships between
people. With the therapeutic relationship between nurse and client being so foundational to nursing practice, these
theories resonate when nurses interact with clients. In fact, many interventions have been created based on
interpersonal theory. More specifically, interpersonal theories focus on how to assess, interact, and intervene with
clients who may be struggling to communicate when dealing with mental health issues.

Interpersonal theory was originally created by Harry Stack Sullivan. He developed a theory founded on the belief
that interpersonal interaction is the basis for the person's behaviors and sense of self. The main mental health
problem identified by Sullivan was anxiety. He believed that human anxiety was fueled by the need for human
interaction. He coined the term significant other, as the main person, or a parent, from which humans have their
first interpersonal interaction. He believed that this relationship was crucial for healthy emotional development.

Hildegard Peplau (1909-1999) was influenced by Sullivan's interpersonal theory and extended it to nursing
practice, thereby developing the first systematic theoretical framework for psychiatric nursing in her book,
52  2 · Fundamentals of Theories and Therapies

    Interpersonal Relations in Nursing (1952). Peplau was the first to create and define the nurse's interpersonal
    relationship with the client as the foundation for nursing practice. She changed the mindset of nursing practice from
    what nurses do to clients to what they do with clients. Her theory speaks to helping clients make positive changes in
    their health care and wellness through education. She believed that illness presents an opportunity for learning,
    growth, and coping, and that self-awareness/reflection and the environment are keys. The nurse-client
    relationship is broken down in stages in her theory: pre-orientation, orientation, working, and mutual termination.
    The nurse and client move through these phases in an interwoven manner over time during which the nurse
    encourages the client's process of thoughts and feelings. The client's self-awareness is increased during these
    interactions (Hagerty et al., 2017).

    Erik Erikson (1902-1994) was an American psychoanalyst and follower of Freud's theories. Erikson believed that a
    human's personality is developed throughout their life span and created a developmental model to reflect this.
    Erikson's theory described eight stages of human development, conflicts through which people negotiate individual
    needs against needs and demands of society in order to grow. Many of the stages involve interpersonal relations.
    Erikson's work is referenced by other studies of human development in mental health, aging, and child development
    (Orenstein, 2022). For example, according to Orenstein (2022), the recovery stage of mental illness involves trusting
    the possibility of regaining health; therefore, this represents a resolution of Erikson's stage of trust versus mistrust.

    Nursing Application of Interpersonal Theories

    Peplau's most lauded contribution to nursing is the application of interpersonal theory to anxiety. She described
    levels of anxiety as mild, moderate, severe, and panic on perception of learning (Table 2.3). She promoted and
    taught different strategies to lower anxiety to a level where the client could learn and cope with life's stresses.

    TABLE 2.3 Peplau's Levels of Anxiety

    Peplau also defined the nurse-client relationship as the connection between the professional nurse and those
    seeking health services (Hagerty et al., 2017). This connection is accomplished through application of the
    therapeutic relationship, which contains specific phases. The phases of this relationship are denoted in Figure 2.4.

These phases are interwoven and overlap as the client and nurse develop rapport, which is the process during
which the nurse creates an atmosphere of safety, trust, and understanding. During this process, the nurse should
use the attributes of empathy, transparency, and positive regard. The nurse assists the client with problem-solving
in a practical, emotional, and situational manner. When used in a nursing context, empathy involves the nurse
placing themselves in the client's shoes, through compassion, understanding, and identification. The interpersonal
process is a process where the nurse and client communicate to develop an understanding of their roles and
responsibilities in the therapeutic relationship. This is often during the orientation phase of the nurse-client
relationship.

Erik Erikson's developmental theory has implications for nursing practice and development of the therapeutic
relationship as well. Nurses use this theory, for instance, during the assessment of the client. Review of the client's
behavioral patterns can help identify age-appropriate, or delayed, development of interpersonal skills. Delays can
hinder normal development and result in a diminished sense of self. Understanding the stages of emotional
development of the client allows the nurse to interact with and assess the client in the most age-appropriate
manner. Table 2.4 lists Erikson's stages of development.

    2.3 Cognitive Theories and Therapies

    LEARNING OBJECTIVES
    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Define behavioral and cognitive behavioral theories and therapies
        · Identify nursing application of behavioral and cognitive behavioral theories and therapies

    Behavioral theory states that human responses can be retrained. Behavior therapies, in general, provide techniques
    for people to learn how to control or modify negative behaviors. Primary behavior therapy seeks to change the
    person's responses to the environment, usually with reward systems.

    Cognitive behavioral theory, one major type of behavioral therapy commonly practiced today, is based on the belief
    that human thinking drives human behaviors. Cognitive therapy brings behavioral change through identification of
    negative emotions and reframing the personal script. Examples of this technique include modeling, cognitive,
    exposure, and acceptance or commitment therapy. The goal for behavioral techniques is to modify or change
    negative emotions or anger-based behavior associated with identified situations. Cognitive behavioral techniques
    can assist the person to be more effective at managing or coping with negative emotions (Horiuchi et al., 2018).

    Definitions

    The form of psychotherapy that is used to change the way a person feels about or perceives an experience is called
    cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). It is effective for a range of problems, including depression, anxiety disorders,
    alcohol and drug use problems, marital conflict, eating disorders, and severe mental illness. CBT helps a person to
    recognize distorted/negative thinking with the goal of changing thoughts and behaviors to respond to changes in a
    more positive manner. Numerous research studies suggest that CBT leads to significant improvement in functioning
    and quality of life. Studies show that CBT has been demonstrated to be as effective as, or more effective than, other
    forms of psychological therapy or psychiatric medications (American Psychological Association, 2017).

    CBT treatment usually involves efforts to change behavioral patterns. Strategies to achieve these goals might
    include facing one's fears instead of avoiding them, using role-play to prepare for potentially problematic
    interactions with others, and learning to calm one's mind and relax one's body. CBT aims to help develop skills to
    manage feelings in healthy ways. Through in-session exercises and "homework" between sessions, people develop
    coping skills, whereby they learn ways to change their own thinking and behavior, ultimately changing how they feel.
    For example, through journaling and reflection on feelings versus behaviors, a client will be developing coping
    strategies to employ the next time they are exposed to the same situation. CBT clinicians focus on current
    situations, thought patterns, and behaviors rather than past events. A certain amount of information about one's
    history is needed, but the focus is primarily on developing more effective ways of coping with life moving forward.

            LINK TO LEARNING

    This fact sheet describes the core principles of CBT (https://openstax.org/r/77CBT) and outlines treatment
    strategies.

    Essential Elements of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
    CBT is based on the principle that how a person perceives life experiences or interprets events determines how they
    will feel, behave, or respond. The essential function of CBT is to assist in changing the way a person thinks or
    perceives an experience to improve the emotion or behavior associated with the event.

    CBT has three main core principles, shown in Table 2.5. One principle is that emotional upsets become thoughts
    that obstruct ways of analyzing situations. A second principle is that emotional upsets are learned behaviors or
    patterns of thinking. A third principle is that one's quality of life can be enhanced through better ways of coping with
    emotions. Treatment with CBT utilizes the influential relationships between these three principles and assists the
    person to understand their own way of thinking.

TABLE 2.5 Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Strategies (Acha, 2017)

Specific techniques taught to manage one's thoughts and emotions include mindfulness-based cognitive therapy
(MBCT), where behavioral therapy is combined with meditation, and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), which
focuses on problem-solving skills and the ability to find and seek acceptance of negative emotions while tolerating
stressors. MBCT has been effective in helping clients cope with anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorders, while
DBT has proven effective in helping clients cope with personality disorders, substance misuse, and eating disorders
(Good Therapy, 2018).

        PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Milieu Therapy

The concept of a therapeutic community is a critical component in mental health care, particularly with behavioral
therapy. A therapeutic, controlled, and supportive environment that provides safety and structure while one seeks
treatment and works on changing negative behavior is called a milieu. The origin of the word milieu is French for
middle place, the safest place in a group, a sanctuary.

Milieu therapy permits health-care clinicians to assess the client while they are exposed to different relationships
and behaviors. Allowing clients to function within a milieu community provides a sense of civility, belonging, and
accountability. The controlled environment provides consistent routine, which fosters predictability and trust. This
allows the client to learn how to respond to stressors through staff and community member feedback and modeled
behavior. As described by Belsiyal et al. (2022), the goals of milieu therapy are behavior change through the client's
autonomy and supported decision-making, therapeutic communication directed toward increasing the client's self-
esteem, and overall respect practiced by all participants.

Another CBT-based technique is called acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), which relies on positive
reinforcement (providing a reward for desired behavior, i.e., praise or material incentive) and counterconditioning.
Counterconditioning means becoming deconditioned to the negative stimulus. This can be accomplished through
brief exposures while being supported until tolerance is built, or by learning a relaxation technique to mitigate the
stress of the exposure. ACT has been shown to help people cope with anxiety, stress, psychosis, OCD, substance
use, eating disorders, and depression (Glasofer, 2024).

        CLINICAL SAFETY AND PROCEDURES (QSEN)

QSEN Competency: Teamwork and Collaboration

The role of the nurse in caring for clients experiencing emotional stressors is related to primary nursing care, but in
collaboration with interprofessional team members. As an interprofessional team member, the nurse may consult
with psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed social workers, and other health-care providers. The scope and practice
of each team member is clearly defined within their professional licensure.

Nurses play a vital role in behavioral therapy as interprofessional team members modeling and teaching desired
58  2 · Fundamentals of Theories and Therapies

    behaviors. The nurse, as the coordinator of care, spends the most time observing and interacting with the client. The
    nurse's assessment plays a crucial role in understanding and treating the client's behavior, which allows for a more
    successful treatment plan.

    Behavioral Therapy in Groups
    The treatment of several clients together by one or more group facilitators addressing traumatic or stress disorders,
    depression, learning differences, or other conditions likely to benefit from the interaction is group therapy (Malhotra
    & Baker, 2022). Group therapy provides opportunities for supportive exchange within the group of individuals who
    have similar challenges. The professionals who facilitate group therapy may explore emotional, cognitive, and
    spiritual struggles. Before group therapy begins, the organizer determines group goals, size, duration of meetings,
    facilitator, and member characteristics. Group therapy can have a fixed life or be ongoing with members leaving and
    being replaced over time. The group usually has a set of agreed rules, such as the role of members in the group,
    contribution expected from members, the role of the leader in the group, dealing with inappropriate behavior,
    etiquette regarding starting and finishing the group as well as when members can leave the room. Group therapy
    can be in treatment settings or in the community and can take place face-to-face or in virtual sessions.

    Group behavioral (and interpersonal) therapy has been proven to be effective in managing substance use disorders,
    such as addictions, and promoting supportive relationships. Group therapy can be a powerful motivator for change
    when members are stimulated with new thought processes, develop bonds with other members, and experience
    adjustments to negative behavior. In group CBT, for instance, the group leader helps group members become aware
    of negative thought patterns that influence their actions and emotions. CBT groups enable members together to
    discover ways to refashion their behaviors and interpretations of situations by determining the foundations of their
    thoughts.

    A form of group therapy wherein all the participants of the group are related, as defined by the family members is
    family behavioral therapy (FBT). FBT can address substance misuse and other addictions, and also assists with
    managing secondary co-occurring problems within the family unit. Addictions can negatively affect the whole family
    and can cause secondary problems, such as abuse or conflict, mistreatment of children, and unemployment. In
    family therapy, the family members try to resolve negative behavior and interactions through learning new coping
    skills. Then, participants apply these strategies to improve the situation at home.

            CULTURAL CONTEXT

    Adapted Cultural Formulation Interview for Children and Adolescents

    The Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI) is a structured tool in the DSM-5, adaptable to the setting, and used to
    assess the influence of culture on a client's experience of distress (Jarvis et al., 2020). The following is an adapted
    version of the CFI tool for children and adolescents that may be used in family therapy.

        · Suggested introduction to the child or adolescent: We have talked about the concerns of your family. Now I
            would like to know how you are feeling about being [age] years old.

        · Feelings of age appropriateness in different settings: Do you feel you are like other people your age? In what
            way? Do you sometimes feel different from other people your age? In what way?
              If they acknowledge sometimes feeling different: Does this feeling of being different happen more at
                  home, at school, at work, and/or at some other place? Do you feel your family is different from other
                  families? Does your name have special meaning for you? Is there something special about you that you
                  like or are proud of?

        · Age-related stressors and supports: What do you like about being at home? At school? With friends? What
            don't you like at home? At school? With friends? Who is there to support you when you feel you need it? At
            home? At school? Among your friends?

        · Age-related expectations: What do your parents or grandparents expect from a person your age in terms of
            chores, schoolwork, play, or religion? What do your teachers expect from a person your age? What do other
            people your age expect from a person your age? (If they have siblings, what do your siblings expect from a
            person your age?)

    · Transition to adulthood (for adolescents): Are there any important celebrations or events in your community
        that recognize reaching a certain age or growing up? When is a youth considered ready to become an adult in
        your family or community? What is good about becoming an adult in your family? In school? In your
        community? How do you feel about "growing up"? In what ways are your life and responsibilities different
        from your parents' life and responsibilities?

(American Psychiatric Association, 2013)

Nursing Applications of Behavioral Therapies

Nurses use behavioral therapy treatments and techniques to help clients alter their maladaptive responses to
certain scenarios. Altering these responses can often ameliorate psychological distress and mental health
challenges. Nurses can use CBT practices, for instance, to assist clients in lessening psychological distress and in
building up coping tools to enhance their mental health. Nurses assess and evaluate, on an ongoing basis, clients
with mental health challenges to recognize behavioral changes and developments. As educators, nurses teach
clients about the effects of thoughts and feelings on behavior. Nurses are support persons and coaches when clients
are in counterconditioning, for example, and can provide honest praise for the client's accomplishments. Further,
nurses facilitate collaborative care when working with therapists and other providers.

In group therapy, nurses can play a vital role in leading or facilitating the group to achieve desired outcomes and
providing feedback to group members. In family therapy, nurses can teach the family unit new coping strategies that
reduce negative behavior and reinforce adaptation to common stressors. Interventions, such as education related to
healthy lifestyle, can be effective for stress reduction and for family unity.

        LINK TO LEARNING

The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (https://openstax.org/r/77healques) is a quick screening tool with nine criteria
for assessing a client's risk of depression. It can be used during CBT to assess the client's risk of depression related
to inability to cope with life stressors.

2.4 Humanistic Theories and Therapies

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Define humanistic theories and therapies
    · Identify nursing application of humanistic theories and therapies

Humanistic theory emerged after the concepts of psychoanalytic and behavioral theories. Humanistic theory states
that persons must be viewed as holistic beings with free will and choice, as continually moving toward self-
actualization, which is the realization of full potential or inner fulfillment considered as a drive or need present in
everyone.

Humanistic theory places the person at the center of mental health care where they are supported to identify
personal strengths and discover their own perspectives. Humanistic theory has a wellness focus and acknowledges
environmental effects on health (Sussex Publishers, 2022). Two humanistic theorists are discussed here: Abraham
Maslow and Carl Rogers.

Definitions

The humanistic theory is based on identification of holistic human needs. When these needs are met, persons can
grow and achieve their goals in life. When needs go unmet, persons may struggle to move to next levels in life. In
therapy utilizing these guidelines, the therapist and client work together to determine the client's life
accomplishments and where assistance is needed for growth.

Abraham Maslow
Abraham Maslow (1908-1970) believed humans were motivated by unmet needs. Maslow created a model that
60  2 · Fundamentals of Theories and Therapies

    started with the most basic needs of all human beings and worked into the most esoteric and abstract human needs
    (Figure 2.5). These needs were incremental and necessary for a client to become a fully functioning whole person.
    He initially had five levels of needs: physiological, safety/security, belonging and love/social, esteem, and self-
    actualization. Later, he added cognitive and aesthetic needs (placed between esteem and actualization). These
    additions represented the need to obtain and understand knowledge and the need for beauty and symmetry
    (McLeod, 2018).

    FIGURE 2.5 Maslow's hierarchy of needs identifies the levels of needs humans need to feel fulfilled. (modification of work from Clinical
    Nursing Skills. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

    Carl Rogers
    Psychologist Carl Rogers (1902-1987) is known for his humanistic theory and person-centered approach to therapy.
    He said that an individual's actions are motivated by the potential of self-actualization, by the possibility of achieving
    their best self, their highest potential. He based his theory on the idea of self-concept, which is a person's
    awareness of who they are. Self-concept has three components, according to Rogers: self-image, self-esteem, and
    the ideal self. He believed that humans have the ability to be self-aware, to evolve, and to recover with the person-
    centered therapist offering unconditional positive regard, empathy, and congruence. This supportive process allows
    the person to work toward their chosen goals in their own way (Millacci, 2022).

    Humanistic Therapies Applications in Mental Health Nursing

    Maslow's theory has had a profound effect on nursing. Understanding the humanistic model demonstrates to the
    nurse what the priority client needs are. The nurse must be able to understand that physiological needs must be
    met before higher-level needs, such as safety or love and belonging. It is important for the nurse to know this in the
    assessment phase of the interaction with the client, when recognizing and analyzing cues. It is important that the
    nurse prioritize and personalize the care of every client.

    Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory is a major foundation of nursing practice as is Carl Rogers's theory. His belief
    was that client care should be done with empathy and should encourage clients to voice their emotions and form
    trusting relationships with the nurse that provide a foundation for client self-awareness and self-care. Nurses
    should respect clients, their autonomy, and treat them with genuine empathy and understanding in order for clients
    to reach their potential.

Because humanistic therapy is a holistic approach, aspects of care focus on the client's personal development and
recovery. Strength identification is part of this process, and feedback from the nurse is meaningful. Also significant
to nursing practice are the concepts of person-centered care and therapeutic communication wherein nurses
establish rapport with clients by focusing on them as individuals. As the person reacts to others and to different
situations, the nurse can assist the client to find relevance and plan their own success. This nursing focus on the
client as an individual encourages trust and transparency in the process.

  CLINICAL JUDGMENT MEASUREMENT MODEL

  Humanistic Approach to Client Care Scenario

  Layer 4 of the CJMM provides contextual elements of clinical decision-making in the form of realistic client-care
  environmental factors. Consider the following example:

      · Environmental cues: secure psychiatric hospital unit
      · Client observation cues: young adult, panic anxiety
      · Medical record cues: history of bipolar mood disorder
      · Time pressure cues: client rapidly losing personal control

  To analyze these cues, nurses must interpret the information. This client has a safety need. The nurse assures
  the client as to safety and the availability of nursing staff to assist the client. The nurse says, "You can tell us
  how you are feeling." The nurse reminds the client of their prior success in self-management and assures the
  client of the staff's interest in returning the client to self-care, thereby establishing trust and person-centered
  care.

2.5 Biological Theories and Therapies

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Define biological theories and therapies
    · Identify nursing application of biological theories and therapies

From a biological perspective, psychiatric-mental health conditions are considered physiological disorders with a
focus on the neurological and immune systems of the body, as well as genetic components of health. Trauma and
injury are also considered with diagnoses and treatment of mental illness (Schwartz & Corcoran, 2017). Magnetic
and computerized imaging are used to study the brain and detect areas of damage or change. The premise is to find
where the problem is in the brain and target that area with medications, diet, surgery, or other therapies, such as
brain stimulation.

Definitions

Biological theory centers on an actual physical reason for psychiatric problems and, in effect, has decreased the
stigma long associated with mental illness. For instance, when a person is diagnosed with schizophrenia, under this
theory it has a physical root cause, which displaces blame.

Medication Therapy
Biological therapy provides remedies for mental health disorders by physically treating the brain. Medical
understanding of the action of neurotransmitters in the brain provides the rationale for pharmacological approaches.
Intended to restore balance in this chemical process, medication therapy is a commonly utilized method to treat
mental health disorders.

Using chemicals to adjust the brain chemistry to assist the client with a mental health disorder is
psychopharmacology. With the inception of chlorpromazine, also known as Thorazine, a strong antipsychotic
medication, many psychiatric clients were able to move from a state of psychosis to a manageable lifestyle
(Lindamood, 2005). Medications that target neurotransmitters help restore brain function by regulating these
neurotransmitters. Clients report having less emotional distress and greater satisfaction with their lives, due to
taking these medications. Clinicians began to understand the vital role these chemicals provided as a new way to
treat psychiatric disorders, other than psychoanalysis and behavioral therapy. Many medications have proven
62  2 · Fundamentals of Theories and Therapies

    effective to treat and/or control psychosis, mania, depression, and anxiety. These medications have decreased
    lengths of hospitalization and helped clients have more productive lives.

    Diet
    Healthy lifestyles include healthy diets. Research has found evidence of dietary influence on mental health. Grajek
    et al. (2022) reviewed possible connections between nutrition and mental health. Nutrition may be able to reduce
    inflammatory processes in the body and promote optimal circulatory and cellular health. Studies reviewed by Grajek
    et al. (2022) found that complex carbohydrates, antioxidants, vitamins B9, D, E, C, carotenoids, tryptophan, alpha-
    lipoic acid, and soluble fiber could have these therapeutic effects. Recent research describes new disciplines of
    psychodietetics and nutritional psychiatry (Grajek et al., 2022).

    Psychosurgery
    Neurosurgery intended to alter psychological responses is called psychosurgery (De Jesus et al., 2023). It can be
    used for a select group of clients who have not experienced successful treatment for anxiety disorders and
    obsessive-compulsive disorders. Psychosurgery alters small portions of brain tissue in specific areas that control
    certain behaviors. Changes are made by thermal, radiation, or surgical methods without damage to the person's
    general function. Drastic surgeries such as frontal lobotomy are no longer performed due to disabling effects.

    Brain Stimulation
    Brain stimulation therapies are those that stimulate the brain through neurochemicals, electricity, and nerve action
    (National Alliance on Mental Illness [NAMI], 2023). There is traditional electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), which uses
    electricity to stimulate targeted areas of the brain by creating a controlled seizure, most commonly used to treat
    major depression. Now other brain stimulation therapies, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), aim to
    target specific brain areas to treat the problem. These therapies also treat other disorders, such as epilepsy,
    Parkinson disease, and several chronic pain disorders.

    Nursing Application of Biological Theory

    The major concepts of the biological theory related to nursing are basic care of the client, through monitoring and
    supporting their physical needs. Nurses are responsible for overseeing sleep, activity, nutrition, hydration,
    elimination, and other functions for the client. The nurse is responsible for administering medications and preparing
    the client for procedures. The nurse also monitors drug-level laboratory reports and ensures the client's therapeutic
    level is met. This physical care of the psychiatric client is part of the holistic approach nursing is known for.

    For clients in treatment with biological therapies, teaching is a nursing intervention that promotes health, prevents
    harm, and empowers the client through partnership with the health-care team. Specific to medication teaching,
    clients must be made aware of the indications and effects of all medications prescribed, including drug-food
    interactions. Nurses also conduct preoperative or pre-procedure teaching and witness the surgical or procedural
    written consent. This education contributes to the effectiveness of the plan of care.

    In dietary education, nurses can teach how stress can result in food choices detrimental to overall health and
    educate clients on the aspects of emotional eating, where food becomes a substitute for addressing feelings.
    Nurses can counsel on grocery shopping and meal preparation.

    Nurses also play a supportive role as advocates for the expressed preferences of the client in treatment with
    biological therapies. The client's beliefs and values must be considered and explored. Open exchange of this
    information contributes to best outcomes of care. Clients and families must be informed of aspects of all biological

2.6 Developmental Theories and Therapies

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Define developmental theories and therapies
    · Identify nursing application of developmental theories and therapies

Psychiatric-mental health nurses can utilize concepts from developmental theories to enhance their awareness of
the client's experience. This knowledge informs client education as well. Nurses may apply cognitive development
theory when observing the client's interactions with the environment, whether in treatment or in the community.
The theory of object relations empowers nurses to recognize and analyze cues in the client's presentation and
expressed needs, which leads to focused care planning. Moral development theory informs nurses when ethical
questions arise. All theory application contributes to the nurse's self-awareness and effectiveness in client care.
This section covers theories of Jean Piaget, Margaret Mahler, and Lawrence Kohlberg.

Definitions

Developmental theories seek to explain the process of a child's understanding. This process is investigated as
occurring in steps or stages, or in a continual way through the life span.

Jean Piaget
Jean Piaget (1896-1980) was a Swiss psychologist and researcher. Piaget worked in a boys' school and scored the
intelligence exams given to the boys, noting that younger children would consistently give incorrect answers to the
same questions the older children would answer correctly. This brought him to conclude that cognitive
development was a dynamic process with primitive awareness and recognition to a more complex manner of
thinking. He found that the mental representation of the world or process of information depended on the cognitive
stage humans reached and mastered (Scott & Cogburn, 2023). The theory had four stages of development:
sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational. Table 2.6 describes these stages.

Stage           Ages        Description

Sensorimotor    Birth to 2  Basic reflexes through purposeful movement, spatial abilities, and hand-eye

                            the environment. Around nine months, the concept of object permanence is
                            mastered. This means the child is able to believe an object exists after the first
                            encounter.

                            qualities without specific objects to show this. They are unable to comprehend,
                            for instance, that the same amount of (mass, volume, or number) liquid can be
                            stored in a tall, thin glass as a short, wide glass.

    TABLE 2.6 Piaget's Cognitive Development Stages (Scott & Cogburn, 2023)

    Piaget's concepts are utilized in therapies in educational settings, especially with children.

    Margaret Mahler
    The theory of object relations, according to theorist Margaret Mahler (1897-1985), is how a person relates to the
    world according to their past relationships. Specifically for the infant, the mother or significant other becomes one
    with the child. The infant cannot conceptualize the mother's permanence when the two are apart, which is known as
    the concept of object constancy. Therefore, in the infant's understanding, the mother does not exist when not
    physically present. A variation of other theories, Mahler places less emphasis on primitive human drives and more
    importance on consistent relationship patterns.

    Mahler believed that psychological problems were related to the disruption in separation from the object (Blom,
    2018). She studied the process of how infants move from total self-interest to struggle with separation from the
    mother, to becoming a physically and psychologically differentiated toddler (Table 2.7). This natural healthy process
    is developed by the object, that is, the parent/significant person, allowing the child to wander off in a safe
    environment while staying close by so the child is assured the parent is still present. Over time and over exposure to
    this type of experience, the child begins to trust the process and become an individual. Another important piece of
    exposure is to reward the child when they return to the mother. This reward is a verbal or other sensory affirmation
    that reinforces the action was good. Mahler also believed that "perfect parenting" was not necessary for this
    transitional trust to develop.

    Mahler's concepts are utilized in therapies by recognizing that individuation is a complex process (Blom, 2018).
    Treatment approaches factor into therapy with families who experience periods of transition such as a new baby, a
    child beginning school, or a young adult leaving home. Mahler's framework guides assessment of individual growth.
    Couples therapy explores separation-individuation, recognizing that personality development occurs throughout the
    life span.

                          independence, i.e., "terrible two's" as infant tests new behaviors, resulting in
                          development of self-concept

In the article "An Object Relations Approach to Cult Membership" (https://openstax.org/r/77psytherapy), the
authors apply the theories of object relations to interactions throughout life that are guided by the earliest
relationships.

Lawrence Kohlberg
Psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg (1927-1987) expanded upon Piaget's cognitive stages by establishing moral
stages. His theory of moral development provides a framework of three levels and six stages for understanding the
progression a child develops when learning right from wrong (Smith, 2023).

The first level, preconventional, has two stages. This level is distinguished by rules and listening to authority. During
the first stage, punishment and obedience, the child learns obedience is the way to avoid punishment. The second
stage is instrumental purpose orientation. In this stage, the child sees that others look at rules differently and if they
choose to not follow the rules, they risk punishment.

The second level, conventional, has stages three and four. The third stage is good interpersonal relationships. In this
stage, the child begins to start using motivation and personality as reason for following or not following the rules.
The child thinks in terms of "good and bad" as a person who gets along with others. Stage four is maintaining the
social order. The person becomes aware of the fact "rules are rules." People all must fall in line with these, not only
to avoid punishment, but because of the broader view of society. The person begins to see that following authority
maintains social order. The person sees this in large systems, such as government and corporations.

The postconventional level houses stages five and six. Stage five is social contract and individual rights. In stage
five, the person believes that social order is good and correct. Stage six is universal ethical principles. The
overarching sentiment here is that actions should create justice for all who are involved, and, as a society, people
are obliged to break unjust laws/rules.

Kohlberg's concepts are utilized in therapies to help explain that people can have different reactions to similar
ethical concerns. Kohlberg's theory can guide parents and caregivers as children develop their own moral
framework and, ultimately, learn about social expectations.

Nursing Application of Developmental Theories

Developmental theories help the nurse know how to assess, intervene, and evaluate the client. These theories help
the nurse develop approaches to client care based on clients' developmental levels, regardless of chronological age.
These levels are multilayered and unique with each client.

Nursing Application of Cognitive Development Theory
Nurses' understanding of basic principles of human growth and development allows focused care planning,
especially for teaching. In addition, nursing expectations for client responses can be realistic and provide situations
wherein clients can receive positive feedback for accomplishments. Because interaction with the environment is
important to human development, the nurse acts as milieu manager in hospital settings and promotes healthy
public communities through advocacy and consulting.

Nursing Application of Object Relations Theory
When nurses learn the client's history, an understanding of childhood experiences may provide cues to client
behaviors, emotions, and coping ability so the nurse gains the knowledge to plan appropriate care. For nurses
themselves, object relations theory gives opportunities for self-awareness. Nurses may experience reactions to
client care scenarios that are unexpected or confusing. These situations can prompt the nurse to seek mentoring or
feedback from colleagues.

Nursing Application of Moral Development Theory
Moral development theory can assist nurses to understand clients' reasoning and decision-making. By
understanding where clients fall in the stages of moral development, the nurse can customize their care to what the
client requires. Understanding these theories allows the nurse to appreciate the importance of their own moral
66  2 · Fundamentals of Theories and Therapies

    compass. Nurses often come across ethical dilemmas when interfacing with clients. Kohlberg's theory can
    contribute to a more educated approach to these dilemmas because it illuminates the level of moral reasoning of all
    parties involved in the situation, including clients, loved ones, and other health-care providers.

    2.7 Holistic Health and Interventions

    LEARNING OBJECTIVES
    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Define holistic health-care theories and therapies, including social determinants of holistic health care
        · Describe mindfulness as a type of holistic health care
        · Identify nursing application of holistic theories

    Holistic health care is a wellness modality used to treat and prevent physical and mental health problems. Holistic
    health care can greatly enhance the success of treatment and outcomes and can be combined with pharmacological
    interventions. Clients in treatment for mental health care may spend a lot of time in a hospital setting trying new
    therapies or medication regimens. A holistic approach to transitioning back into a community setting can prevent
    hospital readmissions (State of New South Wales [NSW] Government, 2020). Incorporation of community-based
    programs after hospital discharge, such as social services, community treatment facilities, and group housing are
    often used as reintegration techniques. The ultimate goal of holistic health care is increased treatment
    effectiveness.

    Definitions

    The multifaceted approach that reflects the client's physical and emotional well-being and considers the whole
    person and how they interact with their environment is called holistic health. It is a focus on one's quality of life
    versus a physical ailment, illness, or disease. The nurse understands there are numerous factors that affect a
    client's actual health goals and potential outcomes. These factors include physical, emotional, cultural, family,
    spiritual, psychological, and environmental influences. Accurate assessment helps the nurse interpret the complex
    interactions between all the different factors. To assess the impact of each influence, the nurse should perform a
    functional assessment. Functional assessments include the client's developmental patterns as well as behavior and
    response to stressors. Analyzing collected data from the functional assessment and applying interventions creates a
    solid foundation for providing holistic health care.

            LINK TO LEARNING

    The Functional Analysis Screening Tool (FAST) (https://openstax.org/r/77FAST) is designed to identify a number of
    factors that may influence the occurrence of problem behaviors.

    Social Determinants and Associated Interventions: Healthy People 2030
    The conditions of the environments where people live, work, play, worship, and go to school, which represent the
    nonmedical factors that influence health outcomes, are social determinants of health (SDOH). Ideally, all
    components of the environment would support health and a good quality of life for the inhabitants. Environmental
    conditions may contribute to health and well-being or may be detrimental or harmful. Even moderate support can
    be beneficial in a less-than-optimal environment. For example, someone with no home or income of their own may
    be part of a faith-based community that comforts and assists them.

    As described by Healthy People 2030, the five areas that comprise SDOH are economic, education, health care,
    neighborhood, and community (Figure 2.6). Therefore, unemployment or debt, education that is disrupted or
    unavailable, low access to health care, a neighborhood with violence or crime, or a larger community without
    resources can have damaging effects on health of the people.

Drafted by the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Healthy People 2030 sets data-driven national
objectives to improve health and well-being associated with social determinants. Through research, common
themes of social determinants emerged among various populations that appeared to be preventing people from
achieving health-care goals, as defined by the person. The Healthy People Committee developed interventions for
health-care workers to help individuals overcome the effects of these conditions. The goal or mission envisions a
society in which all people can achieve their full potential for health and well-being across the life span.

The Patient-Centered Medical Home Model
The patient-centered medical home (PCMH) model, developed by the Veterans Health Administration, is an example
of a proactive, primary care-based, interdisciplinary team model using person-centered, holistic care, and active
communication and coordination among providers. This model is considered effective for clients with complex
health-care needs. Figure 2.7 illustrates the medical home model. As homeless veterans stabilize clinically and
socially, as evidenced by their moving into permanent housing and demonstrating appropriate self-care and health-
seeking behaviors, they are transitioned to traditional care settings to continue their care. Research indicates that
the medical home model reduced emergency department visits and hospitalizations of the homeless population by
integrating supports that addressed social determinants of health into a clinical care model (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention [CDC], 2021).

    Mindfulness

    An individual's state of awareness, achieved through personal focus, being in the present, and/or meditation is
    called mindfulness. Attention to being fully cognizant of a situation without extreme reaction can provide calming
    and centering. The practice of mindfulness dates back to ancient times and was originally grounded in Buddhist and
    Hindu traditions (Figure 2.8).

Research has shown that mindfulness can have positive health outcomes related to managing stress, anxiety, and
many types of depression (Crosswell et al., 2017). Mindfulness has been described as, "non-elaborative,
nonjudgmental, present-centered awareness in which each thought, feeling, or sensation that arises is
acknowledged and accepted as it is" (Delegran & Haley, 2016, para 3). Mindfulness is a holistic technique, involving
all the person's senses and contributing to overall well-being.

Mindfulness practice utilizes techniques for one to be present and in the moment. One exercise might be the
following:

      Compare your default state to mindfulness when studying for an exam in a difficult course or preparing for
      a clinical experience. What do you do? Do you tell yourself, "I am not good at this" or "I am going to look
      stupid"? Does this distract you from paying attention to studying or preparing? How might it be different if
      you had an open attitude with no concern or judgment about your performance? What if you directly
      experienced the process as it unfolded, including the challenges, anxieties, insights, and accomplishments,
      while acknowledging each thought or feeling and accepting it without needing to figure it out or explore it
      further?

If practiced regularly, mindfulness helps a person start to see the habitual patterns that lead to automatic negative
reactions that create stress. By observing these thoughts and emotions instead of reacting to them, a person can
develop a broader perspective and can choose a more effective response.

Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction
Mental training used to alter how pain or stress is processed within the central nervous system, thereby diminishing
or reducing one's perception of pain or stress, is called mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR). MBSR has
shown positive outcomes in a variety of health-care settings for both physical and emotional disruptions (Lamothe
et al., 2016). MBSR was originally developed for clients with chronic illness who were not responding to existing
medical treatments. MBSR was first researched and funded by the National Center for Complementary and
Integrative Health (NCCIH) at the University of Massachusetts in 1979. The NCCIH created a Stress Reduction Clinic
and treated a variety of clients with health conditions, such as cancer, chronic pain, and autoimmune disorders.
Clients completed modules and workshops on techniques like meditation to lower stress levels and increase well-
being.

        REAL RN STORIES

Nurse: Karen B., MSN
Years in Practice: 14
Clinical Setting: Community health clinic
Geographic Location: Greensboro, NC

Fourteen years ago, when I began my career at a community mental health clinic, I worked with women who had
experienced physical trauma from a partner. I felt a hesitancy from the clients to begin the conversation. I felt it
myself and I wanted to incorporate a strategy to reduce the stress of the counseling sessions. The office where we
met was located overlooking a park and I began to invite the clients to stand with me at the window for a moment of
gazing meditation. We did not speak during this time as we watched children playing, people walking their dogs, and
birds fluttering on the tree branches. I was humbly surprised when the clients began to assert their readiness to
begin the session, having settled themselves during the exercise. It worked for me as well.

Because MBSR showed such encouraging results in physical conditions, mental health providers started combining
it with cognitive therapy and incorporating it into the treatment plans of clients suffering from depression. In recent
years, MBSR has shown positive outcomes as a coping technique for caregiver burden as well (Nathan et al., 2017).
Due to the pandemic and social distancing mandates, mental health-care practitioners have recently started
offering MBSR modules and workshops in a virtual platform.

            LINK TO LEARNING

    The Mindfulness Project (https://openstax.org/r/77mindproj) is a tool with numerous mindfulness activities.

    Guided Imagery
    Another form of mindfulness is guided imagery, which provides an alternate narration the mind can focus on during
    an unpleasant experience. According to the pain gate theory, the brain can only experience one pathway at a time,
    either pleasure or pain, but not both (Krau, 2020). Guided imagery allows for the pleasure pathway to take over,
    decreasing the body's perception of pain. Guided imagery is often used during labor as a coping technique for
    contraction pain. The nurse helps the laboring mom picture something that brings a pleasant thought or feeling, like
    her newborn's outfit or ultrasound picture. The mental image accompanied with slow, controlled breathing and
    relaxation of tension in the shoulders, hands, and feet can provide a nonpharmacological approach to pain
    management.

    Guided imagery has also been proven effective as an intervention in mental health scenarios. For example, during a
    client's anxiety, the nurse can offer to assist the client with an exercise. Allow the client to sit comfortably in a quiet
    area. Begin by describing a beach with waves coming in on the sand and going back out to sea. Using the mental
    image of ocean waves, the nurse can instruct the client to breathe in as the waves approach the beach and breathe
    out as the waves go back. Nurses also teach guided imagery to promote relaxation and sleep.

    Teaching Mindfulness Requires Self-Awareness
    To teach mindfulness to clients, the nurse must first examine their own self-awareness and beliefs. Different
    treatments and interventions work for different clients. There is no one single treatment that is effective in every
    situation. The nurse must not impose their own beliefs or personal opinions onto the client, nor provide less than
    quality care just because the client's beliefs differ from their own.

    The therapeutic relationship between a nurse and client must be founded on trust and a judgment-free space in
    order to be effective in producing positive outcomes. For instance, a client with obesity may want to be more
    accepting of their weight and may need assistance with interventions related to achieving a positive body image.
    The nurse may believe instead of self-acceptance, the client should be focusing on health promotion and ways to
    reduce their weight. The nurse has a responsibility, however, to support the client and help them achieve their goals.
    Using applications of mindfulness, the nurse should be aware of their surroundings and display the empathy needed
    by the client to achieve their goal. Nurses who practice self-awareness are better equipped to provide quality client-
    centered care, resulting in more positive outcomes.

    Key elements for the nurse to consider when incorporating self-awareness include:

        · A client's perception is the most influential factor in determining their response to intervention, rather than
            how the nurse feels they should respond.

        · Behavior and emotions will differ between clients in the same situation, with the same variables.
        · No one intervention will work with every client.
        · Becoming familiar with a variety of cognitive and holistic interventions will increase effectiveness in promoting

            a positive well-being.

            CLINICAL SAFETY AND PROCEDURES (QSEN)

    QSEN Competency: Client-Centered Care

    Nurses practice client-centered care when building trust and avoiding judgment in the therapeutic relationship.
    Building trust means "do what you say you will do." For example, if the nurse states a group exercise will start at
    9:00, the group should start on time. If the nurse states they will return to meet with the client after lunch, the nurse
    should do so. Avoid judgment in nurse-client interactions, by saying, for example, "I can see your point," "This
    seems important to you," or "Is it fair to say you were angry about that?" instead of responding with comments such
    as, "You're not making sense," "That's not relevant," or "You shouldn't have felt that way."

Nursing Application of Holistic Health Care

Holism in health care is a psychosocial approach that does not set illness apart, but treats the whole person.
Nightingale, by using the environment as therapy, was incorporating a holistic approach. Nurses should consider the
physical and social environment when treating clients.

        PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Managing the Environment for the Therapeutic Interaction

    · Select an area that provides few distractions, with comfortable seating or space to walk with the client, and
        enough privacy to protect the conversation without being isolated. This may be a conference room, with the
        door open, an area of the unit dayroom, or a secure outdoor area.

    · Consider your own potential discomfort and plan ahead. Consult with another nurse and review printed
        guidelines.

    · Engage the client's participation to talk in the selected area and set the time frame. For example, "Hello,
        Jordan, let's sit in the conference room for about 15 minutes to finish your admission paperwork."

    · Allow the client access to water or a restroom. For example, "You can bring your cup and the restroom is here
        in the hallway."

    · Tell other staff members where you will be. For example, "Jordan and I will be talking in the conference room
        until about 2:30."

    · Show active listening behavior, wait for the client's responses and validate before changing topics. Keep
        appropriate eye contact, nod when you understand, and don't interrupt the client. It is best to sit diagonally so
        as not to confront or crowd the client. Be patient, though gentle prompts are okay, for example, "go on . . ."
        "then what happened?" "It seems you are in agreement with your mom--is that accurate?"

    · Focus on the client, ask permission to take notes, though keep to a minimum. For example, "I'd like to make a
        few notes, so I can follow up with Dr. Smith, if you agree."

    · Draw the interview to a close by mentioning the time frame, thank the client, and give an opening to interact
        another time. For example, "Jordan, our time is up for now. Thank you for talking with me. Let's head back to
        the unit. I can be available after lunch if you would like to meet again."

(Gorman & Sultan, 2008)

During interviewing and data collection, nursing awareness of the physical environment and the nurse's attitudes
are essential components. If the interaction takes place in a busy or noisy area or the nurse expresses impatience or
fatigue, the client will not feel supported.

Nurses should also take into account the client's outside environment. In the community, for example, nurses can
practice advocacy by volunteering and promoting efforts to address food insecurities, housing initiatives, or
transportation systems. In public health settings, nurses can make inquiries with empathy, such as, "Do you
sometimes run out of necessities?" or "What would be the best way to help you with child care?" They can then
make referrals or arrange consults as indicated by clients' preferences.

        CLINICAL SAFETY AND PROCEDURES (QSEN)

QSEN Competency: Quality Improvement (QI)

Nurses use quality improvement projects or task forces to track client responses and positive outcomes. For
instance, surveys can be implemented after the initiation of techniques, such as mindfulness or self-awareness
behaviors among staff members, then results analyzed to show correlation of positive care outcomes.

Summary

2.1 Psychoanalytic Theories and Therapies

The psychoanalytic theory from Sigmund Freud provides a foundation to understand psychiatric problems. This
theory is the basis for the nurse to view the client through the lens of personality development and unconscious
influences on behavior, and to incorporate this into the care of the client.

The id, ego, and superego keep the person in balance between satisfying every primal want and bowing to societal
pressures. The use of defense mechanisms is necessary for all humans to emotionally adjust to their environment.
At the same time, defense mechanisms utilized over the long-term can become patterns of ineffective coping,
causing problems with social adjustment and emotional growth.

Freud also created stages of sexual development that he believed affected a person's emotional growth and/or
adaptation. And the two concepts of transference and countertransference reveal that all clients have a past and are
attempting to frame their reality in ways that are safe and familiar. These ideas enhance therapeutic communication
and active listening to assist the client as needed.

2.2 Interpersonal Theories and Therapies

Interpersonal theories identify interpersonal relationships as drivers for human development. Erikson believed the
personality develops throughout the life span and presented an age-based order to reflect this. Nursing observation
of client behavior can provide cues to the client's developmental stage, which allows nurses to address
psychological needs and develop a therapeutic relationship. Peplau applied interpersonal theory to nursing. She
defined the nurse-client relationship, which includes the phases of pre-orientation, orientation, working, and mutual
termination. Peplau also presented nurses with focused approaches for the described four levels of anxiety: mild,
moderate, severe, and panic.

2.3 Cognitive Theories and Therapies

Behavioral therapeutic interventions for emotional problems can include one or more of the following: milieu
therapy, group therapy, family therapy, and forms of cognitive behavioral therapy. Goals of these therapies include
awareness of emotions and modification of associated negative behaviors. Learned techniques assist the person to
be more effective at coping with stressors in identified situations. Nurses are teachers, advocates, and support
persons. Comprehensive knowledge of the different types of behavioral and cognitive behavioral therapy helps the
nurse select appropriate and effective interventions and treatment approaches.

2.4 Humanistic Theories and Therapies

Humanistic theory views persons as holistic beings utilizing free will to reach self-actualization, as defined by the
person. Maslow's hierarchy of needs model guides nursing assessment and Rogers's concepts of the person's sense
of self assists the nurse with individualized care planning. Both theorists cite self-actualization as the ultimate goal
of human achievement. In a therapeutic approach based on humanistic theory, clients are empowered and
supported toward their own recovery.

2.5 Biological Theories and Therapies

Biological theories have helped with the stigma of mental health by identifying organic bases for many disorders.
Biological therapies include medications, diet, surgery, or other therapies such as brain stimulation. Nurses function
as educators and advocates through direct care, medication administration, surgical and procedural care,
monitoring, and teaching for clients and families. In addition, nurses should remain aware of the latest in
developments of biological therapies so that recipients of care receive current information and optimal support.

2.6 Developmental Theories and Therapies

Developmental theories investigate human development through the life span. Theorists Jean Piaget, Margaret
Mahler, and Lawrence Kohlberg all contributed developmental theories to explain how children develop throughout
stages to reach a more complex way of thinking. Moral development also takes on more complex forms as
individuals age and develop the ability to distinguish right from wrong. Nurses can apply these theories to practice
to understand exactly where their clients stand in their ability to understand concepts and make decisions. These

theories also come into play when ethical dilemmas arise.

2.7 Holistic Health and Interventions

To provide quality holistic care, the nurse must recognize multiple determinants--the physical, emotional, cultural,
family, spiritual, psychological, and environmental influences to which the client is exposed. To achieve this, the
nurse must find out as much as possible about a client's personal values, beliefs, and health practices. Healthy
People 2030 describes identified obstacles affecting a client's ability to achieve health-care goals. Nurses who
become knowledgeable in these obstacles can develop client-specific interventions to overcome negative effects of
social determinants. Nurses should remember the client is the best source of information.

Mindfulness has a long history and has been proven as an effective intervention in both physiological and
psychological disorders. Techniques such as guided imagery, mindfulness-based stress reduction, yoga, and
physical exercise are techniques the nurse can incorporate into the client's plan of care. Nurses must practice self-
awareness to build trusting therapeutic relationships and provide judgment-free quality care.

CHAPTER OUTLINE
3.1 Therapeutic Communication and Relationships
3.2 Client Perception of Illness
3.3 Nursing Assessment and Clinical Tools
INTRODUCTION In the psychiatric-mental health (PMH) specialty, the nurse provides holistic care, using the skills
of observation, interaction, assessment, and collaboration. The client's safety and stability are the goals of care. The
nurse also benefits from the helping relationship through professional growth. One critical factor that influences
communication is self-awareness. The nurse should take time to reflect on how well they communicate and if there
is a need for improvement. Nurses must learn to communicate with awareness of tone of voice, body language,
nonverbal cues, preconceived views of clients, and the correct information to guide the client into a therapeutic
relationship. This chapter presents the nursing techniques of therapeutic communication within the nurse-client
relationship, the client's experience, and specific guidelines for nursing care.

    3.1 Therapeutic Communication and Relationships

    LEARNING OBJECTIVES
    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Describe the significance of self-awareness in nursing practice
        · Demonstrate therapeutic communication strategies and techniques when working with clients
        · Identify barriers to therapeutic communication
        · Discuss the therapeutic relationship and physical, emotional, and social boundaries between nurses and

            clients
        · Explain treatment issues and obstacles in the therapeutic relationship

    Therapeutic communication and relationships with clients are at the core of nursing. As nurses greet, involve, and
    evaluate clients, the manner of interaction is critical. The nurse must use communication techniques to help get the
    best picture of the client. Therefore, the nurse must know how to communicate effectively. Nurses learn and
    develop communication skills through every client and colleague interaction, and improving communication is a
    lifelong pursuit.

    Nurses learn to use specific communication techniques and to identify the barriers to communication as they
    interact and practice with clients. There must be clear communication between nurse and client or there will be a
    disconnect between the message intent and the message received. If the client perceives the tone of voice of the
    nurse to be harsh or uncaring, for example, it might present a barrier to establishing trust between the nurse and the
    client. Active listening is key as a nurse. When the nurse is engaged in the therapeutic process and seeks to capture
    the meaning, intention, and content of the message, this is called active listening. It requires being an active
    participant in the communication process. Active listening entails facing the client, maintaining appropriate eye
    contact, and focusing on the client's words, nonverbal cues, and body language. The nurse does so without
    judgment or interrupting for clarification.

    Along with effective communication, nurses need to keep appropriate physical, emotional, social, and cultural
    boundaries to build and maintain a therapeutic and caring relationship. This section focuses on identifying,
    explaining, and demonstrating communication and therapeutic relationships as the foundation of the nursing
    process when caring for clients.

    Self-Awareness

    Nursing for clients who are in psychiatric care requires self-awareness, which entails a nurse being aware of their
    own behavior, responses, and thoughts during interactions with clients. A nurse with self-awareness will gain
    understanding of how to develop and improve upon these interactions. The Johari Window is a model of self-
    awareness (Figure 3.2) developed by American psychologists Joseph Luft and Harry Ingham in 1955. In this model,
    there are four quadrants: what is known to the person is the y-axis, and what is known to others is the x-axis.

3.1 · Therapeutic Communication and Relationships                                                                                         85

FIGURE 3.2 The Johari model of self-awareness can help improve interactions. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC

The first quadrant is the arena. This is what is known to self and others. Thoughts are open and provided to others.
Both verbal and nonverbal communication are open. The individuals that the person is interacting with are aligned
with the person's thoughts, opinions, and viewpoints.

Second, is the façade area. This area is where the person hides thoughts, feelings, and skills from others. They have
capabilities that may be desired, but they choose to keep them to themselves. Those around the person do not
know that they are holding anything back.

The blind spot is the next area. This is where others know things about the person, but the person is not aware of
these things. Others know these skills, opinions, or viewpoints from prior experience with the person. Others may
know the person can handle a situation or problem, based on prior interaction, but the person has no self-
awareness of this.

Lastly, there is the unknown area. This area is where neither the person or others know the skills, thoughts,
opinions, viewpoints, or feelings a person has. This is when a person does not know they have some idea or feeling
and others do not know it either.

        PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Applying the Johari Window in Nursing Practice

Psychiatric-mental health nurses can offer clients psychosocial support through the nurse's own self-awareness. As
a nurse, use the Johari Window concepts to better understand your own behaviors and responses during
interactions with clients and coworkers.

Examples:

    · Nurse Janet is known as someone who comes to work on time, always willing to stay over to help the next
        shift, very friendly, has fifteen years of experience, and will answer questions from other staff. This falls in the
        arena area.

    · Three years ago, Janet intervened in a domestic situation with a client at another employment situation and
        was threatened with legal action and left that job. She is now reluctant to advocate for clients. This falls in the
        façade area.

    · Janet won't speak up in meetings but others would appreciate her expertise and wonder why she doesn't join
        in and say something. This falls in the blind spot area.

    · Janet's nonverbal communication sends some messages that may portray some aspects of these areas of
        awareness. This falls in the unknown area.
86  3 · Communication, Perception, and Assessment

    If Janet seeks feedback from colleagues and uses her own self-reflection, she has the opportunity to gain insight
    and skill in therapeutic interaction.

    As a nurse, it is important to know where to start in communication with clients. It is best to be self-aware to
    improve and have the best outcome for the client. The nurse should start by sharing who they are, what their goal is
    for the communication, and encourage the client to do the same. The nurse should limit self-disclosure, which is an
    interactive communication process wherein one person shares information about themselves in an appropriate
    context, modeling the behavior for others in the therapeutic relationship. This can be a therapeutic technique, if
    utilized within professional boundaries. For example, if the client is tearful when talking about their children, the
    nurse may offer, "I'm a parent, too." Used in proper context, this comment can show empathy while not elaborating
    or placing the focus on the nurse.

            LINK TO LEARNING

    This video explains how to use the Johari Window (https://openstax.org/r/77johariwin) to increase self-awareness
    and thereby improve communication with clients.

    Reflection should accompany and enhance self-awareness. There are many models of self-reflection in the
    research. One reflective model nurses often use is the Gibbs Reflective Cycle (Figure 3.3) because of its link
    between introspection and action.

    FIGURE 3.3 The Gibbs Reflective Cycle illustrates the six stages of self-reflection. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under
    CC BY 4.0 license)

    There are six stages of this cycle: the description of the situation, what feelings erupt from the situation, evaluating
    what is good and not so good about the situation, analyzing the situation to determine what there is to learn from it,
    concluding what could be done differently, and developing an action plan to improve handling the situation next
    time. Self-awareness with self-reflection allows for further development of therapeutic communication and it
    enables the relationship between the nurse and client to remain open to change and become enriched with
    therapeutic actions.

    Therapeutic Communication Strategies and Techniques

    Communication is an art and a science. When a nurse supports, draws out information for an assessment, or
    provokes deeper understanding on what a client is communicating, they are participating in therapeutic
    communication. Communication between the client and the nurse must be honest, ethical, and legal. The science
    portion of communication relates to the process of how communication is accomplished. There is a sender and a
    receiver of the message. There is interpretation of the message also, through coding and encoding (Figure 3.4). The
    nurse needs to explain to the client that what the client reveals will be kept confidential within the treatment team.
    Information that relates to the health and safety of the client or others, or if the client is homicidal or suicidal, would
    be shared with the health-care team for the safety of all concerned. The client is made aware that this information

                                                             3.1 · Therapeutic Communication and Relationships                         87

will be confidentially shared with those who care for them.

FIGURE 3.4 Verbal communication entails five basic elements: sender, message, channel, receiver, and feedback. The process continues,
sometimes fluidly and sometimes with gaps. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

While information in a medical record is privacy protected, there is legal precedent for releasing the information if it
poses a serious threat to persons or the public, or when disclosure to law enforcement is required. See this link to
the HIPAA Privacy Rule (https://openstax.org/r/77HIPPA) for further information.

Verbal Communication
There are five basic elements of the communication cycle:

    · The sender/source: The sender is the one who transports the message. The sender role and the receiver role
        interact with one another in two-person communication.

    · The message: The message is the intended purpose or content of the communication, what is said, relayed, or
        delivered.

    · The channel or mode of communication: The channel is the manner through which the communication takes
        place. Is it through visual, auditory, or tactile senses?

    · The receiver: The receiver is the one who gathers the message.
    · Feedback: The feedback is the actual response to the sender.

Because this is a cycle, the elements follow one another, and the process continues, sometimes fluidly and
sometime with gaps.

The closer the relationship or how much the two parties have in common often influences how similar the intent of
the sent message is to the received message. Meaning and response will be more closely aligned when parties have
more in common.

Nonverbal Communication
Communication that takes place without words is called nonverbal communication. It includes body movements,
facial expressions (called affect), and gestures. It also includes nonverbal sounds, such as sighing, laughing,
humming, or chuckling. Body movements and facial expressions, such as eye-rolling, grimacing, tapping the foot,
crossing the legs and arms, posture, and eye contact or the lack of eye contact, help nurses see the emotion behind
the words when communicating with a client. Nurses must be aware that there can be nonverbal messages behind
their own body movements and facial expressions.

Sometimes the emotions revealed by nonverbal cues are different than the words that are accompanying them. As a
nurse, it is vital to observe and assess the nonverbal signals clients are offering, both during conversations and at
times when not verbally communicating with one another. If the client is squirming in their seat while being asked
questions about their interaction with a person they are in conflict with, it tells the nurse the client is uncomfortable
and to inquire about this feeling. Often, clients are unable to disclose their feelings verbally until the nurse points
out the nonverbal signals. This can be an effective way to encourage clients to express themselves verbally, allowing
the nonverbal to match the verbal.

Take note of the fact that in American culture, eye contact and head nodding demonstrate acknowledgment and are
viewed as positive and agreeable accompaniments to interactions with words. At the same time, however, eye
88  3 · Communication, Perception, and Assessment

    contact that is maintained for too long or in an intense manner can be interpreted as rude or jarring and aggressive.
    However, in some other cultures, eye contact does not indicate accord or agreement, but may be perceived as
    disrespectful. Likewise, although nodding in America generally indicates agreement, in some other cultures, it
    actually can mean "no" or "thank you" instead. Nurses must be aware of the possible meanings and interpretations
    of common gestures, facial expressions, and body movements across different cultures. The nurse must be mindful
    that gestures and expressions in one culture may not mean the same thing in another. Therefore, the nurse needs to
    be culturally sensitive. See Chapter 8 Cultural Considerations for more information on cultural awareness.

    Clients are aware of the nurse's facial expressions, so it is vital that nurses know what they look like when they are
    speaking (and not speaking) and how to convey concern, caring, and no judgment. If the nurse's face expresses
    surprise at a client response, for example, the client may feel like they answered a question incorrectly and may
    attempt to alter their response to please the nurse or get the "right" answer.

    Nonverbal information from a client can often provide a more accurate assessment of the client's feelings than the
    verbal information. A client may say they are not in pain or are not sad, but then wince when the nurse reaches to
    assess the area or have a flat affect conveying sadness. The reason this information is often more accurate is there
    is less conscious control over nonverbal actions. If the verbal and nonverbal cues do not match, the nurse must be
    aware of this and note it as part of the assessment.

            CULTURAL CONTEXT

    Trust and Health Communication

    As a nurse, it is important to be culturally sensitive with each client. There are certain cultural groups that, because
    of historical events or cultural mores, do not trust health providers and information; trust is built over time with
    health-care providers and nurses. When communicating with members of cultures that lack trust in the health-care
    system, it is important to ask the client if and how they prefer to be touched and to explain the unknown as much as
    possible. Nurses should convey respect and understanding, should ask for clarification, and should restate what the
    client is saying to ensure that the nurse is understanding correctly.

    Along with this lack of trust, according to Maercker et al. (2019), certain groups also hold a strong belief in fatalism,
    that life events are determined by forces outside one's control. As nurses engage with people with fatalistic beliefs,
    it is important to acknowledge and discuss some of these beliefs with them before offering assistance.
    Understanding this can help the nurse communicate better with the client. Overall, clients want to be well and want
    to know they are on the road to wellness. With some information and sensitivity, nurses can help clients from all
    cultures by empowering them with the tools to feel more in control of their health and to care for themselves.

    Barriers to Therapeutic Communication

    Nurses should be mindful of barriers to therapeutic communication so they can overcome the obstacles to
    communicate with clients effectively. Several common barriers to optimal therapeutic communication that nurses
    should avoid include challenging, probing, changing the subject, becoming defensive, providing false reassurances,
    disagreeing, judging, rejecting, and minimizing importance to the client. Here are some other barriers the nurse
    should consider.

    Inattentive Listening
    Clients notice when a nurse is not tuned into the communication. If the nurse breaks eye contact, appears to be
    daydreaming, fidgets, talks over the client, or asks a new question without waiting for an answer to the last one, the
    nurse is not being attentive. Other obvious inattentive behaviors include tapping the foot or pen on the table, looking
    at a watch or clock frequently in the interaction, or gazing at the computer or out the window while the client
    speaks. Nurses should make a concerted effort not only to be attentive, but also to communicate attentiveness.
    Utilizing similar or the same words a client says verbally communicates active listening. A nonverbal cue like
    nodding can go a long way toward making it clear that the nurse is listening.

    Nurses may record data during interaction with clients, and this should be done with consideration of the client's
    perception. A brief request or explanation can contribute to the therapeutic quality of the interaction, such as, "I will

3.1 · Therapeutic Communication and Relationships                                                                          89

make a few notes while we talk," or "I will be entering some information into the computer."

Using Medical Terminology
When a nurse uses medical terminology without defining or explaining it clearly, it may create a barrier to
communication with the client. Medical jargon can confuse a client, cause anxiety for them, and create a power
differential between the nurse and client. The client may ultimately feel less informed because they do not
understand the words the nurse is using and do not feel comfortable revealing their lack of understanding. At the
same time, it is important that the nurse not talk down to the client; understanding and meeting the client where
they are in terms of ability to understand information related to their health is a skill nurses should develop.

Asking Personal Questions Unrelated to the Visit
Asking inappropriate questions for the sake of interest is invasive. If the client chooses to communicate personal
information, they will, but the nurse should not inquire about it. Examples of inappropriate questions would be
those that address political party affiliation or views on reproductive issues, or questions that challenge the client's
coping, such as "Why do you always show up here when you are in trouble?" or "Don't you think it is time for you to
stay on your medications?"

Assessment questions should not include presumptions such as, "Since you refuse to answer the question about
sex, are you gay?" These types of questions are inappropriate, judgmental, and cruel. Another is "I see you sitting
close to that other male who visits you, daily. That is not your spouse. Is he your other spouse?" Again, this is
intrusive. The nurse can ask the question as, "How are you related to the male visitor who comes daily?" The client
can then answer as they want.

The nurse may have to gather personal information for therapeutic purposes, but should do it in a nonthreatening
way. There are assessment data that will lead a nurse to ask personal questions to collect further information about
the client or their situation. An example is if the client presents with signs and symptoms of physical abuse.
Inquiring about how a bruise, abrasion, or laceration was acquired may lead the nurse to dig deeper with
questioning. That client may show signs of apprehension and shifting eye contact if these questions require the
client to admit abuse. This can be a very sensitive issue for the client. The nurse should be cognizant of this. The
nurse must remain calm and professional. The nurse could say to the client, "I'm concerned about your safety. I can
understand if this conversation is uncomfortable for you. I am here to help you and keep you safe." A caring
approach can help reassure the client that the nurse is seeking to gain a better understanding and thus advocate for
the client.

Expressing Approval or Disapproval
Nurses should not agree or disagree with clients' values and beliefs. It is the nurse's responsibility to respect clients
who carry different types of beliefs, whether they are in accord with the nurse's or are diametrically opposed. If
nurses use words, such as should, ought, good, bad, right, or wrong, these terms can send the message that the
nurse is judging the client or their decision. The nurse may agree with the client's decision process or the actual
decision, just not the value of the decision. A therapeutic response may be, "It sounds like you have given this some
thought," or "I can see you have made a decision, tell me how you came to this outcome."

Changing the Subject
When a client is disclosing something that is painful or personal, the nurse needs to use therapeutic techniques to
show the client that the information is important and offer care and empathy while this disclosure is happening.
Often, nurses who are uncomfortable with the client's information will dismiss the message by changing the topic of
discussion. Instead of changing the subject, nurses in this situation should use active listening and ask clarifying
questions to keep the message flowing. Clients could view changing the subject as insensitive and uncaring.

Making Remarks That Are Minimizing
Saying something like, "At least you are not here for treatment for terminal cancer; it could be worse" conveys a lack
of concern. These types of remarks, though they may be intended to offer a broader perspective, belittle a client's
message and feelings. They imply that the nurse is not taking the client's questions or condition seriously. Any
statement that begins with "at least" communicates one should be grateful for what is not happening. It implies
that the problem the client is experiencing could be worse and to consider themselves fortunate. This is not an
empathic response and works against the nurse's objectives because the goal is to have the client open up and
90  3 · Communication, Perception, and Assessment

    share more about their feelings and situation.

    Providing False Reassurance
    Similarly, when nurses offer trite responses to a client who is seriously distraught, it can come across as not
    genuine. It may be the intention of the nurse to offer hope or assurance when saying to a grieving parent, for
    instance, "In a few years, this will look totally different to you." But the client may actually feel discounted and as if
    their feeling is not valid now, in the moment. The nurse can explore open-ended questions to encourage the client to
    discover their voice related to the issue. A better alternative statement of assurance may be, "I am sorry for your
    loss, grief is hard work and takes time." Another alternative to speaking or replying to the client is to actively listen
    to the client's thoughts and feelings. This allows the client to feel heard and validated.

    Expecting Justifications
    Asking "why" can imply an accusation or judgment and often results in defensiveness. For example, suppose a
    nurse asks a client, "Why did you take all the pills in the bottle, and then call 911?" In response, a client may feel
    challenged to defend their actions rather than dig deeper to the underlying emotions behind the actions. Instead,
    the nurse can ask, "Help me understand the desire to hurt yourself" or "Tell me your feelings at this time of self-
    harm." These questions show concern and caring for the client and allow the client to explore the reason for their
    actions without feeling judged or defensive.

    Disagreeing with the Client
    Challenging the client's perception of a situation can also create a barrier to therapeutic communication. It implies
    that they are lying, misinformed, or uneducated. For example, a nurse says to a client who has anorexia, "Your
    weight is exactly the same as last week, so you haven't stayed on your nutritional plan in spite of you telling me you
    are hungry at lunchtime." This statement accuses the client of noncompliance and lying, which can only serve to
    make the client feel attacked, guilty, and defensive, and that they have "failed" their plan of care. A better response
    is: "The numbers on the scale are the same as last week. Can you give me your food list for last week's meals?" This
    helps the client explore with the nurse the reasons for the lack of weight change and is not challenging the client's
    statement that they were hungry at lunchtime.

    Knowing what not to do is part of learning how to care for clients. Self-awareness and knowledge of these
    communication barriers can help nurses enhance their therapeutic communication techniques and form positive
    and productive nurse-client relationships.

    Therapeutic Nurse-Client Relationships

    A therapeutic relationship is a healthy relationship that develops over time, and is based on mutual trust and
    respect. In the relationship, there is a nurturing of health, hope, wellness, empathy, and therapeutic interventions to
    help the client through their current encounter. It evolves through therapeutic communication and by understanding
    the phases of the nurse-client healing relationship. Here are the four phases of the therapeutic relationship as
    outlined by Peplau (1952):

      1. Pre-orientation phase: During this phase, the nurse self-reflects on their feelings, fears, and thoughts on the
            client and the client's situation. The nurse analyzes their own personal and professional strengths and
            weaknesses in the context of the client. They collect information about the client and prepare a plan of care.
            This phase can be done after bedside report or grand rounds on the clients. This can often be collaborative
            with the nurse giving the report, discussing the best interventions or asking questions about what insightful
            thoughts, fears, or feelings the nurse has on the client and the circumstances they are currently in.

      2. Orientation phase: This phase is marked by establishing rapport with the client, gaining trust, and creating an
            environment where the client feels safe and accepted. The nurse gently starts the communication and collects
            data about the client's feelings and reason for seeking assistance. The nurse also identifies problem areas and
            plans interventions. The nurse then establishes, with the client's collaboration, mutual goals to help solve the
            problem(s). The nurse also explains the plan of care to the client. This includes when and how long the nurse
            will spend with the client and when expected discharge or termination of the relationship may occur.

      3. Working phase: This is the phase where most of the therapeutic interventions occur. The nurse and client work
            as a team to identify stressors, promote insight into the client's problems, and find solutions and ways to
            implement them. During this phase, the nurse collects more data on the client, promotes healthy coping

                                                       3.1 · Therapeutic Communication and Relationships                 91

        mechanisms, and helps the client understand their own behavioral changes by encouraging self-evaluation.
        The nurse is consistently encouraging the client to function independently and redefine the problem as
        needed.
  4. Termination phase: This is a critical phase in the nurse-client relationship, and, as mentioned above, is set at
        the Orientation phase. The main point in the plan of care is to have the client resolve their issues with
        independence and confidence. This is the phase that brings the relationship to an end. The nurse explains the
        reality of the separation and evaluates the effectiveness of therapy and the progress toward goals. The nurse
        and client mutually explore the feelings and behavior related to termination.

Nurses should be aware of these phases and assess progress toward the mission of each one, but should also know
that the phases do not necessarily work chronologically. They are more fluid in nature, changing as the nurse and
client work together and develop a relationship tailored to the client's needs. These phases apply to relationships
that have a short or longer time frame and in situations that are emergent or long-term. The therapeutic relationship
requires having respect for each other. Respect within the relationship means honoring each other's boundaries
within the relationship.

Physical Boundaries
Relationships are characterized by different types of boundaries. It is important to establish and respect physical
boundaries in any human interaction. It is particularly critical when developing a therapeutic nurse-client
relationship where breach of physical boundaries may be part of the caregiving process. Physical boundaries include
what people perceive to be their intimate, personal space, social, and public spaces. These boundaries also include
who is allowed to be in these spaces and the degree to which (and by whom) they agree to be touched. According to
Van Edwards (2021), proxemic is how much physical distance individuals like to have between them when
conversing with other people. The anthropologist Edward Hall created the word in the early 1960s. He organized the
boundaries as four zones: the intimate space, personal space, social space, and public space (Table 3.1).

Zone      Distance                      What It Means

Space                                   not in any need for contact.

TABLE 3.1 Proxemic Distances

When interviewing a new client, it is important that the client feels physically safe to express themselves without
feeling threatened or defensive. Nurses should carefully assess each client's individual physical boundaries.
Because caregiving may naturally intrude on the client's physical space, it is paramount for the nurse to express
understanding of a client's boundaries, explain the need to cross them, ask for permission, and not be any more
intrusive than a situation requires. Physical boundaries can be specific to a person's culture. Therefore, nonverbal
communication, such as body language, is important to assess when thinking about physical boundaries.

Emotional Boundaries
The nurse needs to assess the client's emotional state and evaluate what is best for that client in terms of emotional
limits. Once noted, the nurse must be self-aware to separate their own feelings from the client's feelings. The nurse
can have compassion and empathy for the client's condition without passing judgment and becoming overly
involved in placating the client, maintaining respect for the client's emotional state. Respect toward the client and
their reason for seeking assistance should be part of the nurse's reflection during the communication. If the client is
92  3 · Communication, Perception, and Assessment

    depressed, for instance, they may not be able to answer all the questions in one sitting. This client may need blocks
    of time to discuss the elements of the admission assessment. The client who is crying or despondent may need to
    reach an emotionally neutral status with the help of the nurse and then the assessment can move forward.

    Social Boundaries
    Social boundaries represent another important consideration when developing a therapeutic relationship with a
    client. The nurse should avoid socializing with clients except when making small talk to open a conversation or start
    an interview. Opening with a bit of socializing often places the client in a relaxed state. After that, however, a nurse
    should not share intimate details about their life, should not ask invasive and treatment-irrelevant questions about
    the client's life, and should not take lunch or work breaks with clients. Maintaining professional boundaries takes
    self-reflection when a nurse finds themself reaching to create a friendship with a client.

    When nurses share their own feelings about their lives or situations, it often crosses a line and creates a
    nontherapeutic relationship with the client. This burdens the client with the nurse's feelings and problems. The
    nurse-client relationship should be a professional one, characterized by compassion, not a social one. Table 3.2 lists
    the differences between therapeutic and social relationships.

    Clinical Setting: Adult psychiatric unit
    Geographic Location: Washington, DC

    Sara is a novice nurse who recently began working in a psychiatric adult unit in Washington, DC. She finished
    orientation two weeks ago and has gone out with a few friends from work for dinner and to a peer's birthday party.

3.2 · Client Perception of Illness                                                                                          93

She comes to work one day to visit with a friend from work on her day off. During the visit, Sara notices a client she
admitted a few days prior. She says hello to him and asks how he is feeling. The young male, about her age, was
admitted with depression related to family issues. The client tells Sara that he is better and thinks he may be going
home in a few days. Sara smiles and tells him that this is great to hear.

The next day, Sara finds herself thinking about the client and decides to go up to the unit again on her day off. This
time, she asks to visit with the client specifically. Her peers ask her why she needs to visit the client. Sara is evasive
and begins to feel uncomfortable with the questioning. The charge nurse explains to Sara that her behavior is a
violation of the professional boundaries she needs to maintain with the client. Sara then says, "Oh, that's right; I'm
sorry. I should not be here on my day off asking to visit with a client." She turns and walks away, embarrassed.

When she returns to her car, she recalls the lessons on professional boundaries she learned in school. She reflects
on why she wanted to visit with the client. She thinks about it deeply and then returns home to journal about her
experience and feelings. After journaling, Sara comes to realize she is lonely. She desires a male friend or romantic
partner. She then thinks about why she would choose a current client to fulfill this and concludes that the client was
an easy person to meet and was physically attractive. After a while, Sara makes an appointment with a counselor to
talk about it. She takes the situation seriously and also makes an appointment with her supervisor and charge nurse.
She is transparent about her feelings and her actions. Sara tells the nursing leaders she realizes her thoughts and
actions were not professional and could have been burdensome to the client. Sara does not care for the client again,
and continues to seek professional help for her loneliness. About three months later, Sara is thankful for the
experience and has joined an art class to express her feelings, meet others, and learn a new hobby.

Treatment Issues and Obstacles

The focus should always be on the client, not on the nurse. If, because of crossed boundaries, the relationship starts
to become nontherapeutic, nurses should first seek self-awareness about the situation, then ask for and accept
feedback from peers and mentors about what path to take forward.

Other obstacles to creating therapeutic relationships when treating clients with psychiatric illnesses are side effects
of medications, symptoms of the illnesses, and chronicity of the client's diagnosis. Many clients enter psychiatric
treatment during a crisis of their illness. This can limit the development of the nurse-client relationship until the
crisis has subsided, medications reach a therapeutic level, and the environment is such that the client can
communicate well. Hallucinations and delusions as symptoms, until treated successfully, can inhibit a developing
nurse-client relationship. Sensory deficits can also encumber therapeutic relationships as can the chronic nature of
psychiatric illnesses, which can cause hopelessness in clients and nurses alike. The nurse may need to confront and
address their own conflicted feelings about clients' ongoing interventions with their own working peers and
supervisor. The nurse's conscious and unconscious behaviors and attitude affect the therapeutic relationship with
the client. If the therapeutic relationship becomes untherapeutic, this can have negative consequences for the
client's improvement and well-being.

3.2 Client Perception of Illness

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Discuss client beliefs about and stigmas associated with psychiatric-mental illness
    · Identify factors that influence the perception of psychiatric-mental illness
    · Review treatment compliance and resources for psychiatric-mental illness

Mental health, according to the World Health Organization (WHO, 2022a) is a "state of mental well-being that
enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to
their community" (para. 1). Mental disorders are "characterized by a clinically significant disturbance in an
individual's cognition, emotional regulation, or behavior" and are "usually associated with distress or impairment in
important areas of functioning" (WHO, 2022b, para. 1). Mental illness has been stigmatized for centuries.
Perceptions differ across groups, general public or professional, and those experiencing a mental illness. There are
numerous reasons behind the perceptions about mental illness, including cultural beliefs.
94  3 · Communication, Perception, and Assessment

    Client Beliefs and Stigma

    Where do people obtain or learn beliefs and attitudes in general? They come from numerous sources, including
    families, schools, workplaces, culture, society, and religion. Beliefs and attitudes are formed by those who teach,
    model, and influence people. Clients' beliefs about mental illness are often formed by societal stigma, cultural
    beliefs, and treatment issues specific to illnesses rather than by academic sources of information.

    There are many misconceptions about mental health in the United States. There are people who believe that
    individuals choose all of their behaviors. Some people do not understand the degree of pain associated with
    illnesses like depression and panic or anxiety disorder. They may believe that people dealing with depression are
    "just lazy," "don't want to work for a living wage," or "want to stay home and not have to interact with difficult
    people." Others may think that if a person combatting anxiety would "just get over their fear with enough willpower,
    they could function and not have a problem." These types of ideas and beliefs often lead to a stigma that can lead
    those living with mental illness to refuse help and begin to believe that they are beyond help, leading to thoughts of
    suicide.

    In the medical field, illness is related to the physical body and organs of the body. Research has shown that mental
    health or mental illness can also be related to the physical body. For example, chemicals in the brain called
    neurotransmitters are released and taken into the neurons, or cells of the brain, to allow the brain to function.
    Without the chemical release in the necessary amounts, correct timing, and proper reabsorption, the brain does not
    function at its optimum. In other words, mental illness has organic, physical causes.

    Another reason behind the stigma is the historic institutionalization of individuals living with mental illness. These
    clients were once considered incurable so found themselves housed in institutions where they possessed very few
    rights. This treatment approach created a stigma because clients' liberties were removed, so they were labeled as
    "separate," and they were not permitted to live in society. As pharmaceutical research advanced, however, new
    psychiatric medications came about to treat mental illness. Clients receiving effective medications no longer found
    themselves locked in hospitals and instead were able to live and function within their communities.

    When nurses and other health professionals are educated on these facts, the stigma of mental illness lessens.
    Nurses are taught to observe the client as a holistic being living with an illness. In these cases, the illness involves
    thoughts, mood, and behaviors.

    Factors Influencing Perceptions

    Different cultures may have different beliefs and attitudes about mental health and mental illness, and this affects
    how clients perceive their own conditions. For example, some indigenous cultures in America, such as the Apache
    and the Iroquois, may believe a person exhibiting signs and symptoms of mental illness is possessed by evil spirits
    (Danchevskaya, 2020). For this reason, an indigenous practitioner (or someone intimately knowledgeable about the
    culture) may be the best person to interview and care for such clients. The indigenous health-care provider knows
    the rituals and can create an environment that shows support for indigenous beliefs while treating with other
    techniques. Western medical methods to treat mental illness can exist with traditional underpinnings.

    Perceptions that influence behaviors make up a person's belief system. Nursing consideration of the client's
    perceptions can clarify assessment findings. Some who value competition may not seem cooperative to those not
    sharing that value. Those who suppress outward responses may be undertreated for pain. Clients distrustful of
    providers may receive misdiagnoses, inappropriate medication dosages, or ineffective monitoring for medication
    side effects.

    Families may be blended across cultures, religions, belief systems, and languages, so nurses can only rely on the
    therapeutic relationship to establish a connection with clients. Nurses must focus on client-centered care and
    inquire about the client's social identity, for example, the nurse may say, "Within your culture or personal beliefs,
    what are ways we can help you while you are here?"

    Treatment Compliance and Resources

    Clients' beliefs and attitudes factor heavily into their understanding of and compliance with treatment. When
    assessing compliance, meaning adherence to treatment recommendations, there are many factors that the nurse
    must consider in mental health. Some of these factors are within the control of the client and others are not.

    Access for free at openstax.org
3.3 · Nursing Assessment and Clinical Tools                                                                               95

Factors that the client cannot control are termed nonmodifiable risk factors and are important to consider. Cognitive
impairments, poor insight, cost factors, limited access to health care, and the lack of social support are examples of
these factors. Factors that the client can control related to compliance are known as modifiable risk factors. These
can include clients' attitudes toward their own health, becoming informed about their medications and the side
effects, and discussing these matters with their provider and nurse. The nurse should establish a therapeutic
relationship to encourage health plan compliance. The nurse can offer information related to the client's questions
to help the client comply with their treatment plan. The nurse can also inform the client about local resources that
can help with social connections, costs, and access to health care. Often, there are social resources the nurse can
refer the client to for other issues the client may be facing, such as housing or food insecurities.

Directions that clients take related to the problems with their health are called a help-seeking pathway. Because of
the stigma related to mental illness, there are perceptions that influence clients who want help and affect their
treatment compliance. Often, clients do not know how or where to go for help. The primary care provider is often the
first link to reaching out for assistance. There may be reluctance to confide the issues related to mental illness. If
the client has a therapeutic relationship with the primary care provider, this can aid in getting assistance. Clients
who do not have a primary care provider or a local clinic to attend for health-care needs encounter a major barrier to
assistance. For the clients who are on medications, they may experience side effects that they cannot explain or
describe. These side effects may draw unwanted attention to them and require explanation to their peers,
coworkers, friends, family members, and others in their circles. A cultural aspect of the United States is that people
can independently resolve their own problems without seeking outside help. These assumptions negatively
influence a client if they seek help. Educating the client and their significant others is very important to avoid or
change perceptions related to seeking assistance. An analogy often used is if a person has a physical problem,
seeking help from a medical professional is expected. The same can be applied to the one experiencing a mental
health problem. There are health pathways to assist, treat, and potentially resolve the problem.

There are multiple sources from which clients and families can obtain information about mental health and mental
illness. The CDC is a great place to start when investigating psychiatric illness. Here is a list of websites that offer
information on mental health issues and how to cope.

    · Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (https://openstax.org/r/77CDC)
    · Mental Health First Aid (https://openstax.org/r/77NCMW) from the National Council for Mental Wellbeing

3.3 Nursing Assessment and Clinical Tools

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Compare a physical head-to-toe nursing assessment to a psychiatric-mental health (PMH) physical
        nursing assessment

    · Identify characteristics of a psychosocial assessment
    · Describe the Clinical Judgment Measurement Model (CJMM) to recognize, analyze, and prioritize

        assessment data

It is important to follow the nursing process when caring for psychiatric clients. Using a holistic approach, the nurse
should conduct both physical and mental aspects of assessment. Data from the physical assessment complements
the psychiatric-mental health (PMH) assessment. This information may come from the medical record, interview, or
physical examination and includes asking the client about existing physical health conditions (comorbidities) that
may be affected by medications utilized to treat the mental health condition.

The Clinical Judgment Measurement Model will help the nurse with clients who present with emergent or chronic
signs and symptoms of mental illness. The focus in that model is on recognizing, analyzing, and prioritizing the
findings. By the end of this section, it should be clear what to focus on for the different assessments and how to use
the critical information.
96  3 · Communication, Perception, and Assessment

    Physical Nursing Assessment

    The nursing process starts with the assessment of the client. The physical assessment contributes to the
    psychosocial assessment. Clients in mental health treatment may be pregnant, using substances, or living with one
    or multiple chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes or hypertension. The psychiatric diagnosis may be caused
    or worsened by a physical factor, such as thyroid disorder or cardiac medications contributing to depression. During
    the physical assessment, the nurse begins to establish rapport with the client by introducing themselves and
    explaining the process of the assessment. It is essential the nurse be honest and allow for some flexibility in the
    assessment based on the client's behavior, mood, stability, mental status, and general health. It is helpful to begin
    with creating the environment and ensuring the client's privacy and safety. Ask the client what brought them into the
    health-care setting. Then, move into the details.

    In a general hospital, psychiatric units may have an exam or treatment room equipped for medical procedures, such
    as suturing, wound care, women's health, specimen collection, or full physical examinations. These procedures may
    be performed by professional consultants asked to visit the client. Clients from the hospital's emergency
    department or from another facility may receive medical clearance as a prerequisite to psychiatry admission.

    The physical data obtained by the PMH nurse is likely to be basic, and specifically indicated to clarify or add to
    psychosocial assessment findings. A personal search is policy in many treatment settings and involves a clothing
    check for items that are not allowed and observation of the client's skin for rashes, wounds, and physical signs of
    abuse. Sometimes, clients are given different clothing to wear in the unit.

    Vital signs are obtained and the client is asked about allergies and medications. The nurse may follow standing
    orders for routine or basic lab work and possible X-rays to assist the provider with diagnosis and to discover any
    issues that need further follow-up. The nurse should complete a neurological assessment initially because this
    baseline is necessary for the nurse to observe any decline or improvement in the client. The neuro assessment
    includes:

        · Explaining to the client what the nurse will do and asking for permission to begin.
        · Orienting to person, place, and time. The nurse will ask the client their name and date of birth, and verify with

            name badge/bracelet and chart information. This can include a picture of the client. This orientation often
            contains general knowledge questions: Who is the president of the United States? What season of the year is
            it?
        · The nurse then must check the pupils for PERRLA (pupils equal, round, reactive to light and accommodation).
        · Next, the nurse should check the client's tongue to see if it is midline and does not deviate.
        · The nurse all the while should be observing the behavior of the client to notice if they are cooperative with
            what the nurse is asking them to do.
        · The nurse will test the strength of the client's grip and their ability to push against the nurse's hands.
        · The nurse will assess the client's gait and how prone to falling the client may be. Asking the client to walk on
            their heels or stand on tiptoe can help the nurse determine the client's sense of balance.

    Once this is completed, the nurse should document the findings.

    The physical assessment could also include auscultation of the lung and heart sounds, and this must be done in a
    trauma-informed manner, which is discussed in Chapter 2 Fundamentals of Theories and Therapies. The nurse
    explains the procedure to the client and is mindful of the effect of touch. Nursing judgment determines how this part
    of the assessment will be done.

    It is vital to establish if the client is thinking about suicide or harming others. This is a crucial safety aspect. If the
    client reveals this, the nurse needs to gain more insight into how, when, and who they are thinking of hurting.

Psychosocial Assessment

A psychosocial assessment is an evaluation of a client's mental health in relation to their social well-being. The
psychosocial assessment looks at self-perception and the client's ability to function in the community. The objective
of the psychosocial assessment is to establish a baseline for the client and understand the client to provide the best
care possible for their mental health. Generally, the environment for the psychosocial assessment should be calm,
clean, private, and safe for the client and the nurse. The nurse can offer the client a chair. Nurses should help the
client to feel comfortable by using a nonjudgmental tone and exhibiting open posture. It is important for the nurse to
explain what will happen to help the client feel at ease, know what to expect, and alleviate the client's fear and
anxiety.

The psychosocial exam can begin by asking clients about their employment and continue by asking them to describe
their current living situation. While asking these questions, the nurse should observe the client's facial expressions,
bodily movements, eye contact, posture, tone of voice, and different noises or tics they may have. Is the client
jittery, looking around the room, lacking focus on the questions? Is the client mumbling, pointing to items that are
not present, or asking if you see something (a hallucination) that is not present? The nurse must be vigilant about
noticing the client's behavior and ask questions that help the client articulate what they are experiencing.
Questioning the client about their current and most recent mood is helpful. Inquiring about how the client copes
with stress can offer the nurse insight into how the client is coping now and how they have historically coped with
stressful events.

The aspects of the psychosocial assessment are:

    · home environment
    · education/employment
    · activities outside of work/hobbies
    · drug/tobacco/alcohol use
    · sexuality/gender
    · suicide risk
    · violence risk

Home environment means determining how safe and secure the home is and how the client relates to those in the
home: parents, children, spouse, significant other, roommate. How do they interact with them, are there frequent
arguments, how are arguments resolved, and how does the client cope with the living arrangement?

Education/employment establishes the level of education the client has at the time of the assessment and what the
client does for employment. Does the client have a plan or desire to change their job or education level and, if so,
how and where are they on this change?

Questions about activities outside the workplace/hobbies determine what the client enjoys doing with their time
outside of working. Does the client play sports, create art, enjoy woodworking or reading? What does the client
aspire to do for leisure?

Drug/alcohol use is important to assess because clients may use substances to self-medicate or cope with stress
and anxiety. Ask the client, without judgment, if there is use of illegal or illicit drugs. It is vital to know when and how
much the client has taken and regularly takes when it comes to illicit drugs or alcohol. Withdrawal can affect a
client's health and medical and mental stability. The nurse should also ask about over-the-counter medications,
herbal remedies, complementary medications, and prescription pain medications. There may be misuse and/or
contraindications between these and drugs to be prescribed.

Tobacco use/vaping is also something to investigate. Clients who use tobacco are often limited in their use when
admitted to hospital care units. Some facilities are completely nonsmoking. The assessment is a good time to
explain this and to determine if the client is a candidate for nicotine replacement therapy or smoking cessation
support. This is individualized and should be considered when discussing the plan of care for the client.
98  3 · Communication, Perception, and Assessment

    Sexuality also requires discussion. Sexuality covers partner preferences, whether or not the client is sexually active,
    and if they understand how to protect themselves from sexually transmitted infections, unintended pregnancy, and
    interpersonal violence. Further conversations on these topics can be part of the client's plan of care.

    Ask the client about their gender identity and preferred pronouns, and strictly abide by their voiced preferences.
    How the client identifies should be clear in the documentation, so the entire staff can be respectful.

    Risk Assessment
    The assessment evaluates suicide risk to ensure client safety. Often, clients feel relieved when a health professional
    asks them if they intend to hurt or kill themselves. There is a sense of relief that comes from someone noticing a
    problem and how much pain the client is in.

            LINK TO LEARNING

    The Suicide Prevention Resource Center produced a pocket card for the Suicide Assessment Five-Step Evaluation
    and Triage (SAFE-T) (https://openstax.org/r/77samhsa) for use by health-care providers. It provides triage
    guidelines, documentation guidelines, and treatment and intervention protocols.

    If the client admits to having thoughts of suicide, the nurse must ask deeper questions: What is your plan to do this?
    How and when are you thinking of carrying it out? How long have you been thinking about it? Affirming the client by
    telling them you are glad they were honest with you is important to demonstrate empathy and caring for the client
    under difficult circumstances.

            LINK TO LEARNING

    Read the APNA Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurse Essential Competencies for Assessment and Management of
    Individuals at Risk for Suicide (https://openstax.org/r/77apna) for important information about suicide prevention.

    Violence risk means asking the client if they think about hurting others. What plan do they have to carry out the
    violence, and do they have anything written down and where? It is also critical to ask the client if they own weapons
    and where they are. Continued surveillance of the client may be part of the safety plan.

    Asking these hard questions is vital to understanding where the client stands, what they are thinking, and how (and
    by what) they are being influenced. This assessment helps build trust and rapport with the client. Assuring the client
    that the information is confidential among the health-care team will encourage the client to be honest and
    forthcoming.

    Tools Available for Psychosocial Assessment
    There are many psychosocial assessment and mental health screening tools to use (Figure 3.5). The facility policy
    will dictate which tool to use. Here is a list of the most common assessments:

        · Mini Mental Status Exam
        · Mental Status Exam
        · Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)

Clinical Judgment Measurement Model

Clinical judgment is key to working with clients with psychiatric illness. When the client is in crisis, the nurse must
recognize the signs and symptoms and determine what action to take to keep the client and others safe. The
Clinical Judgment Measurement Model (CJMM) was developed by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing
to assist graduates to answer client care questions on the nurse licensure exam. The CJMM provides a nursing
100  3 · Communication, Perception, and Assessment

     framework to decipher client problems. The nurse must recognize cues, analyze them, decide if the cues are
     important enough to act on immediately or if can they wait, identify and prioritize problems, then generate and
     implement a plan of action/intervention/solution.

             LINK TO LEARNING

     Watch this quick video to see how the Clinical Judgment Measurement Model provides a framework to measure
     your clinical judgment (https://openstax.org/r/77clinicaljudg) on the NCLEX.

     There are many scenarios where a nurse practicing in psychiatric care should use this model. For example, suppose
     a client is admitted and is actively suicidal. The nurse recognizes the cues from the client, prioritizes the need for
     safety, then formulates the solutions to help the client. Another example is when the client is actively psychotic and
     is aggressive and hostile toward the other clients in the unit. The nurse again recognizes the cues of unpredictable
     behavior, lack of impulse control, and delusions. After recognizing the cues, the nurse will analyze the cues and
     determine actions, such as changing the client's room, administering certain medications immediately and others
     later if they can wait, and assigning a staff member to monitor the client's actions to keep everyone safe. The
     Clinical Judgment Measurement Model offers a guiding framework to assist the nurse to answer NCLEX questions
     about client care.

       CLINICAL JUDGMENT MEASUREMENT MODEL

       Applying the Clinical Judgment Measurement Model

       When treating a client who is actively suicidal or is aggressive and hostile toward other clients, the nurse can
       apply the steps of the CJMM:

           · Recognize cues, such as unpredictable behavior, lack of impulse control, and delusions.
           · Analyze cues to determine that the client is aggressive, hostile, or actively psychotic.
           · Determine actions, such as client room assignment, medication administration timed as indicated, or

               assigning a staff member to monitor the client's actions.

Summary

3.1 Therapeutic Communication and Relationships

Communication is an art and a science. The facets of communication--sender, message, channel or mode, recipient,
feedback--are consistent, but the human component brings in other considerations like emotions, nonverbal cues,
and boundaries. The nurse must continually strive to communicate in a therapeutic manner and avoid common
obstacles like inattention, false encouragement, and infringing on physical, emotional, and social boundaries. The
nurse must also learn to reflect on the interactions with clients to improve their active listening skills and nonverbal
communication and enhance their compassion.

3.2 Client Perception of Illness

Mental health and mental illness are complex and have many dimensions, in part because of beliefs and attitudes
toward the topics. Many clients have formed their beliefs from the cultures in which they were raised as children and
from their adult experiences. When a client is experiencing a mental illness, the perceptions of mental health
treatments can be the driving force behind whether or not the client seeks help and/or complies with treatment.
Education is one of the most important ways to influence perceptions and beliefs. Nurses are responsible to help
educate on mental health and should take an active part in this mission.

3.3 Nursing Assessment and Clinical Tools

The nurse should conduct physical and psychosocial assessments with psychiatric clients. The psychosocial
assessment includes questions about the client's environment, lifestyle, and mood and encourages the client to
express their problems. The Clinical Judgment Measurement Model, also addressed in this section, provides a
framework for understanding the client needs, how to prioritize their needs, and how to put in place interventions to
meet the needs and evaluate the outcomes.

CHAPTER OUTLINE
4.1 Foundations of Neurobiology
4.2 Psychopharmacology
4.3 Innovations in Mental Health

INTRODUCTION The human brain is responsible for interpreting and managing responses to environmental stimuli,
cognitive processes, emotions, learning, and memories. Human development is shaped by genetic determinants,
environmental influences, and human cognitive and emotional interpretations. Despite the explosion of
neuroscientific exploration over the past 60 years, the mysteries of the mind still abound, particularly when it comes
to mental health disorders. The practice of nursing integrates the neurobiological correlates of human behavior with
functional knowledge of how psychopharmaceuticals manage mental health disease. Nurses must develop the
knowledge and skills needed to provide nursing interventions to manage psychotropic medications. The
combination of knowledge of foundations of neurobiology and pharmaceuticals will facilitate the nurse's ability to
competently manage the following:

    · Evaluate the effectiveness of psychopharmaceuticals and alternative treatments using assessment data.
    · Assess side effects of psychopharmaceuticals and possible interactions with substances (alcohol, tobacco,

        and other drugs), food, other medications, or supplements.
    · Implement client-centered plans of care to manage side effects of psychopharmaceuticals or interactions

        with substances, food, other medications, or supplements.
    · Identify risks to the client's health and potential nursing diagnoses related to care and treatment.
    · Synthesize scientific evidence to provide health education on side effects, potential adverse effects, and

             health promotion strategies in those who are using psychopharmaceuticals.

     4.1 Foundations of Neurobiology

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Review the functions of the nervous system
         · Describe the role of neurotransmitters in human behavior
         · Explain the relationship between endocrine functioning and psychological and mental health disorders

     In order to understand mental health better, nurses must appreciate the underlying biological structures and
     mechanisms that guide human behavior. This section presents the fundamentals of neuroanatomy, cellular
     structures, neurotransmitters, and pathways that are integral in the central and peripheral nervous system. An
     understanding of these systems and their interactions with pharmacology principles will create a foundation for
     psychopharmacology in the next section.

     Basic Principles of Neurobiology

     Neurobiology is the study of the nervous system and how the brain works. The nervous system is made up of the
     central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system, and affects actions and senses. It is responsible for
     interacting with the external environment and managing the human internal environment. The nervous system
     begins developing during the first few days of embryonic growth and is influenced by a variety of maternal factors,
     such as environmental stress, exposure to toxins and hazards, health status, and nutrition. The brain's most rapid
     growth occurs during the third month of gestation through the child's first year after birth.

     Breaking it down, the neuron is the fundamental cell of the nervous system, and it is responsible for receiving and
     transmitting electrical signals across the synaptic space. A human is born with most all of their neurons at birth
     though neurogenesis continues through life. Through environmental learning, synaptic growth--a process by which
     neurons in the brain connect--will occur rapidly during the first six years of life, after which synaptic pruning occurs,
     which is an automatic brain function that eliminates unused synapses, allowing new growth. Psychotropic
     medications work across the synapses to affect neurotransmitters, but more on that later.

     Cells of the Nervous System
     The neuron or the nerve cell is the primary cell or unit of the nervous system. It is responsible for transmitting an
     electrical and chemical message to other neurons or organs in the human body. It consists of a cell body or soma,
     which contains a nucleus. Extending from the cell body are multiple dendrites that receive information from other
     neurons. Once this information is received from other neurons, the information travels to the axon hillock, down the
     axon (the long narrow part of the neuron where impulses are conducted) to the end that contains the
     neurotransmitters, called the axon terminus (Figure 4.2). Here, the information either continues or fades.

Three types of neurons transmit information in the brain: (1) sensory or afferent neurons, which send information
from the outside to the brain, (2) associational or interneurons, which connect neurons primarily within the CNS,
and (3) motor neurons, which take information away from the CNS to effector organs or skeletal muscle at a
neuromuscular junction, where muscle fibers and nerves connect.

The other primary cells in the nervous system are called glial cells, or microglia, which provide structure, repair, and
scaffolding for the migration of the nerve cells. There are three types of glial cells: astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and
Schwann cells. The astrocytes are only located in the central nervous system and are involved with building new
synaptic connections and ensuring an appropriate chemical environment for the neuron. In the central nervous
system, the axon hillock is surrounded by a myelin sheath, made up of oligodendrocytes, which maintain and
generate this sheath. In the peripheral nervous system, the myelin sheath is made up of Schwann cells, which
surround the neuron and keep them alive. This myelin sheath is an insulating layer that allows for an action
potential to travel successfully along the length of the axon at the nodes of Ranvier, which are gaps in the myelin
sheath. This action potential is called saltatory conduction.

psychopharmaceuticals.

The Synapse
The synapse is the small area where two neurons converge: the terminus of one axon and another postsynaptic
neuron. The terminus of one axon is called the presynaptic bulb or knob. Inside the presynaptic bulb are small
vesicles of neurotransmitters that are stimulated into release to the synapse. A neurotransmitter is a chemical
messenger that carries a message from one neuron to another. These neurotransmitters work like a key in a lock.
They unlock an excitatory or inhibitory response by interacting with a receptor in the dendrite at the other end of the
synapse. Psychotropic drugs have action at the synaptic space.

There are four types of connections at synapses: axo-axonic, which are between the axons of one neuron to the
axon of another neuron; axo-somatic, which are from the axon of one neuron to the soma of another neuron; axo-
dendritic, which are from the axon of one neuron to the dendrites of another neuron; and dendro-dendritic, which
are dendrite to dendrite.

     provides a review of this critical part of the neurobiology implicated in the use of psychotropic medications.

     Neurotransmitters and Human Behavior

     Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that are synthesized and packaged within the neuron; they carry
     chemical messages across a synaptic cleft and bind to a receptor on a postsynaptic neuron (Figure 4.3). This
     process advances the excitatory or inhibitory signal. Neurotransmitters can have excitatory effects (they promote
     the generation of an action potential) or inhibitory effects (they inhibit an action potential). The main types of
     neurotransmitters are monoamines, amino acids, and neuropeptides.

     This Khan Academy video about the neurotransmitters targeted by psychopharmaceutical medications
     (https://openstax.org/r/77NeurotranType) provides more information.

     Monoamines
     Monoamines are neurotransmitters that contain a single amino group. They have a broad range of effects on the
     central and peripheral nervous systems. Four monoamine neurotransmitters relevant to mental health are:

         · The neurotransmitter norepinephrine, also known as noradrenaline, promotes alertness, mental focus, pain
             mitigation, and memory retrieval. Decreased levels of norepinephrine are theoretically responsible for
             depression and are implicated in fibromyalgia, attention-deficit disorders, and chronic fatigue syndrome.

4.1 · Foundations of Neurobiology                                                                                       111

        Research suggests that too much norepinephrine is responsible for psychotic states and mania.
    · The neurotransmitter serotonin, also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine, is involved with mood and sleep

        regulation, mitigation of pain, aggression and sexual behavior, stimulation of gastric secretion, and other
        hormonal behaviors. Decreases in serotonin may result in depressive states, weight gain, sedation, and pain.
        Increases in serotonin can cause anxiety and, potentially, psychotic states.
    · The neurotransmitter dopamine manages mood states, attention and focus, motor control and regulation,
        sexual gratification, reward and motivation, and lactation. Decreased dopamine is related to depression,
        attention-deficit disorders, and Parkinson's disease. Increased dopamine is related to psychotic states and
        mania.
    · The neurotransmitter histamine is responsible for management of awake states, homeostasis, appetite, and
        smooth muscle contractions. Decreases in histamine cause sleepiness and weight gain, while increases in
        histamine cause alert states.

Amino Acid Neurotransmitters
The amino acid neurotransmitters include gamma-aminobutyric acid, glycine, and glutamate, which have
widespread effects on the brain and spinal cord. These neurotransmitters are involved in most excitatory and
inhibitory functions in the nervous system.

    · One of the major inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters in the brain is gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). It
        decreases all sensory impulses, including pain and cognition. Decreases in GABA are responsible for anxiety
        states and insomnia. Overactivation of GABA through medications, such as hypnotics, benzodiazepines, or
        alcohol causes central nervous sedation and potential coma or death.

    · Glycine has a stimulant as well as inhibitory effect within the central nervous system, which may affect
        physiological functions, such as immunity, digestion and appetite, pain response, and sleep. Psychosocial
        effects may appear as alterations in mood and cognition.

    · Glutamic acid, or glutamate, is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. Glutamate is primarily
        involved with sensory transmission and learning and memory. Research demonstrates that glutamate
        dysregulation and diminished function at certain glutamate neurons cause hyperactivity in other brain areas
        and potentially psychosis. Increases in glutamate can cause neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration.

Neuropeptides
Neuropeptides, a third type of neurotransmitters, comprise small chains of amino acids and are widely distributed
within the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). Neuropeptides responsible for pain
mitigation include endorphins and enkephalins, which function as neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, or
neurohormones in the CNS. These molecules act at opioid receptors and function to block pain signals.

Acetylcholine
The neurotransmitter acetylcholine is responsible for activation at the neuromuscular junction. Decreases in
acetylcholine have been implicated in disease states, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's. Increases
in acetylcholine, usually caused by cholinergic crisis (overstimulation of receptors at neuromuscular junctions), are
manifested by muscular cramping and weakness, increased salivation, lacrimation, paralysis, and blurry vision.

Central and Peripheral Nervous System

Mental health is a product of genetics, the human, the environment, and the interaction between them. Humans are
constantly reading information from the environment and interpreting it. Nursing strategies make an impact at
varying levels of these interactions, so it is imperative to understand how the brain works and interprets the outside
world. Comprehending the organization and function of each brain organ or system provides the nurse with the
ability to assess symptoms accurately and target them with effective interventions.

The nervous system is divided into two different systems: the central nervous system (CNS), which includes the
brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which includes the cranial and spinal nerves. Both
are specifically affected by the action of psychotropic medications.

The Central Nervous System
The central nervous system is composed of the brain and the spinal cord. The brain comprises millions of
interconnected neurons and other structures. It monitors and responds to external and internal environments,
112  4 · Neurobiology and Pharmacological Standards

     stores and retrieves memories, maintains homeostasis, and manages emotions. There are three main divisions
     within the brain: the forebrain (prosencephalon), the midbrain (mesencephalon), and the hindbrain
     (rhombencephalon). Table 4.1 parses the functions of the various parts of the brain, which are illustrated in Figure
     4.4.

     The other part of the CNS, the spinal cord, transmits sensory information from the periphery to the brain and
     manages behavioral responses via sensory and motor tracts. The spinal cord originates from the medulla
     oblongata--which forms the connection between the brainstem and the spinal cord--and ends at the conus
     medullaris with nerve bundles extended from the structure called the cauda equina, the collection of nerves at the
     terminus of the spinal cord. The spinal cord is divided into five sections: cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and
     coccygeal. The spinal cord has an inner core of gray matter that contains the cell bodies of neurons and an outer

core of white matter tracts. These outer tracts are divided into three different functional sections: the posterior or
dorsal horn, made of interneurons and sensory neurons (afferent); the anterior or ventral horn, made up of motor
neurons (efferent); and the lateral horn, which contains cells involved with the autonomic nervous system.

Memory and Learning
Human memory is recording, retaining, and retrieving environmental stimuli. There are two types of memories. One
type is declarative memories, which include episodic and semantic memories of personal events, facts, and
experiences. Declarative memories are formed in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. The other type is non-
declarative memories, which include those that individuals cannot explicitly recollect consciously, like implicit,
performance-based, and motor memories. Four areas of the brain are responsible for managing memory and
learning. Inside the brain's medial temporal lobe are the hippocampus and the amygdala (Figure 4.5). The
hippocampus is part of the limbic system and is responsible for encoding memories, learning, and perception of
space. Inside the hippocampus are NMDA glutamate receptors that manage memories through long-term
potentiation, which is a process of synaptic strengthening through signal increases in the neuron. Stress can cause
dendritic pruning in the hippocampus, resulting in memory deficits. The amygdala is a pair of small almond-shaped
regions located anterior to the hippocampus and is responsible for the formation and encoding of memories,
especially those that are highly emotionally charged, such as trauma. High levels of stress can augment the fear
startle response mediated by the amygdala resulting in increased levels of norepinephrine, insomnia, high blood
pressure, and increased pulse.

FIGURE 4.5 Structures arranged around the edge of the cerebrum constitute the limbic lobe, which includes the amygdala, hippocampus,
and cingulate gyrus, and connects to the hypothalamus. (modification of work from Anatomy and Physiology, 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice
University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

The third area of the brain responsible for managing memories is the diencephalon (Figure 4.6). The diencephalon
is the central area of the brain located above the brainstem, including the epithalamus, thalamus, subthalamus, and
hypothalamus. Areas within the diencephalon are responsible for forming recognition-based memories. Lesions to
the diencephalon can potentially cause amnesia. Finally, the basal ganglia are a group of subcortical nuclei most
often associated with managing motor control, primarily sequential movements; the basal ganglia are involved with
the formation of procedural memories. Diseases and disorders involved in the basal ganglia include Parkinsonism,
problems controlling movements, medication induced disorders, such as akathisia and dystonia, and Huntington's
disease.
114  4 · Neurobiology and Pharmacological Standards

     FIGURE 4.6 The diencephalon is composed primarily of the thalamus and hypothalamus, which together define the walls of the third
     ventricle. The thalami are two elongated, ovoid structures on either side of the midline that make contact in the middle. The hypothalamus
     is inferior and anterior to the thalamus, culminating in a sharp angle to which the pituitary gland is attached. (modification of work from
     Anatomy and Physiology, 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

     Movement
     Several areas of the brain manage voluntary control over movement. The first is the motor cortex, which is in the
     cerebral cortex and is subdivided into three areas: the primary, premotor, and supplementary motor areas. The
     primary motor cortex is located along the precentral gyrus and is responsible for generating efferent neuronal
     impulses down the spinal cord to manage movement. The premotor cortex lies rostral to the primary motor cortex
     and is responsible for managing coordinated motor responses. Finally, the supplementary motor areas lie anterior to
     the primary motor cortex and manage complex, sequenced movements in proximal muscles. Also involved in
     movement are the basal ganglia, a group of subcortical nuclei associated with managing motor control. Likewise, the
     substantia nigra, the most prominent nucleus in the midbrain, contains a dopaminergic nucleus that manages
     motor control and involves disease states, such as Parkinson's, Huntington's, and extrapyramidal symptoms. Finally,
     the cerebellum is in the basal part of the brain between the cerebrum and the brain stem. It is responsible for
     balance, walking, standing, and measuring distance and timing.

     Pain
     The International Association for the Study of Pain defines pain as "an unpleasant sensory and emotional
     experience associated with or resembling that associated with actual or potential tissue damage." Pain is a
     phenomenon that has biological, environmental, and social determinants. It is a personal experience that is
     memory-driven and emotionally interpreted. Pain has implications for mental health through associations with
     anxiety, fear, powerlessness, social withdrawal, depression, and substance dependence. The processing of pain is
     called nociception. Nerve cell endings distributed throughout the body that initiate pain sensation through afferent
     pathways are nociceptors. They are categorized by the type of pain stimulus that is transmitted. A-Delta (A) fibers
     transmit pressure, mechanical deformation, and extreme temperature sensations. C fibers transmit burning pain,
     itch, and dull ache. A-Beta (A) fibers manage touch and vibration sensations. Pain sensations from nociceptors
     travel to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, where they synapse with an interneuron and then cross over to the
     contralateral spinothalamic tract. The afferent sensations then transcend to the brain through the brainstem, the
     thalamus, and the somatosensory cortex. The somatosensory cortex interprets the existence, location, and intensity
     of pain. The reticular formation, limbic system, prefrontal cortex, and brainstem interpret the emotional response to
     pain based on current and past experiences. Finally, the cerebral cortex evaluates pain perception, threshold, and
     tolerance. The response to pain is called pain modulation, and it can occur during all phases of the pain process.
     The response to pain from the brain to the periphery is called the descending or efferent pathway. Various

excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters that work in the central and peripheral nervous systems manage
modulating pain, including serotonin, norepinephrine, and inflammatory mediators like bradykinin, interleukins,
tumor necrosis factors, and neurokinins.

Sleep
Sleep is a restorative process of decreased mental awareness and physical activity. Several neural circuits and
neurotransmitters coordinate the sleep-wake cycle. Sleep is regulated by the circadian cycle, a 24-hour cycle
determined by light and dark patterns and internal regulatory functions (Figure 4.7). The pacemaker for the
circadian cycle starts in the hypothalamus. Internal body temperature, sleepiness, and the ability to fall asleep are
coupled with the circadian cycle. The homeostatic process, a sleep debt model, also regulates sleep. The more
awake a human is, the greater demand or debt is required for sleep. The more that the human is asleep, the less
demand for sleep there is. That process repeats every day.

FIGURE 4.7 The suprachiasmatic nucleus sends signals to the pineal gland to regulate the circadian cycle. (modification of work from
Psychology, 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

There are different phases of sleep that are regulated by neurotransmitters. Awake states are managed by increased
firing rates of the monoamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and histamine), orexin, and acetylcholine. The
sleep states are regulated by increased firing of GABA and very little firing of the monoamines, orexin, and
acetylcholine. The final stage of sleep is REM sleep or rapid eye movement. Most of the time in this stage is spent
dreaming. This is a paradoxical sleep as the body is "paralyzed" but the mind is "awake." In REM sleep, inhibitory
neurotransmitters release causing overall reduced sympathetic tone. Blood pressure, heart rate, and respirations
vary, and may increase, compared with non-REM sleep, and muscle tone decreases. Sexual arousal may occur
during REM sleep, which may be due to dream activity or increased blood flow.

Sleep patterns change as humans age. Newborns sleep between 16 and 18 hours a day. A three- to five-year-old
child sleeps nine to ten hours a night. Adults sleep an average of seven to nine hours a night, but less as they age.
Older adults begin to go to bed earlier and wake up earlier; they spend more time awake at night. Disruption of sleep
and rest can be associated with anxiety, poor concentration, ineffective coping, and role function.

Sleep can be a complex topic because it involves numerous neurotransmitters and several bodily cycles. Watch this

The Peripheral Nervous System
The peripheral nervous system contains all nerves outside the central nervous system. It is divided into two
different pathways: the ascending or afferent pathway, which brings sensory information to the brain; and the
116  4 · Neurobiology and Pharmacological Standards

     descending or efferent pathway, which takes integrated information from the brain. This means that the afferent
     pathways take things that the client feels, senses, or perceives to the brain, and the efferent pathway manages the
     response.

     There are also functional divisions in the peripheral nervous system. The somatic nervous system is a part of the
     PNS that delivers conscious sensory (afferent) information to the CNS and a voluntary motor response (efferent).
     The autonomic nervous system, regulated by the hypothalamus, manages involuntary homeostatic control over the
     body's internal processes, like temperature. The autonomic nervous system has two further divisions: the
     sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system manages
     the fight or flight response (increase in heart rate, blood pressure, respirations, peripheral vasoconstriction,
     decreased GI motility). This response is manifested when the client is anxious, having a phobic response, or when
     experiencing a trauma trigger. In contrast, the parasympathetic nervous system functions to conserve and store
     energy (decreased heart rate, blood pressure, respirations, peripheral vasodilatation, increased GI motility). This
     system manifests itself when the client is tired, sleepy, or resting.

     Neuroendocrinology

     The nervous and endocrine systems work together via hormonal regulation to manage internal and external
     environments. Groups of molecules that function to send signals to other cellular organisms in the human body are
     called hormones. They are released in response to chemical factors, such as blood glucose levels; endocrine
     factors, such as other hormones; or signals from neurons. Psychotropic medications, such as lithium, can have
     neuroendocrine effects: It has been associated with goiters, hypothyroidism, and hyperthyroidism. Additionally,
     hormonal disorders, such has hypothyroidism, can mimic mental health symptoms such as anhedonia, depressed
     mood, and decreased energy and motivation.

     Endocrine functioning within the CNS is controlled by the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. There are two lobes
     in the pituitary gland: the anterior and posterior. The posterior lobe of the pituitary gland releases two hormones:
     vasopressin and oxytocin. Both are triggered by neuronal impulses from the hypothalamus. The hormone
     vasopressin, also known as antidiuretic hormone, is responsible for retaining water and maintaining blood pressure.
     It is stimulated in the presence of decreased fluid volume, emotional stress, and pain. When released, oxytocin is
     the hormone responsible for uterine contraction and the stimulation of milk from mammary glands after pregnancy.
     The anterior lobe of the pituitary stimulates hormones that target other organs. When finished with their actions,
     they have a negative feedback mechanism that then inhibits the release of the same hormone at the anterior
     pituitary, causing the diminished effect of that hormone.

     The release of prolactin releasing hormone from the hypothalamus stimulates prolactin. It stimulates milk
     production during pregnancy. Certain medications can affect prolactin levels, such as antipsychotics, and can cause
     amenorrhea or galactorrhea, which is production of milk from the breast unrelated to pregnancy. Thyrotropin
     releasing hormone triggers the hypothalamus to release thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which targets the
     thyroid gland to release triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). Optimal thyroid functioning manages temperature
     regulation, mood states, and food metabolism.

     Protein synthesis and growth during child development are managed by growth hormone, or somatotropin.
     Furthermore, melatonin, responsible for initiating sleep during circadian cycles, is released from the pineal gland
     after melanocyte stimulating hormone is secreted from the hypothalamus. The release of this hormone is affected
     by light and dark conditions. Finally, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is released and travels to the adrenal
     glands where cortisol is released. Cortisol is responsible for mobilizing glucose for energy; it increases protein
     metabolism, immune effects, and systemic anti-inflammatory effects. Overall, the release of cortisol enhances the
     body's stress response. Once released, cortisol has the same negative feedback loop to the pituitary, which
     terminates the response. This is called the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, or the HPA response.
     Prolonged stress response and its relationship to the HPA axis has been implicated in disease states, such as post-
     traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, altered response after traumatic brain injury, and accelerated decline
     in disease states like Alzheimer's.

neuroendocrine perspectives, genetic determinants, and environmental influences. The stress diathesis model
posits that there are genetic traits that, when combined with certain environmental influences, create the potential
for a mental health disorder. Take, for example, a child who has a genetic predisposition for depression but is raised
in a loving environment without significant stress. The theory posits that this child has less chance of expressing
that genetic loading for mental disease. Place the same child in an environment with significant environmental
stressors, and the theory posits that there is a higher chance for expression of mental disease. Added to
environmental and genetic variances are the structural and neurological determinants for mental health disease.
Alterations in the monoamines (norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine), dysregulation of neurotransmitter receptors,
and disruption in growth factors can cause mood disorders, which include major depression, bipolar disorder,
dysthymia, mood disorder from a medical condition, and substance-induced mood disorder.

Brain circuits involved in mood disorders include the prefrontal cortex, basal forebrain, striatum, nucleus
accumbens, thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, brainstem, and cerebellum. Schizophrenia, a mental
disorder characterized by "disruptions in thought processes, perceptions, emotional responsiveness, and social
interactions," (National Institutes of Health [NIH] 2022) stems from hyperactive dopamine in the mesolimbic
pathways caused by malfunctioning NMDA glutamate receptors and hyperfunctioning serotonin receptors.
Environmental exposures, such as viral illness in utero, are also theorized to be determinants of the disease. The
neurobiology of fear and anxiety involves the limbic system (amygdala and hippocampus), the HPA axis, and
conditioned responses to external stimuli. Neurotransmitters involved with anxiety and fear include the
monoamines, GABA, and glutamate. Insomnia, being unable to fall or stay asleep, happens because of the inability
to neuromodulate circuits and neurotransmitters associated with awake states. These neurotransmitters include
norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, and histamine. Neurocircuits involved with sleep include the
basal forebrain, the locus coeruleus, and the thalamus. Attention deficits, characterized by impulsive behaviors,
hyperactivity, and/or an inability to focus or pay attention, stem from an imbalance of dopamine and norepinephrine
in the orbitofrontal and prefrontal cortex. Impulsive and compulsive behaviors like addiction result from a lack of
modulation from the prefrontal cortex to impulsive circuits led by the orbital frontal cortex. The dopaminergic
system is integral to this reward-driven behavior.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Describe the biological mechanisms of psychopharmacological drugs
    · Differentiate psychopharmacological drug classifications
    · Discuss psychopharmacological indications, actions, side effects, interactions, and special populations
    · Summarize nursing roles and implications related to psychopharmacological drugs

Nursing is heavily involved in the assessment and management of pharmacological agents. Psychopharmaceuticals
are substances that can affect mood, behaviors, feelings, or thoughts. For the most part, assessment of these
medications requires careful observation and listening skills applied with a level of understanding of how they work
within the human body. This section will provide an overview of the science of pharmacology, the classifications of
psychopharmaceuticals, how they work and their adverse effects, information on special populations, and
management strategies for nurses.

The Biology of Psychopharmacology

The role of psychopharmacology formally began in the mid-20th century with the invention of chlorpromazine, first
used to treat psychotic disorders. The emergence of this drug and further advances in science enabled clinicians to
understand the etiology of mental illness better. Health-care providers who contemplate psychotropic medications
for their clients consider several variables when choosing a medication: symptom presentation, comorbid disease
states, age, gender, genetic variables, which medicines work effectively for which symptoms, potential for side
effects and drug-drug interactions, and overall safety. Nursing interventions with psychopharmaceuticals involve
education, assessment, management of side effects and adverse events, and being prepared to respond to
dangerous drug levels and polypharmacy concerns.

Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors determine how a medication will work. What the human body does
to a drug is called pharmacokinetics, and what a drug does to the body is called pharmacodynamics. There are
118  4 · Neurobiology and Pharmacological Standards

     four mechanisms included in pharmacokinetics: (1) drug absorption, (2) drug distribution, (3) drug metabolism, and
     (4) drug excretion.

     Drug absorption is the process by which an unmetabolized drug is transported from the site of administration into
     the circulation system. Distribution is the amount of drug that ends up acting at its target site. This is affected by
     blood flow, molecular size, and how it interacts with plasma proteins. Drug metabolism is when a drug is broken
     down or biotransformed by a two-step process. The first step of biotransformation is the first-pass effect when
     medications undergo extensive hepatic metabolism through enzymatic processes. The result of this process is a
     reduction in the bioavailability of the medication. Cytochrome P450, also known as CYP450, enzymes often manage
     this step of the reaction. If a CYP450 enzyme metabolizes a medication, it is called a substrate. Different variables
     affect the rate of the enzymatic activity of these enzymes. The first is genetic variation. A human can express genetic
     alterations that inhibit or accelerate the CYP450 enzymes. Additionally, other medications can either induce or
     stimulate an enzyme. If this occurs, metabolism speeds up. Other drugs can temporarily inhibit or irreversibly inhibit
     these enzymes. Inhibition causes the metabolism to slow down or, in the case of the irreversible inhibitor, stop
     altogether. Phase II biotransformation reactions are also known as conjugation reactions that involve the use of
     transferase enzymes that "detoxify" drugs into excretable forms. Finally, excretion of the drug happens either
     primarily via the kidneys or the gastrointestinal tract, but can also occur through sweat, saliva, and tears. Factors
     that can affect excretion include disease states, such as liver disease, kidney disease, and other disease states that
     can affect blood or urine flow such as congestive heart failure.

     The second factor that determines how a medication works is pharmacodynamics, which is the drug-receptor
     interaction, or how the drug affects the human body in both the nature and strength of its response. Psychotropic
     drugs usually target neuronal receptors or enzymes, and in doing so, block, imitate, or alter the actions of
     neurotransmitters. Once a signal from a neuron's cell reaches the axon terminus, it stimulates the release of a
     neurotransmitter into the synapse. The neurotransmitter then targets a receptor either at the dendrite of the other
     nerve or receptor sites on the same nerve. The receptor sites on the same nerve are autoreceptors and shut off
     neurotransmitters' flow. Receptors located at the dendritic ends of another neuron serve to either continue the
     stimulus or shut it down through excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmission.

     PMH Drug Classifications

     Psychotropics have different classifications: antipsychotics, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, anxiolytics,
     hypnotics, and stimulants (Table 4.2). Antipsychotic medications mainly block 5-hydroxytryptophan (5HT)
     dopamine receptors. These medications are approved for use in psychotic disorders and mood stabilization.
     Antidepressant medications primarily target 5HT or serotonin. These medications treat depression, anxiety, trauma,
     and obsessive-compulsive disorders. Mood stabilizers have unknown mechanisms of action. These medications are
     indicated for use in bipolar disorders. Anxiolytics, used for anxiety disorders, include benzodiazepines, which
     enhance the inhibitory effects of GABA-A receptors; medications like hydroxyzine that block histamine; and
     Buspirone, which targets serotonin. Medications that work predominantly to increase norepinephrine and dopamine
     are divided into stimulants and non-stimulants. These medications are used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity
     disorder and sleep-wake disorders. Hypnotics work on various sleep-wake receptors and are approved for use in
     circadian rhythm disorders and insomnia.

TABLE 4.2 Classifications of Psychotropic Medications

Antipsychotics
To understand the medications that treat psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, it
is helpful to have a working knowledge of the etiology of one of the psychotic disease states: schizophrenia. There
are three general hypotheses for the causes of schizophrenia. The first posits that dopamine hyperactivity in the
brain's mesolimbic pathway causes the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, which are those that the disease has
"added" to the person, such as hallucinations or delusions (see Chapter 15 Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder and
Other Psychotic Disorders). The second hypothesis involves the neurotransmitter glutamate, the major excitatory
neurotransmitter in the brain. The theory holds that a hypofunction, formed in the early years of neurodevelopment
in the NMDA receptors located on glutamatergic neurons is the cause of schizophrenia. The final theory involves
hyperfunction (too much activity) at serotonin receptors. The downstream effect of both hypofunction in glutamate
and hyperfunction at serotonin receptors could result in hyperactivity in the same mesolimbic dopamine pathway,
120  4 · Neurobiology and Pharmacological Standards

     which can lead to psychosis.

     The development of the first class of antipsychotics was an accident. The phenothiazine class of medications was
     designed to act as a preanesthetic medication by manipulating antihistamine. The original medication was found to
     have a calming effect on clients. Research continued until chlorpromazine was invented. It was trialed successfully
     for the first time with a client with symptoms of mania. With the advent of chlorpromazine, the first generation of
     antipsychotics arrived. These medications included haloperidol, trifluoperazine, thioridazine, and fluphenazine.
     Classified as "first-generation antipsychotics or typical antipsychotics" in the 1950s, these medications primarily
     block dopamine receptors. The first "second-generation antipsychotic" was developed in the mid-1970s. The
     mechanism of action differed from the first generation in that it had dual actions at both serotonin and dopamine
     receptors. The second-generation drugs boasted fewer extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), which are drug-induced
     movement disorders. Some clients continued to experience them, however, with additional metabolic side effects,
     such as weight gain, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia. Finally, a third generation of atypical antipsychotics
     emerged. These drugs have more potent actions at serotonin receptors; potentially partial agonism at dopamine
     receptors or low occupancy at dopamine receptors, which reduces the potential for EPS; and sometimes minimal
     affinity for histamine receptors, which can result in limited weight gain and metabolic syndrome.

     Indications
     Antipsychotic medications are indicated (FDA approved) for use in clients who have a diagnosis of schizophrenia,
     schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder (mania, mixed mania, bipolar maintenance, bipolar depression), psychotic
     disorders, tics, and vocal utterances. They are also indicated for use in Tourette's syndrome, severe behavior
     problems in children, and treatment-resistant depression.

     Side Effects and Interactions
     The undesirable effects of a medical treatment or drug are called side effects. The side effect profiles of typical and
     atypical antipsychotics are different, but they have two general categories of side effects in common: metabolic side
     effects and extrapyramidal side effects (Table 4.3). Metabolic side effects include weight gain, insulin resistance,
     and hyperlipidemia. The exact mechanism of this has yet to be discovered. The second shared side effects category
     is extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), or drug induced movement disorders. Extrapyramidal side effects include
     akathisia, dystonia, tardive dyskinesia, pseudo-Parkinson's, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. A blockade of
     dopamine in the mesolimbic nigrostriatal pathway causes these movement disorders. All antipsychotic medications
     can potentially cause these movement disorders, some more than others. For example, first-generation
     antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, have more potential to cause EPS than second-generation antipsychotics like
     lurasidone. The more a medication blocks dopamine, the more potential it has to cause EPS. All antipsychotic
     medications can be sedating, may cause dizziness, and can lower the seizure threshold. Other significant side
     effects reported with first-generation antipsychotics include anticholinergic side effects: dry mouth, constipation,
     blurred vision, and urinary retention. Galactorrhea and amenorrhea are of particular concern for clients. Second-
     generation antipsychotics have less potential for anticholinergic side effects.

TABLE 4.3 Extrapyramidal Side Effects and Symptoms (Caroff & Campbell, 2016)

Most antipsychotic medications have interactions with other dopamine agonists, such as levodopa. They may also
cause additional CNS depressant effects when taken with other medications that cause sedation. Additionally, they
have the potential to lower blood pressure, which may heighten the effects of antihypertensive agents. Certain
antipsychotics contain an enzyme that interacts with cigarette smoking to increase the metabolism of the
medication. Therefore, if the client is smoking, or stops smoking, the drug dosages may need to be adjusted.

Clozapine is a second-generation antipsychotic that can potentially suppress bone marrow and cause
agranulocytosis, a condition characterized by a low number of white blood cells called granulocytes. It is a severe
form of neutropenia. Clients on clozapine are monitored for this risk via a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy
(REMS) program that the Food and Drug Administration requires. Certified providers enroll clients taking clozapine
in the program. The clients are then monitored with absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) via weekly blood draws for the
first six months, then every two weeks for the next six months. If the client's ANCs remain within normal ranges,
then they shift to monitoring every four weeks. If the client is found to have low ANC counts, additional monitoring
or steps come into play in accordance with the clozapine REMS algorithm.

Special Populations
First- and second-generation antipsychotic medications are approved for use in children for disorders, such as
aggression, Tourette's, and tics. Second-generation antipsychotics are preferred as first-line agents over first-
generation antipsychotics due to side effect profiles. For older adult clients, lower doses of first- and second-
generation medications are indicated as decreased renal clearance, decreased liver functioning, and decreased
cardiac output can create opportunities for altered metabolism. Additionally, these medications should be used with
caution for clients with dementia because they have been associated with increased mortality rates.

Nursing Implications
When working with clients who will be starting on antipsychotics, nurses begin with an assessment. They should
assess for medications or conditions contraindicated with the medication. Mental status exam and appropriate
screening tools are indicated. Nurses should assess for BMI, fasting lipids, fasting glucose, and potential ECG. For
clients taking clozapine, there is a risk for severe neutropenia as defined as absolute neutrophil count less than 500/
µl. For those clients being initiated and maintained on the medication, nurses should measure baseline blood ANC
before starting treatment and during treatment at prescribed times. Several different scales can be used to assess
EPS, for instance, like the Extrapyramidal System Rating Scale (ESRS) or the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale
(AIMS) (Table 4.4). The Simpson-Angus Scale verifies medication-induced Parkinsonism. The Barnes Akathisia
Rating Scale identifies antipsychotic-induced akathisia. Once the health-care team identifies, documents, and
communicates side effects, they can prescribe medications to mitigate them.

Once an antipsychotic has been prescribed, the nurse should educate the client on the following: drug-drug
interactions, medications to avoid, side effects, diet, exercise, monitoring of adverse events, and safety planning
strategies. Medications commonly avoided with antipsychotics include other dopamine agonists, such as levodopa.
Side effects common with antipsychotics include extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), metabolic syndrome such as
122  4 · Neurobiology and Pharmacological Standards

     insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, weight gain, sedation, sexual dysfunction, gastrointestinal upset, orthostatic
     hypotension, and lowering of seizure threshold. Educating clients on diet and exercise helps to mitigate the risks for
     weight gain and metabolic syndrome. Nurses should monitor for adherence, efficacy, side effects, adverse events,
     and client understanding of education.

             CLINICAL SAFETY AND PROCEDURES (QSEN)

     QSEN Competency: Client-Centered Care

     Side effects of antipsychotic medications can occur at any stage of treatment and include the extrapyramidal
     symptoms (EPS), dystonia, tardive dyskinesia, akathisia, and anti-parkinsonian. Providing client-centered care
     involves assessing and identifying these adverse events; some symptoms can be irreversible if left unmanaged.
     Additionally, side effects, such as EPS, are a common reason for non-adherence to antipsychotic agents.

     Assessment for symptoms of dystonia on examination and observation include muscle stiffness in upper limbs,
     head, and tongue and eye rolling. For dyskinesias, check for slow or lateral movements of the tongue and jaw,
     chewing, biting, clenching, puckering, pouting, and lip smacking, involuntary rocking or twisting of the torso or pelvic
     gyrations, uncontrollable slow "pill rolling" of hands, shuffling gate, and slow-moving lower limbs. For akathisia, look
     for uncontrollable urges to move legs relieved by standing and walking, inability to sit still, constant movement or
     walking. Assess also for subjective level of feelings of uneasiness. Assess client perception of the side effects, if
     they are noted by the client, how much, and how distressing these symptoms are to the client. Do they interfere with
     the client's functioning? Do they influence the client's willingness to continue the medication?

     Tools to evaluate extrapyramidal symptoms include the following: the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale
     (ESRS), which assesses for akathisia, dystonia, dyskinesia, and Parkinsonism; the Abnormal Inventory Movement
     Scale (AIMS), which assesses for tardive dyskinesia; and the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale, which assesses for
     akathisia while the client is in a seated position. All signs of EPS should be documented in the client record and
     promptly transmitted to the provider for medical intervention.

     After medical intervention is provided, documentation may include answers to questions such as the following:

         · What response does the client have?
         · If a medication dose is lowered, does the client show signs of symptoms that have returned as a result?
         · If a medication is given to treat the side effects, what response to the medication does the client have?
         · Does the client have adherence to their medications?

     Accurate assessment of side effects and response to interventions is essential in affording the client confidence
     with their medications, which translates to adherence to treatment algorithms and positive outcomes.

medication side effects (https://openstax.org/r/77MedSideEffect) to learn more. Nursing implications include
accurate assessments, client education, and nursing awareness of potential side effects with newer drugs marketed
as "lower incidence" for side effects.

Antidepressants
Research has not fully explained the etiology of mood disorders. Based on the effects of psychopharmacology
(working backwards), one common theory is that deficits in the monoamines contribute to symptoms of depression.
As discussed earlier, the monoamines include norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin. Antidepressants target
monoamines to increase dendritic growth and mitigate mood states. Another theory on the causes of depression is
related to stress, genetics, and inflammation. These factors can potentially cause loss of neurons.

The origin of antidepressants is tied to that of antipsychotic agents. The antipsychotic agent chlorpromazine was
slightly modified in the 1950s, resulting in the first tricyclic antidepressant, imipramine. Tricyclic antidepressants
(TCAs) include imipramine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protriptyline, doxepin, desipramine, and trimipramine. These
antidepressants increase serotonin and norepinephrine by blocking both presynaptic reuptake pumps. Additionally,
these medications block alpha 1 and 2, muscarinic, and histamine receptors.

In March 1982, fluoxetine, the first SSRI was approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Fluoxetine, sertraline,
fluvoxamine, paroxetine, citalopram, and escitalopram followed. These medications were novel in both their
chemical structure and their safety profile. Tricyclic antidepressants have high lethality in an overdose due to
hypotension, cardiac dysrhythmia, seizure, and coma. SSRIs are rarely lethal. These medications block the
presynaptic serotonin reuptake pump, resulting in increased serotonin within the synaptic cleft. Other
antidepressants followed, with the invention of the serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), such as
venlafaxine and duloxetine; the norepinephrine dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), such as bupropion; the
serotonin receptor antagonist/serotonin antagonist/reuptake inhibitors (S-MM/SARI), such as trazodone; and the
serotonin multimodal (S-MM) agents, such as vortioxetine.

The final class of antidepressant drugs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), targets the enzymatic destruction of
the monoamines in the synaptic cleft. These medications irreversibly inhibit the enzymes MAO-A and MAO-B from
breaking down all three monoamines, resulting in increased neurotransmitter levels in the synaptic space. An
example of an MAO-I is phenelzine.

Indications
Antidepressant medications are FDA-approved for depression, most anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders,
PTSD, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, pain disorders (SNRIs and TCAs,
such as duloxetine or amitriptyline), insomnia (doxepin), and Parkinson's disease (selegiline).

Side Effects and Interactions
Different types of antidepressants cause different types of side effects. Tricyclic antidepressants can potentially
cause significant side effects. Because overdose carries a high risk of lethality, use these medications with caution
for clients who are suicidal or who are known to have self-harming behaviors. Common side effects of tricyclics
include dizziness, sedation, fatigue, anticholinergic side effects (blurred vision, constipation, urinary retention, dry
mouth, weight gain), sexual dysfunction (impotence in biological men, decreased libido in biological women),
headache, irritability, and nervousness. Dangerous side effects include paralytic ileus, hyperthermia, the potential
for seizures, hypotension, dangerous arrhythmias, increased ocular pressure, activation of mania, and suicidal
ideation. These medications are contraindicated in those who have cardiac disease, have undergone cardiac surgery,
have arrhythmias, or have had myocardial infarctions. These medications are not recommended with other
medications that prolong QT intervals.

Clients generally tolerate SSRIs well, and they are rarely lethal in an overdose. Notable side effects include
gastrointestinal upset, headache, tremors, insomnia, agitation, dizziness, sweating, decreased platelet aggregation,
and sexual dysfunction. Serious side effects include mania; suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially in those
124  4 · Neurobiology and Pharmacological Standards

     younger than 24 years of age; and decreased seizure threshold. Drug contraindications with SSRIs include MAO
     inhibitors, and SSRIs should be used cautiously with other serotonergic medications because of the possibility of
     serotonin syndrome. A potentially life-threatening drug-drug interaction called serotonin syndrome is caused when
     high levels of serotonin are built up in the body. Signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome include agitation,
     restlessness, insomnia, confusion, muscle rigidity, tachycardia, hypertension, dilated pupils, sweating, diarrhea,
     shivering, and headache. It most often happens after introducing a new serotonergic drug, or increasing the dose of
     one a client is already taking. Mild cases resolve by decreasing or stopping the offending agent, but more serious
     cases require emergency measures. Moreover, abrupt discontinuation from SSRIs can cause discontinuation
     syndrome. A time-limited syndrome caused by sudden cessation or tapering too quickly off of an antidepressant is
     called discontinuation syndrome. The symptoms can be characterized as mild to moderate and can last from a few
     days to a few weeks after stopping the medication. Symptoms can include dizziness, imbalance, insomnia, sensory
     disturbances, flu-like symptoms, nausea, burning, tingling, electric shock-like feelings, irritability, and agitation.

     SNRIs, like SSRIs, are generally well tolerated. Due to their blockade at presynaptic norepinephrine transports,
     however, there is a potential for these medications to affect blood pressure. Serious side effects include mania;
     suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially in those younger than 24; and decreased seizure threshold. Drug
     contraindications with SNRIs include MAO inhibitors; they should be used with caution with other serotonergic
     medications because of the possibility of serotonin syndrome. Abrupt discontinuation from SNRIs can cause
     discontinuation syndrome.

     Mirtazapine is an atypical antidepressant, frequently taken at night. The medication is more sedating at a lower dose
     and serves as an antidepressant at higher doses. It is rarely lethal in an overdose. The medication can cause dry
     mouth, constipation, dizziness, low blood pressure, and significant weight gain. This medication is not for use in a
     client with a high BMI, and can increase risk for people with narrow-angle glaucoma. Serious side effects include
     mania; suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially in those younger than 24; and decreased seizure threshold. The
     FDA has issued a warning on most antidepressants that there is a potential increased risk of suicide in those clients
     taking them under the age of 24. Evaluation of suicide risk in all mental health clients is critical to any assessment
     and involves collaborative care management approaches between family, other health-care providers, educators,
     and friends. Drug contraindications with mirtazapine include SSRI, SNRI, and MAO inhibitors. It should be used with
     caution with serotonergic medications because of the possibility of serotonin syndrome. Abrupt discontinuation
     from mirtazapine can cause discontinuation syndrome.

     Bupropion is a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor. It is taken early in the day to avoid late afternoon
     activation and insomnia. It is rarely lethal in an overdose, but this medication can be abused by crushing and
     snorting it. Side effects include insomnia, dizziness, agitation, weight loss, high blood pressure, constipation, dry
     mouth, and nausea. Dangerous side effects include Stevens-Johnson syndrome, tinnitus, lowered seizure threshold,
     and activation of mania and suicidal behaviors, especially in those younger than 24. This medication is
     contraindicated in those with preexisting eating disorders, seizure disorder, traumatic brain injury, alcohol or
     sedative use disorder, or nervous system tumor. This medication is used with caution in those with severe anxiety,
     bipolar disorder, or severe insomnia because it can be activating. For instance, it can cause activation or mania in a
     client who is diagnosed and being treated for a unipolar depression but who has an underlying bipolar process.
     Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypomania or mania, which can include decreased need for sleep, pressured
     speech, impulsive behaviors, distractibility, tangential behaviors, racing thoughts, and grandiosity.

     Trazodone is a serotonin receptor antagonist and, like mirtazapine, is taken at night. The medication may be used for
     sleep at a lower dose and serves as an antidepressant at higher doses. It is rarely lethal in an overdose. Side effects
     include GI issues (nausea, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth), blurred vision, dizziness, fatigue, headache, low blood
     pressure, tremors, and rare rash. Serious side effects include priapism; mania; suicidal thoughts and behaviors,
     especially in those younger than 24; and decreased seizure threshold. Drug contraindications include MAO
     inhibitors, and this drug should be used cautiously with other serotonergic medications because of the possibility of
     serotonin syndrome. Use is cautioned in people with narrow-angle glaucoma, due to mydriatic activity of the drug,
     which can increase intraocular pressure. Abrupt discontinuation from trazodone can cause discontinuation
     syndrome.

     Multimodal antidepressants have more than a single effect, that is, inhibiting and activating at receptor sites. This
     class of medications has properties at various locations on serotonin receptors. They have the lowest potential for

side effects. Reports of lethality in overdose are rare. Side effects include GI issues (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, dry
mouth), insomnia, dizziness, sexual dysfunction, and antiplatelet aggregation. Serious side effects include mania;
possible activation of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially in those younger than 24; and decreased seizure
threshold. Drug contraindications include MAO inhibitors, and these drugs should be used cautiously with other
serotonergic medications because of the possibility of serotonin syndrome. Abrupt discontinuation from SSRIs can
cause discontinuation syndrome. Collaborative practice decisions should be made concerning SSRI use prior to
surgery. Risk for perioperative bleeding as well as risks of discontinuation syndrome and depression relapse must be
balanced with benefit of continued symptom management in mood disorders.

MAO inhibitors, the final class of antidepressants, irreversibly block the enzymatic activity of MAO-A and B. There
can be life-threatening side effects if a client on MAO inhibitors ingests food containing tyramine (Table 4.5)--which
can cause a hypertensive crisis--or medications that require the enzymatic destruction of MAO A/B. Signs and
symptoms of the hypertensive crisis include rapid or precipitous increase in blood pressure, sweating, anxiety,
headache, and nausea and vomiting.

TABLE 4.5 Food and Drugs to Avoid with MAOIs

        PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Education on Psychopharmaceuticals

The nurse should work with the provider and team to ensure that the client:

    · understands the need for their medications
    · understands the side effects of the medications
    · can afford the cost of medications
    · can take the medications as seldom as possible, for example, one time a day dosing versus four times a day
    · knows the medication may take three to four weeks or longer before they feel better
    · knows when to call their provider or go to the emergency department
    · is engaged in stigma reduction when the nurse utilizes person-centered language (avoiding labeling person
126  4 · Neurobiology and Pharmacological Standards

             with diagnostic categories), offers comparisons between physical and mental illness, and provides examples
             such as, "When I get that question, I say . . ." or "I push back against those attitudes by . . ."

     Special Populations
     SSRIs and SNRIs have been proven safe and effective in most clients above age six, but it is important to weigh the
     risks versus the benefits carefully when considering SNRIs and TCAs for this population. MAOIs are not for use in
     clients under the age of 16. Multimodal agents, such as vortioxetine, have not been established as safe or effective
     in children. SSRIs and SNRIs can be safe and effective in older adult populations. Those recovering from cardiac
     surgery and those diagnosed with arrhythmias or CVAs should generally be prescribed an SSRI, which will not
     exacerbate the condition.

     Nursing Implications
     Nurses caring for clients who take antidepressants should assess for medications or conditions that are
     contraindicated with the antidepressant. For clients taking bupropion, for instance, the assessment should include a
     history of any preexisting seizure disorders, head injury, or eating disorders contraindicated for the medication.
     Nurses should assess client suicidality through evidenced-based suicide assessment tools, such as the Columbia
     Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Nurses should use a collaborative approach with the client to develop a suicide safety
     plan and educate on the national suicide hotline at 988. They should limit access to certain antidepressants to
     clients who are at risk of self-harming behaviors. Nurses should educate clients on potential for drug/drug
     interactions, such as over-the-counter medications or herbal remedies like St. John's wort. For those clients taking
     MAOIs, education includes dietary restrictions and medications to avoid, such as over-the-counter cold medications
     to avoid antihypertensive crisis. Nurses should document any side effects or adverse events related to the
     medication and notification to the provider. They should also assess changes in condition once medical intervention
     has taken place and document the response. Nurses should use motivational approaches to manage nonadherence
     to medication.

       CLINICAL JUDGMENT MEASUREMENT MODEL

       Psychopharmacology

       The Clinical Judgment Measurement Model is an evidence-based model that identifies six cognitive skills
       needed to make appropriate clinical judgments. Consider these skills in the context of psychopharmacology.

       A nurse works in a clinic with clients diagnosed with severe mental illness. Client X, a 57-year-old, presents to
       the clinic two days after converting from risperidone PO to risperdal consta injection. The client is complaining of
       muscle stiffness, sore jaw, sore neck, and an inability to close their mouth. The client's eyes are rolling back into
       their head. They are having difficulty talking.

       1. Recognize cues: Gather information, such as medication history, signs, symptoms, health history, and so
       forth.

       2. Analyze cues: How does the client history and signs/symptoms relate to the client presentation and the
       client's needs or concerns?

       3. Prioritize hypotheses: Establish priorities based on the client's needs or problems. The priority here is the
       side effects from the antipsychotic medication. The client recently had a change to the dosing of their
       medication that may have contributed to the current symptoms.

       4. Generate solutions: Identify outcomes and nursing interventions to meet the client's needs or address the
       problems.

       Expected outcome: Reduction in the adverse events related to possible medication reaction.

       Nursing interventions: Assess for EPS using scale, take vital signs, notify provider, monitor client per agency
       policy, administer medications as indicated, evaluate the effects of the medications by reassessing the client
       one hour postadministration.

       5. Take action: Implement the nursing interventions using priorities of care and planned outcomes to promote,

maintain, or restore the client's health. Collaborate with other members of the health-care team, and participate
in coordination of care by implementing the plan of care, documenting care, giving/receiving report, assisting
with rounding, educating the client, and so forth.

6. Evaluate outcomes: Gauge the client's response to the interventions to see if the outcomes have been met. If
met, continue to monitor. If not met, gather more information and/or revise the plan of care.

One hour post medication administration, the client is now able to move their mouth without soreness, is able to
talk, and has no muscle stiffness or soreness after injection.

Mood Stabilizers
Mood stabilizers are used to treat bipolar mood disorders and differ from medications to treat unipolar depression.
Mood stabilizers help mitigate both the highs of mania and the lows of depression. The biological etiology of bipolar
disorder, like unipolar depression, is unknown. A possible genetic determinant has been linked to CACNA1C2, a
gene that affects the amygdala, responsible for emotions. As with depression, deficits in neurotropic factors, stress,
and inflammation have also been linked to the disease. There are three types of medications used to treat bipolar
disorder: antipsychotic medications, as already discussed, lithium, and anticonvulsants.

Lithium
The mechanism of action for lithium is unknown. It is considered to be a first-line choice in the management of
mania and mixed mania, and with bipolar maintenance. There is also evidence linking lithium to a reduction in
suicidal thoughts. Lithium is a salt and is excreted via the renal system. Therefore, clients should have optimal renal
functioning to take this medication. Lithium also requires monitoring trough blood levels 12 hours after the last
dose. Optimal lithium levels fall between 0.6 to 1.2 mEq/L. Side effects include ataxia, mild tremors, thirst, frequent
urination, weight gain, acne, hair loss, and euthyroid goiter. Lithium toxicity can start when blood levels reach 1.5
mEq/L, with severe toxicity (which is life-threatening) at 2.5 mEq/L and above. Dangerous and life-threatening side
effects include lithium toxicity, seizures, diabetes insipidus, arrhythmias, and renal impairments. This medication is
contraindicated for those with renal impairments, those who suffer from cardiac disease, and clients with sodium
depletion or who are severely dehydrated (Table 4.6). Medications to avoid taking in conjunction with lithium include
NSAIDs; COX-2 inhibitors, such as celecoxib, metronidazole, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, and diuretics.

          Signs and Symptoms                                                       Lithium Levels

Moderate

Severe    Agitation, hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypotension, confusion, delirium,  2.5-3.5 mEq/L

TABLE 4.6 Signs and Symptoms of Lithium Toxicity

Anticonvulsants
Anticonvulsants are another type of mood stabilizer that includes valproic acid, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine.
While the exact mechanism is not known, these medications target voltage-sensitive sodium channels. The end goal
is the overall reduction in excitatory neurotransmission at the synaptic cleft, which results in mood stabilization.
Valproic acid is the only anticonvulsant mood stabilizer that requires monitoring of trough blood levels. The
therapeutic range for valproic acid is 50-125 µg/mL, with toxic levels > 150 µg/ML. Side effects of valproic acid
include sedation, GI issues (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), weight gain, and alopecia. Adverse events associated with
valproic acid include activation of suicidal thoughts, hepatotoxicity, tachycardia, and valproic acid toxicity. Signs and
symptoms of valproic acid toxicity include nausea, vomiting, myoclonus, somnolence, dizziness, hallucinations,
irritability, headache, lethargy, respiratory depression, and coma. Drug interactions with valproic acid include
lamotrigine, carbamazepine, topiramate, cimetidine, erythromycin, ibuprofen, phenobarbital, and phenytoin.

     Management of lithium levels involves understanding peak and trough levels. Review the details of monitoring
     lithium (https://openstax.org/r/77MonitorLith) from Psych Scene.

     Lamotrigine and carbamazepine side effects are sedation, dizziness, nausea, constipation, and blurred vision.
     Adverse reactions for both include activation of suicidal ideation and potential for Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
     Carbamazepine has the potential to cause aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis. Drug interactions with lamotrigine
     include valproic acid, oral contraceptives, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and lithium. Drug interactions with
     carbamazepine include hormonal contraceptives, other anticonvulsants, and lithium.

     Special Populations
     Lithium is not indicated for mood stabilization for children under seven, and valproic acid is not for children under
     the age of 10; lamotrigine and carbamazepine are not indicated for use as mood stabilizers for children at all. All
     mood stabilizers are indicated for older adult clients with adequate renal and metabolic states. Lithium has the
     potential to become neurotoxic in older adult individuals, so it should be monitored closely. When initiating
     anticonvulsants in older adults, low start with low doses, titrate slowly, and monitor closely for safety and efficacy.
     Use of mood stabilizers during pregnancy and breastfeeding requires medical management.

     Nursing Implications
     Nurses caring for clients taking mood stabilizers should assess for medications or conditions that might be
     contraindicated with the mood stabilizers. They should also assess client suicidality through evidenced-based
     suicide assessment tools, such as the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale, and should limit access to mood
     stabilizers to those who are at risk of self-harming behaviors. Nurses should educate clients on the following: drug-
     drug interactions, medications to avoid, side effects, monitoring of adverse events, and safety planning strategies.
     Monitor adherence, efficacy, side effects, adverse events, and client understanding of education. Nurses should also
     monitor baseline BMI, labs, and blood pressure, and should continue with trough blood levels for valproic acid and
     lithium. Nurses should report signs and symptoms of lithium and valproic acid toxicity. Nurses should educate
     clients on lithium on the importance of maintaining adequate hydration, not overhydrating, and on the signs and
     symptoms of toxicity.

             REAL RN STORIES

     Nurse: Rafael, RN
     Years in Practice: 8
     Clinical Setting: Mental health practice
     Geographic Location: Colorado

     A nurse with eight years' experience working in mental health took a call from a 27-year-old client who had a
     diagnosis of bipolar disorder. The client had previously been prescribed lithium 300mg po bid. The client called with
     concerning symptoms: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and gross hand tremors. The nurse asked how long the client had
     been having the symptoms. The client reported that the symptoms had been happening for the past five days. The
     nurse asked the client if they had been prescribed any new medications recently or if the client had any dose
     changes by their provider. The client was not taking any other medication other than lithium. The client had not had
     any medication changes for over two months. The nurse then asked the client if they were taking the medication
     twice a day as prescribed or if the client had been dehydrated, overexercising, or sick. The client denied all the
     above. The nurse then asked if there was anything unusual that happened five days ago. The client said that the only
     thing that happened five days before was that they picked up their new bottle of lithium at the pharmacy. The nurse
     then asked the client to go retrieve the bottle of medication and read the bottle to them. The client read the
     following off the label of their prescription: lithium 600mg po bid. The nurse then realized that the client was taking
     the wrong dose. The nurse notified the APRN provider who then called the pharmacy. The pharmacy had an order for
     lithium 300mg po bid but had dispensed lithium 600mg po bid. The client had been taking twice the amount of

medication prescribed and was having signs and symptoms of lithium toxicity. The client was asked to go to the
emergency department for an evaluation and have a lithium level drawn, after which they were treated for potential
lithium toxicity.

Anxiolytics
Anxiolytics, or antianxiety drugs, are a class of medications that decrease anxiety. This class includes
benzodiazepines, buspirone, and hydroxyzine. Benzodiazepines are positive allosteric modulators on the GABA
receptor. They increase the flow of negative ions through the cell wall of the neuron to allow for more inhibitory
actions. In effect, this will directly oppose the excitatory nature of the brain. It "slows things down" and decreases
the sensory flow of information to the brain. These medications have a variety of duration of actions and a potential
for dependence and abuse. Buspirone is a serotonin receptor partial agonist, but the mechanism of action is
unknown. The medication is given two to three times a day, requires several weeks to work, and is usually
prescribed as an adjunct to another medication. Hydroxyzine is a histamine antagonist and is classified as an
antihistamine. The medication is given two to three times a day as needed for anxiety.

Indications
Most benzodiazepines are indicated for short-term treatment for generalized anxiety disorders, anxiety, and panic.
Some are indicated only for insomnia. Buspirone is indicated for long-term anxiety management, whereas
hydroxyzine is used as an as-needed medication for anxiety.

Side Effects and Interactions
Side effects of benzodiazepines include sedation, dizziness, fatigue, and confusion. There is the potential for these
medications to cause a paradoxical reaction, a heightened anxiety, excitability, and nervousness. All
benzodiazepines have the potential to create tolerance and cause abuse. Abrupt discontinuation of long-term use of
benzodiazepines can result in withdrawal seizures. These medications are tapered slowly to alleviate that
dangerous situation. Adverse reactions include CNS depression and overdose. Clients with closed-angle glaucoma
should not take benzodiazepines. These medications also should not be given to clients who have alcohol use
disorder unless the client is under medical supervision for alcohol withdrawal treatment.

Side effects of buspirone include sedation, headache, nervousness, excitement, drowsiness, and insomnia.
Dyskinesias are possible with this medication. Adverse reactions are rare but can include cardiac symptoms. Drug
interactions include any serotonergic medication that can cause serotonin syndrome. Hydroxyzine side effects
include sedation, fatigue, dizziness, and QT prolongation. Drug interactions with this medication include any
medication that causes QT prolongation, such as escitalopram, citalopram, or ziprasidone. This medication should
be used with caution in clients with any known cardiac disease.

Special Populations
Benzodiazepines are not frontline medications for children and may have paradoxical effects. There is limited
information on the efficacy of buspirone for children over the age of six, so it is usually not prescribed in pediatrics.
Hydroxyzine can be used for children over six in divided doses while monitoring for paradoxical effects.
Benzodiazepines and buspirone can be used for anxiety in older adults, with lowered doses and monitoring for
clearance, cognitive impairment, and fall risk. Hydroxyzine should not be prescribed to older adult clients with
cardiac disease or those with dementia. Lower doses should be given to all other older adult clients while
monitoring for clearance, cognitive impairment, and fall risk.

        LIFE-STAGE CONTEXT

Medications for Older Adults

The American Geriatric Society publishes a guideline called the Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate
Medication Use in Older Adults, most often referred to as the Beers List. This evidenced-based approach provides
information to health-care providers on the safe management of medications of adults ages 65 and older. The list is
divided into categories of medications that might cause adverse effects or have limited effectiveness, and those
medications that are contraindicated with certain disease states.
130  4 · Neurobiology and Pharmacological Standards

     Assessment of medications for those 65 and older begins with medication reconciliation: obtaining a list of client
     medications, asking the client about current medications--including over-the-counter and supplements--and
     changes to prescribed medications. Assessment continues with identifying medications listed in the Beers List and
     the potential complications: drug-drug interactions, potential for adverse events, or contraindications with current
     disease states. The next step is to educate clients on the potential for adverse events. For example, if the client has
     impaired mobility and the medication causes CNS depressant effects like dizziness, the situation warrants educating
     the client on managing falls. Ensure health literacy of client education through return communication of the
     education received. Assessment and management of medications for those over the age of 65 is part of client safety
     and best practices for which nurses are responsible.

     Nursing Implications
     Nursing management of clients taking anxiolytics starts with an assessment for medications or conditions that
     might be contraindicated with the medication. It continues with the nurse educating the client on the following:
     drug-drug interactions, medications to avoid, side effects, monitoring of adverse events, and potential for tolerance
     and dependence for those who are taking benzodiazepines. Nurses should monitor adherence, efficacy, side effects,
     adverse events, and client understanding of education. Clients taking benzodiazepines should be taught not to
     abruptly stop the medication if they have been using it long-term. When they do discontinue, nurses should monitor
     for signs and symptoms of withdrawal, which can occur within 24 to 48 hours after the last dose depending on the
     half-life of the benzodiazepine, using a scale like the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment Scale. Alternative
     benzodiazepines may be ordered to ameliorate the alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Signs and symptoms of
     benzodiazepine withdrawal include anxiety, nausea, tremors, diaphoresis, headache, heart palpitations,
     hallucinations, depression, autonomic instability, and seizures.

     Hypnotics
     Hypnotics are a class of medications that help clients fall and stay asleep. Sleep is a biological process that involves
     a homeostatic and circadian drive. Neurotransmitters involved in these processes include those that stimulate sleep
     like melatonin and GABA and those involved in the wake cycles, such as acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin,
     norepinephrine, and histamine. There is an additional neurotransmitter, orexin, that promotes the balance between
     wake and sleep states. Hypnotics have several different targets in the sleep-wake cycle. One medication, ramelteon,
     works at the melatonin receptor to induce the sleep cycle. The GABA A positive allosteric modulating drugs, such as
     zolpidem, zaleplon, and eszopiclone, work at the same receptors as the benzodiazepines (but at a different subunit,
     so they lower the potential for tolerance and dependence) to decrease "excitatory" sensory noise that reaches the
     brain, allowing the client to sleep. Orexin-targeting medications, such as suvorexant, inhibit wake-promoting
     neurotransmitters, such as histamine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. These actions allow for stabilization and
     maintenance of sleep.

     Indications
     Hypnotics are indicated for sleep onset insomnia, sleep maintenance insomnia, short-term insomnia, and treatment
     of insomnia with early morning awakening as a symptom.

     Side Effects and Interactions
     Side effects of hypnotics generally include sedation, dizziness, fatigue, and headache. Medications that work on
     GABA receptors have side effects, including amnesia and amnestic events, such as sleep eating, sleep driving, sleep
     cooking, and sleep texting/making phone calls. Adverse events for GABA receptor medications include tolerance
     and dependence, the potential for CNS depression, and overdose. Adverse events related to orexin agents include
     the remote potential for tolerance and abuse, sleep paralysis, hallucinations, and cataplexy. Therefore, these
     medications are generally not for use in those with narcolepsy.

     Special Populations
     Hypnotic medications have not been proven safe or effective in children. Ramelteon, the melatonergic hypnotic, is
     safe for use in older adult clients; dose adjustments are not necessary. GABA receptor medications can be used
     cautiously in older adult clients, but there is an increased risk of falls. Lower doses are generally recommended, and
     clients should be placed on falls precautions.

Nursing Implications
Nursing management of clients taking hypnotics starts with an assessment for medications or conditions with which
the hypnotics might have a contraindication. Educate clients on the following: drug-drug interactions, medications
to avoid, side effects, monitoring of adverse events, and potential for tolerance and dependence for those who are
taking GABA receptor hypnotics. Monitor for adherence, efficacy, side effects, adverse events, and client
understanding of education. Clients taking GABA receptor hypnotics should be educated not to abruptly stop the
medication if they have been using it long-term, because it can cause withdrawal anxiety and worsen insomnia.
Nurses should monitor for total sleep time, time to fall asleep, number of awakenings during the night, and time to
fall asleep after awakenings. Nurses should educate the client on sleep hygiene and nutritional and exercise factors
that affect healthy sleep states.

Stimulants
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a state caused by the inefficiencies of two significant
neurotransmitters, norepinephrine and dopamine, that promote information processing in the brain's prefrontal
cortex. Too much of these neurotransmitters causes overexcitability, inability to concentrate, and a flight or fight
response. Conversely, too few neurotransmitters make the client drowsy, inattentive, and sleepy. When these two
neurotransmitters work efficiently, the client is alert, awake, and cognitively able to attend to events in their
environment. The medications used to regulate these two neurotransmitters for those who have ADHD are called
non-stimulants, and they generally work to make the two neurotransmitters work more optimally; the non-
stimulants are called guanfacine and atomoxetine. These medications work slower and are not controlled
substances. Stimulant medications, by contrast, work within the central nervous system to increase the availability
of neurotransmitters by blocking the reuptake transporter into the presynaptic neuron. Stimulants are controlled
substances and have the potential for tolerance and dependence. Stimulants are usually considered first-line agents
for treating ADHD in school-age children. If caregivers object to stimulant medication and/or there are medical
contraindications, however, non-stimulant medications are an option.

normative response to a threat in the environment and its links to some mental health symptoms.

Indications
Non-stimulants and stimulants are indicated for treating ADHD, narcolepsy, and excessive sleepiness.

Side Effects and Interactions
Guanfacine is a norepinephrine receptor agonist and a non-stimulant. Side effects of this medication include
lowered blood pressure, low pulse, dry mouth, constipation, sedation, fatigue, and nausea. Dangerous side effects
include bradycardia. Atomoxetine is a selective serotonin /norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. Side effects include
anorexia, weight loss, tachycardia, hypertension, insomnia, activation, dry mouth, constipation, nausea, urinary
hesitancy, sexual dysfunction, and anxiety.

Stimulants take a variety of actions to boost norepinephrine and dopamine within the central nervous system. Side
effects include insomnia, weight loss, headaches, tics, dry mouth, Raynaud's, anxiety, and activation. Adverse
events include tachycardia, hypertension, priapism with some stimulants, tardive dyskinesia, neuroleptic malignant
syndrome, activation of mania or suicidal thoughts, seizures, and cardiac events. These medications are generally
contraindicated in those with severe anxiety, a history of cardiac disease, seizure disorders, tics, glaucoma, and
current alcohol or benzodiazepine use disorder. Drug-drug interactions include MAO inhibitors, medications that
increase blood pressure, and antihypertensive medications. Use stimulants with caution with mood stabilizers
because stimulants may destabilize those with bipolar disorder.

Special Populations
Non-stimulant and stimulant medications are generally not recommended for use in children under the age of six.
These medications are not recommended for older adult clients with a cardiac disease history.

     Nursing Implications
     Nursing management of clients taking non-stimulants and stimulants starts with assessing medications or
     conditions contraindicated with the medication. Nurses should educate clients on the following: drug-drug
     interactions, medications to avoid, side effects, monitoring of adverse events, and potential for tolerance and
     dependence. Nurses should monitor for pulse, blood pressure, height, weight, adherence, efficacy, side effects,
     adverse events, and client understanding of education. Nurses should educate clients on maintaining nutritional
     status, especially during midday hours; taking medications when directed; not taking medications too late in the
     day, which could interfere with sleep; and behavioral strategies to manage attention deficits, such as exercise and
     structure in the environment.

             PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

     Concordance and Motivational Interviewing for Medication Adherence

     Adherence is behavior that coincides with prescribed medical health advice or plan of treatment. There are certain
     challenges to adherence to a plan that includes psychotropic medications: negative beliefs about the medication
     effectiveness, family or social support beliefs about medications, and the potential for side effects. Motivational
     interviewing is a client-centered approach to increase motivation by discovering client medication uncertainty
     though a guided communication approach. It is designed to empower the client to explore their thoughts and
     concerns about medication ambivalence in a respectful manner and facilitate a change process to honor client
     autonomy and decision making about taking medication.

     Through a process of open-ended questions, nurses explore the clients' thoughts and beliefs about the medication.
     They should honor the clients' concerns about the medication, and consider where they are in the change model.
     Nurses should educate the client about the risks and benefits of the medication versus not taking the medication,
     and then explore any options that the client can take to alleviate concerns about the medication. Through this
     process, the nurse and the client can gain concordance or shared agreement about their therapeutic goals.

     4.3 Innovations in Mental Health

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe how alternative treatments are used in psychiatric-mental health settings
         · Explain how digital tools can be used to identify and track at-risk clients
         · Describe the role of telemental health in the treatment of psychiatric-mental illness

     The past 60 years has seen dramatic change in the treatment of mental health disease--from the chronic
     internment of the serious mentally ill and treatment with insulin-based shock treatments to the home-based, data-
     driven technologies of today. This section covers the innovations in medicine, technology, and internet-based
     applications that are advancing the science of mental health care.

     Alternative Treatments

     Alternative treatments are considered those that are done instead of the standard treatment procedures. For those
     who are engaged in mental health care, standardized treatment includes individual or group therapy,
     psychopharmaceutical treatments, and more intensive treatments, such as residential or in-client treatment
     facilities. This section will review the more commonly used and approved alternative treatments for mental health
     disorders.

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)
A noninvasive treatment called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was developed in 1985 and approved for
use in those with major depressive disorder in 2008. The treatment consists of an electromagnetic coil that is
placed against the client's head (over the prefrontal cortex) that delivers a magnetic pulse to stimulate nerve cells in
the brain. Different combinations and types of stimulations manage different symptoms. The exact mechanism of
action is not quite understood, but theories posit that TMS stimulates areas of the brain that have decreased
neuronal activity. Indications for TMS include failure of at least one antidepressant and approval by insurance, if
applicable. Approximate costs for TMS range between $6,000 and $12,000 with the TMS course entailing
approximately 20 to 30 clinic sessions lasting 30 to 40 minutes each, but these costs and number and length of
sessions can vary by insurance coverage. Effects of TMS are statistically significant with optimal remission rates.
Prior to referral to TMS, clients should be assessed for risk factors related to seizures, traumatic brain injury,
intracranial masses, neurological disease, metal in the head or neck, alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal, or
medications that lower seizure threshold (bupropion, theophylline, and stimulants). Side effects include pain and
irritation at the site of the magnet, tingling, facial muscles that twitch, and lightheadedness. Some clients with
trauma might become triggered by the experience. After the first course of treatment, clients might engage in
maintenance treatments or a tapering regimen. Deep TMS is the stimulation of deeper brain structures by the same
TMS devices. It is indicated for major depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The treatment algorithms are
commensurate with that of regular TMS.

Esketamine
A innovative treatment for treatment-resistant depression and major depressive disorder with suicidality is
esketamine, which is derived from a drug called ketamine, an anesthetic. It works very differently from traditional
antidepressants; theoretically, it causes an increase in brain-derived growth factor (BDNF), which has been
implicated as a factor in unipolar depression. Esketamine has been found to have optimal remission rates when
treating depression and has FDA approval for this use. It has also demonstrated a rapid reduction in suicidal
thoughts. Side effects include increased blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, anxiety, depersonalization/derealization,
hallucinations, vertigo, and sedation. Prior to treatment, assess clients for conditions that are contraindicated, such
as hypertension, substance misuse disorders, CNS depressed states, and hepatic impairment; also assess vital
signs before and during treatment. Esketamine comes in a nasal spray at a 28 mg dose and is usually administered
in a clinic setting. Clients arrive at the clinic, generally self-administer the esketamine, and then wait for 40 minutes
to one hour before someone else drives them home. Treatments last up to 10 weeks with one to two treatments per
week.

Ketamine may be administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM) by a qualified professional. Infusions are
administered weekly or more frequently; injections may have different administration schedules. Because FDA
approval for ketamine is still as an anesthetic, with "off label" use for mental health treatment, insurance policies
may not cover the expense.

Electroconvulsive Therapy
The use of electrical currents under anesthesia to produce a seizure is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). It is FDA
approved for treatment resistant or severe unipolar depression. How ECT works to decrease depressive symptoms
is not known. There are theories that the induction of the seizure activity releases the neurotransmitters that are
involved in depressive states (serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine), and it potentially results in stimulation of
brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), which is responsible for neuronal growth, learning, and memory. Clients
who are referred for ECT are first evaluated to see if they are a candidate for the treatment. They are then screened
for medical history to determine if there are any contraindications for the treatment (potentially those with coronary
disease, with asthma or COPD, poorly controlled hypertension, those with implanted pacemakers, or those who are
pregnant). Seizures can cause increases in blood pressure, heart rate, and intracranial pressure. Assess and manage
client status before and after the procedure.

Also prior to ECT treatment, educate clients on the risks versus benefits and side effects of the treatment versus no
treatment at all. The risks include the risks of anesthesia, medical complications of the procedure inclusive of heart
attack, stroke, respiratory difficulty, or continuous seizure. Other side effects include dental complications, irregular
heart rate, memory loss, and confusion upon awakening from anesthesia that usually lasts no more than an hour.
The recommended number of ECT treatments is between six and 12, based on the clinical response. Once the client
134  4 · Neurobiology and Pharmacological Standards

     is ready for their treatment, they are usually brought to a surgical suite or pre-anesthesia holding area where the
     procedure takes place. The client is sedated and provided anesthesia. The client is given either unilateral or bilateral
     treatment (meaning that electrodes are placed on one side or both sides of the temporal region) based on their
     symptomology. Once the procedure is done, the client wakes from anesthesia.

     Nursing care prior to the treatment includes:

       1. ensuring that the client has understood and signed informed consent
       2. making sure the client has had nothing by mouth for at least eight hours prior to the procedure
       3. removing all dentures, jewelry, eyewear (glasses, contact lenses), hearing aids
       4. having the client void before the procedure
       5. giving perioperative medications

     Nursing care during the procedure includes:

       1. monitoring vital signs and symptoms
       2. placing oral/dental protection device
       3. giving procedural medications
       4. assessing client during procedure

     Nursing care after the procedure includes:

       1. monitoring vital signs and symptoms
       2. assessing cognitive status
       3. checking for gag reflex, fluids, ambulating, and toileting
       4. placing client on falls precaution

     Virtual Reality
     A useful and effective treatment for anxiety and fear disorders, such as phobias and traumatic stress, is virtual
     reality (VR), a computer generated two- or three-dimensional environment that contains scenes or objects that
     allow the user to immerse in a seemingly real surrounding. Using VR, mental health professionals can engage in
     cognitive treatment like exposure therapy to gradually "expose" their clients in vivo to fear-related situations, in a
     controlled environment, while managing their fear response with use of relaxation techniques taught prior to the VR
     experience. It is the same principle for those who experience trauma triggers. VR immersion can assist clients with
     modulating the trauma trigger through safe encounters while managing their negative beliefs with relaxation
     exercises and cognitive reframes. Side effects of VR include dizziness, headache, nausea, eye strain, and decreased
     sense of present self or dissociation. Those who experience light-triggered seizures are not candidates for VR
     experiences. Recommendations for VR treatment include engaging in between eight and 12 sessions for 15 minutes
     each or for a single session that lasts from 45 minutes to three hours.

     Digital Tools to Identify and Track At-Risk Clients

     Nearly one in five U.S. adults have or will have a mental health diagnosis in their lifetime. With a paucity of mental
     health providers and an explosion of technology, clients and providers are turning to digital tools to assist at-risk
     clients. For those with access to the internet and technology, there are a variety of applications for use in mental
     health. They range from applications to track sleep, mood, stress, and vital signs, such as heart rate and
     respirations, to those that track symptoms of mental health disorders. There are apps that can follow along with
     providers to assist with, monitor, and evaluate cognitive and behavioral interventions. Some apps take the user
     along guided imagery exercises. Others provide motivational experiences to lift mood and provide feedback for
     substance use disorders. There are tools that combine cognitive behavioral therapy and nutrition to achieve a
     healthier diet. Applications assist in goal attainment, recovery from loss, and management of anxiety and panic.
     Applications track self-harming and suicidal thoughts and can assist with the formation of suicide safety planning.
     In a world where stigma and lack of providers creates barriers to care for mental health issues, these applications
     can create bridges to care that reach millions. While they do not replace the clinician, they can provide additional
     resources and tools for those who have access to the virtual world.

mental health services though telephone or videoconferencing. Telemental health is a cost-effective alternative to
in-person mental health services, especially in cases where access is limited. It is not useful in areas where
broadband or cellular communication is not available. In the aftermath of COVID-19, major regulatory efforts have
tried to expand broadband capabilities to extend the reach of telemedicine. Insurance companies and state and
federal regulations have become increasingly supportive of internet-based mental health care, especially after the
pandemic. There are several considerations before providers can engage in internet-based treatment. The services
must be HIPAA-compliant, meaning that the providers' internet-based platforms and communications are required
to have secure communication and privacy features. Moreover, clients must be informed ahead of their first
appointment that internet-based services are part of the care algorithm. Altogether, internet-based mental health
care is a cost-effective and stigma-free way to engage in evidence-based care for those with the health literacy and
technology to engage.

Summary

4.1 Foundations of Neurobiology

This section provided a review of the components and functions of the nervous system relative to mental health
disorders nurses encounter in practice. It explained how neurotransmitters, like serotonin and dopamine, endocrine
functioning, and hormones, affect human behavior. Their presence/absence or proper functioning can heavily
influence expressions of mental health disorders.

4.2 Psychopharmacology

The nursing role when it comes to psychopharmaceuticals is to assess for mental health symptoms and
medications, collaborate with the client to recognize medication barriers and engage in nursing interventions to
combat them, and identify side effects and adverse events of psychopharmaceutical agents. This section provided
knowledge for skills associated with medications used to treat a variety of mental health disease states and the
indications, risks, and population considerations related to these medications.

4.3 Innovations in Mental Health

Advances and modernization in medicine and technology have improved the science and delivery of mental health
care over the past 60 years. In doing so, these innovations have increased access to care, decreased stigma, and
broadened treatment approaches to appeal to more consumers, some who might be wary of traditional
pharmaceutical methods. Advancing innovations in knowledge for mental health care and delivery systems is critical
to achieve optimal client outcomes.

What Should the Nurse Do?

Sara, a 35-year-old female, has come to your local community health clinic due to a recent onset of symptoms. She
has been experiencing severe anxiety, persistent insomnia, irritability, and difficulty concentrating, which have been
interfering with her daily life and work. Sara has no significant prior medical history but reports a family history of
mental health disorders. Upon initial assessment, her vital signs appear within the normal range, with a blood
pressure of 120/80 mm Hg, a heart rate of 80 beats per minute, and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute.
During the initial assessment, Sara showed signs of restlessness by constantly fidgeting.

    1. What specific verbal and nonverbal cues does Sara exhibit during the assessment that may indicate the
        presence of a nervous-system-related issue?

    2. Based on Sara's family history of mental health disorders and her reported symptoms, which
        neurotransmitters or hormonal imbalances could potentially be contributing to her current condition?

José, a 35-year-old male, has been referred to a psychiatric clinic by his primary care physician. José reports
persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and loss of interest in activities he used to enjoy. He also experiences
significant changes in his appetite and sleep patterns, with frequent early morning awakenings. José mentions that
142 4 · Assessments

these symptoms have been present for the past six months, and they are affecting his daily life and relationships.

Upon further assessment, José reveals that his family has a history of mood disorders, including depression. His
primary care physician has prescribed him an antidepressant medication, fluoxetine, an SSRI. José expresses
concerns about starting medication and asks for more information about how it works and its potential side effects.

    3. As the nurse, what initial assessment data should you collect from José to better understand his current
        mental health status and his readiness to begin treatment with fluoxetine? How can you recognize cues that
        may indicate the severity of his depression?

    4. After gathering the assessment data, analyze the information you've collected from José. Based on his
        presentation and family history, what are the psychopharmacological drug classifications that may be
        relevant to his condition? How do these classifications interact with his current symptoms, and what potential
        complications should you consider?

    5. What are the primary hypotheses regarding the cause of José's depression, and how would you rank them in
        terms of likelihood, considering both psychiatric and pharmacological factors? What nursing interventions
        and client education would be essential in his care plan?

    6. José has decided to start taking fluoxetine. What nursing actions should you take during the implementation
        phase to ensure his safety and therapeutic effectiveness of the medication? How can you support him in
        adhering to the treatment plan?

CHAPTER OUTLINE
5.1 Psychiatric-Mental Health Treatment Settings
5.2 Group Therapy
5.3 Community Support Systems
5.4 Family Support Systems
INTRODUCTION The available therapeutic settings within a community, both inpatient and outpatient, are an
important consideration when providing appropriate psychiatric-mental health care. Nurses and other health-care
providers should be knowledgeable about the resources their community has to offer.
Not all communities have the same mental health resources accessible. There may be instances when the most
therapeutic option is a resource found in another community. Networking between facilities is an important part of
working in the psychiatric-mental health (PMH) field. Positive working relationships between facilities create better
outcomes for clients by providing more options for treatment. Reaching out can include calling facilities to find out if
they currently have a program to address a client's needs, finding out if beds are available if inpatient treatment is
necessary, and even asking if someone from a facility can provide interprofessional team training on their services.
Because the least restrictive environment that is safe and effective is the most therapeutic setting, place preference
on keeping a client in the community for as long as possible before considering an inpatient placement.

     5.1 Psychiatric-Mental Health Treatment Settings

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe the main types of treatment settings
         · Identify advantages of each treatment setting
         · Identify disadvantages of each treatment setting

     The word milieu describes the environment in which mental health treatment occurs. There are many different
     milieus to consider when thinking about treatment settings. In milieu therapy, clients are treated in a structured,
     safe environment where their participation in day-to-day routines, communities, and relationships is the method of
     therapy. Milieu therapy dates back to the 1950s residential treatment of emotionally disturbed children (Smith &
     Spitzmueller, 2016). In more recent years, the type and role of milieu has expanded from primarily inpatient
     environments to community environments where interactions occur between health-care/nursing staff and the
     client and between clients sharing experiences. Some examples of milieu settings include inpatient behavioral
     health units, outpatient therapists' offices, community mental health centers, methadone clinics, and substance use
     rehabilitation programs. Within this therapeutic setting or milieu, the client learns positive coping skills, appropriate
     reactions to and communication with others, and practical applications of the therapeutic experience to their lives
     outside of the treatment environment. Treatment settings themselves are as varied as the clients who need
     treatment. The clinician and the client must work together to find the most appropriate fit for treating the presenting
     symptoms.

     Types of Treatment Settings

     The chosen site for the treatment is based on the type and acuity of a client's symptoms and the ability to treat them
     safely outside of the inpatient setting. More specifically, decisions about treatment environments are based on
     safety of the person and others, the person's mental capacity at the time of care, and, in some cases, state laws
     (Pirotte & Benson, 2023). Choosing the least restrictive effective environment, however, is the overriding goal. A
     least restrictive environment is one in which the client receives the most effective treatment that places the fewest
     restrictions on their life. These environments take into consideration a person's personal rights to be able to choose
     where they receive care, their ability to make decisions, their right to be involved in collaborative care with their
     treatment providers, and their right to refuse care or request a different type of care than that recommended by the
     health-care provider.

     There are many different types of mental health services offered in the community, for example:

         · Patient-centered medical homes are comprehensive, coordinated, patient-centered models of primary care
             (AHRQ, n.d.). This type of setting offers mental health and medical care all in one facility. This often
             encourages the client to keep up with their medical care because they are already comfortable receiving their
             mental health care in the same setting.

         · Community mental health centers offer free, low-cost, or sliding scale care for those who lack resources to
             pay for mental health care. These centers are typically in the center of town making them convenient,
             especially if transportation is a barrier to care.

         · County programs, such as Comprehensive Community Services (CSC) or Community Support Programs (CSP),
             offer intensive case management services that allow a person to live in their own home with the support of
             trained personnel who assist them with transportation to health-care provider appointments, running errands,
             peer support services, and care coordination.

         · Forensic nursing is an area of specialty that provides nursing care in correctional facilities, including
             psychiatric-mental health care. The advantage to this type of program is that an incarcerated person can
             continue to receive their mental health medications. The disadvantage is that many programs lack funding to
             provide a psychiatrist who sees the incarcerated people as often as is needed for their mental health needs.
             There is also lack of coordination with local community systems to provide appropriate mental health care to
             individuals upon release from correctional facilities, leading to relapse and recidivism.

         · Psychiatric home care provides community-based treatment for clients who are homebound. The client is able
             to continue to live in their own home with the support of the visits they receive from their assigned nurse.
             Remaining at home helps clients to feel like they have autonomy.

    · Certified peer specialists are people in recovery who support clients by helping them with lived experience
        examples and by providing hope. Peer specialists offer support by sharing their own experiences with a client.
        The support offered through this type of interaction can increase a person's hope that they, too, will be able to
        recover.

    · Telepsychiatry provides therapy and services through videoconferencing. This option became very popular
        during COVID-19 and there are now many applications that clients can access directly from their phones so
        that they can talk to a therapist at any time. Telepsychiatry through a therapist's office requires scheduled
        appointments at specific times. This may not be an option for people who live in rural areas without internet
        connection, who do not have cell phones or computers, or for those who feel more comfortable talking to a
        therapist face-to-face.

Outpatient Treatment
Outpatient treatment occurs in the community; it means receiving a health-care treatment with no overnight stay.
Clients often visit their primary care provider first when concerned about their mental health. If a client has a more
severe mental health challenge, they are typically referred to specialized psychiatric care providers, such as
psychiatrists, psychiatric-mental health advanced practice registered nurses/nurse practitioners, psychologists,
social workers, counselors, or other licensed therapists.

In terms of outpatient treatment, clients may see a therapist to discuss ongoing issues, get assistance developing
positive coping skills, and determine triggers that worsen symptoms. A client may be connected to a community
mental health center where they attend appointments with their psychiatrist or therapist and can participate in
group therapy. A person with a severe mental illness (SMI), a mental illness that interferes with a person's ability to
function in life, may be followed closely by a case manager from, for instance, an Assertive Community Treatment
(ACT) program, which has a team available 24/7, so that person can continue to live independently. An ACT program
offers a team of specially trained case managers who support their clients by providing transportation to medical
and mental health appointments; help with transportation for errands, such as grocery shopping; and assist with
care coordination, such as scheduling appointments with various doctors. Another such service is Comprehensive
Community Support, which "focuses on five life domains: independent living, learning, working, socializing and
recreation" (Presbyterian Medical Services, 2023, para 1). This type of program, and others like it, promote
resilience by teaching clients about community resources and how to access/use them. Outpatient treatment is the
primary goal--and often the best route--for most people dealing with a mental illness.

Some community mental health centers encourage training clients who have gone through mental health issues and
are working on their recovery to become certified peer specialists (see 6.3 Peer Support). One thing that a peer
specialist might be trained to do is run Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP) groups. These programs provide tools
and teach participants how to create action plans to live a safe and healthy life (Advocates for Human Potential,
2023).

Advantages
Outpatient settings can be more convenient, less expensive, encourage longer-term client/counselor relationships,
keep the client working, and are more amenable to family support. In outpatient settings, clients are cared for in or
near the communities in which they live. For those with limited access to transportation, a community health center
is often easily accessible via foot or public transport. Over time, clients build trusting rapports with their therapists,
leading to better long-term outcomes. Other advantages include clients being able to continue with their daily
activities and having close support from their families. This option is also more cost-effective than inpatient
treatment, especially for clients with jobs who can continue to work. Clients can also immediately apply what they
are learning from their outpatient treatment provider to their daily lives.

Disadvantages
In rural areas, there may not be access to a local health-care center, requiring the client to travel long distances to
receive mental health care. This can cause barriers, such as lack of transportation for those who do not drive or an
inability to take off time from work to travel a long distance for an appointment. An additional problem in some
areas is a general lack of mental health providers, which decreases the availability of appointments and the
flexibility to find times that are convenient for the client. Moreover, some outpatient treatment centers have access
to fewer specialized resources than inpatient offerings and offer less supervision than inpatient options.

             REAL RN STORIES

     Nurse: Lenore, MSN, RN-BC
     Clinical Setting: Community mental health center
     Years in Practice: 19
     Location: New Hampshire

     As a nurse who had worked primarily in the inpatient behavioral health setting, it was refreshing to begin working at
     the local community mental health center. Part of my new role was as the medication nurse for the clients who
     received monthly, twice monthly, and weekly injections of their psychiatric medications. I was thrilled to care for
     some of the same clients I had cared for in the hospital. I already had a rapport with these clients and now could
     treat them where they lived in the community.

     One client would often stop by even when he did not have an appointment. Marc had schizophrenia. With
     medication, he was able to live independently and do odd jobs. One day, he asked me, "Do you really think I have
     schizophrenia? I just don't know if I do." I replied, "Yes, I think you do. You tell me you hear voices that no one else
     hears. You feel worse if you miss getting your medication. But, remember, you are not alone. You have your team
     here to support you." Marc left my office to go about his day. A week or two later, Marc stopped by my office. It was
     obvious he had been thinking about our conversation when he said to me, "Lenore, you have always been nice to me
     and honest with me. I really appreciate it." I am sure it took a lot for Marc to say that to me. That was about ten
     years ago, and I still think about it from time to time. The therapeutic connections we make with our clients matter.

     Patient-Centered Medical Homes
     A patient-centered medical home (or the medical home model) provides comprehensive, coordinated, client-
     centered models of primary care. These facilities are not available in every community, but the trend to provide
     medical homes is a national initiative through the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ, 2022).
     Nurses can access the AHRQ website for more information on finding local medical homes. The medical home
     model, developed by the Veterans Health Administration, is an example of a proactive, primary care,
     interdisciplinary team based on client-centered, holistic care, and active communication and coordination among
     providers. This model is considered effective for clients with complex health-care needs. Core elements of the
     medical home model distinguish it from traditional primary care, such as:

         · Clinical outreach: Outreach to people without homes, individuals in shelters, and to those in community
             locations, such as soup kitchens

         · Low threshold access to care: Open access with walk-in capacity and flexible scheduling (i.e., clients do not
             need an appointment to be seen by their care team)

         · Integrated services: Several different kinds of health-care providers in one location, for example, a
             psychiatrist, a therapist, and a health-care provider; mental health services and primary care services are
             located close to each other

         · Sustenance needs: Food or food vouchers, hygiene kits, clothes, bus passes, other transportation assistance
         · Health-care management: Integrated with community agencies with an emphasis on ongoing, continuous care
         · Continual staff training: Focusing on development of care skills for those without homes

     Advantages
     Clients are seen where they feel comfortable and accepted. The lack of need for an appointment means that clients
     can walk in when they are feeling capable of getting to the medical home and are willing and ready to see a provider.
     Because of the variety of services offered in one place, this model is convenient to those clients who have work,
     transportation, and time considerations. Seeing a variety of different providers in different settings may prove
     overwhelming or practically impossible. This type of setting works well for those clients with a distrust for medical
     providers based on their cognition or prior poor treatment or for individuals with multiple medical comorbidities.
     Examples of clients having cognitive problems include those experiencing acute psychiatric symptoms, such as
     paranoia or hearing negative voices (auditory hallucinations), a person born with cognitive disabilities, or a person
     who has dementia. Any of these people may have also had a poor prior treatment experience due to things like
     perceived stigmas from those providing care, being discharged from a medical provider's practice due to missed

appointments (this happens due to lack of transportation, not feeling well enough to attend the appointment, or
even forgetting the appointment due to their illness), or being unable to build a rapport with that provider.

Disadvantages
Not all communities have this sort of medical model available. Some practices that try to follow this model find that
it is financially difficult. They need to be reimbursed at higher dollar amounts in order to make health-care providers
within their practice interested in pursuing the work, and the required documentation that goes into developing this
model can be prohibitive. They also may find the need to hire extra personnel whose job it is to specifically
communicate and coordinate care with other area specialties and offices (Budgen & Cantiello, 2017).

        LINK TO LEARNING

This TED talk (https://openstax.org/r/77sangudelle) discusses the use of digital tools to fight the stigma associated
with getting mental health treatment.

Telehealth Home Care Treatment
COVID-19 led to increased availability of telehealth appointments both through traditional therapists' offices and
online applications. In telehealth, health-care providers use digital technologies to deliver medical care, health
education, and public health services by remotely connecting multiple users in separate locations. Nurses must be
aware of potential barriers affecting client use of telehealth (i.e., lack of internet access or lack of support for
individuals learning new technologies), as well as state and federal policies regarding telehealth and their nursing
license across state lines.

        LINK TO LEARNING

The telehealth hub at the Department of Health and Human Services website provides telehealth information tabs
for clients and providers, including licensing requirements and interstate compacts (https://openstax.org/r/
77telehealth2).

Teletherapy is mental health counseling over the phone or online with videoconferencing. When engaging in
teletherapy, nurses should treat clients as if they are sitting across from them and should focus on eye contact and
empathetic expressions to build a connection, just like during a face-to-face encounter (Telehealth.hhs.gov, 2021).
Group therapy can also take place via telehealth. Connecting clients through telehealth can build community,
reduce feelings of isolation, and provide a forum to share new perspectives. Group therapy, even through telehealth,
can create a sense of belonging and build a trusted support system (Telehealth.hhs.gov, 2021).

Advantages
Clients can receive services within the comfort of their own homes where they feel safe and less anxious. The use of
telehealth and teletherapy can also provide a connection to services and support that may otherwise have been
inaccessible. This option provides "therapy at the fingertips" for those who are tech-savvy. It is more cost-effective,
is convenient, saves time, offers access that may not have been available otherwise, and eliminates other stigma
sometimes associated with seeking mental health services.

Disadvantages
The lack of internet connection in some rural areas and homes eliminates the option for in-home treatment through
teletherapy. Plus, there may be more distractions in a client's home during a therapy session and the connection
between client and provider may suffer or take slightly longer to develop than when in person. Some clients are not
appropriate candidates for in-home or teletherapy due to the acute nature of their symptoms. These clients include
those who are actively suicidal or at risk for self-harm and those with cognitive, hearing, or vision problems (DeCarlo
et al., 2020).

Home Care
In many cases, when someone thinks of home care nursing, they are thinking of the medical care given to some
150  5 · Therapeutic Settings

     clients after they are discharged home from the hospital but need follow-up for a limited time to help with things like
     dressing changes, ostomy care, or even to check on newborn wellness. But some home care facility teams may also
     include psychiatric nurses who provide in-home visits to homebound clients. This type of care is a way of keeping
     clients in their homes, in the least restrictive environment, so that they can live as normal a life as possible while still
     receiving mental health treatment. The home care psychiatric nurse provides regularly scheduled visits to the client
     to monitor any psychiatric symptoms they may be having, provides safety checks to ensure the client is not having
     any suicidal urges, does medication checks to make sure the client is taking their medication as prescribed, helps
     with coordination of other medical or community services, and may even draw labs so that the client does not need
     to leave their home for these services. Combining existing home care programs with the option of in-person or
     telehealth visits has increased wellness in these clients (Boland, 2018).

     Advantages
     There are several advantages to mental health home care. Visits to a client's home can allow nurses to ensure the
     client's understanding of and monitor adherence with a client's medication. The home visit provides socialization to
     a person who might otherwise feel isolated, and the level of intimacy between the RN and the client grows as the
     client becomes more comfortable having the RN in their home. Home visits offer an opportunity to meet the client
     where they are, understand their surroundings, and see what limitations and safety obstacles the environment may
     pose. For instance, there may be fall risks from scatter rugs or a lack of shower rails. The nurse can make
     environmental safety recommendations to the client and family based on home observations. The nurse has the
     added benefit of observing the connection between family members and the client and providing overall support
     and education to the entire family (Boland, 2018).

     Disadvantages
     In rural areas where there may be a lack of mental health services available, a single nurse may be required to travel
     many miles to see clients within the home environment. Travel time makes home visits less efficient, and the nurses
     can see fewer clients in a day because of transport time between appointments. Other concerns for the nurse
     include safety of being in the client's home, amount of time spent in the appointment, especially if family is present,
     and maintaining professional boundaries.

     Substance Use Rehabilitation
     The treatment of substance use disorder is called substance use rehabilitation; it takes place in a variety of
     settings because no one way works best for everyone. It may entail use of medication to reduce cravings, group
     therapy, family education, and a long-term recovery process. The treatment of substance use disorder is typically
     delivered in freestanding programs in hospitals, residential, or outpatient settings that vary in the frequency of care
     delivery, the range of treatment components offered, and planned duration of care. As clients progress in treatment
     and begin to meet the goals of their individualized treatment plan, they often transfer from clinical management in
     residential or intensive outpatient programs to less clinically intensive outpatient programs that promote client self-
     management (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration & Office of the Surgeon General, 2016).

     As with all treatment, the amount of time that a client spends in treatment is based on what substances they have
     been using and their individual needs. An example of a typical progression for someone who has a severe substance
     use disorder might start with three to seven days in a medically managed withdrawal program, followed by a one- to
     three-month period of intensive rehabilitative care in a residential treatment program, followed by an intensive
     outpatient program (two to five days per week for a few months), and later a traditional outpatient program that
     meets one to two times per month. Many people seek the help of a medically managed withdrawal program to get
     them through their detox symptoms and ensure that they can safely withdraw from the substance/s they have been
     using. Depending on the substance used, there may be certain medications to help the client through this period. In
     the case of a person who has been using alcohol as their drug of choice, this type of withdrawal support can be
     lifesaving as withdrawal from alcohol can dangerously increase blood pressure and cause seizures or death. For
     clients whose current living situations are not conducive to recovery, one approach is to recommend outpatient
     services in conjunction with recovery-supportive housing. Best practices recommend that clients with serious
     substance use disorders stay engaged for at least one year in the treatment process, which may involve participating
     in three to four different programs or services at varying levels of intensity, all of which are ideally designed to help
     the client prepare for continued self-management after treatment ends (Substance Abuse and Mental Health
     Services Administration & Office of the Surgeon General, 2016). For example, medication assisted treatment (MAT)

is evidence-based and methadone clinics are helpful to people recovering from opiate addiction.

Advantages
Offering a variety of programs to a person with a substance use disorder enables them to feel autonomy in the
process of choosing their treatment. Programs can be chosen based on location, type of services offered, cost and
insurance coverage, and personal preference. When choosing a program, an individual may choose something that
is close to where they live so that they can continue to have the support of their family and friends. Some people
want a holistic program that offers medical, psychological, and spiritual wellness, while others prefer a spiritual-
only-based program. For many people, cost is the biggest factor, so they have to choose a program that accepts
insurance or Medicaid/Medicare. People who are not limited by a specific budget have a much larger variety of
programs from which to choose, which allows for individual preferences in determining treatment.

Disadvantages
Programs that are self-pay only and not covered by insurance, Medicaid, or Medicare can pose huge barriers to
those struggling with substance use disorders. Clients also must be motivated to change as assessed by the health-
care team when presenting treatment options to the client. Prochaska's Stages of Change (Figure 5.2) illustrate the
cyclical pattern of substance use treatment, recovery, and relapse that can become a barrier to ongoing wellness
(Krebs, 2018). Clients can become discouraged and stigma surrounding substance use can prevent people from
seeking and continuing to receive the help that they need.

        CULTURAL CONTEXT

Overdoses in Native Americans

As the opioid crisis continues in the United States, nurses should be aware of the high overdose rates (OD) among
Native Americans. Statistics of OD rates put this cultural group in second place, behind White people. The highest
mortality rates are in Minnesota, Washington, Alaska, and Oklahoma (Venner, K. L. et al., 2018).

Treatment concerns for Native Americans involve a lack of western medicine health-care providers who recognize
that healing for many Native Americans is holistic in nature. Their traditional medicine wheel allots equal
importance to mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual health contributing to a person's overall health. Although
clinical studies have proven that medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction has a much higher rate of
response than only using psychosocial treatments, there are many barriers to Native Americans using this method
of treatment: lack of cultural training, lack of access to medication resources, limited access to prescribers and high
turnover rate of those prescribers, discrimination received by Native Americans, and the Native Americans' differing
152  5 · Therapeutic Settings

     beliefs about length of time that it is acceptable to continue taking a medication (Venner, K. L. et al., 2018).

     As a nurse, you can bridge the cultural gap that might occur when providing substance use care in a treatment
     facility. You can do things like assign clients of similar ages to the same support groups, incorporate cultural
     preferences, and include the family in care planning. Doing these things helps the client feel that their whole identity
     has been validated.

     The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is required to help direct federal
     resources under the Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010 (SAMHSA, n.d.). It helps the tribes set up Tribal Action Plans
     (TAPs) to ensure that tribes have the resources and programs to address issues with substance use and recovery.

     Partial Hospitalization and Intensive Outpatient Services
     A step-down program for clients who require a higher level of care and support than that offered by outpatient
     treatment but who do not need twenty-four-hour supervision is called a partial hospitalization program (PHP).
     They are usually available six to eight hours a day during the workweek and are located on the hospital grounds.
     Services range from counseling, medication management, and education to clinically intensive programming, such
     as individual or group therapy. These services are less intensive and less restrictive than inpatient programs and are
     appropriate for clients living in an environment that supports recovery but who need structure to avoid relapse. One
     step down from partial hospitalization are intensive outpatient services. These services still require that the client
     attend therapy several times a week but allow the person to maintain their regular daily schedule with extra
     support.

     Advantages
     This type of program generally offers specially trained doctors, nurses, and social workers as well as other members
     of the interprofessional team, but allows the client to live in their own home with their family. They can return to
     work on a limited basis (depending on the number of days the psychiatrist prescribed for attendance). This is
     considered a less restrictive environment option than being in an inpatient unit as it gives the person more
     autonomy.

     Disadvantages
     While the client can have effective follow-up with nurses and therapists in these group-based programs, they may
     not be able to return to work in full capacity as soon as they would like. And while the treatment itself is intensive,
     during the evening hours, the client may feel increased stress as they must rely on what they have learned to begin
     to care for themselves without the assistance of others. The home environment is also an important consideration.
     Where and with whom a person lives can affect their ability to handle daily stressors, especially if they are having
     mental health difficulties. An unstable home environment will not provide the support that a person needs when
     they are transitioning out of the hospital setting. A client also needs to be able to follow the schedule of the partial
     hospitalization program (PHP) or intensive outpatient program (IOP), have transportation to the facility, and be able
     to participate in treatment at the site. Additionally, they need to be stable and safe enough to remain in an
     outpatient setting for treatment.

     Inpatient Treatment
     Clients with acute mental health symptoms, or those who are at risk for hurting themselves or others, may be
     hospitalized. These clients are often initially seen in the emergency department for emergency psychiatric
     assessment. Clients may seek voluntary admission, or in some situations, may be involuntarily admitted after
     referral for emergency evaluation by law enforcement and/or health-care providers.

     Acute-care psychiatric units in general hospitals are typically locked units on a separate floor of the hospital. The
     purpose is to maintain environmental safety for clients. State-operated psychiatric hospitals serve clients who have
     chronic serious mental illness. They also provide court-related care for criminal cases where the client was found
     "not guilty by reason of insanity." While uncommon, this judgment means the client was deemed to be so mentally
     ill when they committed a crime that they cannot be held responsible for the act; instead, they require long-term,
     inpatient mental health treatment.

     Advantages
     Inpatient mental health treatment runs 24/7 and is monitored by specially trained doctors, nurses, and social

workers as well as other members of the interprofessional team. The environment has been created to make safety
the priority. It takes clients out of environments that may have been exacerbating to their mental health conditions.
Trained staff can modify or quickly change medications that they notice are not having the intended effects or are
having intolerable side effects. In other words, in the inpatient setting, it is possible to make quicker pivots in
treatment. Having regular access to in-place therapeutic groups helps clients recognize their strengths and build
positive coping skills through shared experiences with others.

Disadvantages
Stigma remains high in this treatment setting. Some clients are afraid that "people will find out." Not wanting
anyone to know they are receiving mental health treatment adds to the isolation clients may feel as inpatients.
Insurance companies may limit the number of days that a client can remain an inpatient, regardless of health-care
providers recommending a longer stay. If the client has been involuntarily admitted to the unit, they may be angry at
the health-care provider and staff for keeping them against their will. Taking away a person's rights can cause them
to lose autonomy, which can affect motivation and recovery. Planning for discharge is important, as the same
triggers may be present once the client returns to a lesser restrictive environment.

        CLINICAL SAFETY AND PROCEDURES (QSEN)

QSEN Competencies: Client-Centered Care, Teamwork

A thirty-two-year-old female presents to the emergency department stating she has had a seizure and requests
something for her "nerves." The client has a history of alcohol abuse, alcohol withdrawal, and does not have a
permanent home. The client is admitted for observation related to alcohol withdrawal. You are the receiving nurse
on the PMH unit. Consider how to approach the first two QSEN Competencies.

Client-Centered Care: Assess and respond to a change in client condition/reevaluate after interventions, assess for
S/S acute alcohol withdrawal, assess for suicide risk, discuss options for a client who wants to drink alcohol,
incorporate client/family input in treatment plan, intervene when conflict or need for client education is noted

Teamwork and Collaboration: Participate in shift-to-shift handoff, reach out to social work to advocate for
discharge planning that acknowledges concern regarding homelessness, notify the provider as needed using SBA,
receive verbal orders, delegate/seek help as needed

Residential Treatment
Residential treatment includes long-term care facilities, group homes, and supportive/transitional housing. These
treatment options are for those people who, because they are not able to be independent, need long-term care for
chronic and/or severe mental illness, brain injury, dementia, intellectual and physical disabilities, behavioral issues,
and substance use recovery.

Advantages
Clients living in these facilities receive 24/7 care by trained health-care providers in a safe, homelike environment.
They have opportunities to engage with others, participate in treatment, and learn positive coping skills to deal with
activities of daily living. These facilities are the clients' homes during their treatment and have additional benefits,
such as activities, education, medication management, and group therapy.

Disadvantages
These facilities do not generally serve as acute care treatment centers. When a client has an exacerbation of
symptoms or an acute episode of their disorder, the client is often sent to inpatient hospitalization for stabilization.
The client does not have a choice of roommates if the facility does not offer private rooms, so there is a chance of
conflict between clients with behavioral challenges. Many people who live in residential treatment facilities never
move out of this type of living environment. This may be due to lack of family members who can support them,
behavior issues that prevent them from living with family, or their own inability to fully immerse themselves in the
real world. Stigma often prevents these individuals from being able to move out of a group home; landlords may not
be willing to provide housing. Private insurance or Medicaid may not cover costs of this type of treatment. For
example, Texas Medicaid does not cover group homes, and most supportive living facilities are self-pay (NAMI
Texas, n.d.).

     5.2 Group Therapy

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Identify the functions of a group, particularly in the context of group therapy
         · Discuss the seven characteristics of group dynamics

     Group therapy is a treatment option available to help people experiencing mental health issues. This setting
     provides the opportunity to learn from others' experiences, allows for support of one another, opens the floor to
     education, and encourages participants to share their feelings in a safe environment. Groups can be geared toward a
     particular problem or diagnosis. They can also be specific to teaching coping strategies or social skills (American
     Psychological Association, 2019).

     Functions of a Group

     Group therapy serves many purposes for its participants: a place of belonging, a forum to share/learn new
     knowledge, an appropriate outlet, and an opportunity to practice supporting others and receiving support. A
     therapeutic group works as a unit to support its members and make them accountable for participation within the
     group (American Psychological Association, 2019). Working together to learn from and gain sustenance from one
     another is the biggest strength of a group. Each member of the group brings their own experiences to it. Depending
     on the topic of the group, members may be encouraged to share their individual experiences. Sharing these
     experiences helps the group members feel a sense of comradery with others who may have similar experiences. The
     sharing helps them to realize they are not alone in what they are going through. The group leader (in some cases,
     this is a nurse) teaches the members how to support one another and how to accept the support of others.
     Attending groups may be the expectation of the facility, a recommendation of the individual's therapist/provider, or
     their own personal treatment choice.

     Group Dynamics

     A group starts with everyone agreeing on a like purpose or objective. Then, there are several important factors
     (Figure 5.3) that further define how the group will operate and what it will look like when pursuing those objectives.
     These factors of group dynamics include roles, size, composition, leadership, cohesiveness, status, and norms.

     Access for free at openstax.org
5.2 · Group Therapy                                                                                                                    155

FIGURE 5.3 The dynamics of a group are influenced by multiple factors and are ever-changing. (attribution: Copyright Rice University,
OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

Depending upon the type of group, some of these factors might change over time (if the group meets regularly over a
set time period). If the group is a one-time group, then these factors would not change unless a participant gets up
and leaves the room. If the group is a recurring group and is an open group (meaning that new members can join at
any time), then there could be changes in size, composition, and cohesiveness over time. If the group is a recurring
group that is a closed group (meaning that the same members attend for the duration of the group, such as a six-
week group that meets each week on Tuesday), then there probably would not be a lot of change to these factors.

Member Roles in a Group
Typically, there is a group leader (facilitator)--this can be a peer support person or a trained health-care provider,
such as a therapist or a psychiatric nurse--and group participants. The leader facilitates the direction of each group
meeting, keeps order, and promotes healthy interaction between participants. The participants are often people
with similar backgrounds in experience or diagnosis who have the chance to gain strength, skills, and perspective
from being part of the group. If the group is a closed group, then the same members will be in the group from start
to finish, for the specified duration of the group. In an open group, a new member can join at any time. This will
change the dynamics and possibly the roles of the group members as new personalities join the mix.

Group Size and Composition
The group size and composition are usually decided upon by the facilitator prior to the beginning of the group.
Depending on the topic of the group, it may be better to limit the number of participants in order to make the shared
conversation more intimate. Choosing participants with similar concerns or symptoms helps them to feel a sense of
belonging and connection with others within the group (Malhotra & Baker, 2022). Unless the group is focused on
helping clients with a particular diagnosis, groups usually function better if its members are not currently in an acute
state (i.e., psychotic or under the influence). Someone in an acute state would be better suited to individual therapy.
Most inpatient units will have a morning meeting to start the day and an evening meeting to end the day. All clients
are encouraged to attend these groups. There may also be specific groups offered if there are a lot of people
156  5 · Therapeutic Settings

     currently in the unit with the same diagnosis. For instance, if there are many people with bipolar disorder who are
     experiencing auditory hallucinations (hearing voices), then there might be a group offered on this topic so that
     clients can learn/share coping mechanisms.

     Group Leadership Styles
     There are numerous leadership styles common across many environments, such as business, health care, and
     education. This section discusses several of those styles and how they affect the work of the participants in group
     therapy. No matter which leadership style, the leader must remain flexible and able to adapt to changing situations
     in order to meet group goals.

       CLINICAL JUDGMENT MEASUREMENT MODEL

       Analyze Cues: Leadership Styles in Group Settings

       To understand how well the different leadership styles work within the group therapy intervention, nurses must
       be able to identify the types of leadership styles. Each style represents a different way that a group's leader will
       encourage members to interact with one another. Before facilitating a therapeutic group, the nurse needs to
       think about the leadership style that will work best to reach the intended outcome. The group leader is there to
       assist its members to learn about and understand both individual and interpersonal problems (Ezhumalai et al.,
       2018). In this way, group therapy is intended to bring about positive change through the sharing of information,
       ideas, lived experiences, and coping skills to apply to stressful situations.

       For example, participative leadership is often used in the Wrap Up Group that ends the day in an inpatient
       behavioral health unit. At this meeting, clients are asked to share how their days went, what they accomplished,
       and are often asked to sign up for certain responsibilities in the unit, such as turning off the TV and straightening
       chairs in the TV room or returning all phones to the nurses' station. This leadership style encourages everyone to
       work together.

     Authoritative Leadership
     The authoritative leadership (or autocratic) style is one in which the leader is in command and exerts control over
     the group members (Cherry, 2022). In authoritative leadership, the leader would be in complete control; it can be
     viewed as "bossy or dictatorial" (para 7). This style is best used when there needs to be quick decision-making. This
     leadership style might be used in a group setting in which participants are given a set time limit to complete a task.

     Delegative Leadership
     The delegative leadership style relies on the group members to do the work at hand. This style is also referred to as
     laissez-faire. Here, the leader offers little direction to group members, often leaving them without needed guidance.
     This leadership style might be beneficial for a team building group in which the leader is actually trying to get group
     members to work together to problem-solve. This leadership style would be stressful to a group of people who have
     OCD or anxiety.

     Participative Leadership
     The participative leadership style (also known as democratic) entails listening to group concerns and allowing
     members to help with decision-making. This style of leadership encourages the group members to participate
     actively. They feel heard and part of the decision-making process even though the leader has the final say (Cherry,
     2022).

     Servant Leadership
     The servant leadership style works toward the greater good of the members of the group, placing emphasis on
     learning and growth, contentment of group members, and feelings of ownership by group members. Chobanuk and
     James (2015) suggest that this style of leadership motivates others and gains positive results.

     Transactional Leadership
     In transactional leadership, the leader uses a reward and punishment system in order to get results from the group
     and achieve group goals (Chobanuk & James, 2015). Studies have concluded that this type of leadership does get
     results. This leadership style is sometimes used to make learning fun, such as playing a bingo game to teach about

medication and then offering a small prize to the winner. This is especially useful when treating children. This
leadership style might have the opposite effect for people experiencing paranoia as they might feel that the leader is
against them if they are not the winner and do not receive a prize.

Transformational Leadership
The transformational leadership style involves being a change agent; leaders view group members as valuable and
change as positive. Transformational leaders possess four attributes to varying degrees. They are charismatic
(highly liked role models), inspirational (optimistic about goal attainment), intellectually stimulating (encourage
critical thinking and problem-solving), and considerate (Bass et al., 1996). They encourage participation through
"adapt[ing] to the environment, demonstrat[ing] flexibility for change and resolution of issues" (Chobanuk & James,
2015, p. 114). Many leaders are now using this style to help participants in group therapy settings feel more
included/supported.

Group Cohesiveness
Cohesiveness refers to the belonging that each member feels to the group or "interpersonal support, acceptance
and esteem within the group" (Bryde et al., 2021, p. 1). It is what brings the members together to work on the task
at hand. Participants often feel closer to one another than they do to the group leader and that is expected as a
therapeutic point because the ultimate goal is for the participants to feel like they are not alone in what they are
experiencing. The group leader will often read a list of expectations prior to the start of the group. This list might
include the necessity to treat all with respect and the possibility of being asked to leave the group if these
expectations are not followed. By setting up the group expectations, the leader is helping to ensure that the group
members feel supported by one another. The leader also makes sure that everyone who wants to speak or
participate gets an equal opportunity to do so by using positive reminders or a timer to ensure that no one
monopolizes the conversation.

Group Status and Norms
Within any group will be a hierarchy of group members and norms by which the group abides. Hierarchy represents
each member's status within the group and can be based on time they have been in the group (longer time = more
experience with the process), similarities to other group members, differences from other group members,
educational level, and group role. Cultural and ethnical differences may also play a part in determining an
individual's status within the group, and they will certainly influence the group norms. Norms are beliefs that people
learn over time from their family, cultural and religious upbringing, and the people with whom they interact daily.
Groups create their own norms. In groups with less diversity, there will be a higher chance of shared norms
(Meeussen et al., 2018). As a group's size and diversity increases, common norms decrease. It is the job of the
leader to mitigate any conflict that may arise and create common norms specific to the group setting. Beginning
each session with a review of the group's ground rules is helpful so that all members understand acceptable
behavior while participating.

        PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Criteria for Client Placement in Group Therapy

Some criteria to consider before placing a client in group therapy include (1) the client's characteristics, needs,
preferences, and stage of recovery; (2) the program resources; and (3) the nature of the group or groups available.
Clients are matched with the type of group and program resource that best matches where they are in their recovery
journey. Do they prefer to be treated alone or would they prefer to work in a group of other people in the same stage
of recovery? If they continue to relapse, for instance, they may not be a good match for a group of people who have
been sober together for a long time. Gender and age considerations should also be noted as some people do not
want to be in a mixed group of male and female clients and it would be inappropriate to mix adolescents with adults.

Group Types
Some of the types of therapeutic groups include psychoeducational, support, skills, cognitive behavioral, and self-
help. Depending upon the needs of the client, the clinician will suggest which group type might be most helpful.
Psychoeducational groups offer teaching and can be led by a nurse or a therapist. A support group offers
encouragement to clients who have all experienced the same sort of issue, such as a grief support group or a cancer
158  5 · Therapeutic Settings

     support group. A skills group is designed for clients who have not developed certain skills needed for optimal
     functioning. These skills could include coping strategies or socialization (Malhotra & Baker, 2022). Cognitive
     behavioral groups help clients reframe their thinking to lead to positive behavior changes. Self-help groups, such as
     Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), are geared for clients motivated to change.

             CULTURAL CONTEXT

     Overcoming Cultural Barriers

     Nurses must recognize that cultural barriers can make or break the effectiveness of therapy. In "Overcoming
     Cultural Barriers on the Road to Recovery" (2021, October 7), Roselin Dueñas describes going to family therapy to
     deal with her mental health symptoms. "Being a gay, Latina woman who grew up in a religious household of
     immigrants, I had to overcome many obstacles in order to get the help that I needed" (para 2). During her attempt at
     group therapy, she not only had to deal with her parents' backlash for coming out to them as bisexual, but she also
     faced language and financial barriers. Instead of relying on her therapist to help bring her and her parents together,
     she had to act as an interpreter, which reinforced the divide. This challenge made her lose confidence in her
     recovery. Roselin was an immigrant with no documentation; paying for appointments and obtaining medication were
     difficult without health insurance. These were also learning experiences for her as she continued her road to
     recovery and shared her story with others. Refer to the NAMI blog (https://openstax.org/r/77nami2) for more
     information.

     5.3 Community Support Systems

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe a therapeutic community
         · List conditions that promote a therapeutic community
         · Identify members of the interdisciplinary treatment team
         · Discuss the nurse's role in milieu therapy

     When you think about community support systems, it is important to consider the environments in which care takes
     place as well as the people providing the care. Interprofessional teams are groups of professionals who work
     together toward a common goal or outcome when treating clients with mental illness. No two people respond
     exactly the same to treatment. It is important for people to learn how to develop their own community supports and
     learn to be their own advocates, through the help of referrals and resources from their primary care providers.

     Therapeutic Community

     A therapeutic community is a socially interactive approach to client treatment for mental health challenges and can
     include all types of programs, ranging from inpatient to outpatient, short- to longer-term. A therapeutic community
     works by having the clients interact with other people, make their own decisions, and contribute to decision-making
     for the community. In doing so, the clients learn new ways to approach/respond to the world around them
     (Stanborough, 2020). According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (2015), therapeutic communities were
     initially developed as long-term residential treatment facilities for people with substance use disorders. Over the
     years, therapeutic communities have expanded to help people with an array of problems, such as "co-occurring
     psychiatric disorders [and] homeless individuals" (NIH, 2015, para 3).

     Within a therapeutic community, a client strives to be an active participant in group activities, both learning how to
     achieve positive change and helping others with their recovery. The environment where therapy takes place is also
     referred to as the milieu. The therapeutic milieu is closely monitored for safety, has a daily routine, and occurs
     within inpatient and outpatient settings, and meetings (such as AA) or therapeutic groups.

     Conditions That Promote Therapeutic Community

     The underlying principle of a therapeutic community is that clients can use all the parts of the community in order to
     take care of themselves individually and collectively (Janeiro et al., 2018). Clients first learn how the community
     works, what is expected, and the intended goals for treatment. They then begin to interact with both staff and other

clients. Through this process, clients learn to express their emotions safely. Through the education provided in the
therapeutic community, the clients begin to see that psychological change is possible (Janeiro et al., 2018). They
commit to change and to finding ways to apply the change to their lives.

What are the key components for a therapeutic community? Clients begin to develop a sense of hope for the future.
Clients in these communities create a sense of belonging with the connections that form between themselves, staff,
and other clients. Through their interactions, clients have opportunities to "develop life skills, and support in areas
such as employment, funding and benefits, physical health, and relationship issues" (Wood et al., 2022, p. 7).

Interdisciplinary Treatment Teams

An interdisciplinary treatment team is one that may include psychiatrists, nurses, therapists, social workers,
occupational therapists, recreation therapists, mental health technicians, and other team members, all working
together toward the individualized goals of each client. This is not an all-inclusive list of interdisciplinary team
members, as they may differ from facility to facility. According to Miller et al. (2022), for these teams to work well,
there are several conditions. They must first have "material resources" (p. 15) that include being close enough in
physical space and having the equipment needed to get the job done. There must be enough staffing to fill all the
roles within the team. There must be enough time in the daily schedule to get the work completed. There must be
organizational support that includes leaders who are knowledgeable and available to help with any treatment
challenges faced by the team members. Lastly, the team members must have an established respect and trust of
one another.

The Nurse's Role in Milieu Therapy

Nurses constantly observe the ebb and flow of activity in the unit, quickly jumping into action at any indication of a
change that may negatively affect the milieu to ensure the safety and therapeutic benefit of the milieu. The many
roles of the registered nurse in milieu therapy include:

    · demonstrating caring behaviors to develop therapeutic relationships
    · providing care that focuses on the client
    · advocating for the needs of diverse populations across the life span
    · using critical thinking and technology solutions to implement the nursing process to collect, measure, record,

        retrieve, trend, and analyze data and information to enhance health-care consumer outcomes and nursing
        practice
    · partnering with the health-care consumers to implement the plan in a safe, effective, efficient, timely, and
        equitable manner
    · engaging with interprofessional team partners to implement the plan through collaboration and
        communication across the continuum of care
    · using evidence-based interventions and strategies to achieve mutually identified goals and outcomes specific
        to the problem or needs
    · delegating tasks according to the health, safety, and welfare of the health-care consumer and after
        considering the circumstance, person, task, direction or communication, supervision, and evaluation
    · knowing the state's nurse practice act, relevant state and local regulations, and institutional policies, and
        maintaining accountability for the care
    · documenting implementation of and any modifications to the identified nursing care plan

     5.4 Family Support Systems

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe the importance of family support in psychiatric-mental health illness recovery
         · Define family systems therapy concepts and their benefits related to psychiatric-mental health nursing

     Even though the individual client is the focus of therapy, it is vital to remember the importance that family support
     systems play in the client's treatment and recovery. A thorough client history, including questions about who the
     client considers their support person(s), must be part of the initial assessment process.

     Family Support in PMH Recovery

     Recovery is a lifelong process for a person with psychiatric-mental health issues. Piat et al. (2011) state that there
     are two main parts to recovery: clinical recovery and personal recovery. Clinical recovery involves all the ways the
     clinicians rate a person's recovery over time, including "diagnosis, objective measures of symptom management and
     remission, and psychosocial functioning" (p. 3). Personal recovery starts with the person's life experiences and how
     those experiences shape a person's identity. As a person delves into those aspects of their life, they can begin to
     reshape their identity in a healthy way. "Key concepts in the recovery process include hope; personal responsibility,
     self-advocacy and wellness; empowerment and self-determination; and acceptance" (p. 3).

     Families can help by expressing a belief that the person can get better. This helps to instill a sense of hope. Family
     members also protect the person by being advocates for their health care and provide support by trying to keep the
     client's self-image intact even if they have had negative treatment experiences. Families help the individual see their
     strengths and ability beyond their mental health diagnosis. Families offer the individual acceptance, trust, a sense of
     belonging, encouragement, and a place in a community. Remember, however, that "families" may look very different
     from one another and are defined by the client.

     Key Concepts of Family Systems Therapy

     Family therapy is a special form of group therapy, consisting of one or more families. Although there are many
     theoretical orientations in family therapy, one of the most predominant is the systems approach. In this approach,
     the family is viewed as an organized system, and each individual within the family is a contributing member who
     creates and maintains processes within the system that shape behavior (Minuchin, 1985). Each member of the
     family influences and is influenced by the others. The degree to which individuals express or react to life's stressors
     is based on the way the family of origin reacted to the same. The goal of family systems therapy is to enhance the
     growth of each family member as well as that of the family as a whole. The Bowen family systems theory (BFST) was
     developed in the 1950s and is one of the main approaches used in marriage and family therapy (Calatrava et al.,
     2022). The theory is formed around eight main concepts, some of which are detailed more thoroughly here:

         · Nuclear family emotional process: Relationship patterns that guide where conflict occurs in the family unit
         · Differentiation of self: The difference between the individual and groups to which they belong
         · Triangles: The idea of a relationship system of three people
         · Emotional cutoff: Ending emotional contact with another in the family
         · Family projection process: The way that parents can transfer their emotional issues to their children
         · Multigenerational transmission process: The idea that differences between parents and their children grow

             throughout the generations
         · Sibling position: The position in which siblings are born affects behavior and development
         · Emotional processes of society: This same system applies to groups within societies beyond families

             LINK TO LEARNING

     Nurses help clients reach stability by building on the strengths of the family support system and understanding how
     they are connected to recovery and adapt to change. This video on family systems theory (https://openstax.org/r/
     77famsystheory) provides an example.

Emotional Triangles
Emotional triangles, one of the components of Bowen's theory, result when parents have a lower level of
differentiation of self and project their anxiety onto their children by being overreactive and overprotective. This
causes triangulation because it makes the child unable to become differentiated from their parents, reducing their
feeling of autonomy and increasing their levels of reactivity and anxiety (Cepukiene, 2021).

Differentiation of Self
Individuals vary in the degree of "self" they develop and this degree does depend, in part, on family dynamics. This
trait begins to form in young adulthood when the individual can be emotionally objective in the midst of high anxiety
related to other people within their group of belonging. The person begins to be able to have different opinions and
values from the rest of the group members, while still being emotionally connected to them. This group could be
their family, friends, children, or intimate relationships (Calatrava et al., 2022). The higher the level of differentiation
of self, the better the ability of that individual to think for themselves by using intellectual reasoning. Being able to
distinguish oneself from the rest of the group can ultimately affect the family's patterns of functioning and their level
of interaction.

Family Projection Process
The family projection process was also developed by Bowen to explain the way that stressful life events that happen
in childhood shape the attachment that a child has to other members of the family (Palombi, 2016). Depending
upon that level of attachment, the child is at risk of needing to have those family members in order to function. The
way that the family unit adapted its response during stress shapes each individual within that family.

Multigenerational Transmission Process
The multigenerational transmission process explains "how anxiety is transmitted from generation to generation"
(Calatrava et al., 2022, p. 2). Lower levels of anxiety experienced as a child can lead to lower levels of anxiety
experienced as an adult based on the person's learned reaction to stressful situations.

Emotional Cutoff
When people have lower levels of differentiation of self, they continue to be connected to their families in a way that
creates unclear boundaries within their relationships (Messina et al., 2018). They do not develop their own opinions
and values. They seek approval from one another instead of dealing with any tension within their relationships and
may be unable to define their own personal values (Messina et al., 2018). People who are emotionally cut off lack
the ability to find true autonomy even though they may project the look of independence.

With family therapy, the nuclear family (i.e., parents and children) or the nuclear family plus (whoever lives in the
household, e.g., grandparent) come into treatment. Family therapists work with the whole family unit to heal the
family. The main benefit of family systems therapy is that the therapist helps family members resolve issues and
learn to communicate more effectively.
162 5 · Summary

Summary

5.1 Psychiatric-Mental Health Treatment Settings

There are many types of psychiatric-mental health treatment settings, each with its own advantages and
disadvantages. Treatment can happen in the community, in outpatient as well as in inpatient facilities. Clinicians and
clients should work together to choose the least restrictive environment that meets the client's needs.

Building a rapport with clients is important in all types of treatment settings. Gaining the client's trust will improve
treatment outcomes and provide them with the necessary support to live as independently as possible. Telehealth
and teletherapy have become more viable treatment options since COVID-19. Their use extends to rural areas and
to homebound clients who might otherwise not have access to mental health services.

There is a wide range of residential care services available to support people with psychiatric-mental illness. These
facilities offer 24/7 care by trained health-care workers in a homelike environment. There is no one treatment that is
best for all clients. The social, emotional, physical, and spiritual needs of the clients should be considered in
choosing a site.

5.2 Group Therapy

Each of the seven factors of group dynamics works together to determine how successful the group will be in
reaching its determined outcomes. Possible leadership styles include authoritative leadership, delegative
leadership, participative leadership, servant leadership, transactional leadership, and transformational leadership.
Transformational leadership is the most effective current leadership style because of the way it supports its
members and encourages group cohesiveness, thus establishing norms among group members. Many different
types of groups are available, and it is up to the clinician to suggest to the client which group type might be most
appropriate to fit their needs.

5.3 Community Support Systems

Therapeutic communities take a socially interactive approach to client treatment for mental health challenges and
can include all types of programs, ranging from inpatient to outpatient, short- to longer-term. Milieu therapy
provides a safe, structured setting in which people learn to apply healthier ways of thinking and interacting to their
lives. Through the relationships and interactions developed in therapeutic communities, clients begin to enjoy a
sense of hope, create a sense of belonging, and learn to develop skills to apply to their lives outside of treatment.

An interdisciplinary treatment team works together toward the individualized goals of each client. The role of the
nurse within the team includes administering medication, facilitating therapeutic groups, thinking critically to
provide a safe environment, and documenting what transpired for each client during a specific time period. Nurses
also advocate for their clients to make sure they are getting the treatment they deserve.

5.4 Family Support Systems

Family systems are intended to enhance the growth of each family member and the family unit as a whole. The
Bowen family systems theory is the basis of much family therapy that is performed today. The level of attachment
that a child has to their parents will shape their future reactions to stress as they become adults. Family therapy
allows the family unit to work together on issues within their family structure. The therapist helps all members of the
family heal and learn to communicate more effectively.

What Should the Nurse Do?

    1. Amber, a twenty-two-year-old female, has come to her primary care physician accompanied by her
        concerned mother. Amber's mother reports that she has been restricting her food intake in the past six
        months and appears to have lost a lot of weight. She has been avoiding family meals, exercising excessively,
        and staying home favoring online classes rather than in-person ones. While Amber has not had any medical
        problems in the past, she does report strong feelings of anxiety. During the initial assessment, Amber's vital
        signs are as follows: blood pressure of 100/60 mm Hg, heart rate of 50 beats per minute, respiratory rate of
        16 breaths per minute, and BMI of 17.5. Amber appears visibly fatigued and demonstrates signs of social
        withdrawal. She expresses feelings of guilt after eating even small amounts of food and has difficulty
        concentrating on her studies.
        Identify advantages and disadvantages of each treatment setting. What are the pros and cons of inpatient
        treatment, intensive outpatient services, and telehealth for treating Amber at this stage and which is best?

    2. Lawrence arrives at a community mental health clinic seeking support for persistent symptoms of social
        anxiety and depression. He reports challenges in forming and maintaining relationships, both personally and
        professionally. Lawrence, a graphic designer, expresses difficulty collaborating with colleagues and a
        tendency to avoid social gatherings. He mentions a history of childhood trauma, which he has never
        addressed in a therapeutic setting. During the initial assessment, vital signs reveal a slightly elevated blood
        pressure of 130/85 mm Hg, a heart rate of 78 beats per minute, and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per
        minute. Lawrence shows signs of restlessness, constantly fidgeting, and displays guarded body language.
        What verbal and nonverbal cues did Lawrence exhibit during the initial assessment that indicated potential
        suitability for group therapy?

James, a forty-five-year-old male, visits a psychiatric-mental health clinic accompanied by his wife, Sarah. He
presents with symptoms of severe anxiety, insomnia, and emotional withdrawal. James, an accountant, recently lost
his job due to the economic downturn, adding financial stress to the existing burden. His medical history reveals a
family background of mental health issues, with a sibling diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Vital signs during the
initial assessment show an elevated blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg, a heart rate of 88 beats per minute, and a
respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute.

    3. How might James's family history contribute to his symptoms, and in what ways could the recent job loss act
        as a trigger for his anxiety and emotional withdrawal?

    4. What are some potential family-centered interventions that address both James's individual symptoms and
        the broader family context? How might involving Sarah in the treatment plan contribute to James's recovery?

Competency-Based Assessments

    1. The concept of the "least restrictive environment" in mental health refers to providing care and treatment in a
        setting that imposes the fewest limitations on an individual's freedom and autonomy while still ensuring their
        safety and well-being. How would you define this concept for a group of parents who are learning about
        treatment options for their family members with severe mental illnesses?

    2. You are a nurse with a client who has a history of noncompliance with treatment plans. What are the
        advantages and disadvantages of residential, outpatient, and telehealth settings in addressing
        noncompliance issues?

    3. In the context of mental health treatment settings, critically analyze the potential impact of socioeconomic
        factors on a client's access to and experience within treatment settings.

    4. You are a nursing student who has been asked to speak to a group of parents to briefly explain three functions
        of therapeutic groups in mental health care and to explain how a support group functions differently from a
        psychoeducational group. Provide brief explanations.

    5. You have been asked to name some factors that may influence the effectiveness of group therapy for
        individuals with social anxiety. As part of your answer, please discuss how cultural factors are relevant and
        can impact the dynamics of group therapy.

    6. You are a nurse who has been asked by a client's family to consider the potential benefits and challenges of
166 5 · References

        incorporating alternative treatments, such as music or art therapy, into a psychiatric-mental health setting.
        Consider the client engagement and outcomes.

    7. You are a mental health nursing student working on a case study that will require an interdisciplinary
        treatment team to address. What members should the team include and what skills will they bring to the
        effort?

    8. You are a nurse who has been asked to analyze a situation in which family support is lacking in the treatment
        of an individual with PMH illness. Explain how this absence impacts the individual's recovery and what
        interventions could address this deficiency.

    9. You are part of a treatment team that is working with a family that is resistant to participating in family
        systems therapy. Explore potential reasons for this resistance and propose strategies a PMH nurse could
        employ to engage the family in therapy.

CHAPTER OUTLINE
6.1 Nurse-Client Relationship
6.2 Family Dynamics
6.3 Peer Support
6.4 Client Engagement
6.5 Trauma-Informed Care
INTRODUCTION The therapeutic relationship between the client and the nurse is a foundational element in the
provision of good care. This relationship is based on trust, support, engagement, and collaboration to determine a
set of goals based on the needs of the client. The nurse acts as a conduit toward better health, not as an authority
who makes all the decisions. Support from family and friends is also a factor that determines how quickly the client
can recover. Therapeutic relationships and support are protective factors that can decrease the risk of developing or
exacerbating mental health issues.

6.1 Nurse-Client Relationship

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Describe the phases of the nurse-client relationship
    · Discuss the importance of building trust and rapport between the nurse and client
    · Describe boundaries and how to maintain a professional nurse-client relationship
Establishment of the therapeutic nurse-client relationship is vital in nursing care. Nurses engage in compassionate,
170  6 · Therapeutic Relationships

     supportive, professional relationships with their clients as part of the "art of nursing" (American Nurses Association,
     2021). This is especially true in psychiatric care, where the therapeutic relationship is the foundation of client care
     and healing (Ross & Goldner, 2009). The nurse-client relationship establishes trust and rapport with a specific
     purpose; it facilitates therapeutic communication and engages the client in partnership for decision-making
     regarding their plan of care.

     Therapeutic nurse-client relationships vary in depth, length, and focus. Brief therapeutic encounters might last only
     a few minutes and focus on the client's immediate needs, current feelings, or behaviors. For example, in the
     emergency department setting, a nurse may therapeutically communicate with a client in crisis who recently
     experienced a situational trauma. In inpatient care settings, nurses work with clients in setting short-term goals and
     outcomes that are documented in the nursing care plan and evaluated regularly. In long-term care settings, such as
     residential facilities, the therapeutic nurse-client relationship may last several months and include frequent
     interactions focusing on behavior modification.

     Phases of the Nurse-Client Relationship

     Hildegard Peplau is considered the mother of psychiatric nursing through her development of the interpersonal
     relations theory (see 2.2 Interpersonal Theories and Therapies). This theory helps nurses understand the
     importance of therapeutic communication with their clients. According to the theory, there are four phases of the
     nurse-client relationship: pre-orientation, orientation, working, and termination (see link 2.2 Interpersonal Theories
     and Therapies Peplau's nurse/client relationship phases). This relationship is of a professional nature in which both
     the client's and the nurse's "feelings, emotions, and behaviors are taken into consideration" (Deane & Fain, 2016, p.
     38). This theory is beneficial to nursing students as they learn how to communicate effectively with their clients.

     Pre-orientation Phase
     The pre-orientation phase is when the nurse prepares to meet the client by reviewing their chart, getting reports
     from another nurse or department, and planning for the initial assessment that will be performed with this client.
     This is a time when the nurse mentally readies for the interaction that is about to occur.

     Orientation Phase
     During the brief orientation phase, clients may realize they need assistance as they adjust to their current health
     status or condition. Simultaneously, nurses introduce themselves and begin to obtain essential information about
     clients as individuals with unique needs, values, beliefs, and priorities. During this phase, the nurse and the client
     begin to establish trust and develop a rapport. Nurses must ensure privacy when talking with the client and
     providing care and should respect the client's values, beliefs, and personal boundaries.

     A common framework used for introductions during the orientation phase of the nurse-client relationship is AIDET,
     a mnemonic for Acknowledge, Introduce, Duration, Explanation, and Thank You.

         · Acknowledge: Greet the client by their preferred name, verifying their identity per policy. Make eye contact,
             smile, and acknowledge any family or friends in the room. Ask the client their preferred way of being
             addressed (for example, "Mr. Doe," "Jonathon," or "Johnny") and their preferred pronouns (e.g., he/him, she/
             her, or they/them).

         · Introduce: Introduce yourself by name and role. For example, "I'm John Doe, and I am a nursing student
             working with your nurse to take care of you today."

         · Duration: Estimate a timeline for how long it will take to complete the task you are doing. For example, "I am
             here to perform an admission assessment. This should take about 15 minutes."

         · Explanation: Explain step-by-step what to expect next and answer questions. For example, "I will be putting
             this blood pressure cuff on your arm and inflating it. It will feel as if it is squeezing your arm for a few
             moments."

         · Thank you: At the end of the encounter, thank the client and ask if anything is needed before leaving. In an
             acute or long-term care setting, ensure the call light is within reach and that the client knows how to use it. If
             family members are present, thank them for being there to support the client as appropriate. For example,
             "Thank you for taking time to talk with me today. Is there anything I can get for you before I leave the room?
             Here is the call light (place within reach). Press the red button if you would like to call the nurse."

     It is during the orientation phase that nurses begin to understand the client as a person, while also being self-aware

     Access for free at openstax.org
6.1 · Nurse-Client Relationship                                                                                          171

enough to recognize how the interaction affects them. Acting professionally, asking questions, listening to the
client's answers, and setting the tone for the rest of the interaction provides a foundation for a strong nurse-client
rapport.

Working Phase
Most of the nurse's time with a client is spent in the working phase. During this phase, nurses use active listening
and begin by asking the reason the client is seeking care to determine what is important to them. Nurses use
therapeutic communication techniques to facilitate clients' awareness and encourage them to express their
thoughts and feelings. They also use this time to develop goals and an individualized plan of care. Nurses provide
reflective and nonjudgmental feedback to clients to help them clarify their thoughts, goals, and coping strategies
(Hagerty et al., 2018). If a care plan has already been established on admission, nurses use this time to implement
interventions targeted to meet short-term objectives and long-term goals. During the working phase, clients begin to
accept nurses as health educators, counselors, and care providers. During this phase, the nurse also acts as a
resource person who assists the client in gathering more information about their illness (Deane & Fain, 2016).

Resolution/Termination Phase
The final phase of a nurse-client relationship is the termination phase. This phase typically occurs at the end of a
shift or on discharge from care. Success in the working phase means that the client, nurses, and interprofessional
health-care team members have met the client's needs. The nurse should be aware that the client may try to return
to the working phase to avoid termination of the relationship. During the termination phase, the nurse can
encourage the client to reflect on progress they have made and review post discharge goals. Even student nurses
can be involved in discharge teaching as the client prepares to return to their normal routines (Deane & Fain, 2016).
The nurse also makes community referrals for follow-up and continuation of support to meet goals. During this
phase, the nurse reviews how well the plan of care worked. They can then apply the knowledge gathered to the care
provided to future clients.

Building Trust and Rapport

The theory of interpersonal relations is holistic in the way that it uses both verbal and nonverbal communication
skills to assist the client in dealing with their illness (Deane & Fain, 2016). The student nurse can learn a lot about
communication by using this theory to guide their interactions with their clients. Deane and Fain (2016) suggest that
gaining education about the importance of communication will allow nursing students to develop "empathy, active
listening, the use of silence and touch, and being there" (p. 37). A nurse develops rapport by offering themselves as
a genuine presence, being aware of nonverbal communication, being empathetic, and actively listening. Correct use
of these techniques will increase trust and rapport between the student nurse and the client.

Peplau's theory is based on what happens between two people, focusing on feelings, emotions, and behaviors of
both the nurse and the client. Having students practice their communication skills through dialogue with their
clients not only increases the nursing students' self-confidence, but also helps to grow the level of rapport between
the student and the client. Deane and Fain (2016) point out that this interaction encourages the student to have
conversations with their clients and not simply concentrate on the tasks at hand. After the interaction has taken
place, the instructor can then meet with the student to talk about what did and did not work during the interaction,
giving feedback and support as needed to guide the student.

Boundaries in the Therapeutic Relationship

The limits people set to define their levels of comfort when interacting with others are called boundaries. Personal
boundaries include those in the physical, sexual, intellectual, emotional, and financial areas of people's lives.
Boundaries promote safety in relationships at work, home, and with partners by protecting one's well-being and
limiting the stress response. For example, if an individual comes away from a meeting or conversation with someone
172  6 · Therapeutic Relationships

     feeling depleted, anxious, or tense, they might consider if something in the meeting crossed their boundaries. It is
     important to maintain professional boundaries, while also building rapport. For example, you might talk about your
     family in a general way with a client, but you would not provide specific and personal details to them. You may also
     have to reinforce professional boundaries if a client attempts to contact you via social media or asks you to continue
     contact after care is completed. A lack of healthy personal boundaries, or situations that consistently penetrate and
     cross those boundaries, can lead to emotional and physical fatigue (Pattemore, 2021).

     Five major types of boundaries include (Pattemore, 2021):

         · Physical: Physical boundaries refer to one's personal space, privacy, and body. For example, some people are
             comfortable with public displays of affection (hugs, kisses, and hand-holding), while others prefer not to be
             touched in public.

         · Sexual: Sexual boundaries refer to one's comfort level with intimacy and attention of a sexual nature. This can
             include sexual comments and touch, not just sexual acts.

         · Intellectual: Intellectual boundaries refer to one's thoughts and beliefs. When someone dismisses another
             person's ideas and opinions, they are crossing intellectual boundaries.

         · Emotional: Emotional boundaries refer to a person's feelings. For example, an individual might not feel
             comfortable sharing feelings with another person and may prefer to share information gradually over time.

         · Financial: Financial boundaries refer to how one earns money as well as how one prefers to spend or save
             money.

     When caring for clients with mental health disorders, it is common to notice problems with setting appropriate
     boundaries. For example, a client experiencing bipolar disorder may exhibit a lack of financial and sexual
     boundaries. When they are experiencing a manic episode, they may spend thousands of dollars on a credit card over
     a weekend or have sexual relations with someone they just met. Another example of boundary issues is an
     individual with a depressive disorder who is treated poorly by their partner but does not leave or assert boundaries
     because they don't feel that they deserve to be treated any better.

     Nurses must establish professional boundaries with all clients while also maintaining a respectful and caring
     relationship. Due to their professional role, nurses have authority and access to sensitive information that can make
     clients feel vulnerable. A Nurses Guide to Professional Boundaries by the National Council of State Boards of
     Nursing (NCSBN, 2018) states that it is the nurse's responsibility to use clinical judgment to determine and maintain
     professional boundaries. Nurses should limit self-disclosure of personal information and avoid situations where they
     have a personal or business relationship with a client. The difference between a caring nurse-client relationship and
     an overinvolved relationship can be difficult to discern, especially in small communities or in community health
     nursing where roles may overlap. In these circumstances, it is important for the nurse to openly acknowledge their
     dual relationship and recognize when they are performing in a professional capacity. Signs of inappropriate
     boundaries within the nurse-client relationship include the following (National Council of State Boards of Nursing,
     2018):

         · self-disclosing intimate or personal issues with a client
         · engaging in behaviors that could be interpreted as flirting
         · keeping secrets with a client
         · believing the nurse is the only one who truly understands or can help the client
         · spending more time than is necessary with a particular client
         · speaking poorly about colleagues or the employment setting with the client and/or their family
         · showing favoritism to a particular client
         · meeting a client in settings outside of work
         · contacting or permitting contact by a client and/or their family members using social media

     Several concepts related to therapeutic boundaries of which a nursing student should be aware include transference
     and countertransference. Transference is when the client reacts emotionally toward the nurse when triggered by
     memories of a past relationship. This could happen, for example, if the nurse resembles someone from the client's
     life or if the nurse provides support that the client wishes they were receiving from their significant other and this
     support makes the client feel extra close to the nurse.

     Countertransference occurs when the nurse has these types of triggers toward the client. For example, if the client

reminds the nurse of a previous client who was angry and threatening, those feelings might influence the nurse's
attitude toward the current client. It is important for health-care professionals to regularly perform self-reflection
exercises to monitor and adjust their reactions to their clients (Prasko et al., 2022). Establishing professional
boundaries with clients diagnosed with mental health disorders is essential due to the vulnerability of the client
population, as well as the behavioral manifestations of some disorders. For safety purposes, nurses and nursing
students should keep their last name, home address, personal telephone number, and social media handles private.

In my years as a psychiatric nurse, I have always been cautious about nurse-client boundaries. In fact, I teach my
nursing students the importance of maintaining strict boundaries. Our nursing role is meant to have the client's best
interests as the focus of our interactions with them. We cannot muddy the waters by accepting their friend request
on Facebook or building a relationship with them after our nursing role is over. Even if we build a strong rapport with
a long-term client, it is better to terminate the entire relationship once the nursing relationship has reached the
termination phase.

6.2 Family Dynamics

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Explain the role of family dynamics in nursing practice
    · Discuss how the family systems model builds collaborative relationships with clients and their families
    · Describe collaborative relationships in mental health nursing

With approximately 14.1 million adults and 49.5 percent of adolescents with serious mental illness in the United
States needing the help of family caregivers, it is no wonder that family dynamics have a large effect on the
outcomes for these clients (National Institute of Mental Health, 2023). The push in more recent years for providing
care to individuals with serious mental illness in the least restrictive environments, along with the focus on client-
centered care, has increased the need for family members to become caregivers. How does this affect family
dynamics and the need for collaborative relationships?

Mental illness does not only affect the individual. It affects the entire family. Nurses can assist family members by
educating them about mental illness and disease processes, allowing them to share their feelings, and encouraging
open communication between them.

Family Dynamics

The way that the family members interact, communicate, and problem-solve is called family dynamics. Functional
families work together toward common goals. They support one another and have good communication.
Dysfunctional relationships can cause distress and broken ties within the family, leading to poorer mental health
outcomes. Even with effective family dynamics, mental illness can cause changes and challenges to the living
environment, as well as the family hierarchy (Sanders et al., 2014). Stigma affects families just as it does the person
living with the mental health diagnosis. Families can adopt stigmatizing beliefs and feelings about mental illness and
this can influence how they perceive and support the person with the mental health diagnosis.

Families today include a variety of combinations that form the family unit (Table 6.1). These combinations include
nuclear family, single-parent family, extended family, childless family, grandparent family, and step family. Because
mental illness can affect anyone, family members in any combination or type of familial group will have to adapt.

     Family Structure                 Description

     Nuclear family                   Two parents with one or more children

     Single-parent family             One parent raising one or more children

     Extended family                  Multiple family members raising one or more children

                   Stepfamily or blended family Two parents with children forming a combined family unit

                    TABLE 6.1 Types of Family Structures

     Nuclear Families
     The traditional family, or nuclear, family was mother, father, and children. The current version of this family model
     includes two parents, regardless of gender or marital status, and one or more children (Meleen, 2021). This family
     structure can provide stability from having more than one parent to share the care of the child/children. Nuclear
     families may also have more than one income, providing financial stability for the family unit. Consistency provided
     by two parents can increase positive behavior patterns in the children. In a functional nuclear family, children learn
     how to take responsibility and form positive relationships from watching their parents work together to problem-
     solve and support one another. The opposite is also true. If the parents in a nuclear family have a dysfunctional
     relationship, for example one that includes arguing or not supporting one another, then children will learn that type
     of behavior.

     Some cons associated with the nuclear family include burnout, especially in mothers, as they often attend to the
     needs of the entire family while also working outside of the home. Nuclear families are frequently very tightly
     bonded and may not seek the assistance of extended family members. Without the assistance of extended family, it
     may be difficult for parents to juggle work, sick children, household chores, and after-school activities, making them
     more prone to depression and anxiety (Meleen, 2021). Parental stress observed by the children can also impact the
     children's stress levels and cause anxiety.

     Single-Parent Families
     The single-parent family is formed by one parent with one or more children. Nearly one in four children is born to a
     single parent (Blessing, 2023). Family members in single-parent households have a higher risk for developing
     mental illnesses, such as depression (Behere et al., 2017). The mothers in a single-parent household are also at
     three times the risk for developing depression and substance use as compared with their married counterparts
     (Behere et al., 2017). Further, having a parent, particularly the mother, with a mental health problem can increase
     the chances of the children in that household developing depression (Behere et al., 2017).

     One contributing factor is that these households tend to fall at a lower socioeconomic level. It is estimated that
     poverty levels in single-parent households are as high as 50 percent, whereas in households with two parents, it
     averages about 5 percent (Behere et al., 2017). Poverty can contribute to dysfunction in parent-child relationships
     and, like divorce, can cause behavioral problems in the children of those families.

     Extended Family
     An extended family is multiple family members living together with the common goal of raising the children. This
     family unit usually has positive family dynamics. According to Mind Help (2023), the advantages of this family unit
     include sharing duties and finances. Having good communication, being supportive of one another, and working
     together toward the goals of the family creates a positive influence on the overall mental health of the family (Mind
     Help, 2023). Some disadvantages are a lack of privacy and interference with other people's relationships within the
     household. Negative impacts of this family structure include being overinvolved in each other's personal affairs, thus
     decreasing individual autonomy and increasing feelings of stress (Mind Help, 2023).

Childless Family
The childless family has no children, by choice or circumstance. This family consists of two partners, married or
unmarried. These two adults may have a pet instead of a child with no plans to have children. These couples include
working couples, couples who feel that children do not fit into their lifestyle (e.g., they enjoy a lot of traveling), and
couples who choose to wait to have children (BetterHelp, 2023). The advantages to this type of family are time to
enjoy things like travel and quiet time, financial stability, and not having the stress related to taking care of children
(BetterHelp, 2023). The disadvantages are that they may experience loneliness and a feeling that they may be
missing out by not having children.

Grandparent Family
This type of family unit is formed when grandparents step in to care for the grandchild/children when their parents
are unable to do so. Pebley and Rudkin's (n.d.) research has illustrated that split-family households, in which the
grandparent is the primary caregiver, form when a parent has financial, mental health, or substance use problems
and needs the intervention of grandparents to care for the children. There are about 4.5 million grandparents taking
care of their grandchildren (Pebley & Rudkin, n.d.), and a higher percentage of grandparents who have grandchildren
living with them occurs in Black families. This can create stressors unique to this family unit, such as physical and
medical limitations and complications as an aging grandparent is responsible for children, transportation, and
financial issues as well as generational conflict.

Stepfamily
Stepfamilies or blended families occur when two adults with children form a combined family unit. The adults may
or may not have biological children together. While this type of family is becoming more common, it is not without its
own set of problems (Mayntz, 2019). Conflicting family values, roles, and juggling the care of biological and
stepchildren are just a few of the difficulties that may occur. In fact, introduction of a stepparent into a family
increases the likelihood of abuse by 30 to 40 percent (Behere et al., 2017).

Families with a Parent with Mental Illness
In families where a parent has mental illness, children have a higher risk for developing a mental illness than those
without mental illness in their family because of genetic and environmental risk factors (Sanders et al., 2014).
Sanders et al. (2014) describe two types of burden that fall on families with mentally ill members: objective burden
and subjective burden. The greater likelihood that a family member will neglect finances and routines, overlook
other family members, and endure friction between family members, as a direct result of the ill family member, is
called objective burden. Feelings related to the family member's illness, including worries and anxiety,
resentments, feeling trapped, and fears associated with stigma and with potential interactions and disturbing
behaviors, is called subjective burden (Sanders et al., 2014). These burdens can make siblings and children
become secondary victims as they help with caregiving, support their family member, and struggle with the need to
grow up faster.

When considering children whose parents have mental illness, it is important for the nurse to examine the best way
to support, educate, and promote resilience in these individuals (Tapias et al., 2021). Nurses should take into
consideration the age of the child so that supportive measures meet the child's developmental needs and level of
understanding.

        CULTURAL CONTEXT

Family Dynamics in Latinx Youth

Family has a high value in the Latinx culture. The strong family bonds should have a protective factor against mental
illness. Lazarevic et al. (2021) performed a study testing whether strong family bonds do have a protective factor
against mental illness in the context of discrimination faced by Latinx youth. The researchers found that even if the
Latinx family had positive family dynamics, it did not protect against the negative effects discrimination had on
depression and satisfaction with life in youth. Positive family dynamics only had a positive impact if discrimination
levels were low. If the Latinx family had negative family dynamics, it increased the negative effects of discrimination
on both depression and life satisfaction. The authors of this study suggested that practitioners working with Latinx
families should assess for family conflict and the degree to which discrimination is affecting mental health within
176  6 · Therapeutic Relationships

     the family unit (Lazarevic et al., 2021).

     Family Systems Model

     In the 1950s, Murray Bowen developed his family systems theory, which is still the central orientation in family
     therapy practice (Brown, 1999). The purpose of implementing this theory in practice is to enhance the growth of
     each family member as well as that of the family as a whole. The main concept in this theory is how much the
     closeness or distance in the relationship between family members affects anxiety. The major focus in the theory is
     on differentiation of self (Brown, 1999). This is when an individual can feel autonomous and make decisions that
     help them function independently even within the family group (discussed in greater detail in 5.4 Family Support
     Systems).

     When the nurse or therapist determines that there is fusion among family members, it is their job to teach the family
     members better ways of coping with stress and anxiety. When a person reacts immediately, without hesitation, to
     another family member's demands, this is called fusion. Fusion of the family members increases the chances of
     taking things personally and being inflexible to dealing with stress (Brown, 1999). In more recent years, this model
     has also been used in a wider context to include a look at familial changes related to multigenerational stress, age,
     gender, and life cycle.

     Collaborative Relationships

     Interprofessional, collaborative relationships are those that evolve between the interprofessional team and the
     family. This relationship is a partnership in which all parties listen to one another and respect the perspectives of
     each person (Ness et al., 2014). Collaboration involves individuals, departments, and hospital systems working
     together to develop solutions for improving the care they provide to their clients, through sharing information
     (Howard et al., 2022). The collaborative care model has been developed over the past thirty years to connect
     behavioral health and health-care professionals and increase client engagement through providing evidence-based
     care that is based on a shared treatment plan (American Psychiatric Association, 2023).

     The relationship between the nurse and the client/family can be a pivotal part of increasing positive outcomes when
     caring for those with mental illness. The education and support that nurses bring to the interaction help both the
     individual and the family to have a better understanding about how family dynamics affect each other's mental
     health. The nurse acts in partnership with the family through learning about the family members, their hopes, their
     dreams, and how they see their lives unfolding in front of them (Ness et al., 2014). Through this process, they
     mutually agree on how to collaborate while the nurse teaches the family that working together strengthens the
     relationships within the family.

       CLINICAL JUDGMENT MEASUREMENT MODEL

       Generate Solutions: Involve the Client as a Member of the Decision-Making Process

       Psychiatric nursing is not about making decisions for the client, but with the client. Collaborating with the client
       and the client's family in the decision-making process will help engage the client in the development of goals,
       outcomes, and interventions (Ness et al., 2014). Through the previous steps in the CJMM, the nurse will have
       gathered client history, gained information about what is important to the client in the trajectory of their care,
       and learned about their expectations for recovery. In generating solutions, the nurse's interventions are based
       on the client's needs and what makes sense to them. The client should have autonomy, the ability to be involved
       in the decision-making process. Without the client's buy-in, the interventions suggested by the team could be
       fruitless.

6.3 Peer Support

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Describe peer support services in psychiatric-mental health
    · Discuss the functions of peer support services
    · List some examples of peer support services

Living with mental illness can be lonely and isolating. To support those living with mental illness, peer specialists
share their experiences of mental illness and recovery with others. This support provides hope and guidance, as well
as information on resources that worked for the peer specialist. Peer specialists are able to listen, provide strategies
that have been helpful in their recovery, connect people with community resources, and help with overcoming
shame and stigma. In this manner, the person who has mental illness learns they do not have to fight the battle
alone.

Peer Support Services

Peer support services are those led by a person or persons who have lived experience with mental illness
(Muralidharan et al., 2021). A peer support specialist is a nonclinical person who uses their experiences with
mental illness and recovery to help others (George, 2022). These services can be conducted in an inpatient,
outpatient, or group setting, as part of an interdisciplinary treatment team, in a one-to-one format, and in a virtual
setting (Fortuna et al., 2022). The original definition for peer support was that it involved services offered to those
with a mental health condition. Today, the more broadly accepted term is mental health challenges, as that covers a
wider range of mental health issues, such as "trauma, extreme stress, feelings of loneliness...comorbidities
including substance use disorders and chronic medical conditions, criminal justice, and child welfare" (p. 572).

Peer support began as informal self-help groups that offered mutual support. The current model has expanded to
focus on the benefit that the client receives from the peer support specialist (Fortuna et al., 2022). It has also grown
to be a model that can be paid for and reimbursed through Medicaid. A recent survey found that 25 percent of the
time that paid peer specialists spent with their clients was in groups (Muralidharan et al., 2021).

        LINK TO LEARNING

This video from Disability Rights Arkansas presents how one client took his experiences with chemical restraints
and seclusion to become a peer supervisor (https://openstax.org/r/77chemrestraint) at the Arkansas State Hospital.

Functions of Peer Support Services

Deinstitutionalization, when people with mental illness were discharged from state hospitals and returned to the
community, led to peer self-help groups springing up because the clients being discharged into the communities
were mistrustful of health professionals and had difficulty even finding outpatient mental health services (Fortuna et
al., 2022). These peer services have continued to grow and are available to help clients with psychological,
comorbid diagnoses, and social functioning.

Peer support specialists can assist the individual with mental health challenges by helping them, for example, learn
how to build better relationships with others. Not only does the development of social skills give the client hope, but
it addresses the loneliness that is often part of severe mental illness. Having the support of a person who has gone
through some of the same experiences has yielded positive outcomes, such as "decreases in hospitalizations, self-
stigma, psychotic symptoms, depression, substance use and fewer feelings of social isolation" (Fortuna et al., 2022,
p. 578). By sharing their own lived experience and practical guidance, peer support workers help people to develop
their own goals, create strategies for self-empowerment, and take concrete steps. They promote self-esteem, self-
determination, understanding, coping skills, and resilience through mentoring and service coordination supports.

             PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

     Peer Counseling for College Students

     The use of peer-led counseling has become a popular trend on college campuses. According to Mental Health
     America (2022), a study conducted by a team of people from the Born this Way Foundation, the Mary Christie
     Institute, and the MassINC Polling Group, one in five college students has used this type of counseling. Peer
     counseling is especially popular with Black, Transgender, and first-generation college students because they feel
     more comfortable talking with someone who has similar life experiences. Peer counselors provide support with
     issues, such as school stress, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. Students who become peer
     counselors make this choice because they want to help others, want to pay it forward, or have lived experiences that
     help them relate to what other college students are experiencing.

     Examples of Peer Support Services

     There are many types of peer support services available as a resource for clients with mental health challenges.
     What follows is just a small sample of those resources.

         · Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA): These 12-step programs are examples of peer-
             led support groups. The main purpose of AA and NA is to help people with substance (alcohol or narcotics)
             use problems live a sober lifestyle (Alcoholics Anonymous, 2023). The meetings are free to participants and
             held in a variety of settings, including churches, hospitals, and recovery treatment centers.

         · H.E.A.R.T.S. Peer Support Center of Greater Nashua, New Hampshire: This is a free community center for
             adults living with mental challenges. It offers peer support, crisis respite of seven days/six nights, and step
             up/step down (H.E.A.R.T.S., n.d.). This support center was formed to help people with mental health
             challenges stay in the community as much as possible, with the support of others with lived experience.

         · NAMI Connection Recovery Support Groups: These are free support groups for adults with mental health
             conditions. These sixty- to ninety-minute groups are held weekly or every other week and are led by a trained
             peer with lived experience (NAMI, n.d.).

         · NAMI Family Support Groups: These are free, peer-led support groups for adult family members of those with
             a mental health condition (NAMI, n.d.). These groups are offered either weekly or every other week and
             usually run sixty to ninety minutes. The groups create a safe space to share experiences with one another.
             Groups are led by family members of those with mental health conditions.

         · The National Association of Peer Supporters (N.A.P.S.): This organization was formed in 2004 by a group of
             peer specialists in Michigan (N.A.P.S., n.d.). It has since expanded to become an international organization. Its
             goal is to bring together peer support from around the world through conferences, community resources, and
             education.

         · VA Health Services PACT (Patient-aligned Care Team): This began in 2010 with the purpose of bringing the
             health-care team together to work collaboratively toward addressing veterans' health-care goals and needs
             (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, n.d.). The inclusion of trained and certified peer specialists adds a more
             personal layer to the care provided.

     Peer support services can be found across the United States in all different formats. Additionally, there are virtual
     options and apps for on-the-go support. A full list of available apps can be found at the Digital Peer Support

6.4 Client Engagement

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Describe client engagement in mental health care
    · Discuss how client engagement improves outcomes and promotes recovery
    · Describe challenges to and strategies for improving client engagement

According to NAMI (2016), 70 percent of people who start mental health-care treatment drop out after the first or
second visit. The initiation of a therapeutic relationship and the degree of support that the client feels during the
first interaction with a mental health professional can determine the client's level of engagement in the recovery
process.

Client Engagement in Mental Health Care

Compliance is the term frequently used when discussing people following their mental health treatment plan.
Adherence is a more positive and appropriate term because it does not imply a power imbalance in the clinical
provider-client relationship. Alliance is an even better term, focused on recovery and the team approach of client
and clinician. Engagement is actually the best term in that it describes the client and the health-care team
participating together in the services provided (NAMI, 2016). Client engagement includes having the client at the
center of the treatment decision-making process and working in collaboration with the health-care team (Graffign &
Barello, 2018). There are factors that can impede an individual's ability to engage with the health-care team. These
include: "age, ethnicity, level of education, level of income, personal dispositions and beliefs about the patient's role
in managing health care" (p. 1262), as well as the nature of the disease, the details of the therapeutic regimen, and
culture. The health-care team should review all of these factors in an effort to have the most information as they
collaborate with the client in planning their care.

Engagement Defined
NAMI's (2016) definition for engagement is the "strengths-based process through which individuals with mental
health conditions form a healing connection with people that support their recovery and wellness within the context
of family, culture and community" (p. 6). This definition shows belief in the person, beyond symptom management.

Theories Related to Client Engagement in Mental Health Nursing
Nurses base their care on theories that help guide their knowledge and practice. Nursing theories provide a
framework for nurses to understand the how, what, and why of their professional role (Wayne, 2023). There are
three types of nursing theories: grand theories, middle-range theories, and practice-level theories (Wayne, 2023).
Grand theories provide a broad overview for a general nursing framework. Middle-range theories focus on a
particular nursing phenomenon. Practice-level theories are those that are used to form interventions and outcome
planning in specific client populations.

As described previously, Hildegard Peplau is a very important part of the process of client engagement. Her theory
of interpersonal relations helps nurse to understand the importance of the nurse-client relationship. In psychiatric
nursing, this is especially critical as that relationship is what guides practice. Imogene King also had a theory related
to the development of the nurse-client relationship. Her theory of goal attainment was based on the nurse and client
working together to set goals and the nurse being there to help the client attain those goals (Wayne, 2023). Her
theory includes three interacting sections--personal system (perception and self-growth), interpersonal system
(interaction and communication), and social system (organization, authority, and decision-making). And Prochaska's
transtheoretical model, or stages of change model (see 5.1 Psychiatric-Mental Health Treatment Settings) is
focused on the decision-making of the individual and how it occurs in a cyclical manner (LaMorte, 2022). All of these
theories help a nurse to assess a client's ability and level of engagement in care.

McAllister et al. (2021) suggest that nurses and other practitioners use the five techniques of the principles of
engagement model: "(1) understand the person and their illness; (2) facilitate growth; (3) therapeutic use of self; (4)
choose the right approach and; (5) emotional versus restrictive containment" (p. 2). This model was derived from
the behavior change theory with the idea that client and provider engagement is influenced by "capability,
opportunity and motivation to engage" (Celestine, 2021, p. 2). Nurses need to be able to determine how capable the
client is of making a change, if they have the opportunity in their environment to make the change, and whether or
180  6 · Therapeutic Relationships

     not they have the motivation to perform the change. These components are important in helping a client to change
     their behavior, thus increasing their engagement.

     Client Engagement Improves Mental Health Recovery

     According to SAMHSA (n.d.-a), the definition of recovery is a "process of change through which individuals improve
     their health and wellness, live self-directed lives, and strive to reach their full potential" (para 2). For recovery to
     work, the process for achieving it must be appropriate to the individual's age, culture, and stage of life. As discussed
     in 6.3 Peer Support, peer support is a key component of client engagement in the recovery process. The support and
     understanding that someone else has had the same experiences assists the individual to engage in treatment
     choices that are right for them, where they are. Collaboration between the client and the health-care professionals
     is considered a foundation of recovery because of the trust formed in this relationship as everyone works toward the
     same goals (Ness et al., 2014).

     Reduction of Stigma
     A stigma is a cluster of negative attitudes and beliefs that motivates the general public to fear, reject, avoid, and
     discriminate against people with mental health disorders (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
     Administration, n.d.-b). The general public, relatives of those with mental illness, and even health-care professionals
     can possess stigmatizing beliefs and attitudes (Zamorano et al., 2023).

     Nurses and other health-care professionals need to look for ways they can help to reduce the stigma surrounding
     mental illness. Zamorano et al. (2023) identified that there are higher levels of stigma in general nursing and
     medical practice than in psychiatry, and that this resulted in poorer client outcomes, including higher mortality
     rates. Having contact with people who have mental health concerns actually is one of the best ways to lower stigma.
     Interactions with people with mental health diagnoses allow nurses to understand and have empathy for the
     person, seeing beyond the symptoms. It also provides evidence for recovery and hope for people with mental health
     conditions. Education and training are other effective tools.

     Improved Client Outcomes
     The World Health Organization (WHO) defines interprofessional collaborative practice as multiple health workers
     from different professional backgrounds working together with clients, families, caregivers, and communities to
     deliver the highest quality of care (World Health Organization, 2010). Effective teamwork and communication
     reduce medical errors, promote a safety culture, and improve client outcomes (AHRQ, 2015). The importance of
     effective interprofessional collaboration has become even more notable as nurses advocate to reduce health
     disparities related to social determinants of health (SDOH). In these efforts, nurses work with people from a variety
     of professions, such as physicians, social workers, educators, policymakers, attorneys, faith leaders, government
     employees, community advocates, and community members. Nursing students must be prepared to collaborate
     interprofessionally after graduation (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2021).

     Strategies for Improving Client Engagement

     Early intervention is one strategy for increasing client engagement (Becker et al., 2017) because if clients are part of
     the entire process from the start, they will be more likely to understand the nuances of the options and be central to
     the decision-making process. Moreover, in a study completed by Becker et al. (2017), the most important client
     points identified that would lead to them having a higher level of engagement were twenty-four-hour crisis services,
     having a variety of treatment choices, involving family/support people, and availability of addiction services. One
     intervention that has been studied and found to increase client engagement in mental health care is protected
     engagement time (PET) (McAllister et al., 2021). PET encourages nurses and other health-care professionals to set
     aside a specific amount of time to spend engaging with their clients in inpatient units. Research by Ness et al.
     (2014) found that consumers want their health-care providers to take the time and effort to know them by showing
     their availability.

     One example of a strategy used to keep young adults engaged in their mental health treatment is called "Just Do
     You." This intervention includes two 90-minute sessions with a licensed clinician and a peer recovery role model
     (NYU, 2022). The sessions are interactive with music, visual arts, psychoeducation, and peer mentorship. Its design
     empowers youth in making informed decisions about their mental well-being (Narendorf et al., 2020).

REACH Model
During the assessment phase of the nurse-client interaction, nurses must ask open-ended questions about the
client's level of engagement. Do not make assumptions about why clients may seem disinterested in pursuing
further treatment. Becker et al. (2021) suggest that providers often project the blame onto client factors instead of
realizing the problems may be attributed to their own lack of performance in developing a therapeutic rapport. The
REACH model is one that practitioners can use to assess the level of engagement in their clients. There are five parts
to this treatment model: relationship, expectancy, attendance, clarity, and homework (Becker, 2021). A trusting
therapeutic relationship should be the basis of interactions with clients. What is the expectancy of the interaction?
Is the client attending their appointments? Does the nurse ask the client or caregiver to state their understanding/
clarity of what is going to happen in treatment? Is the client completing homework or participating in the treatment
sessions? Awareness of and meeting each of these steps helps determine the likelihood and strength of
engagement.

Barriers to Client Engagement
Some barriers exist that reduce client engagement in their mental health recovery. A barrier is anything that blocks
the ability of an individual to get the care that is appropriate for their needs. According to NAMI (2016), barriers
include outdated policies and procedures, lack of care coordination, negative treatment of people in mental health
crisis, lack of respect from the providers, high caseloads, and following very rigid rules when treating a person in
crisis. Additional barriers include turnover of providers, lack of transportation, cost of care and treatment,
scheduling difficulties, school, work, and implicit bias (Becker et al., 2021). These barriers can make it difficult for
clients to access providers in a timely manner, or to be able to continue with a provider once a relationship has been
established.

6.5 Trauma-Informed Care

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Apply and define trauma-informed care in child/adolescent populations
    · Select nursing interventions incorporating trauma-informed concepts
    · Evaluate psychiatric-mental health nursing trauma-informed outcomes of care

In trauma-informed care (TIC), health-care providers acknowledge all past and present parts of a person's life
situation, including any trauma they have endured (Center for Health Care Strategies, 2021) in an effort to provide
treatment that supports the client's autonomy, strength, and control over making health-care decisions. Trauma
encompasses three areas: the event, how the individual experiences the event, and the way the event affects the
individual's life into the future (Patterson & Troy, 2022). A person who has experienced trauma can develop mental
health problems, such as anxiety, depression, and addiction.

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) (2021) has defined six core principles
of TIC:

    · Safety: Throughout the organization, clients and staff feel physically and psychologically safe.
    · Trustworthiness and transparency: Decisions are made with transparency and with the goal of building and

        maintaining trust.
    · Peer support: Individuals with shared experiences are integrated into the organization and viewed as integral

        to service delivery.
    · Collaboration and mutuality: Power differences between staff and clients and among organizational staff are

        leveled to support shared decision-making.
    · Empowerment voice and choice: Client and staff strengths are recognized, built on, and validated, including a

        belief in resilience and the ability to heal from trauma.
    · Cultural, historical, and gender issues: Biases, stereotypes (e.g., based on race, ethnicity, sexual orientation,

        age, geography), and historical trauma are recognized and addressed.

Organizations focused on providing TIC should consider the addition of trained peer-support workers, individuals
who have lived trauma experiences, to the treatment team in an effort to promote a higher level of trust and
engagement from the client (Menschner & Maul, 2016). By adopting a trauma-informed care approach, health-care
182  6 · Therapeutic Relationships

     providers and care settings can ensure that clients feel safe and cared for in a way that encompasses all of their
     needs.

     Application of TIC to Child Development

     According to Forkey et al. (2021), more than half of all U.S children under the age of eighteen have experienced
     some type of trauma in their lifetimes. The American Psychological Association (2023) describes trauma as an
     emotional reaction to a disturbing, distressing, and painful experience. While there is a wide range of events that can
     be considered traumatic or adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), medical events are high on the list. Keeping this
     in mind, it is important to point out that pediatric health-care providers are in the spotlight for being able to make a
     difference in creating safe, stable, and nurturing relationships with their clients.

     While all children will experience some type of stress at some point in their lives, it has been found that toxic stress
     (adverse events that keep activating the stress response) can lead to lifelong impairments "in physical and mental
     health processes that embed developmental, neurologic, epigenetic, and immunologic changes" (Forkey et al.,
     2021, p. 3-4). This then leads to a higher risk for having major depressive disorder with a more severe clinical
     presentation, stress disorders, "feeling sick" due the immunological component, and poor cognitive function. Higher
     risk populations include children with families living in poverty, a history of child abuse, being an immigrant or
     refugee, being a victim of bullying, being LGBTQIA+, having obesity, being part of a military family, being born
     prematurely, and having chronic medical conditions (Forkey et al., 2021).

     Toxic stress from ACEs can alter brain development and affect how the body responds to stress. ACEs are linked to
     chronic health problems, mental illness, and substance misuse. Children with three or more reported ACEs,
     compared with children with zero reported ACEs, had higher prevalence of one or more mental, emotional, or
     behavioral disorders--36.3 percent versus 11.0 percent (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022,
     February 24).

     Preventing ACEs can help children thrive into adulthood by lowering their risk for chronic health problems and
     substance misuse, improving their education and employment potential, and stopping ACEs from being passed from
     one generation to the next (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022, February 24). Raising awareness
     about ACEs can help reduce stigma around seeking help for parenting challenges, substance misuse, depression, or
     suicidal thoughts. Community solutions focus on promoting safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments
     where children live, learn, and play. In addition to raising awareness and participating in community solutions,
     nurses should recognize ACE risk factors and refer clients and their families for effective services and support.

     Pediatricians, nurses, and community health-care providers can promote primary prevention through universal
     screening for such things as poverty, food insecurity, housing needs, language barriers, postpartum depression, and
     acculturation in immigrant populations (Garner & Yogman, 2021). Using primary prevention techniques is meant to
     mitigate the stress response by providing interventions to reduce adversity. An example would be that the
     pediatrician or pediatric nurse screens for food insecurity and finds that the parents do not have adequate funds to
     provide healthy foods. In response, the pediatrician will educate the parents about community resources that are
     available.

     Pediatric health-care providers who use the relational approach, helping to strengthen relationships, should provide
     plenty of time to clients and their families, practice cultural competence, and provide interpreter services as
     needed. Pediatric health-care providers must also be able to recognize barriers to creating safe, stable, nurturing
     relationships. In some cases, health-care providers will need to work with other community stakeholders in order to
     educate and train families about how to build strong relationships that provide nurturing environments for child
     development.

     Safety
     Ultimately, practitioners must provide care in a manner that does not cause re-traumatization, feeling like the past
     trauma is reoccurring or that the person is in an unsafe situation as they were when the trauma occurred (Substance
     Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2014). Creating a safe environment is a top priority for
     organizational client care practices.

     There are two areas in which organizations can focus: physical environment and social-emotional environment
     (Menschner & Maul, 2016). The physical environment encompasses things such as providing good lighting in

6.5 · Trauma-Informed Care                                                                                                183

parking areas, hallways, waiting rooms, and all treatment areas; reducing noise and distractions; separated seating
in waiting areas; welcoming signage throughout the facility; visibility of security; monitoring who enters and exits the
building; not allowing people to loiter at the entrance or in the parking lot; and giving clients clear access to exits
from examination rooms. The social-emotional environment encompasses providing a welcoming and
understanding care environment, giving plenty of notice if scheduling changes, handling conflict appropriately, and
acknowledging the role of culturally competent care in reducing the trauma response.

Working with children and adolescents is very different from working with adults. Young people are often reluctant
participants who have been brought for care they did not seek on their own. Additionally, their communication skills
are limited based on their developmental stage. In addition to gathering information from the child, information
must also be obtained from the parent or caregiver (Hilt & Nussbaum, 2016).

The first step to successful care is to create a therapeutic nurse-client relationship. A therapeutic alliance can
typically form if the young person feels noticed, heard, and appreciated. It is often helpful to start the conversation
with a relatively neutral question like, "Your mom said that you go to [name of school]. What is that school like?"
School, friends, family, and favorite activities are low-stress conversation starters. For a very young child, a
conversation starter could be a simple observation like what they are wearing. For example, "I see you are wearing
blue tennis shoes; did you pick those out yourself?" (Hilt & Nussbaum, 2016).

For young people who seem reluctant to start talking, it may be helpful to describe something you saw that shows
you have been paying attention to them. For example, "It looked as though it was hard for you to sit and do nothing
while your dad and I were talking. Am I right about that?" (Hilt & Nussbaum, 2016).

When caring for adolescents, it is helpful to gather data from the parent or caregiver, and then ask to speak with the
adolescent alone. Reinforce that the conversation is "conditionally confidential" (discussion will remain confidential
unless laws require that the provider disclose it, as with, for example, suicidal ideation) and invite the adolescent to
sit alone with you to talk. A one-on-one conversation with an adolescent typically creates a better, more honest
therapeutic alliance (Hilt & Nussbaum, 2016).

A subtler strategy to build a therapeutic nurse relationship with children and adolescents is to shape how you speak
so you are perceived as a responsive problem-solving partner rather than a judgmental authority figure. Building a
therapeutic nurse-client relationship with a young person should lead to learning their true chief complaint because
the chief complaint of an adolescent may be different from their parents' complaints (Hilt & Nussbaum, 2016).

Family interaction adds another layer of complexity to the care for children or adolescents who have experienced
trauma. Family dynamics refers to the patterns of interactions among family members, their roles and relationships,
and the various factors that shape their interactions. Because family members typically rely on each other for
emotional, physical, and economic support, they are one of the primary sources of relationship security or stress.
Secure and supportive family relationships provide love, advice, and care, whereas stressful family relationships
may include frequent arguments, critical feedback, and unreasonable demands (Jabbari et al., 2023).

Interpersonal interactions among family members, as a component of safety, have lasting impacts and influence the
development and well-being of children. Unhealthy family dynamics can cause children to experience trauma and
stress as they grow up. Conflict between parents and adolescents is associated with adolescent aggression,
whereas mutuality (cohesion and warmth) is shown to be a protective factor against aggressive behavior (Jabbari et
al., 2023). Effectively assessing and addressing a client's family dynamics and its role in a child's or adolescent's
mental health disorder requires an interprofessional team of health professionals, including nurses, physicians,
social workers, and therapists. Nurses are in a unique position to observe interaction patterns, assess family
relationships, and attend to family concerns in clinical settings because they are in frequent contact with family
members. Collaboration among interprofessional team members promotes family-centered care and provides
clients and families with the necessary resources to develop and maintain healthy family dynamics (Jabbari et al.,
2023).

     Strengths-Based Care and Client Empowerment
     Care provided should be person-centered, meaning it focuses on the individual needs and desires of that client
     (Perrelle et al., 2022). Care should focus on a person's strengths rather than their deficits (UNC School of Medicine,
     Department of Psychiatry, 2023). Focusing on the client's strengths instead of just looking at what is "wrong" with
     them should be at the core of trauma-informed care. This approach includes applauding the client for small steps
     that they take toward their own treatment (Guevara et al., 2021). It helps to empower the client while giving them
     hope that they can accomplish bigger treatment goals.

     Nursing and Trauma-Informed Care

     Individuals who have a history of trauma may become triggered by engagement with the health-care system. They
     may experience arousal and reactivity symptoms. As a result of the stimulation of the "fight, flight, or freeze" stress
     response, the parts of the brain involved in memory, planning, decision-making, and regulation are not engaged.
     This can impact the client's involvement with health-care services and affect their ability to adhere to treatment
     plans (Fleishman et al., 2019). Nurses must understand this potential impact of previous trauma and incorporate
     client-centered, trauma-informed care. Nurses can incorporate trauma-informed care by routinely implementing the
     following practices with all clients (Fleishman et al., 2019):

         · Introduce yourself and your role in every client interaction: Clients might recognize you, but they might not
             remember your role. This can lead to confusion and misunderstanding. When a client understands who you
             are and your role in their care, they feel empowered to be actively engaged in their own care. They also feel
             less threatened because they know your name and why you are interacting with them. When one party is
             nameless, there can be an automatic power differential in the interaction.

         · Use open and nonthreatening body positioning: Be aware of your body position when working with clients.
             Open body language conveys trust and a sense of value. Trauma survivors often feel powerless and trapped.
             Health-care situations can trigger past experiences of lack of control or feeling trapped. Using nonthreatening
             body positioning helps prevent the threat detection areas of the client's brain from taking over and helps
             clients stay regulated. A trauma-informed approach to body position includes attempting to have your body on
             the same level as the client, often sitting at or below the client. Additionally, it is important to think about
             where you and the client are positioned in the room in relation to the door or exit. Both nurse and client should
             have access to the exit.

         · Provide anticipatory guidance: Verbalize what the client can expect during a visit or procedure or what
             paperwork will cover. Knowing what to expect can reassure clients even if it is something that may cause
             discomfort. Past trauma is often associated with unexpected and unpredictable events. Knowing what to
             expect reduces the opportunity for surprises and activation of the sympathetic nervous system symptoms. It
             also helps clients feel more empowered in the care planning process.

         · Ask before touching: For many trauma survivors, inappropriate or unpleasant touch was part of a traumatic
             experience. Touch, even when appropriate and necessary for providing care, can trigger a "fight, flight, or
             freeze" response and bring up difficult feelings or memories. This may lead to the individual experiencing
             increased anxiety and activation of the stress response, resulting in disruptive behaviors and possible
             dissociation. Nurses are often required to touch clients, and sometimes this touch occurs in sensitive areas.
             Any touch can be interpreted as unwanted or threatening, so it is important to ask all clients permission to

     Access for free at openstax.org
6.5 · Trauma-Informed Care                                                                                                185

   touch them. Asking permission before you touch clients gives them a choice and empowers them to have
   control over their body and physical space. Be alert to nonverbal signs, such as eye tearing, flinching,
   shrinking away, or other body language indicating the person is feeling uncomfortable.
· Protect client privacy: Family members and other members of the medical team may be present when you
   care for a client. Clients may not feel empowered or safe in asking others to step out. It is crucial that nurses
   do not put the responsibility on the client to ask others to leave. It is the nurse's role to ask the client (in
   private) whom they would like to be present during care and ask others to leave the room.
· Provide clear and consistent messaging about services and roles: Care providers who are forthright and
   honest build trust with their clients. Dependability, reliability, and consistency are important when working
   with trauma survivors because previous trauma was often unexpected or unpredictable. Providing consistency
   from the nursing team regarding expectations and/or hospital rules can help clients feel secure and decrease
   opportunities for unmet expectations that might lead to triggering disruptive behavior. When clients are
   feeling triggered (i.e., their "fight, flight, or freeze" system is engaged), information processing and learning
   parts of the brain do not function optimally, and it is hard to remember new information. When providing
   education, information, or instructions, break information into small chunks and check for understanding.
   Offer to write important details down so they can accurately recall the information at a later time. Use clear
   language and "teach back" methods that empower clients with knowledge and understanding about their
   care.
· Practice universal precaution: Universal precaution means providing TIC to all clients regardless of a trauma
   history. We cannot know what each person has experienced in their lifetime. Approach every interaction with
   the understanding that trauma may have occurred and will influence the reaction and emotions of the client.
   Unless a trauma-focused intervention is needed to amend the impact of trauma, many TIC experts propose
   universal precaution rather than direct screening.

        CLINICAL SAFETY AND PROCEDURES (QSEN)

QSEN Competency: Nursing Sensitivity During Assessment

When assessing a client, the nurse must always be conscious of the fact that the interaction with the client may in
itself be upsetting for the client and could lead to re-traumatization. Therefore, the organization has to be purposive
in working with staff in providing trauma-informed care from the time when the client is initially assessed through
their period of care and treatment.

This can be achieved by:

    · building a workforce that is trauma informed
    · communicating with staff about using a trauma-informed approach to the client
    · training staff in trauma-specific treatments
    · creating a physical and emotional environment that is safe for the client
    · preventing secondary traumatic stress in staff
    · involving clients in organizational planning
    · including clients in the treatment process
    · screening for trauma
    · engaging referral sources and partner organizations (Center for Health Care Strategies, 2017)

Complexity and Diversity Considerations
A complex trauma occurs when an individual is exposed over time to multiple recurring traumatic events (Cenat,
2022). This type of trauma can be sexual, physical, or psychological in nature. Because these traumas reoccur, they
have a major impact on an individual's physical and mental health, especially if they begin in childhood. Individuals
who have experienced complex traumas are more likely to develop depression, PTSD, anxiety, sleep disorders,
suicidal ideation and substance misuse, as well as physical conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and
digestive disorders (Cenat, 2022).

Another aspect of complex trauma is racial trauma. This type of trauma is related to racial discrimination that results
in threats, humiliation, prejudice, and verbal/physical attacks on an individual. "According to a national survey in the
186  6 · Therapeutic Relationships

     United States, 50% to 70% of Black, Hispanic, and Asian people stated they had been victims of racial
     discrimination" (Cenat, 2022, para 3). This type of trauma occurs in neighborhoods, work environments, schools,
     and health-care environments. If an individual experiences racial trauma as a child or an adolescent, it has the
     potential to follow them into their adult life, impacting both mental and physical health.

     Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
     One type of therapy that has been found to help clients (adolescents and older) with PTSD is cognitive behavioral
     therapy. CBT, combined with exposure therapy, helps people face and control their fear by gradually exposing them
     to the trauma they experienced in a safe way. It uses imagining, writing, or visiting the place where the event
     happened to help reduce the intensity of trauma symptoms.

     CBT follows several steps (Mayo Clinic, 2019). The first is that the individual identifies the problem areas in their life,
     and they focus on the emotions and beliefs attached to those problems. The provider helps the individual recognize
     the thinking patterns that may be contributing to the emotions and beliefs. The individual is encouraged to reshape
     those thinking patterns in order to reduce negativity associated with them. CBT is a short-term therapy that usually
     lasts between five to twenty sessions (Mayo, Clinic, 2019).

     Outcomes of Care

     The overall goal for anyone experiencing trauma-related anxiety is to reduce the frequency and intensity of the
     anxiety symptoms. SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound) outcomes are
     individualized to the client's diagnosed conditions, situational factors, and current status. Planning outcomes in
     small, attainable steps can help a client gain a sense of control over their anxiety (SAMHSA, 2021). Examples of
     SMART outcomes include:

         · The client's vital signs will return to baseline within one hour.
         · The client will identify and verbalize symptoms of anxiety by the end of the shift.
         · The client will verbalize three preferred stress management and coping strategies for controlling their anxiety

             by the end of week one.

     In addition to keeping the client and others safe, priority nursing interventions for a client experiencing severe
     anxiety focus on the client's physical needs, such as fluids to prevent dehydration, blankets for warmth, and rest to
     prevent exhaustion.

     Support During Recovery and Post-Traumatic Growth
     It is very important to get support during the recovery process. Support can be found in a variety of ways/places,
     including friends, family, coworkers, mental health professionals, religious professionals, and support groups
     (Patterson & Troy, 2022). Support can be as simple as an individual asking a friend to sit with them when they are
     feeling anxious. For some people, taking the step to ask for help is the most difficult part of the process.

     Positive changes in a person's outlook after experiencing a trauma is called post-traumatic growth (Mehraban et
     al., 2022). Trauma can cause a person to ruminate on the traumatic event. That rumination can cause the person to
     have an increase in stress. It can also make them take a look at how they react to things and become able to
     reframe their thoughts (Shin et al., 2023). One thing that has a significant effect on post-traumatic growth is a
     person's perception of social support from their friends and family (Mehraban et al., 2022). A person who has the
     support of others is more likely able to adapt to stressful situations and improve their coping mechanisms.

Summary

6.1 Nurse-Client Relationship

Therapeutic nurse-client relationships vary in depth, length, and focus. Some may be brief and others will be longer,
depending upon the environment and the client's needs. Regardless of length or client need, there are four stages to
Peplau's nurse-client relationship: pre-orientation, orientation, working, and termination. Each stage builds upon
the one before it. These stages, as well as the boundaries placed and upheld by the nurse, help to build the rapport
and trust between the client and the nurse.

6.2 Family Dynamics

Family dynamics have a large impact on a child's emotional development. Some things that can affect family
dynamics are being a single-parent family, divorce, poverty, addition of a stepparent, and parental mental health.
Using Bowen's family systems theory, mental health nurses can educate families on positive ways to interact and
cope with mental illness in the family. Collaboration between the nurse, the client, the client's family, and the
interdisciplinary team increases the chances of positive outcomes.

6.3 Peer Support

Peer support services are led by a person or persons who have lived experience with mental illness. These services
can be conducted in an inpatient, outpatient, or group setting, as part of an interdisciplinary treatment team, in a
one-to-one format, and in a virtual setting. Peer support specialists can assist the individual with mental illness by
helping them learn how to build better relationships with others, grow their self-esteem, increase their self-
determination, access resources, empower themselves, and feel less lonely in their illness.

6.4 Client Engagement

Engagement is a term that describes both the client and the health-care team participating in the services provided.
For recovery to work, clients must be engaged, so treatment options must be client-centered and appropriate based
on age, culture, and stage of life. Nurses should assess clients for their potential level of engagement by looking at
their therapeutic relationship, expectancy, attendance, clarity, and homework.

6.5 Trauma-Informed Care

According to Forkey et al. (2021), more than half of all U.S children under the age of eighteen have experienced
some type of trauma in their lifetimes. Toxic stress (adverse events that keep activating the stress response) can
lead to lifelong impairments. Focusing on the client's strengths instead of just looking at what is "wrong" with them
should be at the core of trauma-informed care. Involving the client in their own care provides them with a sense of
autonomy and control over the treatment process. The first step to successful care is to create a safe, therapeutic
nurse-client relationship. Effectively assessing and addressing a client's family dynamics and its role in a child's or
adolescent's mental health disorder requires an interprofessional team of health professionals, including nurses,
physicians, social workers, and therapists. One type of therapy that has been found to help clients with PTSD is
cognitive behavioral therapy. Support is critical during the trauma recovery process in order to achieve optimal
outcomes of care.

Review Questions

    1. A nurse working with a client for a long time has developed a strong rapport with the client. When the nurse
        gets home from work, she is looking at Facebook and notices a friend request from the client. The nurse really
        likes this client. How does the nurse show that she understands professional boundaries?
           a. She eagerly accepts the friend request and later thanks the client.
           b. She denies the friend request and then explains to the client why they cannot be friends on social
                media.
           c. She ignores the friend request and doesn't say anything to the client.
           d. She emails the client to say she cannot accept the friend request.

    2. Building a rapport with a client is the foundation of the therapeutic relationship. Nurse Tom is caring for a
        thirty-two-year-old mother of three who just had her first anxiety attack. Following AIDET, what is one of the
        first things Tom could say to make her feel more relaxed after acknowledging her?
           a. "My name is Tom and I will be taking good care of you today."
           b. "Thank you for coming in today. Please let me know if there is anything you need."
           c. "I will be asking you a series of questions during my assessment. It should take about 20 minutes."
           d. "Next, I am going to tell you three words and I would like you to say them and then memorize them as I
                will ask you to recall them in a few minutes."

    3. Nurse Alena is caring for a ten-year-old client, Lu, whose mother recently married a man with two teenage
        sons. Nurse Alena asks Lu if she is having any difficulties with the transition to a new family structure. In this
        family style, how might children feel?
           a. Children may initially feel conflicted.
           b. Children feel extra love.
           c. Children feel the effects of poverty.
           d. Children may be more likely to grow up quickly.

    4. A nursing instructor is teaching a group of nursing students about the role that collaboration plays in the
        nurse-client relationship. One of the students raises their hand to ask a question. What is one question a
        student might ask that demonstrates understanding of the concept?
           a. "If I am talking with my client, it is a good idea to ask what they want from the treatment, right?"
           b. "When my client's family wants to share information with me, I should tell them that I can only listen to
                the client."
           c. "If my client doesn't want to try the intervention I am providing, I should tell them they have to do it."
           d. "So, to promote the most trust, I should tell my client that all questions should only be directed to me?"

    5. An adult son whose mother is having an exacerbation of her mental health condition immediately does
        whatever his mother suggests, without asking questions or saying that he is busy with other things in his own
        life. According to Bowen's family systems theory, what is the son experiencing?

What Should the Nurse Do?

    1. Nurse Georgia, who works at a community mental health center, is talking with Susan, a sixteen-year-old
        female, who she has often seen in the waiting room when her mother has an appointment with the
        psychiatrist. Nurse Georgia notices how mature Susan is as she says that she is worried that she may get a
        parking ticket because the appointment is taking longer than expected. Nurse Georgia asks Susan how long
        she has been driving. Susan explains that she has had her driver's license for six months but learned how to
        drive when she was fourteen just so she could get her mom to the hospital if there was an emergency. She
        also provides transportation for her younger siblings who both play sports after school. Susan explains that
        her dad left when her mom got really sick four years ago, and they do not see him very often. She says that
        she often prepares meals for her siblings and helps with the household chores. She is a junior in high school
        who does well in school, but is beginning to feel the pressure of her classes and has noticed her grades
        slipping recently.

INTRODUCTION Imagine building a house. One person would not do everything, right? It would take a team of
professionals--architects, builders, electricians, plumbers--to ensure that each part is done correctly and efficiently.
Mental health care is the same way. Each health-care professional involved in a client's care brings their own unique
skills and knowledge to the team.
What is interprofessional care? It's when health-care professionals from different fields work together as a team to
provide the best possible care for a client. This can include doctors, nurses, therapists, social workers, and many
others. Interprofessional care is important because mental health challenges are complex and multifaceted and
require a variety of perspectives and expertise to address. It isn't just about having a bunch of people in the same
room. Interprofessional care requires effective communication, collaboration, and respect for each other's
expertise. By working together, health-care professionals can provide a more holistic and comprehensive approach
to mental health care, leading to more personalized care and better outcomes for their clients.

     7.1 Collaboration and Coordination of Care

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe four evidenced-based case management service models
         · Discuss the role of the nurse as case manager
         · Explain how virtual health care is useful in coordination of care

     Case management developed as a way to coordinate and manage the care of clients with increasingly complex
     health-care needs, and it has evolved over the decades as a response to an increasingly complex health-care
     system (American Case Management Association, n.d.-b). The practice brings together health-care workers from
     different disciplines to provide coordinated, comprehensive, and client-centered care. It aims to address the
     physical, psychological, social, and environmental needs of clients and improve the quality of care while
     simultaneously reducing health-care costs and improving outcomes.

     Case Management Service Models

     The collaborative and organized approach to client care that involves assessing, planning, coordinating, and
     monitoring services and resources to meet the needs of individuals or groups, often in complex or challenging
     situations is called case management (American Case Management Association, n.d.-a). It is a multifaceted
     process that provides health care, mental health support, and social assistance across multiple disciplines and
     settings.

     Case management aims to promote health equity by prioritizing needs, ensuring access to appropriate resources
     and services, addressing social determinants of health, and facilitating safe care transitions. Professional case
     managers develop plans to help each client move smoothly through the health-care system. They are instrumental
     in navigating complex systems to achieve shared goals; advocating for their clients; and upholding their personal
     dignity, autonomy, and right to self-determination.

     The practice of case management is not a new one; it encompasses a range of strategies and services that have
     evolved over decades. The case management system originally evolved in the early 1900s to assist institutionalized
     people with severe and persistent mental illness (Kersbergen, 1996). A deinstitutionalization movement occurred in
     the 1950s and 1960s, leading to significant changes in mental health-care delivery as clients were diverted into
     community-based services (Smith et al.,1993). This resulted in a major increase in psychiatric hospital discharges
     and an increasing demand for community assistance. People with major needs and requirements found it
     challenging to navigate complex, community-based care systems and obtain psychiatric services.

     Through the years, case management began to encompass the medical needs of clients in addition to the
     psychiatric ones. The introduction of Medicaid and Medicare in 1965 created two vast new government health-care
     programs that needed navigating. Health care has only continued to grow more complex in the decades since, due
     to new laws, technology, and cultural changes. Different models of case management have evolved along with these
     changes in order to address the specific needs of different communities.

     The Brokerage Case Management Model
     In the brokerage case management model, a case manager acts as a "broker" or intermediary between a client and
     the various services and resources that the client needs (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services of America
     [SAMHSA], 2021a). This case manager is typically a social worker or nurse. The case manager helps the client to
     identify their needs, access appropriate services, and coordinate care among multiple providers.

     In this model, the case manager is responsible for assessing the client's needs, developing a care plan, identifying
     appropriate service providers, providing referrals, and coordinating care among the different providers. The case
     manager may also provide ongoing monitoring and support to ensure that the client's needs are being met and that
     services are delivered effectively. Interactions between the case manager and client tend to be relatively brief, so
     the brokerage model is better suited to clients with minimal needs.

     The Clinical Case Management Model
     In the clinical case management model, one of the client's clinicians, such as a nurse or therapist, serves as case
     manager (SAMHSA, 2021a). Because the case manager is also the client's clinician, they are more closely involved

     Access for free at openstax.org
7.1 · Collaboration and Coordination of Care                                                                            197

with individual clients than in the brokerage model. With a closer knowledge of their clients' care plans, wants, and
needs, clinical case managers are able to focus on executing the entire care plan for each client.

Clinical case managers can encourage clients to interact with their family, friends, and peers while also assisting
them in overcoming social, emotional, and mental barriers to services. An additional benefit of this model includes
increased one-on-one time between the case manager and client, which, when the case manager is a nurse,
strengthens the nurse-client relationship and helps clients feel motivated and supported. Due to the intense,
comprehensive nature of the relationship with each client, however, clinical case managers see fewer clients.

The Intensive Case Management Model
The intensive case management model (ICM) is intended for severely mentally ill clients. The purpose of the ICM is
to provide high-quality, coordinated care to individuals with complex health and social needs in a short amount of
time (Ponka et al., 2020). Individuals who may benefit from the ICM model are typically those with multiple chronic
conditions, complex medical and social needs, and high utilization of health care. These individuals often require
intensive and ongoing care coordination and support to manage their conditions effectively.

Under an intensive case management model, the client receives much more individual attention from the case
manager than in other models, ideally resulting in a stronger relationship between the case manager and the client.
This strong relationship, along with the higher degree of the case manager's involvement with the client, results in
faster, more thorough results and gives clients with severe mental illness the resources and support they need to
live independently, manage their symptoms, and improve their quality of life.

ICM does have its drawbacks. As with the clinical case management model, the ICM is resource-intensive. Each
case manager carries a relatively small caseload. It is also time- and cost-consuming.

The Strengths-Based Case Management Model
The strengths-based case management model (SBCM) developed in response to concerns that case management
models were focusing mainly on clients' limitations and impairments. In contrast, the SBCM model aims to build on
the strengths and abilities of individuals with mental illness (SAMHSA, 2021a). By recognizing and utilizing each
individual's unique strengths and skills, case managers promote recovery and improve outcomes more effectively.

The SBCM model is challenging because it requires a highly personalized plan for each client, with an eye on cultural
sensitivity. With its focus on positivity, there is a possibility of overlooking serious issues or challenges. It has
numerous benefits, however, including the following:

    · Individualized and person-centered: The SBCM model is tailored to the needs and preferences of each client.
        The approach recognizes that every person has their own unique strengths and challenges and works to
        identify and build on those strengths to achieve recovery goals.

    · Collaborative and empowering: In the SBCM model, the person with mental illness is an active participant in
        their own care. The approach empowers individuals to take an active role in their recovery process, working in
        partnership with their care team to set goals and make decisions about their treatment.

    · Holistic and comprehensive: The SBCM model recognizes that mental health is influenced by a wide range of
        factors, including social, economic, and environmental ones. The approach addresses not only the individual's
        mental health symptoms but also their broader health and social needs.

    · Strengths-focused and solution-oriented: The SBCM model focuses on identifying and building on the
        individual's strengths and abilities, rather than highlighting their weaknesses. The approach also emphasizes
        finding solutions to problems rather than simply identifying them.

    · Outcome-driven and evidence-based: The SBCM model focuses on achieving measurable improvements to
        the individual's mental health and overall well-being. The approach is grounded in scientific research and has
        been proven to be effective at improving outcomes for individuals with mental illness.

Figure 7.2 shows the degree of closeness between the client and the case manager in each of the service models.

     The Nurse's Role as a Case Manager

     Case management is a practice used by and including many disciplines. Because the discipline of nursing focuses on
     the whole person, however, nursing is the predominant field practicing case management. Nurses play a critical role
     in care for clients, serving as both care providers and care coordinators. Consequently, the role of case manager
     often falls to the nurse.

     Nurses often have extensive clinical experience and knowledge of the health-care system, which makes them well-
     suited for this role. Additionally, nurses are often involved in the care of clients from admission to discharge, which
     allows them to have a comprehensive understanding of the client's needs, preferences, and goals. Furthermore,
     nurses are trained to coordinate care across multiple disciplines and to communicate effectively with clients,
     families, and other health-care providers. This makes them valuable members of a care team and capable of
     overseeing the coordination of care for clients with complex mental and other health conditions.

     Virtual Health and Care Coordination

     Virtual health and care coordination are two interrelated concepts that are increasingly important in modern health
     care. Nursing plays a central role. Virtual health, or telehealth, is the application of electronic information and
     communication technologies to facilitate remote clinical health care, education for both clients and health-care
     professionals, and activities related to public health and health-care administration (SAMHSA, 2021b). Telehealth
     utilizes digital technologies, such as telemedicine, remote monitoring, and mobile health apps to deliver health-care
     services and information remotely. This can help to improve access to care, reduce costs, and provide more
     personalized and convenient care for clients. Telehealth can also enable better care coordination by allowing health-
     care providers to share information and collaborate more easily (Mechanic et al., 2022).

     The organization and distribution of health-care services across different providers and settings in order to ensure
     that clients receive the right care at the right time is called care coordination. This can involve coordinating
     appointments, tests, and treatments, as well as managing transitions between different health-care settings, such
     as hospitals, primary care clinics, and home care. Care coordination is important for ensuring that clients receive
     high-quality care and avoid unnecessary complications and hospitalizations.

     Telehealth and care coordination are closely linked because telehealth technologies truly facilitate care
     coordination. For example, virtual visits can enable primary care providers and specialists to consult with each other
     and coordinate care for clients with complex conditions. Remote monitoring technologies can also help to ensure
     that clients receive appropriate follow-up care after a hospitalization or procedure, and mobile health apps can
     provide clients with personalized information and support to help them manage their health and navigate the
     health-care system.

             PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

     Telehealth, Mental Health Needs, and COVID-19

     During the COVID-19 pandemic that began in 2020, there was a rapid increase in the use of telemedicine, especially
     among clients with a mental health or substance misuse diagnosis. Many private insurance companies, along with
     Medicaid, increased their coverage for mental health and substance misuse-related telehealth services (Rae et al.,
     2022). People seeking assistance for mental health and substance use in particular have continued to utilize
     telehealth for their needs. Younger populations are more likely to use telehealth due to their comfort with

technology; rural populations are also more likely to use telehealth due to issues with physically accessing care.
Telehealth represented less than 1 percent of outpatient care for both mental health and substance use prior to the
pandemic; however, at its peak during the pandemic, telehealth represented 40 percent of mental health and
substance use outpatient visits. As of March 2022, telehealth still represented 36 percent of these outpatient visits.
Due to its convenience, cost-effectiveness, and popularity, telemedicine will continue to play a major part in
delivering mental health care to a large percentage of the population in the future.

7.2 Recovery and Rehabilitative Needs

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Discuss four dimensions of recovery
    · Provide examples of rehabilitative treatments in PMH nursing
    · Provide examples of rehabilitative resources in PMH nursing

Recovery and rehabilitation from mental illness are not isolated events, but a process. Depending on each client's
severity of illness and level of functioning, they will need different types of assistance during their recovery. It is a
complex journey requiring support from an interdisciplinary team, including nurses, physicians and advanced
practice providers, social workers, therapists, behavioral health technicians, peer support, and more. It is up to the
nurse to assess the client for their recovery needs and help them develop a plan of care likely to lead to the best
outcomes.

Dimensions of Recovery

The process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self-directed life, and
strive to reach their full potential is called recovery (SAMHSA, n.d.). The concept of recovery is hopeful and
empowering; it is based on the belief that people with mental health conditions have the potential to lead fulfilling
lives, and that recovery is possible with the right support and resources. Recovery-oriented treatment approaches
focus on the person's strengths and abilities, rather than on their limitations or diagnosis, and aim to empower
individuals to take an active role in their own recovery process.

Recovery is a road that is unique to each individual, involving various factors, such as personal growth, resilience,
and self-determination. It does not necessarily mean the absence of symptoms or the return to a previous state of
functioning. Instead, it is a holistic and ongoing process that involves addressing physical, emotional, and social
needs. Recovery can involve medication, therapy, peer support, and lifestyle changes. It is important to note that
recovery is not a linear process, and often involves setbacks. With the right support, though, people with mental
health conditions can learn to manage their symptoms and achieve their goals.

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA, n.d.) identifies four major dimensions of
recovery in a mental health context: health, home, purpose, and community. These dimensions are interconnected
and can have a significant impact on an individual's overall well-being. By addressing each dimension, individuals
can work toward achieving a balanced and fulfilling life in recovery. It's important to remember that mental health
recovery is a unique journey for each individual, so these dimensions may look different for each person.

Health
This dimension emphasizes the importance of maintaining physical and mental health through activities, such as
exercise, healthy eating, and self-care. It also involves managing any medical conditions or mental health symptoms
through medication, therapy, and other interventions.

Home
This dimension refers to having a stable and safe living environment, whether that be through independent living,
supported housing, or other arrangements that meet the individual's needs. It also includes having access to basic
necessities, such as food, clothing, and transportation.

Purpose
This dimension involves finding meaning and purpose in life, such as through work, education, volunteering, or
creative pursuits. It also means setting and achieving goals and having a sense of direction and motivation.
200  7 · Interprofessional Care

     Community
     This dimension emphasizes the importance of social connections and support systems, whether through family,
     friends, peers, or formal support networks. It entails building and maintaining positive relationships, as well as
     contributing to one's community through social engagement and advocacy.

     Rehabilitative Treatments

     The holistic and structured process aimed at assisting individuals with mental health challenges to regain or
     enhance their functional abilities, independence, and quality of life through therapeutic interventions and support is
     called rehabilitation (World Health Organization [WHO], 2023). Rehabilitation promotes recovery.

     Rehabilitative treatments are designed to help individuals with mental health conditions manage their symptoms
     and improve their functioning. These treatments may include therapies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, or
     medication management, as well as other types of interventions, such as group therapy or art therapy. The goal of
     rehabilitative treatments is to help individuals regain independence and improve their quality of life. In essence,
     rehabilitative treatments consist of the clinical interventions that are used to address mental health symptoms and
     take clients on the journey to recovery.

     Medication Management
     Effective medication management involves careful monitoring of the client's symptoms, side effects, and medication
     adherence, as well as adjustments to the medication regimen as needed. Clients attend regular check-ins with
     health-care providers and receive education and support to ensure they understand the importance of taking their
     medication as prescribed.

     Psychological Support
     Psychological support is an essential component of rehabilitative treatment for individuals with mental health
     conditions. This type of treatment is aimed at improving mental health and overall well-being by addressing the
     psychological and emotional needs of the client. Psychological support can be effective for a range of mental health
     conditions, including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, personality disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder
     (PTSD). It can also be helpful for individuals who have experienced trauma, grief, or other life challenges that may
     be affecting their mental health.

     Psychological support comes in various forms, including individual therapy, group therapy, and family therapy. It
     involves working with a mental health professional to explore thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that may be
     contributing to the individual's mental health challenges. The goal of psychological support is to help clients learn
     coping skills and strategies to manage symptoms, improve their mood and emotions, and enhance their quality of
     life.

     Rehabilitative Resources

     The various programs, services, and interventions that aim to support people with mental health conditions in their
     recovery and return to their previous level of functioning, or the highest level of function possible for them, are
     called rehabilitative resources. Mental health professionals, community organizations, or other health-care
     providers may offer these resources. Nurses should expect to collaborate with those in the health-care field as well
     as those in the community.

     Housing
     Stable and safe housing is essential for individuals with mental health diagnoses. A variety of programs aim to
     provide access to safe and affordable housing, which can help people maintain stability and support their recovery.
     Federal laws prohibit housing discrimination based on mental illness. Many states offer subsidized housing to low-
     income and vulnerable populations, such as the chronically mentally ill. These programs include supportive housing,
     which provides additional services, such as case management, counseling, and medication management. These
     subsidized and supportive housing programs are often limited by lack of funding and other resources, and can have
     complex application processes combined with long waits for housing resources.

     Job Coaching
     Job coaching programs can provide clients with mental health conditions with the training, skills, and support they
     need to find and maintain employment. This can include help with résumé writing, job searching, and interview

skills, as well as ongoing support to help individuals succeed in their jobs.

Educational Assistance
Education and training can provide individuals with mental health conditions with the skills they need to achieve
their goals and improve their overall quality of life. These programs include access to training, vocational programs,
and educational opportunities that can help people build new skills and increase their employability.

Social Support
Social support programs can provide individuals with mental health conditions access to peer support, counseling,
and other services that can help them build social connections and develop a sense of community. This can include
support groups, peer mentoring programs, and other resources that can help people connect with others who have
had similar experiences.

        CULTURAL CONTEXT

Cultural Barriers to Mental Health Treatment

Cultural factors can affect a client's support system. Existing stigma can cause clients of different ethnicities to be
left to find mental health treatment and support alone. Cultural barriers also may result in confusion and
misunderstanding between providers and clients. Lack of cultural understanding can lead to suboptimal care, such
as misdiagnoses and/or unsuccessful treatment plans.

One example of a situation where lack of cultural knowledge can lead to misunderstandings involves the Hispanic/
Latinx community. This population is 50 percent less likely to receive mental health treatment than the White non-
Hispanic population (National Alliance on Mental Illness [NAMI], n.d.). One in four individuals in the Hispanic/Latinx
community who reported having a mental health condition were categorized as having a serious mental illness, such
as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder.

NAMI Compartiendo Esperanza is an initiative founded by and for Hispanic/Latinx communities in order to help
address disparities in mental health treatment. It offers resources for individuals, families, and youth on mental
health treatment, breaking down mental health stigma among individuals and communities, and incorporating
understanding in a culturally relevant and sensitive manner (NAMI, n.d.).

7.3 Discharge and Transfer

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Explain the role of discharge planning in psychiatric-mental health nursing
    · Describe the procedure for transfer of a client
    · Describe the procedure for transfer of client health information

Discharge and transfer are crucial times in the treatment process for mental health clients. Both transfer and
discharge require careful planning to ensure the client's safe transition to another level of care, another facility, or
their home. Each client must receive appropriate education and follow-up services in order to maximize their
likelihood of adhering to their plan and achieving positive outcomes.

Discharge Planning

Discharge planning is a critical aspect of psychiatric-mental health nursing. It involves developing a comprehensive
and individualized plan for a client's safe and successful transition from an inpatient psychiatric facility or unit to
their home or community or to another facility. The primary goal of discharge planning is to ensure that clients
receive continuity of care and support after leaving the hospital, which can help to prevent relapse, reduce hospital
readmissions, and promote overall recovery. This process involves collaboration between the client, nurse, family
members, other health-care providers, and community resources to identify the client's needs, strengths, and
resources, and develop a plan that addresses their unique needs. Some of the key components of discharge
planning include assessing the client's mental health status, identifying potential risk factors, evaluating the client's
support system, coordinating with community resources, and ensuring that the client has access to appropriate
202  7 · Interprofessional Care

     medication, therapy, housing, and other resources.

     Psychiatric-mental health nurses play a vital role in discharge planning by facilitating communication and
     coordination between clients, families, and health-care providers; advocating for the client's needs and preferences;
     and providing education and support to promote successful community reintegration. Effective discharge planning
     can help clients with mental health conditions achieve their treatment goals, improve their quality of life, and
     minimize the risk of relapse or hospital readmission.

     When clients with mental health disorders are hospitalized, their admission status may affect their rights related to
     discharge. Voluntary and involuntary admission statuses will influence discharge considerations and legal
     constraints. There are four main types of discharge:

         · Unconditional discharge: Unconditional discharge refers to unconditional termination of the legal client and
             institution relationship. Discharge may be ordered by a psychiatrist, advanced practice provider, or the court.

         · Release against medical advice (AMA): Clients who were admitted voluntarily may elect to leave an institution
             against the advice of the health-care provider.

         · Conditional release: Conditional release means the client is discharged from inpatient care but requires
             outpatient treatment for a specified period of time. If the client was involuntarily admitted, they can be
             readmitted based on the original commitment order if they don't participate in outpatient treatment. These
             laws vary by state and are not uniform throughout the country.

         · Assisted outpatient treatment: Assisted outpatient treatment (AOT) means the conditional release is court-
             ordered. This treatment is tied to services and goods provided by social welfare agencies, such as disability
             benefits and housing. As with conditional releases, these laws are not available in every state.

     Transfer of a Client

     Like discharge, transferring a client with mental illness into or out of a mental health unit or between departments
     can be a complex and sensitive process that requires careful planning and consideration. Client safety is paramount
     when transferring clients with psychiatric needs. It is important to evaluate the client's condition, including their
     mental state, physical health, and potential risks, to determine the safest mode of transportation and level of
     supervision required during the transfer. The client may be transferring between medical units, from a medical unit
     to a behavioral health unit, from a medical or behavioral health unit to a corrections facility, or to an outside facility.

     Transferring clients with mental illness requires adherence to legal and ethical guidelines. It is critical to respect
     clients' rights, and obtain all necessary consents and permissions. Additionally, client confidentiality and privacy are
     paramount throughout the transfer process. Whenever possible, take clients' preferences into account when
     transferring them. This includes considering the client's choice of destination, mode of transportation, and any other
     preferences they may have. Clients should receive appropriate care throughout the transfer process, and their
     treatment plan should be communicated to the receiving facility or care team. This ensures continuity of care and
     minimizes the risk of adverse events.

     The staff involved in the transfer process must be trained and competent in handling clients with mental illness.
     Such staff may include nursing, nursing assistants, security, law enforcement, and others. They must be aware of
     the unique challenges and potential risks involved in the transfer of such clients and know how to respond to
     emergencies. Effective communication is essential when transferring clients with mental illness. Clear and concise
     communication between all parties involved in the transfer process, including the client, their family, health-care
     providers, and transportation staff, is crucial for a successful transfer.

     Protective Placement
     Guardianships and protective orders are legal methods in states for appointing an alternative decision-maker and
     identifying required services for individuals who are legally incompetent. Legally incompetent individuals may have
     developmental disabilities, chronic and serious mental illness, severe substance use disorders, or other conditions
     that limit their decision-making ability. A court can issue orders for a person who has a guardian to be placed
     protectively. The legal standard basically states that without the protective placement, the individual is so incapable
     of providing for their own care and well-being that it creates a substantial risk of serious harm to themselves or
     others. Protective services may include case management, in-home care, nursing services, adult day care, or
     inpatient treatment. Protective placements must be the least restrictive setting necessary to meet the individual's

needs and must be reviewed annually by the court.

EMTALA
The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) was passed by the U.S. Congress in 1986 and
requires hospitals to provide emergency medical treatment to clients regardless of their ability to pay or their
insurance status (Warby & Borger, 2023). The law also prohibits hospitals from transferring clients with emergency
medical conditions to other facilities without stabilizing them first, or without the client's consent.

With regard to mental health client transfers, EMTALA requires that clients with emergency mental health conditions
receive the same level of care as those with emergency medical conditions. This means that if a client is brought to
the emergency department with a mental health crisis, the hospital is required to provide a medical screening
examination to determine the nature and severity of the client's condition. If the examination determines that the
client has an emergency mental health condition, the hospital is required to provide stabilizing treatment before
transferring the client to another facility.

EMTALA also requires that any client transfer must be done in compliance with applicable state and federal laws,
and that the receiving facility must be able to provide the appropriate level of care to meet the client's unique needs.
This is particularly important for mental health clients who may require specialized care and treatment that may not
be available at all hospitals. Overall, EMTALA helps ensure that mental health clients receive appropriate care and
treatment, regardless of their ability to pay or their insurance status.

Transfer of Client Health Information

Transferring a psychiatric client's health information is a sensitive process that requires careful attention to privacy
and confidentiality. There are several important considerations to keep in mind.

Privacy Concerns
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) outlines specific rules for handling and transferring
protected health information (PHI). All parties involved in the transfer of psychiatric client health information must
adhere to HIPAA regulations to protect the privacy and confidentiality of the client's information. It is crucial to
ensure the security of the client's health information during the transfer process. This includes, for example, using
encrypted electronic communication methods and secure faxes or mailing hard copies of the information in a sealed
envelope.

Informed Consent
Before transferring any health information, the client must provide informed consent, which includes information
about the purpose of the transfer, who will receive the information, and any potential risks or benefits. The client's
mental state should be taken into account when transferring their health information. If they are in crisis or
experiencing acute symptoms, the transfer may need to be delayed; otherwise, the legal guardian or proxy may give
consent. A legal guardian will need to consent for the transfer of a minor's health information.

Communication
It is essential to ensure continuity of care for the client during and after the transfer process. This may include
providing the receiving nurse with the client's treatment plan, medication list, and contact information for their
treatment team. Effective communication is crucial during the transfer process to ensure that all parties involved
understand the purpose of the transfer, who will receive the information, and any special considerations that need
to be taken into account.

     7.4 Continued Support

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe follow-up care for psychiatric-mental health clients after hospitalization
         · Explain what mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) entails and provide examples

     Follow-up care is critical for the successful recovery and overall mental health of clients who have been discharged
     from a hospital for psychiatric care. The transition from the hospital back to the community can be challenging for
     clients, and the nurse's role in follow-up care is crucial in providing continuity of care and helping clients navigate
     their recovery journey.

     Follow-Up Care after Hospitalization

     Mental health care for an acute episode does not stop when the client is discharged from the hospital; follow-up
     care after hospitalization is a critical component of ensuring successful recovery and reducing the risk of relapse.
     Often, providers recommend that the client follow up with a mental health provider within thirty days of discharge;
     ideally, they would follow up within seven days (Medicaid, n.d.).

     As coordinator of care for the client, the nurse plays a vital role in assisting with this follow-up care, collaborating
     with other health-care professionals to provide comprehensive care for clients with mental health concerns. The
     nurse's central role in the interdisciplinary team entails addressing a client's overall health needs after discharge.
     Nurses can provide updates on the client's mental health status and collaborate with the team regarding any
     changes that should be made to the care plan to address the client's physical and mental health concerns. Nurses
     can also support clients in a number of other aspects of follow-up care.

     Medication Management
     One of the most important aspects of follow-up care for mental health clients is medication management. Nurses
     can help clients understand the importance of taking their medication as prescribed, monitor side effects, and work
     with the client's providers to make adjustments as necessary. Nurses can assess barriers to medication adherence,
     such as the ability to access pharmacies and locations to fill prescriptions and the high cost of some medications.
     The nurse can also ensure that the client's follow-up appointments with their providers are made prior to discharge
     in order to increase ease of access to medication.

     Counseling and Psychotherapy
     Counseling and psychotherapy are other crucial components of follow-up care for clients after discharge. Nurses
     can provide emotional support, monitor progress, and help clients identify and address any ongoing concerns or
     challenges related to their therapy. They can also help clients identify and manage triggers for their mental health
     concerns, such as stress or certain situations, and provide support in developing coping strategies to address these
     triggers. Nurses may also facilitate group therapy sessions or provide referrals to specialized therapists, depending
     on the client's individual needs. The nurse should ensure that the client's follow-up appointments with relevant
     providers are made prior to discharge.

     Family and Friends
     Family and friends serve a basic human need for companionship and support. The support of loved ones can help
     reduce the feelings of isolation and stigma that clients may experience and provide practical support, such as
     transportation to appointments or assistance with daily activities. Nurses can encourage family and friends to
     provide emotional support, offering encouragement, empathy, and listening without judgment. Additionally, loved
     ones can help identify triggers for the client's mental health concerns and assist in developing coping strategies to
     manage these triggers. Nurses can support the involvement of family and friends as support persons by including
     them in the discharge planning process, with the client's permission. Caring for a loved one with a mental illness can
     be stressful and overwhelming. Nurses provide support for family and friends as well as the client. Educating and
     promoting self-care and appropriate boundary-setting will help support persons avoid burnout when caring for
     someone with a mental illness.

     Community Resources
     Support groups and other community resources are also important aspects of follow-up care for mental health

clients. Nurses can provide clients with information about available support groups or community resources, such
as vocational training programs or housing assistance programs, and help connect them to these resources as
needed. This can help clients build a support network and improve their overall well-being. There are many
organizations that facilitate support groups for families and clients. These support groups may be educational in
nature, or peer-led, and help to foster a sense of community and caring for people in recovery and their support
network.

        REAL RN STORIES

Nurse: Ryan, BSN
Years in Practice: 7
Clinical Setting: Inpatient dual diagnosis unit
Geographic Location: Large midwestern city

Claire was admitted to our inpatient dual diagnosis unit for treatment for major depressive disorder and alcohol use
disorder (AUD). She required medication-assisted detox for her AUD and was put on antidepressant medication to
stabilize her depression. Part of our inpatient treatment for our dual diagnosis clients includes daily twelve-step
group sessions, mostly Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), which has a long and established history and good reputation in
the recovery community. Our clients are encouraged to continue with this peer-based treatment as outpatients.
Continuing to learn from and socializing with peers who are clean and sober is not just helpful, but necessary for
clients with a substance use disorder, including AUD. Because twelve-step programs like AA are commonly available
in the community, we like to familiarize our clients with them while they're in the hospital, then encourage them to
continue to participate after discharge so that they have the community support.

Claire told me that she had tried AA several times in the past but that she didn't feel like it worked for her. She had
objections to certain aspects of the program, such as the emphasis on spirituality, and did not like being constantly
told that she must label herself "an alcoholic." She didn't feel that continuing to attend AA after discharge would
help her and admitted that she probably wouldn't go to any meetings due to her past experience.

As ongoing community support is crucial for clients with AUD, I decided to help research other peer support groups
in the community. I found two abstinence-based peer support programs, Self-Management and Recovery Training
(SMART Recovery) and Women for Sobriety (WFS), that are available in our area. I discussed these programs with
Claire and together we identified meeting days and times that would work for her schedule. She was excited to find
alternatives to AA that still offered the element of peer support. I was happy to find that abstinence-based peer
support groups exist as alternatives to twelve-step programs. Having alternatives for clients like Claire helps
encourage the recovery process as it continues long after discharge, and as the nurse, it is part of my job to ensure
that our clients are set up for success after their hospitalization is done.

Personalized Safety Plan
When clients are discharged from a psychiatric hospital, they are still vulnerable to experiencing a relapse or other
mental health crises. Knowing how to respond in such situations can help clients manage their symptoms and
prevent a potential relapse. One of the best ways to provide clients with information on how to respond in a mental
health crisis is by creating a personalized safety plan with them. This document outlines the client's specific
warning signs, coping strategies, support systems, and emergency contacts. Safety planning can begin at admission
and should be reviewed and updated at discharge. A personalized safety plan can help clients feel more in control of
their mental health and provide them with a clear road map for what to do in case of an emergency. The nurse can
also provide the client with information on crisis hotlines, mobile applications, online platforms, and other resources
for crisis situations.

     Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS)

     The range of interventions and services that promote mental health, prevent and treat mental health disorders, and
     support individuals and communities affected by crises and disasters is called mental health and psychosocial
     support (MHPSS) (U.S. Agency for International Development, 2022). It is a critical component of overall health
     care and well-being.

     MHPSS interventions can include individual and group counseling, psychoeducation, peer support programs, and
     community-based activities aimed at promoting resilience and improving mental health outcomes (Figure 7.3). The
     role of health-care professionals, particularly nurses, is critical in providing MHPSS services to individuals in need.
     Nurses play a key role in assessing and identifying mental health concerns and in providing emotional support,
     counseling, and education to people with mental health concerns. Nurses also administer medications, collaborate
     with other health-care professionals, advocate for the rights and needs of individuals with mental health challenges,
     and promote mental health awareness and education within their communities.

     Understanding Online Self-Help and Therapy

     Online self-help and therapy offer individuals new avenues to address their emotional well-being. These virtual
     platforms provide a range of resources, tools, and therapeutic interventions that empower users to navigate their
     mental health challenges from the comfort of their own spaces. Understanding the dynamics and potential benefits
     of online self-help and therapy is essential for anyone seeking accessible and flexible ways to enhance their mental
     health resilience and seek support.

     Definition and Types
     There are several types of online self-help and therapy available today. Here are some common ones:

         · Online support groups are moderated groups where people can come together to discuss common challenges
             and provide emotional support to each other.

         · Self-guided therapy uses online programs that provide structured activities and exercises to help individuals
             address specific mental health concerns, such as anxiety or depression.

         · Therapy or counseling that happens remotely instead of in-person, called teletherapy, is performed by
             licensed therapists and mental health providers who offer treatment for various mental health concerns.

         · Self-help technology, or online self-help, refers to the use of internet-based resources, such as websites,
             forums, mobile applications, and digital tools, to address personal mental health issues and challenges. These
             include self-help apps that offer a range of features, including CBT exercises, mindfulness techniques, and
             guided meditations.

         · Online coaching: These are online sessions with life coaches or other professionals who provide guidance on
             how to achieve personal or professional goals (APA, 2023).

     Benefits of Online Self-Help and Therapy
     There are multiple advantages to online self-help and therapy that have helped make it such a popular choice in
     recent years. One of the biggest advantages is accessibility. Online self-help and therapy are extremely convenient
     and can be accessed from anywhere and at any time, thereby eliminating the barriers to traditional in-person
     therapy due to location or scheduling conflicts. As access to care is a challenge in health care in both rural and urban
     settings, online options are providing services to more individuals.

     Another major benefit is affordability: online self-help and therapy can be less costly than traditional in-person
     therapy, increasing access for clients with lower incomes. Additionally, some self-help materials are available online
     for free, requiring only an internet connection. Local public libraries are often a great resource for people who need
     access to free internet.

     There are other benefits. For example, some clients believe online therapy offers greater anonymity and privacy and
     prefer it to discussing their problems face-to-face with a therapist. Additionally, online self-help and therapy can
     provide access to a wide range of resources, including forums, videos, and articles, that can supplement therapy and
     help individuals develop coping mechanisms for their mental health issues.

     Common Features of Platforms
     In today's digital era, reputable online self-help and therapy platforms have emerged as valuable resources in the
     realm of mental health and well-being. These platforms offer individuals convenient access to a variety of
     therapeutic tools, resources, and guidance, providing a means to address their emotional challenges and personal
     growth at their own pace and on their own terms. Exploring the world of reputable online self-help and therapy
     platforms opens up opportunities for individuals to engage in evidence-based practices and connect with
     professional support, all within the comfort and privacy of their digital environments. Reputable online self-help and
     therapy platforms share several features in common:

         · Accessibility: Online self-help and therapy platforms offer easy access to mental health resources for
             individuals who may not have access to traditional in-person therapy due to various reasons, such as financial
             constraints, distance, or scheduling conflicts. They also offer different communication channels, including
             messaging, videoconferencing, and phone calls, to enable individuals to connect with therapists and access
             support.

         · Confidentiality: Most online self-help and therapy platforms ensure the privacy and confidentiality of user
             information and conversations with licensed therapists. Clients should be discouraged from using those that

        do not.
    · Personalization: These platforms often use algorithms or assessments to match individuals with therapists or

        self-help resources that are tailored to their specific needs and concerns.

Special Considerations for Online Platforms

Online mental health platforms have several challenges and limitations. To begin with, not everyone has access to
reliable internet or possesses the equipment and technical skills required to use online mental health platforms.
This can limit the reach and accessibility of these services, particularly for older adults and people in low-income or
rural areas. When it comes to client care, online mental health platforms often have a standardized approach to
mental health treatment that may not be tailored to the individual needs of the client. This lack of personalization
may not be suitable for people with certain complex or severe mental health issues. If someone is expressing
thoughts or demonstrating behaviors indicating that they may be a harm to themselves or others, they should be
seen in person immediately.

Other limitations relate to communication. Online mental health platforms rely on video, written, or typed
communication, which can be limiting in terms of conveying emotions, tone, and nonverbal cues when compared
with in-person interactions. This can make it difficult for the therapist and client to build trust and rapport. Also,
online mental health platforms may not provide the same level of continuity and follow-up care as traditional in-
person therapy. Clients may discontinue treatment or switch to another provider without adequate transition
planning, leading to discontinuity of care.

As online mental health platforms have increased in popularity, specific ethical considerations have evolved to
protect clients and provide the safest, most secure experience. The top ethical concerns for online platforms are
privacy and confidentiality (Stoll et al., 2020). The safeguarding of an individual's personal and sensitive health
information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure, ensuring confidentiality and maintaining the individual's
control over their health data is called privacy. The ethical obligation to protect and keep private a client's personal
health information, preventing its disclosure to unauthorized individuals or entities, is called confidentiality. Online
platforms must ensure the privacy and confidentiality of their users. This includes providing highly secure
transmission and storage of personal and sensitive information. Data breaches can occur, however, because of
security or technology issues that are beyond the control of the clinician. Clients should read and understand terms
and conditions clearly when entering personal information on websites and ensure the site uses appropriate privacy
practices. The legal terms and conditions concerning privacy can be long and dense, making it challenging for clients
to comprehend.

Another top ethical concern for online platforms is informed consent. Informed consent for online services is slightly
different due to different ethical and legal concerns that may vary by service or by state. Users should be informed
about the nature and limitations of online mental health services and have the right to give or withhold consent for
treatment. It can be difficult, however, for the provider to assess if the client is mentally or legally able to give
consent online without first having evaluated the client.

Online mental health providers must have appropriate training, credentials, and licensure to provide services.
Therapeutic techniques for online therapy may differ from those that are used for in-person therapy and require
special training. Online providers must adhere to the same ethical and professional standards as in-person
providers, such as avoiding dual relationships, maintaining appropriate boundaries, and avoiding conflicts of
interest. Additionally, online mental health platforms must ensure that their services meet accepted standards of
quality of care. This includes regular assessment of client outcomes, ongoing professional development, and
adherence to evidence-based practices.

The Role of Nursing Online

As telehealth has expanded, so has the role of the nurse in providing telehealth services for clients with mental
health issues. The role of nursing in online self-help and therapy platforms can vary depending on the specific
platform and the services it offers. Nevertheless, nurses play valuable roles in supporting individuals who are
seeking help or therapy online.

One important role for nurses is providing health education and information to individuals who are using online self-
help and therapy platforms. Nurses can use their expertise to help individuals better understand their health
210  7 · Interprofessional Care

     conditions, medications, and treatment options. This can be particularly helpful for individuals who are seeking
     information about mental health conditions, such as depression or anxiety. Nurses can also provide education to
     clients on how to look for the best online platform to suit their own particular wants and needs.

     Ethical and Legal Considerations
     It is the nurse's duty to deliver ethical, evidence-based, high-quality, individualized care that is based on the Code of
     Ethics for Nurses (American Nurses Association [ANA], 2015). With online platforms, privacy is of the utmost
     concern. Nurses should have knowledge of the different telehealth technologies that are available--particularly
     which telehealth platforms are considered secure. For example, no Zoom platform may be entirely HIPAA secure,
     and FaceTime is not considered secure in most facilities. Organizations often have designated platforms that meet
     privacy, confidentiality, and security requirements.

     Nurses must also be aware of legal and regulatory issues, that vary from state to state, and remain current on
     applicable laws. For example, licensure requirements for a nurse providing care to clients in other states may differ
     from requirements in the nurse's home state and are subject to change at any time (Telehealth.HHS.gov, 2023). The
     details of telehealth consents vary between states as well. If the nurse is providing care in multiple states, they
     must follow the Board of Nursing guidelines for each state. The telehealth nurse must also be trained in the proper
     delegation of non-RN tasks to unlicensed staff and licensed practical nurses (LPNs). For example, an LPN can
     schedule appointments and referrals to other providers.

     Nursing Interventions
     Even though telehealth leads to a much more independent, client-driven experience, it is still important to follow up
     and evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment plan. One important nursing intervention is to educate clients about
     the benefits and limitations of using online platforms. By discussing the various platforms available and their
     effectiveness, clients can make informed decisions about which platform would suit them best. Another important
     intervention is to assess whether clients are suitable candidates for online self-help and therapy platforms. Factors,
     such as the severity of a client's mental health condition, their access to technology, and their computer literacy
     levels, can determine if online self-help and therapy platforms are appropriate.

     Nurses also help monitor clients' progress and adherence to their treatment plan, including their use of online self-
     help and therapy platforms. By tracking their usage, nurses can identify any issues or barriers to treatment, such as
     problems with the client navigating the website or difficulties understanding certain concepts. Nurses can also
     collaborate with other health-care professionals, such as psychologists or psychiatrists, to provide a holistic
     approach to the client's mental health. This collaboration can ensure that the client's treatment plan is
     comprehensive and that it addresses all aspects of their mental health.

     Finally, nurses can provide emotional support to clients who are using online self-help and therapy platforms. They
     can discuss clients' concerns or fears about using these platforms, address any feelings of isolation or
     disconnection, and provide reassurance and encouragement.

     Clinical Setting: Community mental health center
     Geographic Location: Midwest

     In rural areas, there can be a lack of both psychiatrists and psychiatric nurses available to care for clients in the
     inpatient setting. One thing that hospitals do to combat this is use contract providers through a telehealth company
     to provide ER psych assessments and to cover daily rounds, especially on weekends. Even though this is provided
     within the hospital setting, it does require that the client feel comfortable talking to a doctor on a computer screen
     and the assistance of the RN to bring the clients to the examination room to support both the client and the doctor
     during the appointment. Sometimes, the clients are hesitant to talk to a doctor who is not physically present, so the
     nurse can provide the client with support during the intervention. The doctor can also ask the nurse questions after
     the client has left the room and this helps to facilitate continuity of care. This particular hospital gets admissions

from as far away as a five-hour drive. There is an online tracking system used throughout the state to find beds for
clients in need. The availability of online providers to support the in-person psychiatrists is beneficial to the
department and the clients.

During the pandemic, many therapy offices switched to online appointments with their licensed professional
counselors. Clients became comfortable with the convenience and flexibility of this type of service. I am familiar
with several local offices that continue to offer online appointments to meet the needs of their clients.

Online Approaches and Theories for Self-Help and Therapy
Several different approaches are well-suited for online self-help and therapy. Here are some of the most commonly
utilized.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
One of the most widely used and well-known forms of psychotherapy (NAMI, 2017), CBT is based on the idea that
thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected, and that by changing thoughts and behaviors, people can
improve their emotional well-being. Research shows that CBT delivered through telehealth can be just as effective
as traditional CBT, especially for anxiety and depression (NAMI, 2017).

Mentalization-Based Therapy
Used to treat personality disorders, such as borderline personality disorder, mentalization-based therapy (MBT)
encourages clients to consider how their thoughts influence their behaviors and their relationships with others.

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy
Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is a type of psychotherapy that aims to help individuals develop
psychological flexibility and improve their overall well-being. The core principle of ACT is to accept difficult thoughts
and feelings, rather than try to avoid or eliminate them, and to focus instead on taking action toward living a
meaningful and fulfilling life.

Dialectical Behavioral Therapy
DBT is a form of therapy based in CBT that is meant for clients who have difficulty regulating and expressing their
emotions. It was originally designed to assist clients with borderline personality disorder, but is now used to treat a
variety of mental illnesses. DBT emphasizes the importance of balancing acceptance of reality and change of
unhelpful behaviors in order to improve emotional regulation.

Online Support Groups
In online support groups, clients can find a community of individuals who share similar experiences and can offer
advice and support to one another. Examples include groups for individuals with anxiety, depression, or addiction.

  CLINICAL JUDGMENT MEASUREMENT MODEL

  Generate Solutions: Helping Clients Find Options for Online Mental Health Assistance

  Generating solutions involves the identification of the measures, interventions, or actions necessary to address a
  particular problem or issue. Part of this process involves differentiating between solutions that are appropriate,
  and those that are unnecessary, unneeded, or contraindicated (Introduction to Health Assessment for the
  Nursing Professional--Part I, 2021). When assisting clients with finding the most appropriate forms of online
  therapy, there are multiple factors that the nurse must take into account:

      · Diagnosis: Consider the client's specific mental health diagnosis. Certain therapeutic modalities may be
          more effective for particular issues, such as CBT for anxiety or depression, or DBT for borderline
          personality disorder.

      · Severity of symptoms: Some individuals may require more intensive support or specialized interventions
          than may be offered through online care. For example, online therapy would not be appropriate for a client
          experiencing active suicidal ideation or psychosis.

      · Technological accessibility: Ensure that the client has access to the necessary computer technology and
          internet connection to participate in online therapy sessions. Determine if they are comfortable enough
212  7 · Interprofessional Care

               with technology to effectively participate in regular online treatment.
           · Privacy and security: Ensure that the proposed online therapy platform complies with relevant health-care

               regulations and provides secure, confidential communication channels to protect the client's sensitive
               information.
           · Cost and insurance coverage: Discuss the cost of online therapy sessions and whether they are covered by
               the client's insurance. Consider the financial aspects and explore options that are affordable for the client.
           · Client preference: Involve the client in the decision-making process. Understand their preferences
               regarding the format of therapy, communication style, and therapeutic goals. Some individuals may prefer
               traditional talk therapy, while others might benefit from approaches like mindfulness-based therapies or
               dialectical behavior therapy. Others may prefer therapists who specialize in certain culturally sensitive
               care, such as those who provide therapy specific to LGBTQIA+ individuals.

     7.6 Challenges to Continuity of Care

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe the complexity of mental health care and providing continuity of care
         · Explain how communication helps or hinders continuity of care for clients
         · Describe the nurse's role in providing continuity of care

     The nature of mental illness, as well as the variety of treatments offered, contribute to the complexity of mental
     health services. This makes quality care coordination a top priority when caring for clients with mental illness.
     Excellent communication is particularly important when dealing with multiple professions and agencies in order to
     prevent fragmentation of care. As always, the nurse plays an important role as care coordinator, removing
     boundaries and ensuring smooth communication.

     Complexity of Mental Health Services

     The complexity of mental health services can be seen in the types of services available, the variability of the
     conditions that mental health professionals treat, and the challenges in accessing these services. One of the nurse's
     central roles in providing mental health services is care coordination. As previously mentioned, care coordination
     refers to the organization and distribution of health-care services across different providers and settings in order to
     ensure that clients receive the right care at the right time.

     One key factor contributing to the complexity of mental health services is the wide range of conditions that fall
     under the category of "mental illness." Mental health professionals may work with individuals experiencing
     depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, eating disorders, addiction, and many other conditions, each
     with its own set of symptoms and treatment approaches. Mental health services often involve a multidisciplinary
     team of professionals, including psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, nurses, and other specialists, who must
     work together to provide the most effective care possible. This coordination can be challenging, particularly when
     working with clients who may have multiple health issues or complex treatment needs.

     Another factor that contributes to the complexity of mental health services is the difficulty in accessing care. In
     most parts of the world, mental health services are not as widely available or affordable as they need to be, and
     individuals may face long wait times or significant physical or financial barriers to accessing care. Additionally,
     mental health services are often delivered in a variety of settings, including hospitals, clinics, community centers,
     schools, and even online. This diversity of settings means that mental health professionals must be adaptable and
     able to work effectively across different environments. The complexity of mental health services requires
     specialization of health-care services, communication, and continuity to ensure access and utilization of the care
     continuum.

     Specialization of Health-Care Services
     Specialization in mental health-care services refers to the process of focusing on specific areas of mental health
     practice to provide more targeted and effective care for individuals with specific mental health needs. There are
     many reasons why mental health-care services may become specialized, including the need to provide more
     individualized care, the desire to improve outcomes, and the recognition that different mental health conditions

7.6 · Challenges to Continuity of Care                                                                                   213

require different types of care.

Specialization is commonly seen in the treatment of specific mental health disorders. For example, there are
specialized treatment programs for individuals with eating disorders, substance use disorders, and post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD). These programs often involve a multidisciplinary team of health-care providers who have
extensive training and expertise in treating the specific disorder.

Another area where specialization is increasingly common is in the delivery of telehealth services. With the
increasing use of technology in mental health care, providers can now offer specialized services to individuals in
remote or underserved areas. Telehealth services can include online counseling, virtual therapy sessions, and
remote monitoring of mental health symptoms.

Specialization in mental health-care services can also extend to specific populations, such as children, adolescents,
or older adults. For example, providers may specialize in working with children and adolescents with autism
spectrum disorder or older adults with dementia. Specializing in a particular population allows providers to better
understand the unique mental health needs of that group and tailor their care accordingly.

Overall, the specialization of mental health-care services can lead to more targeted and effective care for individuals
with specific mental health needs. By focusing on specific areas of practice, providers can gain the expertise needed
to deliver high-quality care and improve outcomes for their clients. The specialization of care can lead to clients
having to see multiple providers to address all of their needs. This can lead to fragmentation of communication and
care across a continuum. The nurse has a role in care coordination, ensuring continuity throughout all health
services.

Communication along the Continuum of Care
The continuum of care refers to the different stages of care that a person may receive, from prevention and early
intervention to treatment and recovery. Effective communication is crucial for providing high-quality mental health
care across all these stages. Communication involves the exchange of information, ideas, and emotions between
mental health professionals, clients, their families, and other health-care providers involved in the client's care.

At the prevention and early intervention stage, communication involves educating the public about mental health,
reducing the stigma associated with mental illness, and promoting awareness of the signs and symptoms of mental
health problems. This may include providing educational materials, conducting community outreach programs, and
promoting mental health screenings.

In the assessment and diagnosis stage, communication involves the exchange of information between the client and
their health-care provider to gather information about the client's mental health history, symptoms, and other
relevant information. Effective communication at this stage is essential for making an accurate diagnosis and
developing a treatment plan that meets the client's needs.

In the treatment and recovery stage, communication involves ongoing collaboration between nurses, clients, other
providers, and their families to meet treatment goals and monitor progress. This may involve regular check-ins with
the client, medication management, therapy sessions, and support groups. Effective communication at this stage is
essential for promoting client engagement, adherence to treatment, and positive outcomes.

Throughout the continuum of care, communication also involves coordination and collaboration between mental
health professionals and other health-care providers involved in the client's care. This may include primary care
physicians, social workers, case managers, and other specialists. Effective communication between these providers
is essential for ensuring that clients receive comprehensive and coordinated care that addresses all of their mental
health needs.

Communication Hindering or Helping Continuity of Care

What contributes to more comprehensive and better health care through the coordination and quality of health-care
services a client receives over time from various health-care providers or care settings is continuity of care. When
employed effectively, communication is the most effective tool for providing continuity of care for clients. When
incomplete or inconsistent, communication can hinder continuity of care. Missing or incorrect information can have
a particularly negative effect on client outcomes.
214  7 · Interprofessional Care

     Communication Helping with Continuity of Care
     The communication skills of nurses are essential for delivering effective care and promoting positive health
     outcomes. By communicating effectively with clients, nurses establish a trusting relationship, which is important for
     promoting client engagement and involvement in the care process. Nurses can also help to identify potential
     barriers to treatment, such as medication side effects or lack of social support, and work to address them.
     Furthermore, regular communication between nurses and clients can help ensure that clients receive consistent
     care, even when they see different providers at different times. Good nurse communication also involves
     collaboration and coordination with other health-care providers, such as physicians and mental health specialists, to
     ensure that clients receive appropriate and timely care. By working together, health-care providers can ensure that
     clients receive consistent and comprehensive care.

     Communication Hindering Continuity of Care
     Just as good communication can ensure continuity of care for clients, communication barriers can cause significant
     problems with continuity of care for mental health clients. When communication is inadequate, it may lead to a lack
     of information, or misinformation, being exchanged between health-care professionals. If nurse-client
     communication is poor, clients may struggle to communicate their symptoms or concerns, leading to missed
     diagnoses, inadequate treatment, or medication errors. Communication barriers can contribute to
     misunderstandings between clients and health-care providers, leading to a lack of trust, poor client engagement,
     and a lack of follow-up.

     The Nurse's Role in Promoting Continuity of Care

     The nurse's role in promoting continuity of care in mental health services is central. The nurse works as a liaison
     between different mental health-care providers and coordinates care to ensure that clients receive comprehensive
     and consistent care. The nurse can also maintain open and ongoing communication with the client and their family
     to ensure that everyone is informed about the client's progress and any changes to their care plan.

     The nurse should advocate for clients by ensuring that their rights are respected, their needs are addressed, and
     their voices are heard in the decision-making process. Additionally, the nurse can provide clients with information
     about their mental health condition and treatment options, as well as coping strategies and resources to support
     their recovery. This increases compliance and follow-up.

     Finally, the nurse can follow up with clients after they have received treatment to ensure that they are following their
     care plan, taking their medications, and attending any necessary appointments. If clients are not reaching goals, the
     nurse should evaluate why, and make any necessary changes to the client's nursing care plan.

Summary

7.1 Collaboration and Coordination of Care

The four evidence-based case management service models are the brokerage model, the intensive case
management model, the clinical case management model, and the strengths-based case management model. They
differ in who serves as the case manager and in the degree of closeness and interaction between the case manager
and client. The nurse as case manager helps plan and coordinate care for each client to address their unique needs.
Virtual health care may be used in coordination of care as a way to more easily access and exchange information
and navigate the health-care system.

7.2 Recovery and Rehabilitative Needs

Recovery is a journey throughout which clients improve their mental and physical health and wellness, and try to live
a fulfilling, self-directed life. The four dimensions of recovery are health, home, purpose, and community.
Rehabilitative treatments, which support recovery, include medication management and therapy. Examples of
rehabilitative resources, which also support recovery, include housing assistance, job coaching, educational
assistance, and social support.

7.3 Discharge and Transfer

Discharge planning is a critical aspect of psychiatric-mental health nursing. It involves developing a comprehensive
and individualized plan for a client's safe and successful transition from an inpatient psychiatric facility or unit to
their home or community or to another facility. Transferring a client with mental illness into or out of a mental health
unit or between departments can be a complex and sensitive process that requires careful planning and, above all,
consideration for client safety. Transferring a psychiatric client's health information is also a sensitive process,
requiring informed consent, effective communication, and careful attention to privacy and confidentiality concerns.

7.4 Continued Support

Discharge and transfer of clients are critical times in client care. Clients should follow up with a mental health
provider within thirty (preferably seven) days of discharge. As coordinator of care for the client, the nurse plays a
vital role in assisting with this follow-up care in collaboration with other health-care professionals. Mental health
and psychosocial support (MHPSS) is a critical component of overall health care and well-being. It refers to a range
of interventions and services that promote and treat mental health and health care after disasters and crises.

7.5 Online Self-Help and Therapy

Types of online therapy include online support groups, self-guided therapy, teletherapy, online self-help, and online
coaching. Benefits include accessibility, cost, anonymity, and access to resources. There are other considerations
involved in the decision to use online mental health applications, such as access, communication, quality, legal and
licensing issues, and ethical concerns like privacy. Nurses play a valuable role in supporting individuals who are
seeking help or therapy online, though the specific role can vary depending on the platform and the services it
offers.

7.6 Challenges to Continuity of Care

The complexity of mental health involves the types of services available, the challenges in accessing these services,
and the variability of the conditions that mental health professionals treat. Effective communication helps to ensure
that clients continue to receive consistent, comprehensive care that is tailored to their individual needs and
preferences even as they move between health-care providers. When communication is inadequate, it can
contribute to misunderstandings between nurses and clients; it may also lead to a lack of information, or
misinformation being exchanged between health-care professionals. The nurse's role in promoting continuity of care
in mental health services is crucial. The nurse works as a liaison between different mental health-care providers and
coordinates care to ensure that clients receive comprehensive and consistent care.

diagnosed during her early twenties. Over the years, she has encountered recurrent episodes of both manic and
depressive states, impacting her overall quality of life. Recently, Sarah has been grappling with intensified
symptoms of depression, including persistent feelings of hopelessness, a diminished interest in activities she once
enjoyed, disrupted sleep patterns, and noticeable changes in her appetite leading to unintentional weight loss. In
addition to her psychiatric history, Sarah reports a significant life event that triggered this latest episode--a recent
divorce after a fifteen-year marriage. The stressors associated with this major life change have exacerbated her
bipolar symptoms, leading her to seek professional help. Sarah's vital signs upon arrival indicate a heightened level
of physiological distress, with an increased heart rate of 105 bpm and elevated blood pressure reading at 140/90
mmHg. During the initial assessment, she expresses difficulties in concentrating at work, which has led to a decline

hallucinations, reporting command hallucinations instructing him to harm himself. He exhibits paranoid delusions,
expressing a belief that he is being followed and persecuted. Rodney has a complex psychiatric history, dating back
to his early twenties when he was initially diagnosed with schizophrenia. He has a history of multiple psychiatric
hospitalizations, often precipitated by medication noncompliance. His medical history includes hypertension, for
which he takes amlodipine, a medication that has been well-tolerated. In the current episode, Rodney's family
reports a recent decline in his overall functioning. They noticed increased social withdrawal, decreased self-care,
and disrupted sleep patterns. He denies any recent substance use or changes in medications. His vital signs on
admission are within normal limits, and initial laboratory workup, including a complete blood count and
comprehensive metabolic panel, is unremarkable.

    9. Discuss the key components of a comprehensive discharge plan for Rodney, considering his complex
        psychiatric history, recent exacerbation of schizophrenia, and the goal of preventing relapse. How can

Emily is a thirty-two-year-old female who arrives at the psychiatric outpatient clinic for follow-up care after a recent
hospitalization for a major depressive episode with suicidal ideation. Emily reports a two-month history of persistent
low mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and changes in sleep and appetite. During her hospitalization, she
was started on a therapeutic dose of sertraline and engaged in individual and group therapy sessions. Emily has a
history of recurrent depressive episodes since her early twenties, with intermittent periods of stability. She has a
family history of mood disorders, and her past psychiatric treatments have included various antidepressant
medications and psychotherapy. Emily's medical history is notable for hypothyroidism, managed with levothyroxine,
and there is no reported history of substance use. During her initial assessment, Emily's vital signs are within normal
limits, and she expresses a commitment to continue with her medication regimen and follow-up appointments.

Aarav, a twenty-eight-year-old nonbinary individual, seeks care at the psychiatric outpatient clinic due to escalating
symptoms of anxiety and panic attacks. Aarav provides a comprehensive account of the distress, linking it to
heightened stress levels arising from work-related pressures and challenges in personal relationships. Aarav
describes the anxiety as pervasive, affecting both day-to-day functioning and overall well-being. The reported
symptoms encompass various dimensions. Aarav mentions experiencing disrupted sleep patterns, characterized by
frequent awakenings and difficulty falling asleep due to intrusive thoughts. Racing thoughts dominate waking hours,
contributing to a heightened sense of unease. Physical manifestations during panic attacks include palpitations, a
racing heartbeat, and shortness of breath, further intensifying the emotional distress. A thorough exploration of
Aarav's medical history reveals no significant health issues or prior engagements with mental health services. This
marks Aarav's first encounter with seeking professional support for mental health concerns. The absence of a
mental health treatment history prompts the nurse to gather additional information about Aarav's coping
mechanisms, support systems, and any past strategies employed to manage stress. Aarav's social history unveils a
dynamic and supportive network of friends and family. However, recent challenges in personal relationships have
strained these support systems, contributing to Aarav's sense of isolation and exacerbating the anxiety symptoms.

  14. Given Aarav's presentation of anxiety and panic attacks, discuss the potential benefits of specific online self-
        help and therapy options mentioned in the chapter, such as teletherapy, self-guided therapy, and online

        can nurses provide health education, assess the suitability of online platforms for specific clients, and
        monitor progress while maintaining ethical standards and addressing potential challenges associated with
        online mental health services?

learned and customary way of life in human societies, unique to each. Culture helps give people an identity and
shapes their values, beliefs, and practices. Culture plays a significant role in health and wellness because it can
affect what types of medicines and treatments to use, who is allowed to provide care, and beliefs about what causes
illness and injury.
The United States has long had a reputation as a multicultural nation and, according to the United States Census
Bureau, it continues to grow even more racially and ethnically diverse every year (Jensen, 2022). In health care,
nurses will encounter clients with different cultures from each other and different cultures from themselves. It is
imperative that nurses are able to understand and adapt to cultural differences in order to provide the best possible
care for all clients, regardless of culture. This chapter discusses how to gain a better understanding of cultural
differences among the clients nurses serve and how to incorporate diversity and inclusion as best practice.

     8.1 Understanding Cultural Differences

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Identify cultural influences on beliefs regarding health and illness
         · Recognize health disparities among different cultural groups
         · Describe various types of healing in different cultures
         · Explain how to recognize and address unconscious or implicit bias

     Nurses encounter clients from a variety of backgrounds; therefore, it is essential that nurses provide culturally
     appropriate care. Cultural competence, in the context of nursing care, does not assume mastery. It means being
     open to learn and grow and practicing toward success. The skill of applying evidence-based nursing care in
     agreement with the cultural values, beliefs, worldview, and practices of clients to produce improved client outcomes
     is called cultural competency. It is one component of providing client-centered, holistic nursing care.

     A nurse who provides holistic care to clients will focus on healing the person as a whole, rather than on one specific
     problem. Holistic care means to think about and care for physical, cognitive, social, emotional, and spiritual health.
     When an individual's cultural beliefs are integrated into their health care, it is called culturally responsive care.
     Culturally responsive care is required for a trusting, effective relationship with the client, and this skill begins with
     cultural awareness. Throughout care delivery, nurses partner with clients and families to become aware of their
     preferences and values. This awareness can come through structured interviews, therapeutic interactions, and
     inclusion of the clients' significant others in care, as permitted.

     Cultural Influences on Health and Illness

     The United States is a country of various ethnic and cultural groups that grows more diverse every day. The set of
     beliefs, attitudes, and practices shared by a group of people or community that is accepted, followed, and passed
     down to other members of the group is called culture. Some cultures have beliefs that explain what causes illness,
     how illnesses can be treated or cured, and who should be involved in the process. Culture also affects how people
     communicate with health-care team members in terms of language or eye contact, or what can be discussed in
     terms of the person's body, health, or illness. A person's culture affects everything from how they think and feel
     about health and illness, to how receptive they are to treatment recommendations, to how, when, and from whom
     they receive care.

             CLINICAL SAFETY AND PROCEDURES (QSEN)

     Competency: Client-Centered Care

     Definition: Recognize the client as a full partner in control of all decisions when providing compassionate and
     coordinated care based on respect for the client's preferences, values, and needs.

     Knowledge: Describe how diverse cultural, ethnic, and social backgrounds function as sources of client, family, and
     community values.

     Skill: Communicate client values, preferences, and expressed needs to other members of the health-care team.

     Attitude: Respect and encourage individual expression of client values, preferences, and expressed needs.

     Best practice standards include the nurse providing competent, effective care with each client interaction.
     Conducting a cultural assessment is one way to ensure meeting the client's preferences and cultural needs.

     (QSEN Institute, n.d.)

     Individualism versus Collectivism
     One main psychological distinction between cultures that affects how people think and make decisions is
     individualism versus collectivism. Cultures that follow individualism focus on the individual. They are encouraged to
     make choices for their own benefit with an emphasis on independence and self-reliance, and health care tends to be
     viewed as a personal responsibility. Most Western countries, such as the United States, United Kingdom, and other

parts of Western Europe are considered to have individualistic cultures (Fatehi et al., 2020).

In contrast, cultures that follow collectivism emphasize community and cooperation. Decisions are made for the
benefit of the collective. These cultures believe that it is best for society when everyone works together as a group,
and the needs of the individual come secondary to the needs of the greater good. A client from a collectivistic
culture might defer treatment decisions to their family, for example. Some countries that practice cultural
collectivism include China, Japan, Indonesia, and several other Eastern Asian or South Asian countries.

Cultural Influences on Pain
Pain management can be a challenging task and can be made more complex by the cultural considerations
particular to each client. Different cultures have varying views on pain, including how to express it, how to treat it,
and what it means. Pain is a universal physical experience, but it also involves emotions and behaviors that are
colored by the client's cultural viewpoint (Givler & Bhatt, 2022). For instance, Black, Japanese, Hispanic, and East
Asian cultures tend to appear stoic about pain and may keep an unexpressive face or believe that requesting pain
medication is a sign of weakness (Givler & Bhatt, 2022). This does not mean that they are not experiencing pain, or
that they have a higher pain tolerance than people who may appear more emotional when experiencing pain.
Others, such as those who are part of Muslim or Christian communities, can view pain as the plan of a higher power.
Chinese clients may view pain as an imbalance between yin and yang (Perreira et al., 2019). Take care to avoid
misunderstandings about pain due to cultural differences because they can result in overtreatment or
undertreatment of the client's pain.

  CLINICAL JUDGMENT MEASUREMENT MODEL

  Take Action: Culturally Sensitive Nursing Interventions for Pain

  Even though the ways in which clients experience and express pain are influenced by their cultural background,
  pain is an individual experience. It is important for the nurse to be aware of cultural differences so that they can
  treat the individual in a way that best suits their pain and their preferences. Culturally sensitive nursing
  interventions for pain include (Givler & Bhatt, 2022):

      · Providing an interpreter for clients with limited verbal or written English skills.
      · Asking the client about their ideas and understanding of the concept of pain. Their beliefs may be

          representative of their cultural background, or they may not--be careful not to make generalizations
          without listening to the client.
      · Providing thorough education to the client on pain assessment and the importance of reporting pain. Rely
          on these assessments rather than on behaviors.
      · Being sensitive to traditional healing remedies, such as prayer or use of certain foods. Allow the client to
          incorporate traditional remedies whenever possible. Make sure to gather a thorough history of all
          medicines, herbs, plants, and foods to avoid any possible interactions.
      · Assuring the client that the health-care team is there to help treat their pain in a way that is the most
          appropriate and suitable for them.
      · Adjusting the client's care plan to reflect their cultural needs.

Health Disparities Related to Cultural Differences

The nonbiological factors that influence health outcomes, including conditions in which people are born, grow, work,
live, and age, and the wider sets of forces and systems shaping the conditions of daily life are called social
determinants of health. Health outcomes that are influenced by these social determinants of health and therefore
represent preventable differences experienced by underrepresented individuals are called health disparities.

Various factors contribute to health disparities among different cultural groups. Socioeconomic status, race,
educational level, and physical proximity to health-care facilities are all factors that contribute to health disparities.
For instance, distrust of mainstream Western medicine in Black and American Indian communities due to a long
history of systemic discrimination can further health disparities by preventing community members from seeking
preventative care. Black and American Indian populations experience increased stress levels of systemic
discrimination and have higher rates of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease when compared with
228  8 · Cultural Considerations

     White populations (Perreira et al., 2019; Weinstein et al., 2017). This represents one example of why it is important
     for the nurse to provide culturally sensitive care to all groups and foster a trusting relationship with the client.

     Healer Variations among Different Cultures

     Every culture develops its own ways of dealing with health and illness. Some use traditional healing, the various
     medicines and healing practices around the world that differ from the modern, Western health-care system (World
     Health Organization, n.d.) (Table 8.1). The term encompasses a vast range of traditions and practices that differ
     across different regions and cultures.

     Traditional healing has long been used to promote health and fight disease and is still used today by many people
     around the world because traditional healers tend to be accessible, affordable, familiar, and knowledgeable of the
     language and culture. Some people rely on traditional healers instead of Western medicine, while others choose to
     incorporate traditional healing practices into Western medical care.

     Asian Traditions
     Asian healing traditions are rooted in the concept of balance. Two of the more well-known traditions are Traditional
     Chinese Medicine and Ayurveda. Both Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurveda have become increasingly popular
     in recent years as complementary therapies to Western medicine.

     Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is an ancient practice based on the ideas of qi and yin and yang. Qi is the life
     force that runs through one's body; yin and yang are the opposite qualities of qi that must be in balance for optimal
     health (Johns Hopkins Medicine, 2019b). TCM consists of such practices as acupuncture, acupressure, cupping,
     herbs, tai chi, and others (Figure 8.2). The Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine
     (ACAOM) is a federally recognized organization that accredits schools in the United States that teach acupuncture

and TCM.

 FIGURE 8.2 Various herbs shown here are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine. ("Chinese prescriptions" by Tim Wilson/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)

Ayurveda is the traditional Hindu form of medicine from India that is based on the idea that disease is caused by an
imbalance in the body. Ayurvedic medicine seeks to cure this imbalance through a combination of diet, herbal
medicines, yoga, and meditation. In India, Ayurvedic medicine is considered equivalent to conventional Western
medicine, and providers receive formal training, but there is no licensing process for Ayurvedic practitioners in the
United States (Johns Hopkins Medicine, 2019a). Ayurvedic medicine consists of herbs, spices, minerals, and other
substances that can interfere with conventional drugs; a thorough list of all medicines and supplements is an
important part of the nursing assessment for this reason.

African Traditions
African healing traditions have their foundations in practices dating back thousands of years. Although specific
religious traditions vary from tribe to tribe, traditional African healing is rooted in the idea that ancestral spirits are
closely involved in the lives of the living, and act as "mediators" between the living and God (Mokgobi, 2014). As
Christianity and Islam began to spread across the continent, many people converted from traditional religions, but
continued the use of traditional practices while also using Westernized health care.

Different tribes have different types of healers; for example, the Bapedi tribe has diviners (Ngaka ya ditaola), Sanusi
(or Sedupe), traditional surgeons, and traditional birth attendants. Diviners and Sanusi can diagnose and prescribe
treatment for mental, physical, and spiritual afflictions (Zuma et al., 2016). Surgeons have been trained to perform
circumcisions on boys, along with the duties of diviners and Sanusi. Older women who have experience assisting
with births over many years become traditional birth attendants. African traditional healers do more than help with
physical illness and injury, however. They also offer spiritual education and care and have special knowledge of
traditional culture, which allows them to function as counselors and social workers.
230  8 · Cultural Considerations

     Native American Traditions
     In Native American and Alaska Native cultures, physical and spiritual health are interconnected. The belief is that in
     order for the body to heal, the soul must heal as well. Native American healers believe that the individual is the
     source of most of the healing, and is responsible for their own health, wellness, and behavior. The healer's role is to
     help the individual as they heal themselves, although the individual's family and community play an important part
     as well (National Institutes of Health (NIH), n.d.).

     many conducted by individual tribes, that provide mental health services.

     Ritual and ceremony hold a key role in traditional Native American healing. Purifying and cleansing the body,
     whether through sweating or purging, is an important practice in some Native American healing rituals. Smudging is
     another practice that involves cleansing a place or person with the smoke of certain sacred plants. Some healing
     ceremonies can involve whole communities. These ceremonies can include music, painting bodies, dancing,
     exorcisms, sand paintings, stories, and use of mind-altering substances. These ceremonies are a way to seek
     spiritual assistance and physical healing (NIH, n.d.). Researchers call for mentorship and outreach in nursing
     education to incorporate culture and tradition into academic programs (Moore, 2023).

     Members of the Native American Church are legally allowed to use peyote, a hallucinogen, during religious
     ceremonies. It can cause hallucinations and alterations in perceptions of space, time, and self. Physical symptoms
     include nausea, vomiting, dilated pupils, increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, perspiration, headaches,
     muscle weakness, and impaired motor coordination. In rare cases, large doses have been reported to cause
     bradycardia, hypotension, and respiratory depression (Department of Justice, 2020). Peyote has been used for
     centuries by American Indians and is considered a sacred plant.

     Sacrament of Peyote (https://openstax.org/r/77NACpeyote) and its history in the indigenous medicine world.

     Hispanic Traditions
     Traditional Hispanic medicine is performed by healers called curandera (women) or curandero (men). The practice is
     called curanderismo, a holistic practice rooted in beliefs that health is achieved through the right balance of mind,
     body, and spirit. A curandero focuses not only on the individual's physical health, but also on their mental health,
     diet, personal relationships, and more. Curanderos use various healing methods, including prayer, oils, herbs,
     special diets, and other spiritual rituals. They also act as counselors and social workers, listening to individuals talk
     about their problems and helping them build an emotional support network (Cruz et al., 2022).

     Western European Traditions
     The central role of the client in the healer-client relationship is foundational to modern Western European healing
     culture. There is also a strong emphasis on technology and scientific evidence of healing practices.

     Traditional European medicine has a strong foundation in using medicines created from natural elements, including
     herbs, plants, minerals, and animals (Firenzuoli & Gori, 2007). Homeopathy and naturopathy both have roots in

European tradition. Individuals who rely on herbal and plant-based remedies tend to either use them in conjunction
with conventional Western medicine or view them as alternatives to harsher methods of treatment. Examples are
discussed later in this chapter. Nurses should provide quality education to their clients about clinical evidence of the
effectiveness of these complementary and alternative therapies (Leonti & Verpoorte, 2017).

Counteracting Implicit Bias

Everyone holds biases that reflect their own personal belief systems. One type of bias is called explicit bias, a
consciously held set of beliefs about a particular group of people based on characteristics. Explicit bias is what we
typically think of when we see or hear the word bias. A person might be openly biased against someone due to their
age, gender, race, sexuality, or another reason. An overtly racist comment is an example of explicit bias (Sabin,
2022).

In comparison, implicit bias refers to unconscious biases. Implicit bias is an automatic reaction toward a group of
people involving subconscious feelings, perceptions, attitudes, and stereotypes. People may hold conscious beliefs
about equality and fairness while still having unconscious, implicit biases that contradict these beliefs.

Bias negatively affects the client-provider relationship, leading to poorer quality care and worse outcomes for
certain groups. For example, research studies have shown that implicit bias regularly leads to the undertreatment of
pain in Black individuals (Sabin, 2022). Implicit bias can be difficult to change. The first step in overcoming implicit
biases is to become aware of them; training in diversity and inclusiveness can also help identify problematic
feelings, thoughts, and behaviors.

8.2 Ethical Practice in Culture and Diversity

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Identify ways to accommodate different cultural practices
    · Explain ethical ways to engage in cultural diversity practices
    · Define how nurses can be responsive to diversity and inclusion

As discussed in 8.1 Understanding Cultural Differences, the concept of culturally responsive care, which involves
integrating an individual's cultural beliefs into their health care, is an important foundation of cultural competence.
Providing culturally competent care requires attention to diversity and inclusion and a willingness to accommodate
the cultural differences of others. According to the American Psychological Association (APA, n.d.), cultural
diversity means a variety of communities that are very different from one another. Nurturing a community that
acknowledges, respects, and has regard for people from all different cultures is called inclusion.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2024), there are eight principles of cultural
competence:

  1. Define culture broadly.
  2. Value clients' cultural beliefs.
  3. Recognize complexity in language interpretation.
  4. Facilitate learning between providers and communities.
  5. Involve the community in defining and addressing service needs.
  6. Collaborate with other agencies.
  7. Professionalize staff hiring and training.
  8. Institutionalize cultural competence.

Note that it is the responsibility of the health-care professional to seek out, understand, and integrate the client's
beliefs into their care. Ultimately, the goal is to build cultural competence into the permanent framework of health
232  8 · Cultural Considerations

     care.

     Accommodating Cultural Practices

     According to the American Nurses Association (ANA) Code of Ethics (2018), nurses must practice with cultural
     humility and inclusiveness. Culture is constantly changing and evolving, so true cultural competence requires a
     lifetime of learning with these changes. Respecting and learning about the cultures of others while exploring one's
     own cultural biases is considered cultural humility.

     There are both intrapersonal and interpersonal components to cultural humility (Table 8.2) (Hughes et al., 2020).
     The intrapersonal component consists of a personal awareness of one's own limited knowledge of the client's
     culture. The interpersonal component involves a respect for the client's culture and openness to their beliefs and
     experiences. By focusing on developing partnerships with clients, the nurse can create a space that encourages
     learning and appreciation for other cultures. It is a client-centered way of providing culturally sensitive care.

     Interpersonal Skills                                 Intrapersonal Skills

     relationships; must develop self-awareness           opinions, and attitudes are developed

     TABLE 8.2 Interpersonal versus Intrapersonal Skills

     Avoid Forcing Change
     Cultural humility involves inclusion. Inclusion means taking into account the client's own cultural preferences and
     involving them in the process as much as possible. Forcing a client to accept a treatment plan that conflicts with
     their cultural practices and beliefs is rarely effective and can damage the relationship of trust between the nurse
     and the client. The process where the client and nurse seek a mutually acceptable way to deal with competing
     interests of nursing care, prescribed medical care, and the client's cultural needs is called cultural negotiation. It is
     reciprocal and collaborative. When the client's cultural needs do not significantly or adversely affect their treatment
     plan, the cultural needs can and should factor into the plan.

     Seek Cultural Assistance
     Having respectful, curious, in-depth conversations with clients is the best way to learn about their individual cultural
     practices. When seeking ways to accommodate different cultural practices, approach clients with cultural humility
     to learn how best to care for them. Cultural guides from different local communities may also be available for
     cultural dialogue (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], 2014). Collaboration
     between clients from diverse cultures and nurses is an excellent way to produce culturally sensitive, client-centered
     care plans (Hughes et al., 2020). Examples of seeking cultural assistance include researching assistance from
     different organizations, discovering available resources, or developing initiatives for unit-based councils.

     Ethical Engagement in Cultural Diversity

     As a nurse, it is necessary to actively engage with the client and their culture. Cultural negotiation is mutual; the
     nurse and the client must gain an understanding of each other's perspective. There are many ways a nurse can
     actively take part in learning about different cultures to best serve diverse client populations. Some examples
     include encouraging the client to bring traditional or culturally important food from home that is compatible with
     dietary orders and needs or involving the family in medical decision-making.

     Active Learning
     One of the first steps in engaging in cultural diversity is to get to know your community--what ethnic groups are
     most prevalent, what languages are most widely spoken, what religions are most popular? Use sources, such as

newspapers, journal or book articles, and cultural training seminars or courses to research cultural issues that are
relevant to your area. At the same time, do not stereotype or generalize clients. Make sure to ask clients' personal
preferences when it comes to their cultural background and beliefs (Stubbe, 2020).

Learning about cultural diversity also includes becoming aware of your own practices and implicit biases. There are
various implicit bias inventories available to help you identify unconsciously held beliefs. Journaling or reflective
practice is another way to help identify and reflect upon personal thoughts and feelings toward working with diverse
groups. Awareness of your own practices can help identify and address issues with practices observed in the
workplace. For example, your area may have a large Arabic-speaking population, but your clinic does not have
consent forms in Arabic. You decide to advocate for your clients and ask the clinic to provide consent forms in
Arabic. Another example would be your clinic hosts educational workshops so employees can actively learn about
the populations they serve. Learning about the culture of your client population leads to better client outcomes.

Exploring
Immersing yourself in different cultural communities can be an engaging and fun way to learn more about your
clients. Attending local cultural events, such as festivals and dances, exploring art and music scenes, and even
joining religious ceremonies (may require special permission) are all ways to experience cultural practices firsthand
(Figure 8.3).

FIGURE 8.3 Attending cultural festivals, like celebrations of Traditional Mardi Gras Indians in Louisiana, is an excellent way to gain firsthand
exposure to diverse cultural practices. (credit: "Mardi Gras Indians at Algiers Riverfest New Orleans 2009" by Mark Gstohl/Flickr, CC BY

Responsiveness to Cultural Diversity

Learning about different cultures is only one step toward providing culturally competent care. How one responds to
cultural diversity is what directly affects the nurse-client relationship and outcomes. Being responsive to cultural
diversity involves taking lessons learned about other cultures from conversations, experiences, and research and
integrating the knowledge into practice. It also involves advocating for diversity and inclusion at a structural and
institutional level.
234  8 · Cultural Considerations

     Steps to Change
     EveryNurse (2023) defines the cultural differences encountered by nurses that may pose barriers to quality nursing
     care. For example, language differences can impact communication and complicate the nurse-client relationship;
     cultural traditions may influence the client's acceptance of certain medications or interventions and may be
     misinterpreted by health-care providers; health literacy can create differences in understanding, accessing, and
     being able to use health-care information and can impact client education and discharge planning; cultural
     assumptions can lead to knowledge deficit and interfere with the nurse-client relationship.

     Cultural sensitivity in nursing practice, and in health care in general, is essential (EveryNurse, 2023). Table 8.3
     outlines strategies to meet these challenges.

     Challenge    Strategy

     Awareness    Share with your peers that you are working toward stronger cultural sensitivity; engage them in
                  the process. Be open about this change, appreciate the effort, and state the goal of excellence in
                  client care.

     Assumptions  Build validation and inquiry into your interactions with clients and families.
                  Keep your own nonverbal cues appropriate when clients clarify and answer.

     Knowledge    Visit an area where a culture is dominant and read about the culture from reputable books and
                  online sources. Reflect upon your own assumptions and strive to become informed.

     Trust and    If working with a translator, remain focused on the client for nonverbal cues and speak to the
     rapport      client. The translator will interpret the messages.

     Language     Explore translation technology, and use appropriate pictures or gestures to communicate if
     barriers     needed. Keep in mind that the process may be frustrating and allow sufficient time.

     Client       "Teach back" is an effective method to ensure messages have been received. Use translation

     TABLE 8.3 Steps to Overcome Cultural Barriers to Optimal Nursing Care (EveryNurse, 2023)

     Willingness to Change
     Approach the process of learning about other cultures with cultural humility. Learning about other cultures requires
     self-examination and openness to new ideas, beliefs, and behaviors. It is normal to encounter beliefs and practices
     that are extremely different from one's own. They may be in direct conflict with the nurse's own cultural background,
     and may even make them uncomfortable, sad, angry, or confused. It is not expected that nurses will completely
     change all their thoughts and feelings, but a willingness to change is key to accepting others and putting cultural
     competence into action.

Geographic Location: Southern California

I was a twenty-eight-year-old registered nurse from Florida who recently resettled in an area of Southern California.
I am White and prior to this had lived in Florida all of my life. I had been practicing for two years and had just started
a new job on a med-surg floor at a local hospital. The hospital was located in a community that was known for its
large Vietnamese population. Most of the nurses, providers, and clients at the hospital were either Vietnamese
immigrants or of Vietnamese descent.

One day I took report on a new client. The client was a fifty-three-year-old Vietnamese female with a diagnosis of
terminal brain cancer. The client had no expected chance of survival, but she remained a full code and the family
was refusing hospice. I wondered why the client and family would refuse hospice care.

As I went to assess the client, I found her lying in bed and moaning while clutching her head in her hands. She was
nonverbal and nonresponsive to my stimuli. I noticed she had pain medication, so I administered as ordered.

Upon reassessing her, I noticed the medication didn't seem to make much difference. The client was still clutching
her head in her hands and moaning. The doctor refused to increase the dose at my suggestion, and seemed to brush
me off when I recommended talking to the family again about hospice or comfort measures. I found myself growing
increasingly frustrated on behalf of my client, and I felt she might be suffering unnecessarily at the end of her life.

At lunch, I called the client's daughter, Viv, and requested she come to the hospital to visit her mother. Upon the
daughter's arrival, I administered the client some IV pain medication, but the client was not responding or showing
signs of relief. Viv stated, "The pain medication does not seem to be making much of a difference the last couple of
days." I asked her if she had considered hospice for her mother and explained that I had found hospice very helpful
when my own grandmother was at the end of her life. Viv told me that she had discussed hospice with the
physicians but decided against it. "Hospice is not an option for us. In our culture, we believe in fighting with
everything we have down to the last minute," she stated. She explained that she and her family viewed the use of
medication at end of life in hospice care as hastening death.

After having this conversation with Viv, I had a new understanding for why the family was refusing hospice and
comfort measures. I now understood how important it was to the client and the client's family that their own views
on end-of-life care be respected. This conversation allowed me to reexamine my own cultural biases and be more
culturally respectful of the clients I was now serving.

8.3 Cultural Practice in Nursing

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Describe the guidelines for nursing care of different cultural practices
    · Explain the importance of cultural competency and transcultural nursing
    · Recognize factors that can affect diversity and inclusion in nursing

Cultural competence enables a nurse to provide the best quality client-centered care possible. Establishing a
culturally sensitive environment is the first step in providing culturally responsive care to clients. An accurate and
thorough cultural assessment allows for the gathering of client-specific cultural information. The pursuit of culturally
competent care also requires recognizing the various factors that can affect diversity and inclusion in nursing.

Guidelines for Nursing Care

Providing culturally responsive care integrates an individual's cultural beliefs into their health care. Begin by
conveying cultural sensitivity to clients and their family members with these suggestions:

    · Set the stage by introducing oneself by name and role when meeting the client and their family for the first
        time. Address the client formally by using their title and last name. Ask the client how they want to be
        addressed and record this in the client's chart. Respectfully acknowledge any family members and visitors at
        the client's bedside.

    · Begin by standing or sitting at least arm's length from the client.
    · Observe the client and family members in regard to eye contact, space orientation, touch, and other nonverbal
236  8 · Cultural Considerations

             communication behaviors, and follow their lead.
         · Make note of the language the client prefers to use, and record this in the client's chart. If English is not the

             client's primary language, determine if a medical interpreter is required before proceeding with interview
             questions.
         · Use inclusive language that is culturally sensitive and appropriate. For example, do not refer to someone as
             "wheelchair bound;" instead, say "a person who uses a wheelchair."
         · Be open and honest about the extent of knowledge of their culture. It is acceptable to politely ask questions
             about their beliefs and seek clarification to avoid misunderstandings.
         · Adopt a nonjudgmental approach and show respect for the client's cultural beliefs, values, and practices. It is
             possible not to agree with a client's cultural expressions, but it is imperative that the client's rights be upheld.
             As long as the expressions are not unsafe for the client or others, the nurse should attempt to integrate them
             into their care.
         · Assure the client that their cultural considerations are a priority of their care.

     Cultural Assessment
     After establishing a culturally sensitive environment, nurses should incorporate a cultural assessment when caring
     for all clients. There are many assessment guides used for client interviews that are adaptable to a variety of health-
     care settings and are designed to facilitate understanding and communication.

     One such model is the 4C's of Culture, a mnemonic developed by Slavin et al. (2019) to prompt health-care
     providers with culturally sensitive inquiries more likely to present the client's point of view. This model asks
     questions about what the client Considers to be a problem, the Cause of the problem, how they are Coping with the
     problem, and how Concerned they are about the problem. Use these questions to begin the cultural assessment:

         · What do you think is wrong? What is worrying you? (In other words, discover what the client Considers to be
             the problem and what they call it.) Example: A client with a diagnosis of a sinus infection believes their body is
             "unbalanced."

         · What do you think Caused this problem? How did this happen? Example: The client believes this illness is a
             punishment for a misdeed.

         · What are you doing to Cope with this problem? How are you taking care of yourself? Example: The client
             avoids eating certain foods to treat the illness while also using home remedies, such as herbal tea.

         · How serious is this problem for you? How Concerned are you? Example: A client views the illness as being
             "God's will" and states, "It's in God's hands."

             PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

     How to Perform a Brief Cultural Assessment

     Scenario: The nurse enters the client's room to perform a cultural assessment. The client is a female from China in
     the area visiting family whose preferred language is Mandarin. The nurse sets up the video translator to begin the
     conversation and allows the translator to introduce themselves to the client.
     Nurse: Hi, I'm Travis, and I'm going to be your nurse today. Can you please tell me your name and date of birth?
     Client: Mei Wang, January 2, 1947.
     Nurse: What would you like for me to call you?
     Client: Mrs. Wang is fine.
     Nurse: Mrs. Wang, I'm here to do a cultural assessment, which involves asking you a few questions. It should take
     less than 15 minutes. Is that okay?
     Client: Yes, that is fine.
     Nurse: What do you think is wrong? What is worrying you?
     Client: The doctors are telling me that I have an infection in my lungs. I haven't been feeling well, and I believe it is

because my body is not in balance.

Nurse: What do you think caused this problem? How did this happen?

Client: My husband died four months ago, and I left China to live with my son and his family here in the United
States. I miss my husband, and everything here is so different compared with what I'm used to.

Nurse: Have you been trying things at home to make yourself feel better? How have you been coping?

Client: I've been making some special food. A lot of soup, and other foods with ginger, onion, and garlic to help with
the phlegm.

Nurse: How serious is this problem for you? How concerned are you?

Client: I've never been in the hospital before, so I'm worried, but I think the doctors are good here and will get me
home. I want to make sure that my family can bring me food from home, though. I don't like the hospital food; my
food from home is much better for me.

Nurse: I'll check with your doctor to see if your family can bring your food from home; I'll tell them how much better
you like it, okay? My assessment is done for now; do you have any other questions for me?

Client: Not right now, thank you for talking to me.

Another, more comprehensive cultural assessment tool, inspired by R. E. Spector's Heritage Assessment Interview,
is called the Sample Cultural Assessment Interview and includes these additional questions (Spector, 2017):

    · Where were you born? Where were your parents born?
    · What pronouns do you use (he, she, they)?
    · In what language are you most comfortable speaking and reading?
    · Did you grow up in a city or a town or a rural setting?

Cultural Knowledge
Another important step toward becoming a culturally competent nurse is acquiring cultural knowledge, which
involves seeking information about a culture's health beliefs, history, customs, and values to understand clients'
worldviews. To acquire cultural knowledge, the nurse actively seeks information about other cultures, including
common practices, beliefs, values, and customs, particularly for those cultures that are prevalent within the
communities they serve. Cultural knowledge includes understanding the historical backgrounds of culturally diverse
groups in society, as well as physiological variations and the incidence of certain health conditions in culturally
diverse groups. Cultural knowledge is best obtained through cultural encounters with clients from diverse
backgrounds to learn about individual variations that occur within cultural groups and to prevent stereotyping.

Standards of Practice
The Transcultural Nursing Society has developed Standards of Practice for Culturally Competent Nursing Care
(Douglas et al., 2011). These twelve standards are intended to serve as a universally applicable guide for nurses in
all aspects of culturally competent nursing care. Table 8.4 lists the twelve standards and an example of each:

Standard                                                     Example

1. Social justice: Nurses must promote and advocate          Nurses advocate for equitable access to mental health

                                                             socioeconomic status, can receive necessary care.

2. Critical reflection: Nurses must engage in ongoing,       A nurse regularly examines how their cultural beliefs

and practices affect their nursing care.                     and adjusts their approach to respect diverse
                                                             perspectives.

Complementary and Alternative Therapies
Nonmainstream approaches to health that are used alongside conventional Western medical care are called
complementary therapies. When nonmainstream approaches are used in place of conventional Western medical
care, they are called alternative therapies U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, n.d.-a). Conventional
(Western) therapies are much more common than alternative therapies in the United States. Examples of
complementary therapies include the use of guided imagery and meditation for insomnia, or acupuncture for muscle
pain. It is important for the nurse to perform a thorough medication reconciliation to understand use of
complementary or alternative therapies. Clients may not consider alternative supplements to be "medicines" or
"drugs."

Nutritional/Supplemental Therapies
The most popular complementary therapy among Americans is dietary supplements, such as fish oil. This category
also includes special diets, herbs, vitamins, minerals, and probiotics. Because these products can interact with
drugs, it is important to get a comprehensive list from the client of all supplements they are taking. For example, St.
John's Wort, a common supplement, is known to interact with numerous different common medications, including
SSRIs, certain contraceptives, and digoxin (Mayo Foundation, 2021).

Physical and Psychological Therapies
Physical and psychological therapies include a wide range of modalities, such as acupuncture, massage therapy,
meditation, reiki, and qigong. Cupping, coining, yoga, art, music, and dance also fall into this category. Acupuncture
and cupping are two of the more popular alternative physical therapy modalities. Acupuncture is used to treat pain
and multiple other conditions; it is performed by inserting needles at special points in the body. Acupuncture is
intended to restore balance and is thought to work by releasing endorphins, the body's natural painkillers. Cupping
is another traditional therapy where cups are placed on the skin to increase blood flow with the aim of helping with
stress or muscle aches and pains (Figure 8.4).

FIGURE 8.4 Blood marks such as these are a normal finding on someone after a cupping session. (credit: "Cupping" by Renato Ganoza/
Flickr, CC BY 2.0)

Other Complementary Therapies
There are other complementary therapies that do not fit in either category. These include traditional healers,
Ayurvedic medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine, naturopathy, and homeopathy. Naturopathic medicine is derived
from eighteenth- and nineteenth-century European natural healing systems and involves a combination of
therapies, including herbal medicine, diet, acupuncture, and psychotherapy (U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, 2017). Another complementary therapy is homeopathy, the belief that the body can heal itself with
natural substances. It uses natural products in extremely diluted doses to treat illness. Examples include Chestal
Honey cough syrup used for coughs, or chamomilla often used for colic, teething, and childhood irritability.
Homeopathic products can still include ingredients that can cause significant drug interactions, so they must be
noted on the client's chart (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, n.d.-c).
240  8 · Cultural Considerations

     Cultural Competency and Transcultural Nursing

     All people have the freedom to express their cultural beliefs. Nurses realize that people speak, behave, and act in
     many different ways due to the influential role that culture plays in their lives and their view of the world. Cultural
     competency is the skill of applying evidence-based nursing in agreement with the cultural values, beliefs,
     worldview, and practices of clients to produce improved client outcomes.

     Culturally competent care requires nurses to combine their knowledge and skills with awareness, curiosity, and
     sensitivity about their clients' cultural beliefs. It takes motivation, time, and practice to develop cultural
     competence, and it will evolve throughout a nursing career. Nurses who accept and uphold the cultural values and
     beliefs of their clients are more likely to develop supportive and trusting relationships with their clients. In turn, this
     opens the way for optimal disease and injury prevention and leads toward positive health outcomes for all clients.

             LINK TO LEARNING

     This video shows a unique and inspiring discussion about becoming a culturally competent nurse
     (https://openstax.org/r/77culcomnurse) from nurse and professor Jana Lauderdale.

     The roots of providing culturally competent care are based on a concept developed by nurse and anthropologist, Dr.
     Madeleine Leininger, called transcultural nursing, which incorporates cultural beliefs and practices of individuals to
     help them maintain and regain health or to face death in a meaningful way. It forms the foundation of all culturally
     competent care. Dr. Leininger's theory of culture care diversity and universality is also known as the culture care
     theory (CCT). It provides the framework for transcultural nursing and the development and practice of culturally
     competent nursing care (McFarland & Wehbe-Alamah, 2019). Dr. Leininger states that health-care providers cannot
     offer effective care without considering the client's cultural background. The theory emphasizes the importance of
     understanding the cultural values, beliefs, and practices of clients in order to provide appropriate care. According to
     Leininger, as cited in McFarland & Wehbe-Alamah (2019), culture is a fundamental component of human life and
     influences an individual's perception of health, illness, and health care. Therefore, health-care providers must
     approach each client with cultural sensitivity and strive to deliver care that is respectful and tailored to the client's
     cultural needs.

     The culture care theory is an important framework for promoting culturally competent care and achieving health
     equity for all individuals. Using the culture care theory as a framework, nurses can guide research of discovery and
     translational research projects for evidenced-based nursing practice. Educational programs can develop nursing
     courses and curricula to prepare culturally competent nurses. Hospitals and medical facilities can use the
     framework to guide future culturally competent administrative and leadership policies and procedures.

     Factors Affecting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Nursing

     The American Nurses Association recognizes specific factors that negatively affect diversity, equity, and inclusion in
     nursing. Explicit bias in the form of discrimination due to gender identity, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or
     socioeconomic status negatively impacts the health status of various populations. Implicit bias affects the
     relationship between health-care providers and clients, and between health-care team members, as well as
     outcomes (Jolley & Peck, 2022). Awareness of one's biases is always the first step in combating them.

     Cultural Self-Awareness
     A person's understanding of their own culture and its impact on themselves is their cultural self-awareness.
     Understanding oneself is a crucial step in forming a broader understanding and acceptance of other cultures (Lu &
     Wan, 2018). It is important to note that cultural awareness is not a one-time activity, but an ongoing process that
     requires continuous learning and adaptation. Cultural self-awareness can help nurses understand what shapes their
     own values and beliefs and recognize their place in a larger multicultural society.

     The belief that one's culture (or race, ethnicity, or country) is better than and preferable to another's is called
     ethnocentrism. An example would be a nurse telling a client that conventional Western medical treatments are
     better than traditional healing remedies. Appropriate cultural self-awareness can help the nurse avoid
     ethnocentrism. Designing interventions that are relevant to and respectful of the client's culture is one way to avoid

ethnocentrism. Other ways to avoid ethnocentrism include avoiding making generalizations or stereotypes about
other cultures. Deal with cultural differences with an open mind and a willingness to learn and understand. Always
try to approach each client interaction with a sense of cultural humility and practice active listening.

Six Cultural Phenomena
There are other cultural considerations that can affect efforts to increase diversity and inclusion in nursing, which
Giger and Davidhizar identify in their transcultural assessment model (2002). The transcultural assessment model
developed as a way for nurses to assess and provide care for culturally diverse clients. This model states that each
individual is unique and should be assessed according to six cultural phenomena:

    · Communication: This includes the language, tone, and nonverbal cues used by the individual and the health-
        care provider. Communication styles can vary across cultures and can influence the effectiveness of health-
        care interactions.

    · Personal space: All communication occurs in the context of space. There are four distinct zones of
        interpersonal space: intimate, personal, social and consultative, and public (Figure 8.5) (Hall, 1966). This
        includes the physical and emotional distance between the individual and the health-care provider. Cultural
        norms around personal space and touch can vary across cultures.

    · Social organization: This includes the individual's cultural values and beliefs related to family, community, and
        social roles. Cultural expectations around family involvement in health-care decisions, for example, can vary
        across cultures. Another example is local, state, or government agencies that all share the same values,
        beliefs, and interests.

    · Time orientation: Time is an important aspect of interpersonal communication. This includes the individual's
        cultural beliefs and practices related to time, such as punctuality and the perception of time as linear or
        cyclical. For example, the past, present, and future have different meanings and value to different cultures.

    · Environmental control: This includes the individual's cultural beliefs and practices related to controlling their
        environment, such as beliefs around the causes of illness and how it is directly impacted by one's
        environment.

    · Biologic variations: This includes the individual's cultural beliefs and practices related to biology, such as
        beliefs around the causes of illness and the use of alternative therapies. Cultural beliefs around pain
        management and the use of medication can also vary across cultures.

FIGURE 8.5 There are four zones of interpersonal space, and cultural norms around how much space is acceptable varies across cultures.

     social conversation, but for others, a small personal space is appropriate when conversing with another. There are
     times when a nurse must enter a client's personal space, which can cause emotional distress for some clients. The
     nurse should always ask for permission before entering a client's personal space and explain why and what is about
     to happen.

     Clients may also be concerned about their modesty or being exposed. A client may deal with the violation of their
     space by removing themselves from the situation, pulling away, or closing their eyes. The nurse should recognize
     these cues for what they are, an expression of cultural preference, and allow the client to assume a position or
     distance that is comfortable for them.

     Similar to cultural influences on personal space, touch is also culturally determined. This has implications for nurses
     because it may be inappropriate for a male nurse to provide care for a female client and vice versa. In some
     cultures, it is also considered rude to touch a person's head without permission.

     8.4 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define important considerations related to providing equal, diverse, and inclusive nursing care
         · Identify factors that can prevent diversity, equity, and inclusion
         · Explain how barriers to communication affect diversity, equity, and inclusion

     Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) create an environment that encourages different ideas, cultures, backgrounds,
     and experiences. This type of environment allows nurses to provide more comprehensive and effective care to their
     clients. Diversity, equity, and inclusion foster a culture of mutual respect, understanding, and support, which can
     lead to improved client outcomes. DEI is at the organizational level and higher, while cultural competency works on
     an individual level. Additionally, diversity and inclusion can help to reduce health disparities, which can improve
     health-care access and quality for communities that are traditionally underserved. Ultimately, diversity and
     inclusion are critical components of successful nursing practice that can help to ensure that all clients receive the
     best possible care.

     Health Equity through Diversity and Inclusion

     In nursing, health equality means that nurses treat all clients as individuals, show respect for their personal
     choices and differences, and recognize their dignity and human rights. It assumes equal treatment and support. In
     contrast, health equity speaks to social justice and is when everyone has a fair opportunity to obtain optimal health
     (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2022a). Both equity and equality are important considerations
     when providing inclusive nursing care Figure 8.6.

fairness for all in society. The ANA states that this obligation guarantees not only basic rights (respect, human
dignity, autonomy, security, and safety), but also fairness in all operations of societal structures (2021). This
includes care being delivered with fairness, rightness, correctness, unbiasedness, and inclusiveness while being
based on well-founded reason and evidence.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention discuss diversity and inclusion as important factors in health equity
considerations. Diversity refers to the existence of societies, communities, or subcultures that differ substantially
from one another. Inclusion is the practice of creating an environment in which individuals of all backgrounds feel
respected, valued, and supported (CDC, 2022b). There are numerous factors that can prevent diversity, inclusion,
and justice. These can, in turn, create health disparities that limit access to care and worsen health outcomes for
certain groups.

Race/Ethnic Heritage
Race and ethnicity are both socially constructed ideas. There are no true scientifically or genetically distinct races or
ethnicities (Mersha & Beck, 2020). Nonetheless, race and ethnicity have an undeniable effect on health-care access
and outcomes. The belief that races are distinct from one another, and that there is a hierarchy to race, implying that
races are unequal is the concept of racism. As health-care providers, nurses have an obligation to recognize the
impact of racism on their clients and the communities they serve. In the United States, race and ethnic background
have long played a role in health disparities among different populations.

Most racial and ethnic minorities experience higher rates of chronic disease and premature death compared with
White populations; some underrepresented groups, such as Asian and Hispanic immigrants, experience lower rates
(Weinstein et al., 2017). American Indian, Alaska Native, and Black populations experience the highest infant
mortality rates, while Asian and Pacific Islanders experience the lowest (Figure 8.7). Black individuals are more
likely than White individuals to die prematurely from heart disease, and Black males are twice as likely as White
males to die prematurely from stroke.

FIGURE 8.7 This chart from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows infant mortality rates by race and ethnicity for the United
States and illustrates discrepancies between groups. (credit: "Infant Mortality Rates by Race and Ethnicity, 2019" by Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, Public Domain)

Implicit bias related to race and ethnicity has been repeatedly shown in research to negatively affect client care and
outcomes. Nurses should also be sensitive to the fact that individuals from certain ethnicities may be distrusting of
health-care professionals due to cultural history and other factors.

Spirituality and Religion
Throughout human history, spirituality, religion, and health have often gone hand in hand. In many healing
traditions, healers also serve as religious leaders (Figure 8.8). A person's religious beliefs may affect their diet, what
medications they will take, their views on physical and mental illness, and their approaches to death and dying.
244  8 · Cultural Considerations

     Many people consult and rely on their religious and spiritual beliefs when making medical decisions. For instance,
     Jehovah's Witnesses do not accept whole blood, plasma, and platelets because they believe that this might
     interfere with eternal salvation. A person's religious beliefs can affect their views on mental health care as well. For
     example, members of the Church of Scientology believe that modern psychology and psychiatric medicine are
     inhumane, cruel, and unscientific (McCall, 2006). They believe that modern mental health care robs an individual of
     their freedom and can even damage the brain, and that following certain practices within the Church are the only
     ways to improve one's mental well-being.

     FIGURE 8.8 Religion and health are closely intertwined for many people. (credit: "Guatemalan Clergymen Lead Sunday Mass Aboard USNS
     Comfort" by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Ethan J. Soto/Flickr, Public Domain)

     Nurses must be prepared to take clients' religious and spiritual preferences into account as an important part of the
     treatment plan (Swihart et al., 2022). A thorough cultural assessment should include information on a client's
     religious or spiritual beliefs that might affect their health behaviors and their care. Nurses must be aware of implicit
     biases and personal beliefs and be culturally aware to provide equitable and competent care. One tool that can
     assist in a thorough spiritual assessment is FICA. FICA is an acronym that stands for faith or beliefs, the importance
     of beliefs, the community supporting the individual and beliefs, and the way in which we can address care issues
     related to spirituality.

             LINK TO LEARNING

     The FICA Spiritual Assessment tool developed by Christina Puchalski, MD, in 1991, provides a framework
     (https://openstax.org/r/77FICA) that may be helpful for obtaining a spiritual history from a client.

     Age
     Older adults struggle with some limitations in their care related to their age. Studies have shown that health-care
     providers are more likely to assume that older clients' conditions, such as cognitive decline, are due to their age and
     to deny them certain treatments as compared with younger clients (Hughes et al., 2020). Older clients also tend to
     be undertreated for pain and depression (Hughes et al., 2020).

     Gender Identity and Sexual Orientation
     An individual's deeply held sense of their gender, which may or may not align with the sex assigned to them at birth
     is called gender identity. The term used to describe a person whose gender identity matches their sex assigned at
     birth is cisgender. To the extent that a person's gender identity does not conform with the sex assigned to them at
     birth, they may identify as Transgender or as gender nonbinary. Someone whose gender identity or expression
     differs from traditional cultural gender roles for one's sex assigned at birth is called Transgender. Transgender
     people, like cisgender people, may be sexually oriented toward males, females, both sexes, or neither sex. Gender

expression refers to a person's outward demonstration of gender in relation to societal norms, such as in style of
dress, hairstyle, or other mannerisms. Sharing pronouns as part of a basic introduction to a client can assist a
Transgender client to feel secure sharing their pronouns in a health-care setting. Asking a client for their pronoun
(he, she, they, ze, etc.) is considered part of a nursing assessment.

There is a strong body of research showing a history of gender bias in health care (Hughes et al., 2020). Providers
are more likely to believe that the health complaints of women result from emotional instead of physical causes
compared with men. There is also a demonstrated history of underdiagnosis and undertreatment of cardiovascular
disease in women when compared with men. Moreover, studies reveal that "Transgender people already experience
health inequities at a disparate rate compared to their cisgender peers, including increased rates of mental health
disorders, substance use disorders, sexual and physical violence, and sexually transmitted infections" (Walter-
McCabe & Chen, 2022, para 2).

A person's physical and emotional interest or desire for others is their sexual orientation. It exists on a continuum
and is manifested in one's self-identity and behaviors. The acronym LGBTQIA stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual,
Transgender, Queer or Questioning, Intersex, or Asexual in reference to sexual orientation. Historically, individuals
within the LGBTQIA+ community have experienced discrimination and prejudice from health-care providers and
avoided or delayed health care due to these negative experiences. Despite increased recognition of this group of
people in recent years, members of the LGBTQIA+ community continue to experience significant health disparities
(Walter-McCabe & Chen, 2022).

Disability
Disabilities can be present from birth or acquired later in life. They can be physical, cognitive, or mental health
related. Adults with disabilities are more likely than adults with no disabilities to report poor health, including higher
rates of obesity, diabetes, smoking, lack of physical activity, and cardiovascular disease. Adults with disabilities are
also more likely to live in poverty, and even those with health insurance are less likely than adults without
disabilities to seek care. Adults with disabilities also cite common stereotypes, bias, and beliefs among providers as
barriers to care (VanPuymbrouck et al., 2020). Examples include lack of appropriate equipment to transfer clients
with disabilities in doctor's offices, or a health-care provider's assumption that the client is unhealthy or fragile
simply because they are disabled.

Education Level
Differences in educational levels can affect how people access health-care services and understand health
information in order to make informed decisions. The higher a person's level of education, the higher their life
expectancy and the more likely they are to access preventative and screening services (Viinikainen et al., 2022).

Raghupathi and Raghupathi (2020) analyzed data from twenty-six countries over ten years and identified
connections between education and health. Their research proposed investments in education as investments in
population health. Raghupathi and Raghupathi found that parental education at the tertiary level (beyond high
school) was especially significant for infant and child health and overall life expectancy (2020). Heightened
awareness of individual health could result from focused promotional campaigns. These efforts could increase
school completion rates and employment skills and serve to reduce health disparities by promoting health
maintenance and illness prevention (Raghupathi & Raghupathi, 2020).

Physical Characteristics
Certain physical characteristics have the potential to create barriers to care. For example, clients who are deaf or
blind may need accommodations to ensure that communication is clear and accurate. To supplement spoken and
printed communication, American Sign Language interpreters can be sought for deaf clients. Educational materials
and consent forms printed in Braille can assist blind populations. Health equity and inclusion provides care for
everyone assuming basic equal support and resources, no matter what their physical characteristics are.

Socioeconomic Status
In the United States, socioeconomic status is a major determinant of health status. People who belong to low
socioeconomic groups--such as people who are homeless or people living in poverty--are more likely to report
higher rates of disease, such as heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and obesity (National Academies of Sciences,
2017). This is because they have fewer opportunities to seek early prevention. They also are lacking the resources
246  8 · Cultural Considerations

     to follow through with standard treatment plans. For instance, someone who is homeless is unable to perform clean
     dressing changes daily without adequate access to water. Socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals also have
     higher rates of infant mortality, substance misuse, and shorter life expectancies. Additionally, they may report
     avoiding care because they feel discrimination from health-care workers (Hughes et al., 2020).

     In 2021, the majority of Americans relied on privately purchased insurance for their health care. Most of this
     insurance is made available through employers. Individuals are also able to purchase health insurance through the
     federal Marketplace. The Marketplace mandates that all of their available plans cover both inpatient and outpatient
     mental health and substance use disorder treatment (HealthCare.gov, n.d.). About 35 percent of the population
     holds a public form of insurance in the form of Medicaid or Medicare. Medicare is for those who have been
     determined to need special care, such as older people or those who have disabilities. Medicare covers both
     inpatient and outpatient mental health services, although clients may still be responsible for deductibles, copays, or
     coinsurance. Medicaid is for those who need aid in receiving care, such as people who meet certain lower income
     guidelines. It is the top payer of mental health services in the United States (Medicaid.gov, n.d.).

     Veteran Status
     Military veterans often have complex needs due to physical and psychological trauma sustained during military
     service and socioeconomic issues that arise after discharge (Figure 8.9). Many veterans are eligible for health-care
     benefits through the Veterans Administration if they meet certain criteria, such as age or level of disability (Veterans
     Affairs, n.d.). The Veterans Administration also offers free health care to veterans who meet certain low-income
     guidelines. The Veterans Administration covers community-based care in non-VA facilities for individuals who meet
     certain criteria, including those who live in a place where no VA facilities are available. That said, many veterans still
     struggle with a lack of access to health-care benefits, sometimes based on residing in rural locations that do not
     have veteran-specific health-care facilities.

     Factors Preventing Sensitivity to Diversity

     Several factors related to a person's experiences, attitudes, and knowledge hinder sensitivity to diversity. One
     significant factor is a lack of exposure to diverse individuals and cultures. Limited exposure can lead to a lack of
     understanding and appreciation for diversity. Stereotyping and prejudice can also contribute to insensitivity;
     preconceived notions or stereotypes about certain groups can lead to discrimination and bias. Personal biases can

8.4 · Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion                                                                                    247

influence perceptions and attitudes toward different groups, leading to insensitivity. Additionally, a lack of education
or awareness about different cultures and backgrounds can lead to misunderstandings. Overcoming these barriers
requires ongoing education, open-mindedness, and a willingness to learn about and appreciate different cultures
and backgrounds. It also requires actively challenging one's biases and seeking out opportunities for exposure to
diversity.

Stereotyping
The assumption that a person has the attributes, traits, beliefs, and values of a cultural group simply because they
are a member of that group is called stereotyping. Engaging in stereotyping prevents the ability to identify people's
needs on an individual level. One common stereotype is the assumption that all older clients are forgetful or have
memory problems. This stereotype can lead to medical professionals overlooking or dismissing legitimate concerns
or symptoms of older clients, attributing them solely to age-related memory decline, which can, in turn, lead to
misdiagnosis or delayed treatment. Culturally equitable care extends beyond general knowledge of a cultural group
to knowledge of the individual themselves.

Cultural Imposition
The imposition of one's own values, beliefs, and practices upon another person or group is called cultural
imposition. It runs counter to cultural humility and can manifest in various ways. Examples include disregarding a
client's cultural practices, beliefs, and values when making medical decisions, or imposing Western medical
practices on non-Western cultures without consideration for their unique cultural beliefs and practices. For instance,
health-care providers may fail to consider a client's traditional healing practices or the role of family members in
health-care decisions, which can lead to a breakdown in communication and a lack of trust between clients and
health-care providers.

Cultural Blindness
The belief that all cultural groups are the same and share identical experiences is called cultural blindness
(Bhattacharya et al., 2019). Different cultural groups can have vastly different experiences just within the health-
care system. Cultural blindness might lead a nurse to conclude that all treatment services are adequate for all
clients, contributing to the continuation of policies that prevent diversity and inclusion. For example, a hospital may
carry copies of all of its consent forms in English and Spanish, but there is a large local Vietnamese population as
well, and the nurse can never find a Vietnamese consent form for these clients. This is a result of system-wide
cultural blindness. Once the nurse identifies the issue, they can escalate it and have the issue addressed by having
adequate Vietnamese-language consent forms available for the client population.

Culture Conflict
Tension or opposition between different cultures can result in culture conflict. Often, the dominant culture weakens
the cultural practices of the underrepresented group as a result (APA, n.d.). Culture conflict can arise in many ways,
such as when a client's cultural beliefs around illness and healing differ from those of the health-care provider, or
when a client's cultural practices conflict with medical protocols. For example, a client who refuses to receive a
blood transfusion due to religious beliefs may have conflict with the nurse who sees this treatment as medically
necessary.

Culture conflict can also arise when health-care providers make assumptions or judgments about clients based on
their cultural background, leading to biases and discrimination. This can result in disparities in health-care access
and outcomes for clients from diverse backgrounds. Nurses should approach such conflicts with cultural humility to
ensure they are resolved without damage to the nurse-client relationship.

Barriers to Communication Affecting Diversity and Inclusion

It is necessary to overcome communication barriers in order to maximize the clients' opportunities for best care.
According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (2020), for instance, about three out of one hundred
people in the United States have a hearing disability, and two out of one hundred have a visual disability to the
extent that they are blind or have trouble seeing even with corrective vision wear. Various strategies can help
improve the communication process for these clients.

For clients with hearing barriers, offer print materials, text telephones (TTYs), or videos with captioning. Sign
language interpreters use American Sign Language or Signed English; there are also oral and cued-speech
248  8 · Cultural Considerations

     interpreters who use articulation and gestures. When having conversations, make sure the television or other
     sources of background noise are silenced and the surrounding environment is free of distracting noise.

     For clients with sight barriers, make sure that the lighting is at their comfort level. Whenever possible, provide
     assistance in the form of audio recordings, large-print materials, and screen magnifiers. Text-to-speech or Braille
     output screen reading software is also available.

     According to recent data, 8 percent of the U.S. population has limited English proficiency (Haldar et al., 2023).
     Linguistically competent care aims to help these people understand their treatment. The Agency for Healthcare
     Research and Quality defines linguistic competence as "providing readily available, culturally appropriate oral and
     written language services to limited English proficiency (LEP) members through such means as bilingual/bicultural
     staff, trained medical interpreters, and qualified translators" (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2019,
     para 2).

     All educational materials, instructions, and consent forms should be offered in the client's preferred language. When
     caring for a client whose primary language is not English and they have a limited ability to speak, read, write, or
     understand the English language, seek the services of a trained medical interpreter. Health-care facilities are
     mandated by the Joint Commission to provide qualified medical interpreters. Use of a trained medical interpreter is
     linked to fewer communication errors, shorter hospital stays, reduced thirty-day readmission rates, and improved
     client satisfaction (Fidler, 2023).

     Refrain from asking a family member to act as an interpreter. The client may withhold sensitive information from
     them, or family members may possibly edit or change the information provided. Unfamiliarity with medical
     terminology can also cause misunderstanding and errors.

     Medical interpreters may be on-site or available by videoconferencing or telephone. When possible, obtain a
     medical interpreter of the same gender as the client to prevent potential embarrassment if a sensitive matter is
     being discussed. Some additional guidelines for working with a medical interpreter are to:

         · Allow extra time for the interview or conversation with the client.
         · Whenever possible, meet with the interpreter beforehand to provide background.
         · Document the name of the medical interpreter in the progress note.
         · Always face and address the client directly, using a normal tone of voice. Do not direct questions or

             conversation to the interpreter.
         · Speak in the first person (using "I").
         · Avoid using idioms, such as "Are you feeling under the weather today?" Avoid abbreviations, slang, jokes, and

             jargon.
         · Speak in short paragraphs or sentences. Ask only one question at a time. Allow sufficient time for the

             interpreter to finish interpreting before beginning another statement or topic.
         · Ask the client to repeat any instructions and explanations given to verify that they understood.

Summary

8.1 Understanding Cultural Differences

An individual's cultural background influences their beliefs, feelings, and attitudes toward health care. Their culture
informs how they view health and illness, how they view healthcare providers, and how receptive they are to
treatment plans. Culture also determines who receives care and the quality of their care. Certain cultures
experience higher rates of disease due to genetics or health disparities caused by environmental factors. Various
cultures have their own traditional healing practices and beliefs, and many people still use these practices either
alongside or in place of Western medicine. Nurses care for clients from different cultures with their own beliefs and
practices. It is important to be respectful of these individual differences and be aware of any implicit bias in order to
provide the best possible care.

8.2 Ethical Practice in Culture and Diversity

Accommodating different cultural practices begins with the practice of cultural humility. By seeking cultural
assistance from appropriate sources and practicing cultural negotiation, the nurse can demonstrate respect for
other cultures. Engaging in cultural diversity practices can range from one-on-one conversations with clients, to
researching written history, to actively participating in different cultural activities and experiences. Being responsive
to cultural diversity involves understanding cultural differences and being willing to overcome personal biases to
accommodate the cultural preferences of a client in order to provide the most culturally competent care.

8.3 Cultural Practice in Nursing

When providing care for clients from different cultural practices, it is necessary to perform a thorough cultural
assessment to gain information on client-specific details. The Transcultural Nursing Society developed the
Standards of Practice for Culturally Competent Nursing Care, which serves as universally applicable guidelines for
nurses in all aspects of culturally competent nursing care. Cultural competency is important because it has the
power to improve the quality of care and lead to better health outcomes for culturally diverse clients. Various factors
can affect diversity and inclusion in nursing, including the six cultural phenomena of communication, space, social
organization, time, environmental control, and biological variations. The best way to counteract this is to identify
biases and change practices going forward.

8.4 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

Important considerations related to providing equal, diverse, and inclusive nursing care include nursing knowledge
of health equity and health disparities. The nurse should be aware of possible disparities in care of client
populations and strive to foster a culture of mutual respect, understanding, and support, which can lead to improved
client outcomes. Factors that can prevent diversity and inclusion include stereotyping, cultural imposition, cultural
blindness, and culture conflict. Barriers to communication related to language, literacy, and accessibility for all
clients can negatively affect diversity and inclusion.

What Should the Nurse Do?

Maria, a thirty-year-old female, comes to the primary care clinic reporting persistent fatigue, headaches, and
difficulty sleeping. Maria reveals that she recently lost her job, which has added financial strain to her life. She
expresses a preference for alternative healing practices and mentions consulting a traditional healer in her
community for spiritual guidance. Maria has a history of hypertension and has been managing her blood pressure
with medication. She is generally healthy but notes increased stress levels recently. Maria prefers natural remedies
and has sought guidance from traditional healers in the past for spiritual and emotional well-being. Vital signs show
an elevated blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, a heart rate of 82 bpm, a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute,
and a temperature of 98.6°F (37°C).

    1. What cultural cues or verbal/nonverbal expressions from Maria might reveal her beliefs about health and
        illness? How can recognizing these cues help tailor the nursing approach to her cultural context?

    2. How can the nurse proactively address unconscious bias when interacting with Maria, considering her cultural
        background? What strategies can be employed to ensure culturally competent and unbiased care?

Dolores, a forty-five-year-old female, presents at the community health clinic for a routine checkup. She recently
immigrated from Mexico and speaks limited English. Dolores reports feeling fatigued and experiencing occasional
headaches. Her medical history includes hypertension and type 2 diabetes, both well-managed with medications.
During the assessment, her blood pressure is elevated (150/90 mmHg), and she exhibits signs of distress when
trying to communicate her symptoms in English.

    3. What immediate actions can be taken to address Dolores's elevated blood pressure and ensure her comfort in
        the health-care setting?

    4. What culturally sensitive strategies can be employed to improve communication with Dolores and gather a
        more accurate medical history?

Tan, a sixty-year-old Vietnamese male, presents at the hospital emergency department with complaints of severe

underwent abdominal surgery for a gastrointestinal issue. Vital signs reveal an elevated respiratory rate and
decreased oxygen saturation.

    5. What cultural cues did you observe in Tan's communication style, and how might these cues impact the
254 8 · References

        nursing care provided?
    6. How can you involve Tan's daughter in a way that respects cultural practices and enhances communication to

        ensure the provision of comprehensive care?

        shadow Muhammad. Muhammad has been an employee for over ten years and was awarded Nurse of the
        Year two years ago. Francine notices that with each client interaction, he educates the client on both
        conventional Western medical treatments and traditional healing remedies. Francine is very confused; she
        thought that Western medicine was superior to that of traditional healing practices. She decides to confront
        Muhammad.
        If you were Muhammad, how would you explain to Francine that her thought process is impacting diversity
        and inclusion?

Loretta, a seventy-year-old female, arrives at the outpatient clinic with complaints of persistent joint pain and
difficulty moving. Loretta has a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis and hypertension, well-controlled with
medications. During the assessment, she appears hesitant to share details about her symptoms and seems
uncomfortable. Vital signs are all within the normal range: blood pressure of 120/80mm Hg, heart rate of 80 beats
per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minutes, and a temperature of 98.8°F (37°C).

    9. How might cultural factors influence Loretta's communication style and her willingness to disclose
        information about her joint pain?

  10. What steps can be taken to foster an inclusive and culturally sensitive environment during the assessment
        and treatment of Loretta's joint pain?

  11. How can you modify your communication approach to address potential barriers and ensure Loretta feels
        comfortable sharing information about her symptoms?

Competency-Based Assessments

    1. Use various sources to research diverse cultural communities in your region. Note important cultural factors,
        such as language, race/ethnicity, and religion. Discuss how these cultural factors might impact the abilities of
        these diverse communities to access health care.

    2. Identify a diverse cultural event in your community in which you can actively participate, such as a meal,
        dance, or festival. Attend the event and write a journal entry about your experience. What did you learn about
        diversity at this event? Did it help you to identify any implicit biases? What lessons will you take with you as
        you begin your nursing practice?

    3. Have you ever experienced or witnessed an interaction where there was a lack of cultural competency? What
        factors caused the lack of cultural competency? Discuss how you can use your experiences to ensure better
        diversity and inclusion in nursing.

    4. Develop a ten-minute presentation on an alternative or complementary therapy.

CHAPTER OUTLINE
9.1 Death and Dying
9.2 Grief and Loss
9.3 Anger, Abuse, and Violence
INTRODUCTION Death and dying are integral aspects of the human experience, and for health-care professionals,
understanding and effectively responding to the end-of-life journey is paramount. Nurses are pivotal in providing
compassionate care, support, and comfort to clients and their families during this sensitive time. Grieving
individuals may experience social isolation, difficulty maintaining relationships, and hurdles to resuming daily
activities. Different cultures and societies have unique beliefs, customs, and rituals surrounding death. In some
instances, death-related topics may be stigmatized, leading to a lack of open discussion and support for those
experiencing loss. Health-care providers must be sensitive to these diverse perspectives and accommodate
individual and family preferences during the end-of-life journey.
Likewise, grief, anger, and aggression are universal human experiences, deeply ingrained within individuals'
biological and psychological makeup. As survival mechanisms, they evolved to protect us from threats and ensure
our existence. When misdirected or poorly managed, however, these emotions can lead to destructive outcomes,
causing harm to oneself and others.

     9.1 Death and Dying

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe social and legal concerns associated with death and dying
         · Discuss emotional, spiritual, and practical concerns associated with death and dying
         · Discuss cultural considerations related to death and dying

     Understanding the intricacies of human emotions and experiences is as crucial as any medical procedure or
     treatment plan. As caregivers, nurses navigate a variety of human emotions, encountering profound challenges that
     test not just their medical expertise but also their empathy and understanding. A profound and inevitable aspect of
     the human experience is the concept of death and dying. Nurses play a pivotal role in supporting clients and families
     through this deeply personal and challenging phase. According to Kübler-Ross's theory, the stages of grief--denial,
     anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance--guide individuals through the emotional journey surrounding death
     (Valliani & Mughal, 2022). Understanding these stages allows nurses to provide holistic care and support to clients
     and their loved ones during this delicate transition.

     Social and Legal Concerns Associated with Death and Dying

     Death and dying profoundly impact individuals, families, and communities because death is not solely a biological
     event but also a social and cultural phenomenon. Losing a loved one triggers intense grief reactions, which can have
     social implications. Death often carries societal stigmas and taboos, leading to varying degrees of discomfort or
     avoidance in discussing this inevitable facet of life (Dimitrov et al., 2022). Certain circumstances involving
     death--physician-assisted dying, abortion, and suicide--bring with them particular social and legal concerns of
     which nurses should be aware.

     Generally, nurses play a pivotal role in ensuring compassionate care and support throughout any death and dying
     process:

         · Client advocacy and support: Nurses serve as advocates for clients navigating end-of-life decisions, offering
             empathetic guidance and support while respecting individual autonomy. They facilitate informed discussions,
             ensuring clients comprehend their options and rights and client wishes related to dying such as whether they
             wish to be resuscitated or not.

         · Ethical guidance and counseling: Nurses provide counseling to clients, families, and colleagues, fostering
             understanding of the moral, legal, and emotional implications surrounding death.

         · Collaborative care coordination: Nurses serve as a liaison between clients, families, physicians, and support
             services, ensuring coordinated care aligned with the client's wishes and needs.

         · Compassionate end-of-life care: Nurses offer compassionate care to clients, focusing on pain management,
             emotional support, and dignified end-of-life experiences. A focus on palliative care ensures comfort and
             quality of life until the final moments (Demedts et al., 2023).

     Physician-Assisted Dying
     Intentionally ending a life to prevent further pain and suffering is considered assisted dying. Most people are
     familiar with the concept of euthanasia, which is when someone other than the individual aids the person's dying
     through the administration of medication at the request of the individual (ANA, 2019). Euthanasia is illegal in the
     United States. It should not be confused with medical aid in dying. Physician-assisted, or medical aid in dying, is
     intentional assistance provided by a physician to enable an individual to end their own life by furnishing drugs for
     self-administration, always at the voluntary and competent request of the individual involved (Fontalis et al., 2018).

     Physician-assisted dying is an emotionally charged and complex issue, and nurses face critical moral, legal, and
     ethical considerations. The laws on assisted dying vary globally, with only a few countries recognizing its legality
     (Emanuel et al., 2016). In the United States, it is legal in eleven states: California, Colorado, District of Columbia,
     Hawaii, Montana, Maine, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington. An example of how legislation
     is applied is the Oregon Death with Dignity Act, permitting dying Oregonians to voluntarily kill themselves by taking
     physician-prescribed lethal medications. This law has sparked debates on ethical, legal, and moral grounds, serving
     as a catalyst for discussions about end-of-life care, client autonomy, and health-care provider roles in assisted
     dying. It has influenced similar legislation in other states and countries, contributing to ongoing discussions and

initiatives regarding end-of-life choices and physician-assisted dying (Oregon Health Authority, 2021). Under this
act, nurses serve as primary educators, providing comprehensive information about end-of-life care options,
ensuring clients possess informed decision-making capabilities. Nurses clarify procedural intricacies, explaining
eligibility criteria and requirements, guiding clients through the process, and addressing inquiries to facilitate well-
informed choices. In assessing client eligibility, they aid in documenting and communicating clients' preferences,
while also advocating for client autonomy, ensuring that their wishes are effectively communicated within the
health-care team. Furthermore, nurses extend emotional support to both clients and families, offering compassion
during decision-making and throughout the end-of-life journey (Oregon Nurses Association, 2015). Nurses must
have knowledge of the existing legal framework in their location and adhere strictly to it to avoid legal repercussions
(Bellon et al., 2022). According to the ANA position statement (2019), nurses are ethically prohibited from actively
being involved in medical aid in dying, other than providing support to their clients.

Nurses need to be aware of and sensitive to the ethics of assisted death as well. Assisted death raises fundamental
ethical issues, such as respect for autonomy, the sanctity of life, and harm prevention. Nurses should carefully
reflect upon and navigate these ideas, considering the individual client's wishes and the nurse's values (Bellon et al.,
2022). No matter the laws or ethical considerations, effective communication is critical. Nurses should be able to
engage in open, sensitive, and respectful discussions about physician-assisted dying with clients and their families.
They should also communicate effectively with other health-care professionals to ensure coordinated care.

Abortion
As health-care professionals, it is crucial to explore and understand the complexities surrounding abortion to
provide compassionate and nonjudgmental care to individuals facing this decision. According to the American
Nurses Association (ANA), nurses have a professional and ethical obligation to respect the autonomy and dignity of
clients and honor their right to make informed decisions about their reproductive health. The ANA emphasizes the
importance of providing unbiased information, support, and access to safe and legal reproductive health-care
services, including abortion (American Nurses Association, 2015).

Health-care professionals should approach the topic of abortion with sensitivity and respect, acknowledging the
diverse perspectives and beliefs held by individuals, communities, and health-care professionals. Developing a
comprehensive understanding of abortion empowers nursing professionals to deliver client-centered care, ensuring
access to comprehensive reproductive health care, and supporting individuals in making informed decisions about
their reproductive health (Schooley & Kratovil, 2023). When supporting individuals navigating this experience, it is
crucial for the nurse to acknowledge the multifaceted nature of emotions involved, including grief. For instance,
women's emotional responses postabortion can vary widely. Some may experience relief, while others might
undergo grief, sadness, or a sense of loss (Reardon, 2018). Additionally, research suggests that health-care
professionals' empathy and understanding play a vital role in supporting individuals dealing with abortion-related
emotions (McLean et al., 2023). Techniques like active listening and creating a safe, nonjudgmental environment
can aid in providing compassionate care (Tennant & Toney-Butler, 2022).

Suicide
Suicide is a major public health concern, and health-care professionals, including nurses, play a critical role in its
prevention. Nurses must understand the importance of effective communication, active listening, and therapeutic
relationships in suicide prevention. The collaborative efforts of health-care professionals, clients, and their support
networks are essential in creating a safety net of support and identifying appropriate interventions (World Health
Organization, 2014).

The ethical considerations surrounding suicide require health-care providers to balance autonomy, beneficence, and
nonmaleficence. Respecting a person's autonomy means acknowledging their right to make decisions about their
own life, while beneficence and nonmaleficence call for actions to prevent harm and promote well-being (Varkey,
2021). Furthermore, nurses must recognize the impact of their attitudes, biases, and stigma on the care they
provide to individuals at risk of suicide. Developing a nonjudgmental and empathetic approach is crucial in
establishing trust and promoting open discussions about suicidal ideation or behaviors (Saini et al., 2020).

Research underscores the importance of understanding the social determinants of suicide, emphasizing factors
such as socioeconomic status, social support, and access to mental health services. Nurses, through their client
interactions, can assess and address these determinants by advocating for improved access to mental health
262  9 · Social and Emotional Concerns

     resources and facilitating social support networks (Robertson et al., 2022).

     Nurses are also involved in the aftermath of suicide, providing support to bereaved families and communities,
     offering counseling services, and helping individuals navigate the complex emotions associated with loss
     (Andriessen et al., 2019). Suicide is discussed in more detail in Chapter 16 Mood Disorders and Suicide.

     Emotional, Spiritual, and Practical Concerns Associated with Death and Dying

     Emotional concerns associated with death and dying encompass various psychological and interpersonal challenges
     for both clients and health-care professionals. Understanding and addressing these emotional concerns is important
     for providing holistic and compassionate care during the end-of-life journey. Likewise, research by Kostka et al.
     (2021) highlights the range of emotions nurses may encounter, including sadness, grief, empathy, and sometimes
     even relief or a sense of accomplishment in providing comfort during a client's end-of-life journey. Nurses often form
     strong bonds with clients and their families, which can intensify these emotions.

     Furthermore, the Kübler-Ross model of the five stages of grief--denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and
     acceptance (Valliani & Mughal, 2022)--remains a foundational framework to understand not only the emotions
     experienced by dying clients and their families, but also those encountered by health-care providers, including
     nurses, as they navigate these challenging situations. Effective coping strategies for nurses are key, such as
     reflective practices, seeking peer support, and utilizing counseling services (Abdul-Mumin et al., 2023).

     Nurses should cultivate empathy, active listening, and nonjudgmental attitudes to create a safe and supportive
     environment for clients and their families (Kim et al., 2020b). Open and honest communication fosters emotional
     connection, promotes understanding, and facilitates discussions about end-of-life wishes and concerns.

             PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

     Self-Care for the Nurse

     Self-care practices in nursing encompass a spectrum beyond physical well-being, delving into the psychosocial
     aspects crucial for holistic health maintenance. As caregivers, nurses navigate emotionally demanding situations,
     underscoring the necessity for robust self-care strategies. Understanding the interplay between psychological and
     social components is pivotal in fostering self-care resilience within the nursing profession (Wang et al., 2022b). The
     areas where they intersect include the following:

         · Emotional intelligence: Nurses harness emotional intelligence to navigate stressors, foster empathy, and
             maintain professional boundaries. By recognizing and regulating emotions, nurses cultivate resilience amid
             high-pressure environments (Aghajani Inche Kikanloo et al., 2019).

         · Coping mechanisms: Utilizing effective coping mechanisms, such as mindfulness practices or reflective
             journaling, empowers nurses to process emotions and mitigate burnout (Malik & Annabi, 2022).

         · Social support networks: Building support networks within the nursing community aids in sharing experiences,
             seeking guidance, and nurturing a sense of belonging (Pereira et al., 2021).

         · Work-life balance: Striking a balance between professional commitments and personal life serves as a
             protective factor against burnout and enhances overall well-being (Putri et al., 2023).

     Caring for the Nurses' Needs
     Incorporating psychosocial elements into self-care paradigms is essential for nurses. Addressing psychological
     well-being and nurturing supportive social structures not only fortifies individual resilience, but also cultivates a
     healthier work environment conducive to optimal client care.

     Effective communication skills are essential in addressing emotional concerns related to death and dying.

     Furthermore, self-reflection is important for nurses to recognize and manage their emotional reactions to death and
     dying. Engaging in reflective practices, such as journaling or debriefing with mentors or peers, can help nurses
     process emotions, gain insights, and promote personal growth. After all, providing care to clients at the end of life
     can evoke strong emotions and potential burnout. Engaging in self-care practices can help nurses process their
     feelings and maintain their mental and emotional well-being (Hussain, 2021).

Caring for Clients' Emotional Needs
Mental and emotional needs are significant in caring for individuals and families facing death and dying. Recognizing
and addressing these needs is crucial for nurses to provide holistic, client-centered care during this challenging
period. One of the primary mental and emotional needs is psychological support. Clients and their families may
experience a wide range of emotions, as referenced earlier, such as fear, anxiety, sadness, anger, and confusion.
Nurses should cultivate effective communication and active listening skills to provide a safe and empathetic
environment for individuals to express their emotions (Anderson et al., 2019). Offering emotional support,
validation, and counseling services can help individuals navigate their feelings and cope with the challenges
associated with end-of-life care.

Clients and families often have questions and concerns about the dying process, treatment options, and what to
expect. Nurses can contribute to meeting these needs by providing clear and accurate information, discussing
prognoses, and involving clients and families in care planning (Heyland et al., 2013). Equipping individuals with
knowledge can help reduce anxiety and promote a sense of control and understanding.

Also helpful for addressing client emotional concerns is maintaining a peaceful and soothing environment. This
includes controlling noise levels, providing appropriate lighting, and creating a calm atmosphere to facilitate
relaxation (Zulueta Egea et al., 2022). Supporting the client's preferred spiritual or cultural practices can improve
their physical comfort. By recognizing and addressing the mental and emotional needs related to death and dying,
nurses can provide compassionate, holistic care for clients and their families.

Spiritual Needs
Spiritual support is also important. Many individuals find comfort and solace in their spiritual or religious beliefs.
Nurses should be sensitive to diverse spiritual and cultural practices and, when appropriate, facilitate access to
spiritual or religious leaders for guidance (Zare et al., 2019). Creating an environment that respects and supports
the spiritual needs of clients and their families can contribute to their overall well-being, coping, and sense of peace.

One of the key spiritual needs is the need for meaning and purpose. Clients may question the meaning of their lives,
their values, and the significance of their experiences. Nurses can engage in open and compassionate conversations
to explore these existential concerns, helping individuals use their spirituality to find purpose and meaning in their
lives, even in the face of mortality (Zare et al., 2019).

Supporting religious and cultural practices is another important spiritual need. Many individuals find comfort and
draw strength from their religious or cultural beliefs and rituals and involvement with a spiritual leader, such as a
priest, pastor, rabbi, or imam. Nurses should be knowledgeable about diverse spiritual practices and willing to
facilitate access to spiritual leaders, prayer, or religious texts as requested by clients and their families (Puchalski et
al., 2014).

Maintaining hope is also a significant spiritual need. Hope can take various forms, such as physical healing, a
peaceful death, or hope for reunification with loved ones. Nurses should foster an environment that nurtures and
supports hope, allowing individuals to express their desires and aspirations (Puchalski et al., 2014). Encouraging
clients and families to identify and focus on what brings them hope can contribute to their spiritual well-being.

Nurses should be aware of their own spiritual beliefs and biases and separate them from their care. Maintaining a
nonjudgmental and inclusive attitude toward diverse spiritual perspectives is essential in meeting the spiritual
needs of clients. Respecting and supporting individual beliefs, regardless of personal agreement, is crucial in
providing client-centered care (de Brito Sena et al., 2021).

Practical Nursing Responsibilities in Death and Dying
Nurses also have a practical role to play in managing death and dying. One of the most critical responsibilities is
effective communication. Nurses must be able to relay information concisely and compassionately to the dying
client, their families, and the rest of the health-care team (Dionne-Odom et al., 2019). They should also be skilled at
facilitating discussions about end-of-life decisions, including advanced care planning and do-not-resuscitate orders.

Pain and symptom management is another task. Nurses must help administer appropriate pain relief, monitor for
adverse effects, and adjust treatments based on a client's changing needs and preferences (Sinha et al., 2023).
Nurses serve as advocates, educators, and compassionate caregivers in addressing the fear of pain and concerns
about excessive pain medication in end-of-life care. Their role extends beyond administering medications,
264  9 · Social and Emotional Concerns

     encompassing holistic care, empathy, and effective communication to ensure clients' comfort and dignity during this
     critical phase (Twycross, 2019). Lastly, nurses often oversee postmortem care, which includes preparing the body
     for viewing, arranging for transport, completing the necessary documentation, and providing emotional support to
     grieving family members (Wang et al., 2021).

     Death and Dying Cultural Considerations

     When a nurse demonstrates understanding of and respect toward a client's cultural background and beliefs, their
     end-of-life care can be more effective and compassionate (Six et al., 2023). Some cultures may have specific
     practices and rituals associated with dying and death. These can range from wanting family members present at the
     time of death to specific customs around handling the body post death (Givler et al., 2023). Understanding these
     practices can assist nurses in providing culturally competent care and promoting client and family comfort and
     dignity in death. Additionally, conversations around advance care planning and the process of dying can vary widely
     between cultures. For example, in some Asian cultures, discussing death is considered taboo (Givler et al., 2023).
     Conversely, many Western cultures advocate for open discussions about death and end-of-life care planning.

     Nurses should be aware of these differences and approach the topic sensitively, engaging family members, cultural
     liaisons, or translators when necessary. Education, communication, and empathy are fundamental for nurses to
     respect clients' cultural views on death, enhance their well-being, and fulfill their wishes (Busolo & Woodgate,
     2015). The following cultural group examples are generalizations and may not apply to every individual.

     Black Americans
     For Black Americans, cultural considerations can significantly shape the experience of death, dying, and
     bereavement. Historically, Black culture values strong family connections and spiritual beliefs, often influencing
     end-of-life care perceptions (Givler et al., 2023). For many Black Americans, spirituality plays a critical role in coping
     with death and dying. They can rely heavily on faith, prayer, and the church community for support during illness or
     death (Collins et al., 2018). Nurses must understand the significance of these spiritual beliefs and respect their role
     in end-of-life decisions and coping mechanisms.

     Additionally, Black Americans traditionally have a strong sense of community, which extends to the family's
     involvement in health-care decisions. This collective decision-making process includes the immediate family,
     extended kin, and close friends. Therefore, health-care professionals must incorporate these family dynamics into
     care planning (Givler et al., 2023).

     Furthermore, research suggests that Black Americans often prefer more aggressive treatment measures at the end-
     of-life compared with other groups (Orlovic et al., 2018). The preference for aggressive measures may be related to
     the historic mistrust of health-care providers and the legacy of disparate care experienced by Black Americans. This
     mistrust is deeply rooted in historical injustices and systemic biases, such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, that have
     significantly impacted health-care access and outcomes (Hostetter & Klein, 2021). In the Tuskegee Syphilis Study,
     researchers studied the effects of syphilis on Black men without collecting informed consent or offering treatment
     (CDC, 2022). Nurses should consider this while discussing end-of-life care options, ensuring they understand and
     respect the client's wishes. To provide culturally competent care to Black clients at the end of life, nurses need to
     recognize the role of spirituality, value the collaborative decision-making process, and respect the preference for
     aggressive treatment.

     American Indians/Alaska Natives
     Understanding and respecting the cultural beliefs and practices of American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN)
     surrounding death and dying is essential for health-care providers. Cultural beliefs and traditions in these
     communities are often influenced by a deep respect for the natural world and spiritual connections with ancestors
     and the afterlife (Colclough & Brown, 2014).

     Many AI/AN communities perceive death as a part of the natural life cycle rather than an ending. This view can
     influence decisions regarding end-of-life care, where a focus may be on maintaining balance and harmony with the
     natural and spiritual world rather than prolonging life at all costs (Colclough & Brown, 2014).

     Spiritual practices and rituals are essential components of the death and dying process in many AI/AN cultures.
     Ceremonies often involve the entire community, including prayer, singing, and using sacred items, such as eagle
     feathers or tobacco. Health-care providers should respect and accommodate these practices whenever possible

9.1 · Death and Dying                                                                                                    265

(Isaacson & Lynch, 2018).

Family and community connections are highly valued in AI/AN cultures. In end-of-life care decisions, the client's
family and community often play significant roles (Dennis & Washington, 2016). Nurses need to understand this
communal approach to health-care decision-making and include family and community members in discussions
when appropriate.

It is important to remember that there is significant diversity among the AI/AN community. Each tribe or community
has unique cultural beliefs, traditions, and practices surrounding death and dying. Therefore, nurses should not
assume that all AI/AN clients share the same beliefs or preferences but should instead seek to understand the
specific cultural context of each client.

Asian Americans
Asian Americans encompass diverse ethnic groups with unique cultures, languages, and beliefs. Therefore, attitudes
toward death, dying, and end-of-life care can vary greatly among Asian American communities. Certain cultural
values and practices are often shared, however, and they do influence how individuals and families approach end-
of-life decisions (Lee, 2009). Respect for one's parents, elders, and ancestors and family cohesion are fundamental
concepts in many Asian cultures. These values often translate into collective decision-making processes for health-
care decisions, including end-of-life care. Therefore, involving family members in discussions around the terminal
prognosis and treatment decisions is crucial to culturally appropriate care (Lee, 2009).

Many Asian cultures emphasize respect for elders, which might influence decisions about disclosing terminal
prognoses. Directly telling a client about a terminal prognosis can sometimes be seen as disrespectful or causing
unnecessary distress, and thus, family members often prefer to receive the information first (La et al., 2021) and
then determine if and how to relay that information to the person.

Spirituality and religion, such as Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, and Taoism, play a
significant role in shaping views on death and dying among Asian American communities. For instance, beliefs in
karma, reincarnation, or the afterlife can affect preferences for end-of-life care, mourning rituals, and funeral
arrangements (Lee et al., 2018).

Health-care providers should also be aware of potential language barriers and the need for accurate interpretation
services when discussing end-of-life care with Asian American clients and their families (Lee, 2009). Overall, nurses
providing care for Asian American clients near the end of life should appreciate the significance of family decision-
making, consider cultural attitudes toward disclosing terminal prognoses, respect spiritual and religious beliefs, and
acknowledge the importance of language-accessible services. Following is a discussion of three groups of Asian
Americans that have specific practices regarding death and dying.

Filipino Americans
Filipino Americans possess unique beliefs and practices surrounding death and dying stemming from their rich
blend of indigenous, Spanish, and American influences. Appreciating these cultural nuances is critical in providing
culturally competent end-of-life care. Family plays a central role in the lives of Filipino Americans, and this extends
to health-care decisions. Many place a high value on kapwa (shared identity), emphasizing interconnectedness
among family members. Consequently, decisions regarding end-of-life care often involve the entire family
(Constante, 2022).

Spirituality, influenced predominantly by Catholicism due to Spanish colonization, profoundly impacts Filipino
Americans' perspectives on death and dying. Many may find solace in prayer and religious rituals and prefer
receiving sacraments, such as the Anointing of the Sick, during end-of-life care (Lagman et al., 2014). Moreover,
Filipino Americans may value pag-aaruga, or caring, expressed through a high level of physical care and presence by
family members at the bedside of a dying loved one. This cultural practice reflects their commitment and love for
their family (David & Okazaki, 2006).

In Filipino culture, direct communication about death can be considered disrespectful or distressing. Health-care
providers may need to approach these conversations carefully, considering the client's and family's comfort with
discussing death openly (Givler et al., 2023).

Language barriers can also be a concern, especially for older Filipino Americans. Providers should ensure the
266  9 · Social and Emotional Concerns

     availability of appropriate interpretation services to facilitate clear and respectful communication (Lagman et al.,
     2014).

     Japanese Americans
     Japanese Americans have unique beliefs and traditions surrounding death and dying rooted in their Japanese
     heritage and experiences in the United States. Understanding these cultural nuances can improve end-of-life care
     for Japanese American clients (Matsumura et al., 2002). Collective decision-making is common in many Japanese
     American families. Maintaining familial unity and avoiding conflict are often emphasized in line with the cultural
     concept of wa, or harmony. End-of-life care discussions may involve the client and their family members, but as
     Japanese Americans become more Americanized, they may want more autonomy in their own decisions (Matsui,
     2009).

     Spirituality, particularly in the form of Buddhism, Shintoism, and Christianity, shapes perspectives on death and
     dying in the Japanese American community. Certain rituals, like chanting or prayer, may be important for some
     families. In addition, many Japanese Americans believe in continuing a spiritual relationship with their deceased
     loved ones, which is honored through practices like maintaining a family altar (Suzuki, 2012).

     Communication around death can be indirect in Japanese culture, guided by the concept of honne (true feelings)
     and tatemae (public facade). This might influence disclosure and receipt of information about prognosis and end-of-
     life (Matsumura et al., 2002). Health-care providers also must be mindful of potential language barriers.

     Vietnamese Americans
     Vietnamese Americans also have unique cultural practices and beliefs surrounding death and dying, rooted in their
     Vietnamese heritage, and influenced by their experiences in the United States. Culturally sensitive health-care
     providers, including nurses, can enhance the quality of end-of-life care for Vietnamese American clients by
     understanding these cultural nuances (Tran et al., 2019).

     The Vietnamese culture places a high value on the family unit. As a result, decisions about end-of-life care often
     involve collective decision-making, with family members playing key roles in discussing options and making final
     decisions (Tran et al., 2019). Spiritual beliefs are fundamental to understanding death and dying among Vietnamese
     Americans. These beliefs often incorporate a mix of Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, and ancestor veneration, all
     of which can influence preferences for end-of-life care, including pain management, life-prolonging interventions,
     and funeral rites (Tran et al., 2019).

     Buddhism's influence on end-of-life care emphasizes alleviating suffering and allowing the client to achieve a
     peaceful transition (Tran et al., 2019). Clients may prefer noninvasive treatments or palliative care to manage pain
     while maintaining mental clarity for spiritual contemplation. Funeral rites often involve rituals honoring the
     deceased, such as chanting or meditation, promoting a tranquil passage to the afterlife and comforting the bereaved
     (Kalra et al., 2018). Confucianism's emphasis on family and societal harmony influences end-of-life preferences.
     Respect for elders and maintaining familial harmony guide decisions on care. Funeral rites emphasize honoring
     ancestors, with rituals focusing on proper ceremonies to ensure a peaceful afterlife transition (Badanta et al., 2022).
     Taoism's approach to end-of-life care centers on harmony with nature and acceptance of the natural cycle of life and
     death. Funeral rites might include simplicity, embracing the natural order, and rituals to facilitate the departed soul's
     journey into the Tao, fostering peace and harmony (International End-of-Life Doula Association, 2017).

     Communication about terminal illness and death is often indirect in Vietnamese culture because discussing death
     may be perceived as disrespectful or as bringing bad luck. Health-care providers should consider this cultural
     sensitivity when discussing prognosis and treatment options (Givler et al., 2023). Potential language barriers also
     exist, especially among older Vietnamese Americans with limited English proficiency.

     Jewish Americans
     Jewish Americans have unique cultural considerations about death and dying, rooted deeply in their religious
     traditions and beliefs. Within the Jewish culture, there are diverse beliefs and rituals (JCFS Chicago, n.d.), but in
     general, the approach toward the end of life is one of acceptance and reverence, where the dying process is seen as
     a natural part of life. There is a belief in the sanctity of life until the very end, emphasizing the importance of quality
     of life. Medical treatments that prolong life are encouraged, but extraordinary measures to prolong life without
     meaningful recovery are generally discouraged, highlighting the value placed on the dignity and autonomy of the

individual (Rosenberg et al., 2020).

The process of death in Jewish culture involves several rituals. Upon death, it is customary for the eyes and mouth
of the deceased to be closed, the body covered, and a candle lit near the body, symbolizing the soul's divine spark
(Popovsky, 2007). The burial traditionally occurs as quickly as possible, usually within forty-eight hours of death.
Practices, such as embalming and cremation, do not take place because of the belief in the sanctity and respect of
the body. After the funeral, family and friends observe a seven-day mourning period, known as shiva, allowing for
grief and remembrance (Rosenberg et al., 2020).

Mexican Americans
Death and dying hold significant cultural and religious importance for Mexican Americans. According to Mexican
cultural tradition, death is perceived as a natural phase in life's continuum. It is not considered an end but a part of a
cycle of life and rebirth, influenced by the belief system and the dominant religion of Catholicism (Altamirano,
2018).

One significant aspect of death in Mexican American culture is the commitment to familial responsibilities and the
idea of buen muerte (good death), which emphasizes dying at home surrounded by family (Ko et al., 2013). This
reflects the strong cultural importance of family bonds and the collective approach to life and death. Many Mexican
Americans uphold the Catholic belief in an afterlife, making spiritual care important at the end of life. Spiritual rituals
often take place and provide comfort and peace.

Mexican Americans traditionally celebrate Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead). This multiday holiday focuses on
gatherings to pray for and remember friends and family members who have died (Altamirano, 2018). Health-care
professionals must understand these unique cultural considerations to provide culturally competent, sensitive, and
appropriate end-of-life care to Mexican American clients and their families.

        REAL RN STORIES

Nurse: Sarah
Years in Practice: Seven
Clinical Setting: Senior care facility
Geographic Location: Ohio

Sarah, a seasoned nurse, was assigned to care for Mrs. Chen, an older Chinese female nearing the end of her life.
Mrs. Chen's family filled the room with the aroma of incense and brought offerings of her favorite foods. Initially,
Sarah was uncertain how to navigate these cultural practices within the hospital setting. However, guided by her
past experiences and knowledge, she understood the significance of these rituals in Chinese culture.

Sarah approached Mrs. Chen's family with respect and curiosity, eager to learn about their traditions. Through a
translator, she discovered that the family believed in maintaining a connection with the departed through offerings.
Sarah coordinated with the hospital staff to accommodate these practices while ensuring client safety.

As Mrs. Chen's condition worsened, her family expressed the importance of maintaining a peaceful environment.
They requested to perform a brief ceremony involving prayers and chants. Sarah collaborated with the hospital
chaplain to create a serene space within the facility for this ritual.

Throughout Mrs. Chen's final days, Sarah and the health-care team not only tended to her physical needs but also
respected and integrated the family's cultural beliefs. They arranged for a quiet corner where the family could light
incense, allowing Mrs. Chen's family to continue their customs while maintaining hospital regulations.

When Mrs. Chen passed away, Sarah witnessed the family's gratitude for the compassionate care that honored their
cultural practices. The family expressed how comforting it was to have their beliefs acknowledged and respected
during this difficult time. Reflecting on this experience, Sarah understood the profound impact of cultural
competence in end-of-life care. She realized that embracing and accommodating diverse spiritual beliefs not only
provided comfort to the family, but also enriched the holistic care provided by the health-care team (Victorian
Agency for Health Information, 2016).

     9.2 Grief and Loss

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Discuss social factors that influence grief and loss responses relating to the five stages of grief
         · Discover the physical, social, and spiritual impacts of grief and loss
         · Describe the impact of grief and loss on the nurse

     Grief and loss are universal human experiences. As inevitable as they are challenging, these moments can shape
     individuals profoundly and permanently, influencing emotions, thoughts, behaviors, relationships, and even views of
     the world. The natural emotional response to loss, which is often most powerful when an individual loses someone
     or something deeply important to them, is called grief. This could include the death of a loved one, the ending of a
     significant relationship, or the loss of physical or mental health, among many other possibilities. Grief is complex,
     deeply personal, and can manifest differently for everyone, defying simple definitions or timelines. It can include a
     range of emotions, such as sadness, anger, confusion, guilt, and fear, and can also evoke a host of physical
     symptoms.

     Related to grief, loss is not just to what has been taken away, but also to the secondary losses that might follow.
     These might include the loss of identity, routine, security, or future plans. Although intrinsically tied to grief, it has its
     unique complexities. A significant loss can change a person's life trajectory and necessitate navigating a new,
     unfamiliar reality.

     Understanding grief and loss involves many perspectives, from the psychological processes to the social and
     cultural contexts shaping how an individual mourns. It means acknowledging the less recognized or understood
     types of grief, such as anticipatory, complicated, and disenfranchised. The following section on grief and loss aims to
     provide a compassionate, comprehensive exploration of grief and loss for both clients and nurses.

     Social Factors and Processes That Influence Grief and Loss

     Social factors play a role in how individuals experience and navigate grief and loss. Cultural norms and traditions,
     societal expectations, and social support can significantly shape the grieving process. For instance, societies often
     have prescribed "grieving rules" that dictate who, how, and when people should grieve (Dayes et al., 2023). These
     norms can influence the legitimacy of one's grief and can lead to disenfranchised grief, a type of grief that is not
     openly acknowledged or socially supported. For instance, consider the grief experienced by a person after the loss
     of a pet. While deeply impactful, this loss might not receive the same understanding or support as the loss of a
     human loved one. In nursing, disenfranchised grief can also manifest in situations like miscarriages, where the
     emotional impact on the mother and family might not be fully recognized by others, leading to feelings of isolation
     and prolonged grief (Thompson & Doka, 2017).

     Social support is another critical factor. Social support systems, such as family, friends, and community groups, can
     provide emotional comfort, practical help, and a sense of belonging, all of which can facilitate the grieving process.
     Inadequate or unsupportive responses can compound feelings of loss, however, and make the bereaved feel more
     isolated (Peña-Vargas et al., 2020).

     Societal expectations and stigma can also shape grief experiences. This can manifest as pressure to quickly return
     to normalcy and function effectively in society. Furthermore, societal stigma around death and grief can lead to
     silence and avoidance, exacerbating feelings of loneliness and distress (Cacciatore et al., 2021) and leading to
     complicated grief, characterized by prolonged and intense mourning (Shear et al., 2016). Complicated grief is a
     profound and prolonged response to loss that impacts a person's ability to move forward. For example, consider a
     client who has lost a loved one and finds themselves unable to return to their daily activities or experiences severe
     emotional distress for an extended period, well beyond what might be considered a "normal" grieving process. They
     might struggle with intense feelings of disbelief, anger, or even guilt. In nursing, recognizing complicated grief is
     important because it can lead to significant mental health challenges (Mughal et al., 2019).

     Withdrawal and Isolation
     Withdrawal is a common, not necessarily unhealthy, side effect of grief, marked by a sense of pulling away from
     others and the world, a deep internalization of the grieving process. Withdrawing individuals may seem disengaged

9.2 · Grief and Loss                                                                                                                         269

from their surroundings. This can be a crucial time for self-reflection and reevaluation, although others can
misinterpret it as a lack of progress or healing (Vasquez, 2022).

Similarly, isolation is a common experience after losing a loved one, often occurring as part of the grieving process
and frequently leading to withdrawal. The bereaved may experience isolation in various forms, including physical,
emotional, and social isolation. Physical isolation may result from withdrawing from everyday activities and social
interactions as part of the natural response to loss (Vasquez, 2022). The bereaved may spend time alone, reflecting
on the loss and processing their grief.

Emotional isolation can lead to withdrawal. Even when surrounded by supportive friends and family, individuals who
have experienced loss may feel misunderstood or disconnected due to their grief's deeply personal and unique
nature. They may feel that others cannot fully comprehend their pain, leading to feelings of loneliness.

Social isolation can also occur when social networks change after a loss. The bereaved may feel alienated or
detached from their usual social groups due to the shared history and memories with the deceased. Furthermore,
societal expectations and stigma around grief can exacerbate feelings of isolation (Pitman et al., 2018).

It is important to note that everyone's grieving process is unique, and all may not experience withdrawal and
isolation. While some may withdraw, others may seek social connection to cope with their loss. And while some
degree of isolation may be a normal part of the grieving process, prolonged or extreme isolation can indicate a more
serious issue, such as complicated grief or depression (Shear et al., 2016). Therefore, the individual may need
professional help to assist in dealing with significant feelings of isolation after a loss. Thus, it is critical to provide
individualized support during this time.

Kübler-Ross Model of Grief
The Kübler-Ross model, also known as the five stages of grief, is a psychological framework that describes the
emotional process individuals go through when facing their mortality or experiencing significant loss. This model
states that grief involves five stages: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance (Kübler-Ross, 1969).
These stages are not necessarily linear or experienced in a fixed order, and not everyone goes through all of them.
They serve as a guide to understand the range of emotions people might encounter during a grieving process.
Health-care professionals must remember that everyone's grief is unique and may not neatly fit into these stages
(Figure 9.2).

FIGURE 9.2 Kübler-Ross believed that most people go through five stages of grief, although not all in the same order. (modification of work

Denial
Denial is recognized as a significant stage in the grieving process, according to the Kübler-Ross model of grief
(1969). The denial stage is often the initial response to a devastating loss, functioning as a defense mechanism that
helps individuals cope with the initial shock (Stroebe et al., 2017). During this stage, individuals may refuse to
acknowledge the reality of the loss or perceive it as a mistake or misunderstanding (Corr et al., 2018). For clients in
this stage of grief, nurses can validate feelings without reinforcing denial. Gentle and compassionate communication
can help the client gradually accept the reality of their situation (Tyrrell et al., 2023).

Anger
According to Kübler-Ross's (1969) model of grief, anger is the second stage that individuals might experience after a
profound loss. This stage is characterized by frustration, irritation, and even rage (Kübler-Ross, 1969). The grieving
person might direct this anger toward themselves, others, or even inanimate objects, attributing blame for the loss
that has occurred (Stroebe et al., 2017). Anger can also be a manifestation of deep pain, a reaction to feeling
270  9 · Social and Emotional Concerns

     abandoned by the deceased, or a protest against the reality and finality of death (Corr et al., 2018). In this stage,
     nurses can create a safe environment for the client to express anger without judgment and use active listening and
     empathetic communication to facilitate expression of emotion. As with all stages of grief, the anger phase is not
     linear and may overlap with other stages or return later in the grieving process. Additionally, some people might not
     experience this stage, demonstrating grief's individual and complex nature (Tyrrell et al., 2023).

     Bargaining
     According to Kübler-Ross's (1969) model, bargaining is another potential stage in grieving. During this stage,
     individuals often make deals or promises to a higher power, the universe, or themselves, in an attempt to reverse or
     lessen the loss (Kübler-Ross, 1969). This stage typically involves "what if" and "if only" statements that reflect a
     desire to regain control over the situation (Stroebe et al., 2017). People may also fantasize about ways things could
     have been different, leading to a temporary escape from their pain (Corr et al., 2018). While this can provide
     temporary relief, extended time in this stage may prolong the grieving process if it prevents acceptance of the loss.
     In this stage, nurses may support clients in discussing their hopes, wishes, and concerns. They should also offer self
     and be open to conversations about spirituality or alternative treatments (Tyrrell et al., 2023).

     Depression
     Depression, as conceptualized in Kübler-Ross's (1969) grief model, is typically the fourth stage in the grief process.
     Unlike clinical depression, this grief stage is characterized by profound sadness, despair, and loneliness that arise
     from the recognition and reality of the loss (Kübler-Ross, 1969). Individuals may exhibit symptoms, such as loss of
     appetite, lack of energy, sleep difficulties, and a general withdrawal from life and social activities (Stroebe et al.,
     2017). This stage of grief is not pathological but rather an expected response to a significant loss. It signifies an
     individual's grappling with the loss's impact and attempts to adjust to a new reality without the deceased (Corr et
     al., 2018). In this stage, nurses may offer empathetic support and validation of feelings of sadness and loss. They
     can also encourage expression of emotions and provide a supportive presence (Tyrrell et al., 2023). As with all
     stages of grief, the depression phase is not necessarily linear, and individuals might experience it in different ways
     and at different times during their grieving process.

     Acceptance
     According to Kübler-Ross's (1969) model, the final stage of the grieving process is acceptance. Acceptance does not
     imply happiness or that the individual is "over" the loss. Rather, it signifies understanding and coming to terms with
     the reality of the loss (Kübler-Ross, 1969). During this stage, individuals often begin to look forward and engage
     more with life, albeit with the acknowledgment that it will be different than before (Stroebe et al., 2017). This stage
     is characterized by a sense of calm, a decreased anger or despair, and an increased ability to reflect on the loss
     without overwhelming pain (Corr et al., 2018). In this stage, nurses may celebrate small victories and support the
     client's acceptance without minimizing their experiences and continuing to provide compassionate care and
     assistance (Tyrrell et al., 2023). For those who do experience this stage, it may not represent the end of grief but
     rather an integration of the loss into their life.

     Unrealistic Expectations
     The grieving process is highly personal and unique to each individual. As such, setting expectations, particularly
     unrealistic ones, can often hinder the process rather than facilitate it. One common unrealistic expectation is the
     belief that grief should follow a predictable, linear path, such as the five stages proposed by Kübler-Ross (1969).
     Grief is a complex process, often involving cycling between different emotions and stages (Stroebe et al., 2017).

     Another common misconception is the expectation that grief has a distinct endpoint or a deadline when an
     individual will or should completely "get over" the loss. In many cases, individuals do not fully "move on" from their
     loss but rather learn to live with it and integrate it into their ongoing lives at their own pace (O'Connor, 2019).

     The expectation that all individuals should display their grief openly or, conversely, should grieve in private is also
     unrealistic. Grief is experienced and expressed differently by different individuals, and all expressions of grief are
     valid (Stroebe et al., 2017). The key to healthy grieving is allowing individuals to experience and express grief in a
     way that feels right. Nurses facilitate an environment conducive to individualized grief expression through
     empathetic listening, personalized care, education, collaboration with interdisciplinary teams, and fostering a
     supportive community. This approach empowers individuals to navigate grief in a manner that feels right for them,
     fostering healing and resilience (Oates & Maani-Fogelman, 2022).

Impacts of Grief and Loss

Grief and loss can profoundly affect individuals, changing various aspects of their lives, including physical, mental,
and overall well-being. Physically, grief can lead to symptoms, such as fatigue, changes in appetite, sleep
disturbances, and even increased susceptibility to illness due to the stress and exhaustion it can cause (O'Connor,
2019). Mentally, individuals can experience sadness, anger, guilt, and anxiety and may even face an increased risk of
conditions like depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (Stroebe et al., 2017).

Loss can also change an individual's identity and understanding of the world. They may struggle with finding
meaning in life after the loss, and their identity may change as they adjust to a new life and navigate the loss they
have experienced (Bellet et al., 2020). Individuals endure various types of losses that can encompass physical,
emotional, and spiritual realms, all of which can have an impact on their overall well-being. These losses can
challenge a client's sense of identity and self-worth, necessitating comprehensive support and care. Grief can also
have social implications, as individuals may feel isolated or misunderstood by others, which can strain relationships
(Mortazavi et al., 2020). The impact of grief and loss on an individual is multifaceted and extends far beyond
emotional distress.

Physical
Grief and loss have significant physical impacts on individuals. The stress and emotional turmoil associated with
grief can lead to a range of physiological symptoms. Fatigue, sleep disturbances, and changes in appetite are
common among grieving individuals (Stroebe et al., 2017). In some cases, intense grief can lead to physical pain,
such as chest pain or headaches (O'Connor, 2019).

Research also suggests that grieving individuals may experience weakened immune function, making them more
susceptible to infections and illnesses (O'Connor, 2019). Furthermore, a prolonged period of intense grief, often
called complicated or prolonged grief, can increase the risk of cardiovascular problems, high blood pressure, and
even mortality (O'Connor, 2019). The physical impact of grief illustrates the intricate interplay between emotional
distress and physical health, underscoring the need for comprehensive care for those dealing with loss.

Emotional
Grief and loss profoundly trigger various complex emotions. Feelings of sadness and despair are common, as is a
sense of loneliness or isolation following a significant loss (Stroebe et al., 2017). The grieving individual may also
experience guilt or regret, especially if there are unresolved issues or unexpressed feelings toward the deceased
(Currier et al., 2015). Anger is another common emotional response; it may be directed at oneself, the deceased,
other individuals, health-care providers, or even a higher power (Kübler-Ross, 1969). Additionally, anxiety can occur,
including fears about mortality or the inability to cope with the loss alone (Mortazavi et al., 2020). In complicated
grief, individuals may experience severe emotional distress, intrusive thoughts about the deceased, and difficulty
accepting the death, which can significantly interfere with daily functioning (Duffy & Wild, 2017). Thus, the
emotional effects of grief are multifaceted, illustrating the necessity of emotional support and care in times of loss.

  Applying the CJMM to the Stages of Grief

  Walter has recently been diagnosed with dementia and is a new resident in the memory unit attached to the
  assisted living facility (ALF). Walter receives palliative care through the local hospice and already has legal
  documents in place to assist with his ongoing care.

  Walter refuses to eat and tells staff to "get out" when they try to assist him with activities of daily living (ADLs),
  including bathing and hygiene. Walter says he just wants to be left alone to die. Walter refuses to leave his room

     TABLE 9.1 Walter's Assessment

     Spiritual
     The spiritual impacts of grief and loss are significant and can manifest in numerous ways. For some, a loss might
     prompt a deep questioning of their faith or belief systems, leading to a crisis of meaning. Individuals might grapple
     with questions about the nature of life and death, the existence of an afterlife, or the perceived fairness or justice of
     their loss. Sometimes, these questions can lead to spiritual distress or a loss of faith (Wong & Yu, 2021).

     to support your own well-being.

     Spirituality can also serve as a vital source of comfort and resilience in the face of loss. Many individuals find solace
     in their faith or spiritual beliefs, which can provide a sense of hope and meaning amidst their grief. Spiritual
     practices, such as prayer or meditation, can provide peace and connectedness (Biancalani et al., 2022). For some,
     the experience of loss can lead to spiritual growth or transformation. They may develop a deeper or more nuanced
     understanding of their beliefs or discover new spiritual perspectives that help them make sense of their loss (Eames
     & O'Connor, 2022).

     Impact of Grief and Loss on the Nurse

     The impact of grief and loss on nurses is significant, involving emotional, physical, and psychological components.

9.2 · Grief and Loss                                                                                                          273

Due to the nature of their work, nurses often develop close relationships with clients and their families, making
them susceptible to feelings of loss when a client dies (Üstüku & Eskimez, 2021). Emotionally, nurses may
experience sadness, guilt, or helplessness, especially if they felt close to the client or if the death was unexpected
(Kostka et al., 2021). They may also experience symptoms of grief similar to those held by the client's family, such
as disbelief, anger, and depression (McCallum et al., 2021).

Physically, the stress associated with grief and loss can lead to fatigue, sleep disturbances, and other health issues
(Rahmani et al., 2023). Psychologically, the repeated experience of loss can contribute to burnout, a state of chronic
physical and emotional exhaustion often associated with feelings of cynicism and detachment from work (Friganovi
& Selic, 2021). There is also an increased risk for compassion fatigue, characterized by a decreased capacity for
empathy over time due to repeated exposure to traumatic events or losses (Gustafsson & Hemberg, 2022).

        CULTURAL CONTEXT

Cultural Stigma: Potential for Nurses' Compassion Fatigue

Psychiatric and physical symptoms combine in culture-bound syndromes, which are mental health conditions
specific to the client's primary social group. Perceived experience with spiritual phenomena, or altered engagement
in culture-based activities or rituals, may present during mental health care. Lack of understanding or acceptance,
even lack of inquiry, on the part of the health-care providers may result in inadequate or delayed treatment,
incorrect diagnosis, or stigma.

Nurses should seek culturally-informative education and evidence-based resources to help identify and address
symptoms and cues that are difficult to interpret. Nurses can refer clients and families to community mental health
and inquire as to peer services. Nurses are called to act as advocates to mitigate risks posed by stigma for
conditions that may be poorly understood.

(Ahad et al., 2023)

In extreme cases, prolonged exposure to grief and loss without adequate coping mechanisms or support can result
in traumatic stress responses similar to PTSD (Gabra et al., 2022). Dealing with grief can be emotionally challenging,
especially for nurses who often witness and support clients and families through difficult situations. This is why it is
important for nurses to employ self-care strategies in their daily lives. Some of these strategies include engaging in
regular exercise, maintaining a balanced diet, and ensuring adequate rest. In addition, talking to colleagues,
mentors, or support groups can provide an outlet to express emotions and share experiences, offering valuable
emotional support. Nurses should also be mindful to recognize personal limits and establish clear boundaries
between work and personal life to help prevent emotional exhaustion (Rabow et al., 2021). Health-care institutions
need to recognize these impacts and support nurses, providing opportunities for debriefing, counseling services,
and education about healthy coping strategies (Rahmani et al., 2023).

        LIFE-STAGE CONTEXT

Interventions for Assisting a Teenage Client with Grief After Loss

Psychoeducation

Understanding the stages and process of grief can be helpful for a teenager, particularly if this is their first significant
loss. It can normalize their experience and reduce feelings of confusion or isolation. It can also prepare them for
some of the different emotions they may experience, helping them understand that grief is not a linear process.

Individual Therapy (CBT, EMDR)

Cognitive behavioral therapy can help teenagers manage and understand their emotions and develop coping
strategies. Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) could be considered if the teenager is
experiencing traumatic grief, helping to process the traumatic elements of the loss.

Group Therapy
274  9 · Social and Emotional Concerns

     Participating in group therapy with other teenagers experiencing grief can foster a sense of community and reduce
     feelings of isolation. They can share experiences and coping strategies and support each other in a safe and
     controlled environment.

     Art Therapy or Expressive Arts Therapy

     Teenagers may struggle to articulate their emotions verbally, especially if they are intense or confusing. Art therapy
     provides an alternative medium through which they can express their feelings. Creating art can also be a therapeutic
     process, serving as a distraction and providing a sense of accomplishment.

     Physical Activity

     Regular physical activity can improve mental health by reducing anxiety, depression, and negative mood and
     improving self-esteem and cognitive function. Exercise is a powerful tool to help teenagers manage grief-related
     stress and insomnia.

     Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques

     Techniques, such as yoga, meditation, and deep breathing, can help teenagers manage the physical symptoms of
     grief, such as tension and difficulty sleeping. They can also promote a sense of calm and control, which can be
     particularly helpful in times of intense emotion or stress.

     Family Therapy

     The death of a close friend or relative affects the whole family. Family therapy can help each member understand
     the others' grief process and coping mechanisms. It can improve communication and help the family support each
     other effectively.

     School-Based Support

     Schools can provide resources and create an environment conducive to healing. This may involve coordinating with
     teachers and administrators to ensure the teenager can access grief counseling, time off as needed, and academic
     support.

     All these interventions should be tailored to the teenager's unique needs, cultural background, and personal
     preferences. These strategies aim to support them during this difficult time and equip them with coping
     mechanisms to manage their grief.

     9.3 Anger, Abuse, and Violence

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Understand and define anger and aggression
         · Review the cycle of abuse and types of abuse and violence
         · Learn prominent risk factors for anger, abuse, and violence
         · Comprehend the social problems relating to anger, abuse, and violence
         · Discuss ways to handle anger, abuse, and violence in clinical settings

     Anger is a universal human emotion. As a survival mechanism, it evolved to protect people from threats and to
     ensure existence. When misdirected or poorly managed, however, anger can lead to destructive outcomes, causing
     harm to oneself and others. The nursing profession brings individuals face-to-face with some of these destructive
     outcomes: abuse and violence.

     Abuse and violence come in many forms and can occur in various contexts, ranging from domestic settings to
     institutions, such as hospitals or nursing homes. This issue can affect individuals across the life span, from children
     to older adults. It encompasses physical, emotional, psychological, and sexual abuse, as well as neglect, and often
     has severe consequences for the health and well-being of the affected individuals. Nurses are often the first to
     recognize signs of anger, abuse, and violence, making their role pivotal in preventing, identifying, and intervening in
     these issues. Nurses are not just caregivers but are also advocates for clients, which demands understanding these
     societal problems and their manifestations in the health context.

Anger and Aggression Defined

Anger and aggression are two interrelated yet distinct constructs in psychology. The subjective, emotional state
characterized by antagonism toward someone or something perceived as causing harm or offense is called anger.
By contrast, aggression pertains to behaviors intended to harm or assert dominance over others. Both can be
triggered by external or internal stimuli, such as perceived threats, frustration, or chronic stress, and can manifest in
various ways, including verbal or physical confrontations, destructive behaviors, or even internalized distress.

Anger does not always lead to aggression; it can be expressed and managed in healthy ways through strategies like
cognitive restructuring, relaxation techniques, and problem-solving (Richard et al., 2022). In turn, aggression does
not always originate from anger alone. While anger is a common emotion associated with aggressive behavior,
aggression can also stem from various other sources or triggers. It might arise from frustration, fear, self-defense,
protection of oneself or others, or even from learned behavior or societal influences. For instance, aggression can
manifest in response to a threat. It can be a learned behavior from environmental factors or past experiences. Some
individuals might display aggressive behavior as a result of neurological conditions or certain mental health issues
(Kruglanski et al., 2023). There are multiple issues that can cause anger, including medications, emotional
dysregulation, poor impulse control, trauma, depression, poor outcomes, and challenging diagnoses and symptoms.

The Cycle and Types of Abuse Defined

Anger and aggressive behavior can be precursors to violence and abuse. The cycle of abuse is a model developed to
explain behavior patterns in abusive relationships; it encompasses four stages: tension building, acute violence,
reconciliation or honeymoon, and calm (Focht & Chu, 2020). In the tension-building phase, stress and conflict begin
to escalate, often accompanied by verbal abuse or other forms of psychological torment. This phase may last for
minutes or months, with the abused partner often feeling as though they are "walking on eggshells" (Focht & Chu,
2020).

The acute violence phase follows, characterized by outbursts of aggressive, abusive behavior, which can include
physical, verbal, emotional, sexual, or financial abuse. Most harm occurs in this stage, but it is usually shorter than
the tension-building phase (Focht & Chu, 2020).

After the violent episode, the cycle enters the reconciliation or honeymoon phase. The abuser may feel guilty or
afraid of consequences, leading them to apologize, promise change, or exhibit unusually kind behavior. This period
gives the victim hope that their abuser has truly changed, making it less likely they will leave the abusive
relationship (Focht & Chu, 2020).

The calm phase is the period of relative tranquility before the tension starts building again. During this phase, the
abuser might deny or minimize the abuse or act as if it never occurred. This behavior can confuse the victim and
keep them in the relationship (Focht & Chu, 2020). It is important to note that while the cycle of abuse model has
been widely used, it does not fit all abusive relationships. The pattern and frequency of the cycle can vary drastically
between relationships (Dutton, 2007).

Physical Abuse
The intentional use of physical force that results in injury, pain, or impairment is called physical abuse. This form of
abuse can encompass a broad range of behaviors, including hitting, slapping, punching, kicking, burning, choking,
and the use of weapons. It is important to understand that the injuries resulting from physical abuse are not always
apparent and can be concealed by the abuser or the victim due to fear, shame, or efforts to protect the abuser
(Warren et al., 2023).

Health-care professionals must be aware of the signs of physical abuse, which can include unexplained or
inconsistently explained injuries, frequent visits to the emergency department, delayed treatment seeking, and
276  9 · Social and Emotional Concerns

     symptoms of anxiety or depression (Hegarty et al., 2020). Nurses play a pivotal role in recognizing, documenting,
     and reporting instances of physical abuse. They are also instrumental in providing emotional support and resources
     to victims, such as information on safety planning, crisis intervention services, and legal options. Mandatory
     reporting for nurses is an ethical and legal obligation aimed at safeguarding vulnerable individuals from harm or
     potential harm. Nurses are ethically bound to advocate for clients' well-being and safety. Mandatory reporting
     requirements vary by jurisdiction but commonly include instances of suspected child abuse or neglect, elder abuse,
     domestic violence, and certain communicable diseases (Thomas & Reeves, 2020). Failure to comply with mandatory
     reporting obligations can result in legal repercussions and may compromise client safety and well-being (Geiderman
     & Marco, 2020).

     Nurses must be mindful of potential cultural, linguistic, or societal barriers when addressing physical abuse. This
     includes respecting privacy, recognizing the influence of cultural norms on abuse disclosure, and acknowledging
     that all individuals, regardless of gender, age, or sexual orientation, can be victims of physical abuse (Arora et al.,
     2023).

     Psychological Abuse
     Subjecting or exposing another individual to behavior that can result in psychological harm, such as anxiety, chronic
     depression, decreased self-esteem, or even post-traumatic stress disorder, is called psychological abuse or
     emotional abuse (Dokkedahl et al., 2019). This form of abuse is often characterized by a pattern of behavior that
     can include belittling, constant criticism, manipulation, intimidation, humiliation, gaslighting, and coercive control.
     This form of abuse often aims to undermine an individual's sense of self-worth and independence, making them
     more dependent on the abuser (Dokkedahl et al., 2019).

     While psychological abuse does not leave physical marks, its effects can be long-lasting, influencing an individual's
     emotional health and well-being. Victims may experience feelings of fear, confusion, and doubt about their
     perceptions of the events. They may also exhibit symptoms, such as withdrawal, low self-esteem, and depression
     (Heise et al., 2019). It can be challenging for health-care professionals to identify psychological abuse due to its
     nonphysical nature. Being aware of possible signs, such as changes in behavior, withdrawal from social activities,
     and an unusual degree of compliance or deference toward a partner, can be helpful (Radell et al., 2021). Addressing
     psychological abuse requires a sensitive and holistic approach, including providing emotional support, encouraging
     clients to speak about their experience, connecting them with appropriate community resources, and potentially
     involving social services or mental health professionals (Dokkedahl et al., 2019).

     Risk Factors for Anger, Violence, and Abuse

     Emotional factors play a significant role in triggering anger and aggression. Specifically, negative emotions, such as
     frustration, stress, anxiety, and fear, often serve as antecedents to anger. For example, frustration, when a person's
     goals are thwarted, can readily precipitate feelings of anger. Stress, too, increases irritability and impairs coping
     mechanisms, leading to heightened anger. Anxiety and fear, particularly if they are chronic or pervasive, can
     contribute to anger and violence as defensive responses to perceived threats. The inability to manage or
     appropriately express emotions, or emotional dysregulation, is another significant factor, as individuals who
     struggle with this often resort to aggression as an inappropriate coping mechanism (Richard et al., 2022). Social,
     economic, and environmental factors also increase the risk of anger, abuse, and violent behavior.

     There are also several mitigating factors that can lessen the likelihood that an individual will engage in or be a victim
     to abusive or violent behavior. This section briefly reviews several of these items as well.

     Stress
     Stress plays a crucial role in increasing the risk that a client will display anger. Stressful situations can distort
     cognitive processes, leading to increased hostility. Specifically, clients under stress might misinterpret social cues,
     perceive threats where none exist, and respond disproportionately with anger or aggression. Chronic or high-stress
     levels can also impair emotional regulation, making it challenging for clients to manage their anger appropriately
     (Chipidza et al., 2016). Furthermore, stress can exacerbate preexisting mental health conditions, such as
     depression, anxiety, or personality disorders, increasing the risk of aggressive behaviors (Neelam et al., 2021).
     Interventions that help clients manage stress, such as mindfulness, relaxation training, and cognitive behavioral
     therapies, can effectively reduce stress-induced anger and aggression (Chipidza et al., 2016).

Experiencing Abuse
Research has continuously shown a strong correlation between being abused and individuals' subsequent
development of anger and aggression (Auslander et al., 2016). Abusive experiences often cause complex emotional
and psychological effects, including the manifestation of anger. Abuse can lead to a hostile worldview, creating a
sense of perceived threat that may trigger defensive responses, including aggression (Dugal et al., 2016). Anger and
aggression can be coping mechanisms used by victims to deal with the ongoing pain or trauma associated with their
abusive experiences (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, 2014). Exposure to abusive environments often leads
to normalizing aggressive behavior as an adaptive response to perceived threats, thereby perpetuating a cycle of
anger and aggression (Auslander et al., 2016).

Unfairness
Anger is a common emotional response to perceived injustice or unfairness and is often a precursor to aggression if
the individual decides to act on this emotion (Archer & Mills, 2019). The appraisal theory of emotion reasons that
not only does the experience of unfairness elicit these emotions but so does the individual's interpretation and
appraisal of the situation (Moors, 2017). Individuals are more likely to exhibit aggressive behavior when they
perceive they have been treated unfairly and may be more prone to display aggression to rectify the perceived
injustice (Qin & Zhang, 2022). Nurses may see this type of aggression in clients or family members if they feel they
are not receiving the care they deserve.

Strained Relationships
Strained relationships, characterized by conflict, discord, and a lack of positive communication, may predict anger
and aggression in individuals. The strain or stressors arising from these relationships can elicit various negative
emotional responses, with anger being a common outcome (Wang et al., 2022a). Interpersonal relationships can be
strained by various factors, such as communication breakdown, where misinterpretation or lack of effective
communication can escalate tension and frustration (Gratis, 2022). Additionally, unresolved conflicts and
disagreements over fundamental issues, such as finances, values, or priorities, can create persistent strain
(Gossman et al., 2023). Stressors external to the relationship, such as work-related pressures or family conflicts,
can spill over and impact the dynamics within the relationship, contributing to heightened emotional responses,
including anger (Lau et al., 2019). Furthermore, breaches of trust, such as infidelity or dishonesty, can severely
strain relationships and evoke strong feelings of betrayal and anger (Rokach & Chan, 2023). These factors can
contribute to the deterioration of relationships, fostering anger and animosity between individuals involved.

Anger often serves as a catalyst for aggressive behavior, violence, and abuse, particularly within interpersonal
relationships where conflict is present (Chen et al., 2019). People may resort to psychological or physical aggression
as a coping mechanism or a means to assert control in the face of ongoing strain in their relationships. Strained
relationships can create conditions that foster feelings of anger, which, in turn, can lead to abuse (Soreff et al.,
2023).

Disparities in Access to Care
Disparities in access to care compound the risk factor for violence and abuse. The availability of essential services,
such as health care, psychosocial support, and legal assistance, often varies based on geographic location,
socioeconomic status, race, and ethnicity, creating barriers to care for many people in need of psychosocial support
and for victims of abuse. In rural areas, for instance, individuals often face limited access to services due to physical
distance, lack of transportation, and a shortage of specialized service providers (Cyr et al., 2019). In low-income
communities, a lack of resources can similarly inhibit access to needed care. These disparities underscore the
systemic issues inherent in the provision of services for abuse and violence victims. They also underscore a lack of
access for people for whom early intervention may prevent later violence. Racial and ethnic disparities in care also
persist. Victims from marginalized racial and ethnic groups may face additional barriers [barriers such as] such as
cultural insensitivity, language barriers, or fear of discrimination, that can deter them from seeking or receiving care.

Families and Communities
Families can both be a source of support and risk for individuals when it comes to anger, violence, and abuse. For
example, family structure and dynamics, such as marital conflict, divorce, single-parent households, and large
family size, have been associated with an increased risk of child abuse and neglect. Exposure to violence within the
family normalizes violent behavior and may perpetuate intergenerational cycles of abuse (Almuneef et al., 2016).
278  9 · Social and Emotional Concerns

     Conversely, a strong and supportive family environment can help prevent violence and mitigate its effects when it
     does occur (Mercy et al., 2017).

     Communities, similarly, play a crucial role in either exacerbating or alleviating anger and violence. Factors, such as
     high levels of neighborhood violence, social disorder, and poverty, can increase anger and the risk of aggression. In
     contrast, supportive communities with strong social networks and institutions can foster resilience and protect
     against violence. Societal norms and attitudes within communities can discourage violent behavior (World Health
     Organization, 2022).

     Factors Mitigating Anger and Violence
     Prevention programs are key to mitigating violence generally, focusing on early intervention to deter violent
     behavior. These initiatives often center around enhancing at-risk individuals' social skills and emotional intelligence,
     implementing anti-bullying initiatives, or teaching conflict resolution methods (Rivara & Le Menestrel, 2016).
     Furthermore, mental health support is a crucial component in reducing violent behavior, given that many individuals
     exhibiting such behaviors have mental health challenges. Mental health services, such as counseling and
     medication, can relieve these conditions and decrease instances of violence. Community outreach programs that
     actively engage community members can play a significant role in reducing violence. Such programs may include
     establishing secure spaces for at-risk youth, providing mentorship programs, or creating opportunities for positive
     social interaction (Sugimoto-Matsuda & Braun, 2013). Additionally, potent tools for violence prevention include
     school-based programs educating on the impacts of violence and professional training for individuals like teachers
     and police officers to identify and de-escalate potentially violent situations. Policy changes and legislation also
     contribute to violence reduction, with reforms like stricter gun control laws, shifts in the criminal justice system
     toward a focus on rehabilitation over punishment, or policies addressing systemic issues, such as poverty and
     inequality, which are frequently tied to violence (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine et al.,
     2018).

     Therapeutic approaches, such as CBT and positive behavior support (PBS), can help individuals change destructive
     or disturbing thought patterns that negatively influence their behavior and emotions (Wilmots et al., 2020). In
     addition, conflict resolution skills training can foster connections within communities and encourage peaceful
     conflict resolution, significantly reducing instances of violence (Kamatsiko, 2021) (Figure 9.3).

Social Problems Related to Anger, Abuse, and Violence

Anger has long been associated with a range of social problems. This emotion, when unregulated, can damage
interpersonal relationships, disrupt the workplace environment, and pose significant barriers to effective
communication. When unmanaged, anger can escalate into aggression, leading to antisocial behaviors and even
violence (Reilly & Shopshire, 2019). Abuse and violence within society have direct and indirect impacts that ripple
through communities, affecting individuals' physical, psychological, and emotional health and overall societal
structures (Wessells & Kostelny, 2022). Exposure to violence can lead to trauma, contributing to various mental
health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These conditions can
further exacerbate societal problems, as individuals dealing with these conditions may struggle with employment,
relationships, and other areas of daily life (Dabaghi et al., 2023). Moreover, abuse and violence have significant
economic implications. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that the financial toll of
violence, including the cost of medical care and loss of productivity, amounted to billions of dollars annually (CDC,
2019).

Job Loss
Job loss due to anger and aggression in the workplace can have profound implications on an individual's career
trajectory and overall well-being. Frequent displays of anger and aggressive behavior can significantly contribute to
strained interpersonal relationships, reduced team cohesion, and ultimately result in termination of employment.
Such behaviors not only disrupt the work environment but also compromise productivity and morale among
colleagues (Popa et al., 2023). The repercussions of job loss linked to anger management issues extend beyond the
professional realm, impacting one's financial stability and mental health (Adler et al., 2022).

Rates of abusive behavior tend to increase during periods of economic decline, where job loss is more common.
280  9 · Social and Emotional Concerns

     Added stress from unemployment could lead to a rise in violent behaviors because job loss might lead to a reduced
     sense of self-worth and increased feelings of stress and anger (Schleimer et al., 2022).

     Loss of Family or Significant Others
     Anger and aggression can negatively affect personal relationships, leading to damaged and irreparable
     relationships. Persistent anger and aggressive behavior significantly contribute to domestic discord, often resulting
     in strained familial relationships and, in extreme cases, separation or divorce. This behavior pattern not only inflicts
     emotional distress, but also poses a threat to the safety and well-being of family members (Killgore et al., 2021).
     Children exposed to parental aggression face adverse psychological and developmental consequences, which can
     lead to lasting impacts on their mental health and future relationships. The loss of family ties due to unmanaged
     anger and aggression underscores the urgency of seeking appropriate interventions and support systems to foster
     healthy relationships and prevent further emotional turmoil (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
     Administration [SAMHSA], 2023).

     Trauma
     The psychological impact of aggression and abuse is profound, often manifesting as traumatic stress responses.
     Individuals who have experienced abuse or violence may develop trauma symptoms, ranging from intrusive
     memories of the traumatic event, avoidance of reminders of the event, changes in thoughts and mood, and changes
     in physical and emotional reactions to everyday life events (SAMHSA, 2019). Physically, victims might demonstrate
     heightened startle responses, increased vigilance, or hypervigilance in mundane situations. For instance, sudden
     loud noises may evoke intense fear or panic due to past trauma experiences, leading to an exaggerated startle
     reflex. Additionally, survivors might manifest altered emotional reactions, such as emotional numbing or
     dissociation when faced with stressors that remind them of their traumatic experiences. In these cases, individuals
     may disconnect from their emotions or surroundings as a coping mechanism to manage overwhelming feelings
     associated with past abuse or violence (SAMHSA, 2019).

     It is essential to acknowledge the long-term consequences of these traumatic experiences. Literature establishes a
     correlation between adverse childhood experiences (such as abuse or violence) and health and well-being issues in
     adulthood, including mental health disorders and chronic physical health conditions (Chang et al., 2019). This
     indicates that the traumatic effects of abuse and violence can span a lifetime, leading to many health problems,
     anger, and aggression.

     Furthermore, victims of abuse and violence may develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Symptoms of PTSD
     include flashbacks, nightmares, severe anxiety, and uncontrollable thoughts about the event. The prevalence of
     PTSD underscores the severe psychological damage that abuse and violence can cause (National Institute of Mental
     Health, 2023).

     Trauma-informed care is a framework that acknowledges the prevalence of trauma in individuals' lives and seeks to
     create an environment sensitive to their experiences. It is grounded in understanding the profound impact of trauma
     on one's mental, emotional, and physical health (Menschner & Maul, 2016). Trauma-informed care emphasizes
     safety, trustworthiness, collaboration, empowerment, and cultural humility. Its principles guide health-care
     providers in delivering compassionate, individualized care while respecting the autonomy and dignity of those who
     have experienced trauma (Ranjbar et al., 2020). See 6.5 Trauma-Informed Care for more information.

     Substance Misuse
     Substance misuse and violence are interconnected and often co-occurring. Substance misuse is not necessarily a
     result of violence--although sexual abuse victims, for example, do have higher rates of substance misuse (SAMHSA,
     2022)--but is often a cause of it. It can impair judgment, reduce inhibition, and increase impulsivity, escalating the
     likelihood of violent behavior. Various substances, including alcohol, illicit drugs, and prescription drugs, can
     contribute to interpersonal violence, such as domestic violence, and self-directed violence, such as self-harm or

suicide (Zhong et al., 2020).

Research indicates that individuals with substance use disorders are more likely to engage in violent behavior,
including physical assault and the use of weapons. They are also at a heightened risk of becoming victims of
violence themselves. This increased risk may be due to various factors, such as engagement in high-risk activities,
association with violent peers, or being targeted due to perceived vulnerability (Zhong et al., 2020). Conversely,
experiencing violence, particularly during formative years, can increase an individual's susceptibility to substance
misuse. Exposure to violence, trauma, and stress can lead to maladaptive coping strategies, such as substance use,
to manage overwhelming emotional pain or distress (Edalati & Krank, 2016).

From a health-care perspective, it is vital to recognize the intricate links between substance misuse and violence.
Integrative approaches, including trauma-informed care, substance misuse treatment, mental health services, and
violence prevention programs, have been effective (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, 2014).

Incarceration
Individuals who commit aggressive, abusive, or violent behavior may face incarceration. At the same time,
imprisonment can expose individuals to various abuses, including physical violence, sexual assault, and
psychological trauma (Mears & Cochran, 2015). In other words, incarceration can contribute to and result from
various forms of abuse, highlighting the complex relationship between the criminal justice system and abuse
(Saxena & Messina, 2021). The experience of incarceration can also indirectly contribute to patterns of abuse. Post
release, individuals often face significant social, economic, and psychological challenges, leading to high-stress
environments that may increase the likelihood of violent or abusive behavior once released (Saxena & Messina,
2021). Incarceration can deeply affect familial relationships, leading to emotional trauma, economic hardship, and
potentially a continuation of the cycle of abuse in the families affected (Massoglia & Pridemore, 2015).

Prevention and intervention strategies are essential in breaking the cycle, such as trauma-informed care within
correctional facilities, support for reintegration post incarceration, and efforts to address the root causes of abuse
and criminal behavior (Lehrer, 2021). Nurses employ assessment tools and techniques to identify trauma exposure
and its potential effects on an individual's health and well-being. Through comprehensive assessments, they gather
information regarding trauma experiences, enabling them to develop personalized care plans that consider the
unique needs of each person (Lehrer, 2021). They serve as frontline health-care providers who have direct and
frequent interactions with incarcerated individuals. Their responsibilities encompass creating a safe and supportive
environment conducive to healing while respecting the inherent dignity of the incarcerated individuals (Levenson &
Willis, 2018).

Social and Emotional Concerns of Victims of Abuse and Violence
Abuse and violence can lead to a range of social and emotional concerns in victims, significantly affecting their
psychological well-being and overall life quality. Immediate emotional responses to abuse and violence may include
fear, anxiety, confusion, and anger. Over time, these can evolve into more chronic conditions, such as PTSD,
depression, anxiety disorders, and complex trauma, characterized by difficulties with emotion regulation,
relationship issues, and altered belief systems (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, 2014).

Victims of violence and abuse often experience shame, guilt, and self-blame, which can exacerbate their emotional
distress and hinder their help-seeking behavior (Ullman & Peter-Hagene, 2014). They may also suffer from
diminished self-worth and develop a negative self-concept. They have an increased risk of resorting to substance
misuse. In addition, experiencing violence can lead to chronic feelings of powerlessness and a persistent sense of
threat, creating a state of hypervigilance and difficulty trusting others (Smith et al., 2019). These emotional
concerns underscore the need for trauma-informed interventions that address the profound psychological impacts
of violence and abuse.

Stigmatization and Discrimination
Stigmatization and discrimination compound the harm inflicted by abuse and violence. The social stigma attached to
being a victim of abuse or violence often discourages victims from reporting these experiences, seeking help, or
pursuing justice (Dahal et al., 2022). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), fear of stigma and
discriminatory attitudes can deter individuals from seeking and receiving necessary medical, legal, and psychosocial
support, potentially exacerbating trauma and health consequences (2021).
282  9 · Social and Emotional Concerns

     Furthermore, victims may face societal discrimination, often stemming from deeply ingrained societal norms that
     blame victims or trivialize the abuse or violence they experienced (UN Women, 2020). This discrimination can
     contribute to a culture of silence around abuse and violence, making it more difficult for victims to reach out for
     support and resources for recovery. It is common for victims to be ostracized or judged by their communities or
     certain cultures, which only amplifies the emotional toll of the abuse and violence they have suffered (Dahal et al.,
     2022) and places them at higher risk of secondary victimization or revictimization (Sabri et al., 2022).

     Fear and Anxiety
     Fear and anxiety are common psychological responses to abuse and violence and can lead to both acute and chronic
     mental health difficulties. Following a traumatic event, such as experiencing violence or abuse, individuals often
     report intense fear, which can stem from the immediate threat to their safety and well-being (Smith et al., 2019).
     This fear can continue long after the threat has passed, particularly if the individual experiences ongoing abuse or is
     constantly afraid of recurrence.

     Anxiety is also frequently seen in survivors of abuse and violence. This anxiety may present as generalized anxiety
     disorder, characterized by excessive and persistent worry, or as PTSD (National Institute of Mental Health, 2023).
     Moreover, survivors may experience panic attacks and specific phobias related to the trauma, further compounding
     their distress (Cruz et al., 2022). Fear and anxiety can negatively impact an individual's daily functioning,
     relationships, and quality of life. They may cause sleep disturbances, problems concentrating, and physical health
     issues, such as heart disease and chronic pain (Scott et al., 2013).

     Shame and Guilt
     Shame and guilt play critical roles in the dynamics of abuse and violence, affecting both the victim and the
     perpetrator. Abuse victims often report shame and guilt, as they may blame themselves for the abuse or believe
     they could have prevented it. This self-blame can exacerbate feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness,
     potentially leading to chronic emotional distress and contributing to the development of mental health disorders,
     such as depression and anxiety (McElvaney et al., 2022). Sometimes, these feelings can deter victims from seeking
     help and delay their recovery (Ullman & Peter-Hagene, 2014).

     Anger and Loss of Trust
     Anger and loss of trust are significant emotional consequences frequently associated with experiences of abuse and
     violence. Victims often experience anger toward their perpetrators, which can be a normal and healthy response to
     injustice but also a potential source of chronic distress if not appropriately addressed. In some instances, this anger
     may be internalized and misdirected toward the self, leading to feelings of self-loathing and perpetuating a cycle of
     victimization (Avdibegovic et al., 2017).

     In addition to anger, victims of abuse often experience a profound loss of trust, particularly when the perpetrator is a
     close family member, partner, or friend. This loss of trust can extend beyond the perpetrator, affecting the victim's
     relationships with others and their ability to form new, healthy relationships. Victims may develop a pervasive sense
     of insecurity, expecting others to harm or betray them, leading to social withdrawal and isolation (Radell et al.,
     2021). Furthermore, loss of trust can significantly hinder the healing process because it may reduce the likelihood of
     victims seeking or accepting help from others, including professionals (Ullman & Peter-Hagene, 2014).

     Isolation and Loneliness
     Abuse and violence can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness in victims, worsening the traumatic impacts of
     the experiences. Perpetrators of abuse often employ tactics of control and manipulation, which may include
     isolating the victim from their social networks in an attempt to increase their dependence on the abuser. This
     isolation can leave victims feeling alone and unsupported, contributing to hopelessness and despair (Harsey et al.,
     2017). At times, the stigma and shame associated with being a victim of abuse can lead individuals to isolate
     themselves out of fear of judgment or misunderstanding by others (Ullman & Peter-Hagene, 2014). This self-
     imposed isolation can compound feelings of loneliness and exacerbate mental health issues, such as depression
     and anxiety (Birken et al., 2023).

     Anger, Abuse, and Violence in Clinical Settings

     When dealing with anger and aggression in clinical situations, understand that these emotions may stem from fear,
     frustration, or a loss of control related to clients' medical conditions (Llor-Esteban et al., 2017). Nurses most often

encounter types of verbal aggression in clinical settings. This type of aggression involves hostile communication or
threats without physical harm. Clients might become verbally aggressive due to frustration with treatment,
communication barriers, or feelings of powerlessness (BCcampus, 2014). It is important first to ensure safety for
staff and clients, and then to consider all of the institutional, legal, and ethical implications. After all, in clinical
settings, anger and aggression can manifest in various forms, each presenting distinct characteristics and
consequences.

Causes of Anger and Violence in the Clinical Environment
Anger and aggression within the clinical environment are often categorized as client-related, health-care provider-
related, or systemic (Vento et al., 2020). From the client's perspective, certain medical conditions, including chronic
pain and mental health disorders, such as dementia, personality disorders, schizophrenia, delirium, and substance
misuse, can precipitate aggressive behaviors (Pekurinen et al., 2017). Severe psychiatric symptoms, a history of
violence, and substance misuse can contribute to the risk of violence in health settings as well. It is important to
stress, however, that most individuals with mental health disorders are not violent, and mental illness alone does
not predict violence (DeAngelis, 2021).

Additionally, the stress induced by hospitalization, diagnoses of serious illnesses, limited opportunities for
meaningful activities, and the need for medical procedures can often lead to heightened fear and anxiety, which may
manifest as anger or aggression (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, 2014). A nurse may encounter impulsive
aggression, which often occurs quickly in response to perceived provocation or threat. For instance, a client might
exhibit this type of aggression if they feel misunderstood or subjected to intrusive procedures, leading to an
outburst of anger or violence (BCcampus, 2014).

Provider-related factors can also motivate aggressive behaviors. These may include poor communication skills, lack
of empathy, perceived neglect, and rushed consultations that may frustrate clients and their families. An unfriendly
and unsupportive attitude from the health-care provider can trigger defensive mechanisms, such as anger and
aggression (Pekurinen et al., 2017).

Systemic issues within the health-care system likewise can be catalysts for anger and aggression. These systemic
problems often include long waiting times, inadequate resources, overworked staff, and poor hospital conditions
(Lim et al., 2022). Such conditions may exacerbate client-related factors, creating a stressful environment leading to
anger and violence.

Handling Anger and Violence in Clinical Settings
Addressing anger and aggression in mental health settings requires a comprehensive, person-centered approach,
acknowledging the individual's unique psychological state and needs (Välimäki et al., 2022). Nurses must approach
these situations with empathy, validation, and nonjudgmental attitudes, which can help defuse tension and foster a
therapeutic relationship. Safety should be the primary concern, however. At the group level, teamwork and good
interpersonal relationships among health-care providers can contribute to a less stressful environment, potentially
reducing the occurrence of anger and aggression. Regular team meetings, supervision, and stress management
workshops can support the health-care staff, further alleviating workplace stress (Pollock et al., 2020). At the
organizational level, hospitals and health-care institutions should prioritize creating a safe, respectful, and
supportive environment for clients and staff. This may involve reducing waiting times, improving resources, and
ensuring appropriate staffing levels. Clear policies on managing aggression and violence and a zero-tolerance
approach to such behaviors are crucial (Rosen et al., 2018). In situations where violence occurs, a thorough risk
assessment ensures the safety of all involved and helps in developing appropriate management strategies for future
incidents. The implementation of restrictive measures, such as seclusion and restraint, should be used as a last
resort and only when less invasive strategies are ineffective and safety is at immediate risk. It is more appropriate to
handle aggressive/escalating behaviors by employing client engagement through therapeutic communication,
respecting the wishes and personal space of the client, and suggesting alternative physical activities such as
walking.

Setting Boundaries
Setting boundaries with angry and aggressive clients is critical to effective clinical practice. It protects the safety of
the health-care professional and the client, supports the therapeutic relationship, and fosters an environment
conducive to effective client care. A crucial first step is maintaining a calm, nonthreatening demeanor and utilizing
284  9 · Social and Emotional Concerns

     active listening to understand the client's frustrations and fears. Validating the client's feelings without condoning
     aggressive behavior can help to de-escalate the situation. It is essential to set clear and explicit behavioral
     expectations, such as respect for personal space and nonviolence, and to be consistent with consequences for
     violations of these boundaries. Providing clients with choices where possible can also help them regain control and
     reduce anger and aggression (Adeniyi & Puzi, 2021).

     Trauma-Informed Approach
     In clinical situations, addressing abuse and violence with sensitivity, awareness, and a trauma-informed approach is
     crucial. This entails understanding the widespread impact of trauma, recognizing signs and symptoms of trauma in
     clients, and responding by integrating knowledge about trauma into treatment planning. It is important to ensure
     that the environment is safe, trustworthy, and nurturing for individuals who have experienced abuse. Health-care
     professionals should respect clients' decisions about when and how much to disclose about their experiences
     because forcing the issue can lead to further traumatization. Finally, health-care professionals should empower
     survivors of abuse and violence by facilitating self-efficacy and resilience, encouraging them to take an active role in
     their recovery process (Doyle et al., 2022). This client-centered approach recognizes the individual as the expert on
     their experience and is key in fostering healing and growth.

     Client Engagement
     Client engagement is a critical component of effectively mitigating violent incidents in health-care settings. Active
     engagement involves creating a respectful and therapeutic relationship with the client, which can help lessen
     feelings of distress and fear that often contribute to escalating behaviors (Pomey et al., 2015).

     Client engagement entails involvement in the decision-making process. When clients are included in decision-
     making about their care, it can foster a sense of control, reduce feelings of powerlessness, and minimize the
     likelihood of agitation or aggression. Shared decision-making can involve explaining procedures, discussing
     treatment options, and seeking the client's input and preferences (Pomey et al., 2015).

     Client engagement in developing a personalized de-escalation plan may enhance the effectiveness of these
     strategies. This plan would include the client's triggers, signs of escalation, and preferred de-escalation techniques.
     Client engagement is a critical part of de-escalation, with key components of open communication, shared decision-
     making, and personalized care planning (Crisis Prevention Institute, 2022).

     De-escalation
     The concept of de-escalation involves recognizing early signs of agitation or aggression, such as changes in a
     client's body language, tone of voice, or behavior to prevent an escalating situation from becoming harmful or
     violent by reducing the intensity and reestablishing communication with the individual involved (Spencer et al.,
     2018). De-escalation in health-care settings is vital in managing anger, aggression, and potential violence.

     Techniques for de-escalation include using a calm, reassuring tone of voice, maintaining appropriate body language,
     actively listening, and demonstrating empathy. Health-care providers should communicate empathetically and
     nonjudgmentally, validating the individual's feelings and concerns. It is crucial to ensure the individual's safety and
     the safety of others. This might involve creating physical space, reducing environmental stimuli, or calling for
     additional assistance in more severe cases (Goodman et al., 2020).

     More specifically, de-escalation involves employing active listening and empathy to understand the client's
     perspective. By actively listening without judgment and acknowledging their feelings, nurses can establish rapport
     and defuse escalating tension. Additionally, utilizing nonthreatening body language, such as maintaining a calm
     posture and speaking in a soft tone, helps convey a sense of reassurance and safety. Redirecting attention away
     from the source of agitation to a more calming topic or environment can further aid in de-escalation. These
     techniques, when combined with a comprehensive understanding of individualized client triggers, contribute
     significantly to the creation of a safer and more supportive care environment (Khan et al., 2021). Creating a
     therapeutic environment that promotes resilience and adherence to the rights and dignity of clients, even in the face
     of aggression, is paramount in mental health settings.

     Training Staff
     Staff training is essential to preventing and managing abuse and violence in health-care settings. Structured de-
     escalation training programs, such as the Crisis Prevention Institute's Nonviolent Crisis Intervention Program, have

     Access for free at openstax.org
9.3 · Anger, Abuse, and Violence                                                                                          285

effectively taught health-care providers these de-escalation techniques and are recommended for all health-care
staff (Crisis Prevention Institute, 2020). Regular debriefing sessions after such incidents can help staff cope with
their emotions and understand that such incidents reflect not their clinical competence but a part of the complex
human behavior in stressful circumstances (Richardson et al., 2019).

In addition, staff should receive training in recognizing and managing traumatic responses often seen in clients who
have experienced abuse. This requires education on trauma-informed care principles emphasizing understanding,
empathy, and respect for the client's trauma history (Muskett, 2014). Training should also include clear instructions
on organizational policies and procedures related to managing violence and abuse, such as reporting incidents and
implementing safety measures like medication, seclusion, or restraints, should they be necessary (NICE, 2015).
Training should also address staff well-being and self-care, including strategies for coping with the emotional impact
of encountering violence and abuse in the workplace (Nowrouzi-Kia et al., 2019).

The Use of PRN Medication to Manage Violent Clients
The primary purpose of using pro re nata (PRN) medications is to ensure the safety and comfort of the client, other
clients, and staff. The most commonly used PRN medications include antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, and
antihistamines, which have sedative effects (van Schalkwyk et al., 2018). Antipsychotic medications, such as
haloperidol or risperidone, can be administered when the client exhibits violent behavior or aggression linked to
psychotic symptoms (Einberger et al., 2020). Benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam or diazepam, are frequently used
in managing acute agitation due to their rapid onset of action (Amore et al., 2021). Atypical antipsychotics and
antihistamines may also be administered for their calming effects, especially when traditional methods are
insufficient or contraindicated (Garakani et al., 2020). It is critical to note, however, that while PRN medications can
be useful, they should be used cautiously and in conjunction with a broader therapeutic strategy. Overreliance on
PRN medications can lead to unnecessary sedation, mask underlying conditions, or result in physical dependence
(Mardani et al., 2022).

        CLINICAL SAFETY AND PROCEDURES (QSEN)

Safety: Procedures for Initiating PRN to Manage Behavioral Crises

Pro re nata (PRN): This Latin term refers to medication taken "as needed." It is frequently used in psychiatric
settings to manage behavioral crises, including violent or aggressive behavior.

Common PRN medications: The most commonly used PRN medications for managing violent behavior include
antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone), benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam, diazepam), and antihistamines.
These medications often have calming or sedative effects.

Role of PRN medication: PRN medication is crucial in ensuring the safety and comfort of the client, other clients, and
staff members. It can help de-escalate acute episodes of aggression or violence often associated with psychotic
symptoms or agitation.

Cautious use: PRN medications should be used judiciously; overreliance can lead to unnecessary sedation, mask
underlying conditions, or result in physical dependence. They are not a substitute for a comprehensive treatment
plan but a part of it.

Broad therapeutic strategy: PRN medications should be incorporated into a broader therapeutic strategy that
includes regular medication management, psychological therapies, and environmental modifications to reduce the
frequency of behavioral crises. It is essential to have a health-care professional involved in any decisions regarding
PRN medications.

The Use of Seclusion and Restraint to Intervene with Violent Clients
Seclusion and restraint are occasionally used interventions in health-care settings to manage violent or aggressive
behavior and to ensure the safety of the client, other clients, and staff. These techniques should be used as last-
resort measures, when all less restrictive interventions have been ineffective, and only used as long as necessary
(Fletcher et al., 2019).

Confining a client in a room from which the client cannot freely exit, called seclusion, is used when the client poses
286  9 · Social and Emotional Concerns

     an immediate danger to themselves or others. It provides the client with a safe, quiet environment to de-escalate
     without causing harm (Oostermeijer et al., 2021). The technique where physical or mechanical means restrict a
     client's movement is called restraint. Physical restraint involves health-care staff physically holding a client to
     prevent harm, while mechanical restraint devices, such as straps or belts, restrict movement (Chieze et al., 2019).
     While these interventions can be necessary in some cases, they are not without risks and ethical concerns. They can
     be traumatic experiences for clients, potentially resulting in physical injury, emotional distress, and undermining
     therapeutic relationships (Chieze et al., 2019). As a result, their use should always be accompanied by a thorough
     risk assessment, clear documentation, and follow-up care.

     Professional guidelines and policies often suggest that seclusion and restraint should only be used in emergency
     situations as a last resort and should be discontinued as soon as the client is no longer a danger to themselves or
     others. Furthermore, there should be a commitment to restraint-free care, and efforts should be made to develop
     and implement preventative strategies to manage aggressive behavior and reduce the use of these interventions
     (American Psychiatric Nurses Association, 2018).

             PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

     Controversy Surrounding the Use of Seclusion and Restraint in Clinical Environments

     Seclusion and restraint are considered last-resort interventions to manage violent or aggressive behavior in health-
     care settings. They are only to be used (1) when all less restrictive methods have proven ineffective, and (2) for as
     short a duration as possible. These methods can be traumatic for clients. They might cause emotional distress and
     physical injury, negatively impacting therapeutic relationships. The potential for harm raises ethical concerns about
     client rights and autonomy. For these reasons, there is ongoing debate about the efficacy of these interventions
     (Hodel, 2023). Some studies suggest that these methods do not necessarily decrease the frequency of violent
     incidents and may even lead to increased agitation in some clients. In fact, the use of seclusion and restraint has
     been criticized as a potential violation of clients' human rights. Concerns about misuse or overuse, particularly in
     vulnerable populations, have led to calls for stricter regulation and oversight. The growing emphasis on restraint-
     free care focuses on preventive strategies, such as de-escalation techniques, crisis intervention training, and client-
     centered care plans. The goal is to reduce reliance on these measures and promote a more humane approach to
     managing aggressive behavior (Hodel, 2023).

Summary

9.1 Death and Dying

The section delves into the multifaceted aspects surrounding death and dying, exploring social, emotional, and
cultural dimensions. It explains the social concerns intertwined with end-of-life experiences, shedding light on
societal attitudes, stigmas, and the impact on individuals and families facing mortality, specifically in the areas of
assisted dying, abortion, and suicide. Furthermore, it delves into the intricate emotional landscape, discussing grief,
coping mechanisms, and the psychological intricacies involved in processing impending loss. It emphasizes nursing
responsibilities at the end of life, as well as the importance of nursing self-care to avoid burnout. Central to the
section are cultural considerations, emphasizing the diverse beliefs, rituals, and practices related to death and dying
across various cultures and religions. It underscores the significance of cultural competence in health care,
emphasizing how understanding and respecting diverse cultural perspectives are essential in providing
compassionate and holistic end-of-life care.

9.2 Grief and Loss

Grief and loss are profound, deeply emotional experiences that occur in response to significant events, such as the
death of a loved one, the ending of a relationship, the loss of a job, or a decline in health. This emotional journey is
unique to every individual and does not follow a specific, predictable course.

The experience of grief and loss typically encompasses a range of emotional states. These can include feelings of
shock or denial, sadness, anger, guilt, anxiety, and even relief. It is common for individuals to experience physical
symptoms, such as fatigue, changes in appetite or sleep patterns, and physical discomfort. Kübler-Ross's model, the
five stages of grief--denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance--conceptualizes grief. It is important to
remember that not everyone will go through all these stages or in the given order.

While grief and loss are incredibly challenging to navigate socially, emotionally, and spiritually, they are a universal
part of the human experience. Many people, including nurses, emerge from these experiences with a new
perspective and a deeper understanding of their resilience (Murray, 2023).

9.3 Anger, Abuse, and Violence

Understanding the emotion of anger is integral in health care, affecting client care and professional interactions.
Unmanaged anger can lead to aggression, violence, and abuse, which pose significant problems affecting client
safety, staff well-being, and health-care outcomes (Khan et al., 2021). Abuse and violence refer to harmful
behaviors directed toward an individual or group of individuals that cause physical, sexual, or psychological harm
and suffering. These harmful behaviors can take various forms, including, but not limited to, physical assault, sexual
assault, verbal abuse, harassment, and emotional manipulation. Some of the risk factors for anger and violence
include stress, having experienced abuse, unfairness, strained relationships, and disparities in health-care access.

The effects of abuse and violence can be profound, leading to physical injuries, psychological issues, and, in some
cases, chronic health problems or death. Anger, abuse, and violence can lead to job loss, loss of close ties, trauma,
substance misuse, and incarceration, and impacts on victims of abuse are far-ranging. Handling abuse in clinical
settings is a challenge for health-care providers and involves, among other things, learning de-escalation techniques
and offering trauma-informed care to clients.

    7. How can nurses effectively manage and mitigate the impact of anger and violence in a clinical setting?

What Should the Nurse Do?

Gloria, a seventy-five-year-old widow, arrives at the oncology clinic accompanied by her daughter, Emily. She has
been diagnosed with advanced-stage lung cancer. Gloria presents with symptoms of increasing pain, fatigue, and
shortness of breath. Her medical history includes a previous diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), which has exacerbated in recent months. Vital signs show an elevated blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg, a
heart rate of 95 beats per minute, and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. During the assessment, Gloria
expresses concerns about the impact of her illness on her family and worries about being a burden. Emily mentions
their family's cultural background and the importance of certain end-of-life rituals. Recognizing the social,
emotional, and cultural dimensions of Gloria's concerns, the health-care team aims to provide holistic and culturally
sensitive care.

    1. What nonverbal cues from Gloria and verbal cues from Emily might indicate that cultural considerations are
        crucial in addressing their concerns about end-of-life care?

    2. Considering Gloria's COPD diagnosis and advanced-stage lung cancer, prioritize hypotheses regarding the
        emotional concerns that are likely to have the most significant impact on her well-being. How might these
        emotional concerns influence her overall care plan?

Frank, a sixty-year-old male, visits the outpatient clinic following the recent loss of his wife to cancer. He presents
with symptoms of overwhelming sadness, difficulty sleeping, and social withdrawal. Frank's medical history
includes hypertension, for which he takes medication regularly. Vital signs reveal an elevated blood pressure of 140/
85 mm Hg, a heart rate of 92 beats per minute, and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. During the
assessment, Frank expresses feelings of guilt about not being able to do more for his wife and struggles to engage in
conversation about his grief. Recognizing the concepts of grief and loss, the nurse aims to understand the social
factors influencing Frank's response and be mindful of the potential impact of grief on both the client and the
health-care provider.

    3. How can the nurse create a safe and empathetic environment that encourages open communication about
        grief?

    4. If the nurse implements interventions to address Frank's grief, what specific indicators of progress or positive
        outcomes would you monitor to assess the effectiveness of the interventions for both Frank and the nurse?

Competency-Based Assessments

    1. Provide two examples of social concerns that individuals and their families may experience when facing death
        and dying, and begin a discussion on how these concerns might affect an individual's end-of-life experience.

    2. Take on the role of a nurse caring for a client who has different cultural practices than your own. You can
        choose the culture. How can you best navigate these cultural differences and ensure respectful and client-
        centered care?

    3. Critical thinking is crucial in understanding grief concepts. You are a nursing student working with a client who
        exhibits complicated grief reactions. List the factors that might contribute to complicated grief, and
        brainstorm ways that you can adapt your interventions to address this complexity.

    4. You have been asked to name some factors that may influence the effectiveness of group therapy for
        individuals with social anxiety. As part of your answer, discuss how cultural factors are relevant and can
        impact the dynamics of group therapy.

    5. Explore ways to differentiate between normal grief reactions and signs of complicated grief. What
        interventions can you implement to address complicated grief effectively?

    6. Consider the impact of grief and loss on emotional well-being as a caregiver. Brainstorm ways to proactively
        manage emotional responses to prevent burnout and maintain professional effectiveness in providing
        empathetic care.

    7. Outline three ways in which anger can manifest in the clinical environment and potentially affect client
        outcomes. How can nurses proactively create a therapeutic environment that minimizes anger-related
        challenges and promotes positive client experiences?
292 9 · References

    8. In a scenario where a client expresses anger due to frustration with their treatment plan, critically analyze
        how the nurse can explore the underlying causes of this anger. How can the nurse employ communication
        strategies to address the client's frustration and enhance collaboration?

    9. Reflect on a situation where a nurse observes a colleague struggling to manage their anger in response to a
        challenging client interaction. How can the observing nurse provide support to their colleague, and what
        resources or interventions can be implemented to promote a healthy work environment?

CHAPTER OUTLINE
10.1 Client Rights and Protections
10.2 Legal Issues Relating to Mental Health Nursing
10.3 Ethical Standards in Mental Health Nursing
INTRODUCTION There are very important connections between psychiatry/mental health and the law. They both
manage social behavior as well as responsibilities and relationships within society. Mental health care seeks to
understand behavior and to improve or maintain quality of life. Law seeks to manage the outcomes of behavior to
encourage functioning within groups of people in society. They both work together to ensure the safety of the
individual and the group. The mental health nurse must understand the law to protect themselves, their clients, as
well as society as a whole. Keeping clients and the nurses who care for them safe is of primary importance. The best
way to protect nurse, client, and society is to be knowledgeable of the laws that govern practice at both the federal
and state levels as well as the rights and responsibilities of the client.

10.1 Client Rights and Protections

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Explain the importance of upholding HIPAA rules within the mental health practice setting
    · Describe the protections put in place by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
Mental health clients are potentially a vulnerable population and therefore need to be protected from exploitation or
308  10 · Legal and Ethical Guidelines

     abuse. There are federal and state statutes that lay out these protections as well as organizational policies and
     procedures intended to protect client rights. Client rights include concepts like confidentiality of protected health
     information, covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and the right to purchase
     health insurance, covered by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). States can issue laws that
     offer additional protections, as long as they uphold the federal protections.

     HIPAA

     The federal government has enacted multiple legal protections so that protected health information remains private
     and protected. This has become very important in the digital age where health information is easier to access by
     health-care providers and clients, but also by those who would use the information for secondary gain.

     In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) into law
     (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2022b). This federal law (and accompanying regulations that
     implement the law) protects sensitive client health information from being disclosed without the client's consent or
     knowledge. This law covers clients' protected health information (PHI), information included in a medical record
     that can be used to identify an individual and that was used, created, or disclosed in the process of providing a
     health-care service. Until 1996, confidentiality in medical records was minimally protected, though the records were
     harder to access since they were primarily paper-based (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, n.d.).
     HIPAA gives clients more control over their health information by setting boundaries on and requiring written
     consent for the use and release of health records. At the time of the first visit to a provider and in the mail from the
     health plan, providers must offer clients a HIPAA notice--which must be signed acknowledging receipt--that
     describes how the health information is shared and includes health privacy rights. If a client refuses to sign the
     acknowledgment, this must be documented.

     HIPAA requires covered health-care entities to provide training to staff to ensure understanding of HIPAA rules and
     regulations. Covered health-care entities are defined by the HIPAA rules as health plans, health-care
     clearinghouses, and health-care providers, but only if they transmit information related to financial or administrative
     activities related to health care. During HIPAA training, employees should be made aware of the possible penalties
     for HIPAA violations. Figure 10.2 lays out the three rules of privacy, security, and breach notification for HIPAA
     compliance.

     Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2023). (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

Geographic Location: Oregon

George is a nurse in a mental health inpatient facility in an affluent area that sometimes has wealthy people
admitted for drug, alcohol, or psychiatric treatment. Recently, the facility admitted a celebrity; rumors spread
among the staff, but they kept it quiet. George was not involved in this client's care and was not assigned to that unit
during their stay. However, he was unable to avoid the temptation of looking into the person's medical record
despite them being under an alias. He had undergone HIPAA training and knew it was wrong, but thought that he
would not share the information, so what is the harm? After the client was discharged, regulators audited the chart
and found that not only George, but four others who were not involved in this person's care had accessed the chart
without appropriate cause, reason, or permission. George and the four others were fired for HIPAA violations and
George was reported to his state board of nursing and is awaiting a determination of disciplinary action. All health-
care professionals must be aware that they leave a "footprint" whenever they enter the records of a client.

HIPAA compliance rules apply to hospitals as well as a variety of other types of health-care treatment settings.
There are four potential outcomes that may result from HIPAA noncompliance: (1) the employer may deal with the
violation internally, (2) the violator could be terminated, (3) the violator could face sanctions from professional
boards, and/or (4) the violator could face criminal charges, including fines and imprisonment.

Five common HIPAA violations include:

    · the loss of a device, such as the theft of a computer that contains client information
    · downloading a computer virus on a health-care agency computer that allows personal client information to be

        accessed or leaked such as through portable media or email
    · employee dishonesty while accessing files, such as a nurse who accesses client information that they do not

        have the authority to see
    · improper filing and disposing of documents, such as a nurse who throws lab results that include client-

        identifying information into the public trash receptacle at the nurse station
    · releasing client information after the authorization to release period expires (Intraprise Health, 2023)

The Affordable Care Act

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) or Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed into law in 2010 by
President Barack Obama and continues to be a politically charged topic. Its original premise, which continues, is to
expand access to health insurance to uninsured Americans. The main points of the law were to expand Medicaid
eligibility, create a Health Insurance Marketplace, and prevent insurance companies from denying coverage due to
preexisting conditions. The ACA also requires insurers to cover a list of essential health benefits. It was also
designed to reform the insurance industry to reduce the costs of coverage and to include premium tax credits and
cost-sharing reductions to help lower expenses for lower-income families and individuals. According to the
Affordable Care Act (ACA), employers must provide health insurance to their employees. Certain small firms that
meet the requirements can get tax credits. To assist consumers and small businesses in obtaining insurance, the
law established insurance exchanges that are headquartered in multiple states. By the ACA law, young adults are
allowed to remain on their parents' insurance policies until the age of 26. ACA creates state rate reviews for
insurance premium increases, forbids lifetime financial ceilings on insurance coverage, and restricts the use of
yearly caps. It forbids insurance companies from terminating or withdrawing coverage, as well as from refusing to
cover children with preexisting conditions. The ACA improved access to insurance and health care for many
Americans; it also added coverage for preventative care and preexisting conditions that was lacking in many existing
prior plans. Some of the downsides include increases in premiums, new taxes to support costs, a limited enrollment
period, and reduced hours of employees to avoid providing medical insurance (U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services, 2022a).

     10.2 Legal Issues Relating to Mental Health Nursing

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Discuss the laws applicable to nursing practice
         · Explain the laws and rights protecting clients receiving health care
         · Understand nursing challenges to protecting these client rights
         · Describe the role of the nurse in forensic services

     Nurses should understand and keep abreast of any legal issues that affect health care in order to protect their hard-
     earned licenses, jobs, institutions, and clients. Nursing practice changes frequently in terms of best practices and
     emerging evidence; it also changes as health care and technology innovations and political developments lead to
     new laws and ethical issues. Nurses are accountable to practice according to current laws and standards. Federal
     and state legislatures direct practice with laws relating to negligence or that require reporting child and elder abuse.
     Federal agencies, such as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, create regulations to supplement and
     detail compliance with the federal and state laws. These regulations cover topics like staff-to-client ratios, proper
     training, the use of seclusion and restraints, and much more. Moreover, state boards of nursing establish and
     maintain their own regulations governing the scope of nursing practice, including the requirements and limitations
     for nursing practice and licensure. The following sections describe the most significant legal topics that nurses may
     encounter while caring for clients. Knowledge and understanding of these concepts will help assist the nurse with
     decision-making and in providing better care.

     Laws Applicable to Nursing

     Nurses must follow federal and state laws, administrative regulations, institutional policies, and professional
     standards. In terms of federal and state laws, criminal law is a system of laws that punishes individuals who commit
     crimes. Conviction for a crime requires that the prosecution show evidence to prove that the defendant is guilty
     beyond a reasonable doubt. Civil law, on the other hand, focuses on the rights, responsibilities, and legal
     relationships between private citizens, and possibly involves compensation to an injured party. The evidentiary
     standard to prove wrongdoing in a civil case is lower than in a criminal case. Other standards nurses must follow
     include the state nurse practice acts, which set professional regulations for the scope of nursing practice, licensure
     requirements, and enforcement procedures within a given state.

     Criminal Challenges
     Nurses are not immune from criminal prosecution if they break the law. Nurses have been prosecuted for crimes,
     such as negligent homicide, insurance fraud, theft of narcotics, manslaughter, and falsifying medical records. There
     are many examples of nurses being charged with crimes. One example took place in November of 2021 and
     September of 2022 when a nurse in Pennsylvania took narcotics from clients and attempted to cover it up by
     tampering with records. She is now facing charges of theft of drugs and tampering of records (Oltmann, 2023).
     There are many other ways that nurses can face criminal charges for various crimes against their clients. It is the
     nurse's responsibility to practice responsibly, ethically, morally, and with care to protect themselves and their
     clients.

     Torts
     One type of civil case nurses may encounter in practice is a tort, an act of commission or omission that gives rise to
     injury or harm to another and amounts to a civil wrong for which courts impose liability. Tort law exists to
     compensate clients injured by negligent practice, provide corrective judgment, and deter negligence. An intentional
     tort is a wrong that the defendant knew (or should have known) would be caused by their actions. Examples of
     intentional torts include assault, battery, false imprisonment, slander, and libel. An unintentional tort occurs when
     a defendant's actions or inactions were reckless or unreasonably unsafe. Unintentional torts can result from acts of
     commission (i.e., doing something a reasonable nurse would not have done) or omission (i.e., failing to do something
     a reasonable nurse would do).

     Assault and Battery
     Assault and battery are intentional torts (not to be confused with the separate crimes of assault and battery). In a
     civil context, assault means intentionally putting another person in reasonable apprehension, that is fear, of

10.2 · Legal Issues Relating to Mental Health Nursing                                                                       311

imminent harmful or offensive contact. The intentional causation of harmful or offensive contact with another
person without that person's consent is called battery. Physical harm does not need to occur in order to be charged
with assault or battery. In fact, assault does not even involve a physical touch, although battery does. Assault and
battery often arise in health care in relation to a client's right to refuse treatment. For example, a hospitalized client
can refuse to take prescribed medication. If a nurse forcibly administers medication without that client's consent, it
could be ruled battery in a court of law. Keep in mind, however, that it may be justified to force administration of a
medication based on a provider's order in an emergency situation to prevent imminent harm.

False Imprisonment
Another intentional tort is false imprisonment, defined as an act of restraining another person and causing that
person to be confined in a bounded area. This tort often comes up in the use of restraints or seclusion, which is one
reason why nurses must be vigilant in following agency policy related to the use of physical restraints and seclusion
and must carefully monitor clients who are restrained or secluded.

Restraints are devices used in health-care settings, when alternative, less restrictive interventions are not effective,
to prevent clients from causing harm to themselves or others. A restraint restricts a client's freedom of movement
without the permission of the person. Seclusion, by contrast, is defined as the confinement of a client in a locked
room or an area from which they cannot exit on their own. Seclusion should only be used to manage violent or
destructive behavior. The chapter will revisit restraints and seclusion in more detail later.

Slander and Libel
Slander and libel are also intentional torts. Spoken defamation is called slander, and written defamation is called
libel. Defamation of character occurs when an individual makes negative, malicious, and untrue remarks about
another person to damage their reputation. Nurses must take care in their oral communication and documentation
to avoid defaming clients or coworkers, or they risk a civil suit for damages. For example, if one nurse talked about a
client to another nurse out loud saying, "Did you hear that this client did . . ." while knowing that it was untrue, it
could be an example of slander. An example of libel is a nurse making an untrue social media post disparaging a
client.

Fraud
When one individual deceives another for personal gain, it is called fraud. It is an intentional tort and can be charged
as a crime. A nurse may be charged with fraud for documenting interventions not performed (in order to secure
payment for them) or for altering documentation to cover up an error. Fraud can result in civil and criminal charges,
as well as suspension or revocation of a nurse's license.

Negligence and Malpractice
Negligence and malpractice are unintentional torts and may be the area with which nurses are most familiar. The
failure to exercise the ordinary care a reasonable person would use in similar circumstances is called negligence.
For instance, a Wisconsin civil jury instruction states, "A person is not using ordinary care and is negligent, if the
person, without intending to do harm, does something (or fails to do something) that a reasonable person would
recognize as creating an unreasonable risk of injury or damage to a person or property" (Wisconsin Civil Jury
Instructions Committee of the Wisconsin Judicial Conference, 2023). Negligence committed by a health
professional with a license is called malpractice. When a nurse provides negligent care, it is an example of
malpractice. The guidelines that create a baseline of appropriate (reasonable) professional conduct for nurses are
the standards of care. For instance, a court will measure a nurse's behavior against the standard of care to
determine if the behavior was negligent. The standard of care is generally defined by what a reasonable nurse in a
comparable situation, with similar circumstances, education, and training would do.

Medical errors, a potential type of negligence, are a problem in nursing often highlighted in the media. Nurses are
humans and make mistakes. How nurses and administration handle those mistakes is often the difference between
being negligent or not. Potential for error is one reason why a system of checks and balances is built into medicine
administration, with EMR systems with scanning systems, pharmacy systems and pharmacists, and two nurse
verification for dangerous drugs.

But errors do not stop with medication administration. All areas of nursing practice can lead to errors, from
documentation to equipment injuries, client falls, infections, and others. Even with all of the protections put into
312  10 · Legal and Ethical Guidelines

     place by law and policy, the human factor has its part and mistakes happen. For example, a nurse may grab the
     wrong antibiotic and skip steps due to being behind with their work and cause a reaction. A responsible nurse will
     then self-report the mistake as per facility policy and notify the client's provider as soon as the error is noted so that
     any possible adverse effect can be mitigated as soon as possible. Taking responsibility for an error may be the one
     thing that prevents the revocation of a nurse's license, though this is not guaranteed depending on the degree of the
     error and the level of adverse effect. If the error were to result in a client's death, there may be consequences no
     matter how responsible the nurse has been to self-report.

     The best way to avoid malpractice is to be vigilant and follow protocol. There are some areas of negligence or
     malpractice that are specific to mental health. For example, a client may express thoughts of suicidal ideation. If the
     nurse does not act on those expressions and place the safeguards as per policy and the client acts on those
     thoughts, the nurse is responsible for the negligent action of not acting and therefore causing harm when it could
     have been avoided. Not performing timely and appropriate assessment and evaluation can also be malpractice. For
     example, not assessing the client who is restrained or not assessing for possibility of self-harm are forms of
     malpractice.

     In order to determine the amount of money owed a victim of malpractice, courts examine economic damages, which
     are actual and measurable costs, disability or disfigurement, physical impairment, loss of life, and others. Courts
     also take "pain and suffering" into consideration, which is a more nebulous concept that is more difficult to quantify.
     For that reason, currently twenty-nine states have implemented tort reform, placing a cap on "pain and suffering"
     dollar amounts. The damages awarded vary greatly based on many factors, including severity of injury, the state that
     the case is brought in, the severity of the negligence, and the named plaintiffs.

             REAL RN STORIES

     Nurse: RaDonda Vaught
     Years in Practice: Two
     Clinical Setting: Large university hospital
     Geographic Location: Tennessee

     In March 2022, nurse RaDonda Vaught was found guilty of criminally negligent homicide and gross neglect of an
     impaired adult. The client was a seventy-five-year-old woman who was recovering from a brain injury. She was to
     get a PET scan in the radiology department prior to being discharged. She was prescribed Versed, a sedative, to
     calm her. The nurse, Vaught, mistakenly gave the client vecuronium, which is a powerful paralytic. This led to total
     muscle paralysis, stopped her from being able to breathe, and caused her death. Vaught also failed to monitor the
     client after administering the vecuronium, so she did not catch her error in enough time to reverse the paralysis.
     Despite the fact that the nurse did take the correct steps to report her error, in the peer review process at her
     institution, she was fired. After a subsequent review from the state board of nursing, she lost her license. The district
     attorney charged her with a crime, and the case went to court. She was sentenced to three years of supervised
     probation. It was a very public court case, watched by health-care professionals all over the United States.

     Duty to Warn and Protect
     In addition to state and federal criminal and civil laws regarding nursing practice, nurses and other mental health
     professionals have a duty to warn and protect third parties when they may be in danger from a client. This duty falls
     outside of HIPAA regulations, meaning that it does not violate privacy and confidentiality provisions. This duty
     includes assessing and predicting the likelihood of a client's threat of violence or harm toward another person or
     groups of people and taking action to protect the identified victims. Duty to warn entails notifying the threatened
     party and local authorities, such as police and the Department of Health and Human Services, of the threat so that
     they may put protections in place. The duty to protect is a little less formal than the duty to warn. It can include
     possible commitment, development of a "no-harm" contract, teaching or arranging for anger management, referring
     for medical evaluation, or increasing therapy sessions and/or telephone contact. The most common threats that
     trigger the duty to warn are injury and homicide, but it also has come up with regard to STIs, child abuse or neglect,
     incest, and battery.

Mandatory Reporting of Suspected Abuse or Neglect
Many states also require health professionals to report suspected neglect or abuse, called mandatory reporting.
State laws vary, but they generally include a definition of reportable abuse, a list of professionals required to report
abuse, and the government agency designated to receive and investigate the reports. Nurses and other health
professionals are referred to as mandated reporters because they are required by state law to report suspected
neglect or abuse of children, adults at risk, and older adults. Adults at risk are adults who have a physical or mental
condition that impairs their ability to care for their own needs. This is also defined by state statute and will vary from
state to state. Nurses need to know the law and their role in the reporting requirements for the population that they
work with.

Nurse Practice Acts
The board of nursing is the state-specific licensing and regulatory body that enforces the state practice act and
issues nursing licenses to qualified candidates. If nurses do not follow the standards and scope of practice set forth
by the nurse practice act, they can have their nursing license revoked by that same board of nursing. Each state is
different and has the power to create regulations to detail, implement, and enforce the more general state nurse
practice act statutes, but regulations cannot violate the laws set forth by the state. Just like state laws cannot
violate those laws set forth by the federal government. Each state's nurse practice act also determines the
disciplinary action for violating the act, such as a fine, reprimand, reeducation, or loss of nursing license. It is up to
the nurse to know the specific state laws for the state or states in which they are licensed.

Nursing students are legally accountable for the quality of care they provide to clients just as nurses are
accountable. Students are expected to recognize the limits of their knowledge and experience and appropriately
alert individuals in authority regarding situations that are beyond their competency. A violation of the standards of
practice constitutes unprofessional conduct and can result in the board of nursing denying a license to a nursing
graduate.

The Laws and Rights Protecting Clients

There exist both state and federal laws and regulations to shield client rights. One example, in addition to HIPAA
and the ACA mentioned earlier, includes the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005, which encourages
reporting medical errors. A patient bill of rights lists the minimum standards for the ways that clients can expect to
be treated by health-care professionals.

Patient's Bill of Rights Overview
Client rights serve as a guideline for client and staff professional behavior. There are four fundamental client
rights--the right to courtesy, the right to respect, the right to dignity, and the right to timely, responsive attention to
client needs--but they have been elaborated upon and expanded over time and with changes in society and health
care.

In 1973, the Patient's Bill of Rights was first adopted by the American Hospital Association (AHA) to protect clients.
Client rights were developed with the expectation that hospitals and health-care institutions would support these
rights while delivering effective client care. Although not legally binding, the Patient's Bill of Rights provides clients
with goals and expectations on how they are to be treated during a hospital stay. The Patient's Bill of Rights
embraces key areas regarding client rights related to treatment decisions, respect and nondiscrimination, access to
and confidentiality of medical records, refusal of treatment, and the least restrictive treatment. Clients with
psychiatric-mental health disorders have the same rights as other persons.

The AHA Patient's Bill of Rights title was replaced with the name Patient Care Partnership (PCP) in 2001 to promote
the concept that health care is a partnership between a client and a provider. The PCP utilizes plain language to
inform clients about what they should expect during a hospital stay regarding rights and responsibilities. The PCP
states that any hospitalized client has the right to quality hospital care, such as a clean and safe environment,
involvement in care planning and decision-making, protection of privacy, assistance when discharging or leaving the
hospital, and assistance with billing claims (AHA, 2003).

             LINK TO LEARNING

     The Patient Care Partnership (https://openstax.org/r/77PtCarePartner) replaced the Patient Bills of Rights in 2001.

     Mental Health Bill of Rights
     Psychiatric-mental health clients deserve to be treated with dignity and have the same rights and protections as
     other health-care clients. Historically, individuals with mental health conditions have endured abuse and
     discrimination. According to Mental Health America (MHA), "From leaving people to languish in overcrowded state
     hospitals to lobotomies and forced sterilization, the treatment of those with mental health conditions is a dark stain
     on our history as a nation," (2023, para 2) The Mental Health Bill of Rights recognizes that psychiatric-mental health
     clients may be at increased risk for mistreatment and abuse. With that in mind, the Mental Health Bill of Rights
     includes liberty and autonomy, protection from seclusion and restraint, community inclusion, access to services,
     and privacy (MHA, 2023). Clients have the following rights:

         · the right to be informed promptly of their rights at the time of admission and periodically thereafter, in
             language and terms appropriate to such person's condition and ability to understand

         · the right to assert grievances with respect to infringement of the rights, including the right to have such
             grievances considered in a fair, timely, and impartial grievance procedure provided for or by the program or
             facility

         · the right of access to any available rights protection service within a program, facility, or state mental health
             system designed to protect and advocate the rights of individuals with mental illness, and the right to a
             qualified advocate for the purpose of receiving assistance to understand, exercise, and protect the rights
             described in this section and in other provisions of law

         · the right to exercise one's rights without reprisal, including reprisal in the form of denial of any appropriate,
             available treatment

         · the right to referral as appropriate to other providers of mental health services upon discharge (Conlon et al.,
             2019)

             LINK TO LEARNING

     The Bill of Rights for Mental Health (https://openstax.org/r/77MentalHltBOR) was enacted by the U.S. government
     and is updated on a regular basis. Its purpose is to guide mental health professionals in providing care that is safe,
     that maintains autonomy and dignity, and that is appropriate and reasonable.

     Client Right to Treatment
     The right to mental health treatment includes two components: the right to appropriate treatment and the right to
     an individualized, written treatment or service plan. The right to appropriate treatment and related services means
     that treatment occurs in a setting and under conditions that support personal liberty and restrict such liberty only
     when necessary to comply with treatment needs, laws, and judicial orders. The right to an individualized, written
     treatment plan means that the provider develops it promptly after admission, that treatment is based on the plan,
     that the health-care team periodically reviews and reassesses the treatment plan, and that the team appropriately
     revises the plan (Pirotte, 2022). The health-care team will include the professionals involved with the care for the
     client, including doctors, nurses, and therapists, and generally includes the client and family being involved in
     decision-making with the nurse maintaining the role of client advocate at such meetings.

     All clients have the right to participate in the planning of mental health services provided, including the development
     and periodic revision of the plan of care. They also have the right to be provided with a reasonable explanation for
     the treatment plan, in terms and language appropriate to their mental condition and general physical condition and
     ability to understand. The treatment plan should also outline the goals of treatment, the nature and significant
     possible adverse effects of recommended treatments, the rationale for why a particular treatment is considered
     appropriate, reasons why access to certain visitors may be restricted, and any appropriate and suitable substitute
     treatments, services, and types of providers of mental health services (Figure 10.3).

Emergency Treatment
Emergency treatment is the client right to receive care in the event they are in a life-or-death situation that requires
medical attention before providers can obtain consent. There are circumstances where a client is not able to
knowingly understand and intelligently make a decision. There are many reasons that a person may not have
capacity to make their own decisions, from trauma and medical reasons to mental health reasons, including
dementia, psychosis, substance misuse and acute intoxication or overdose, mania, among others. In these cases,
providers need to assess capacity, and if that person is deemed to lack capacity, the decisions for care usually can
be made by a surrogate decision-maker, such as a spouse or an adult child. There are certain circumstances when
emergency exceptions apply:
316  10 · Legal and Ethical Guidelines

         · a life- or limb-threatening situation
         · the client is without capacity to make decisions
         · there is no surrogate decision-maker available
         · time is of the essence, for example imminent risk of harm
         · under the circumstances, a reasonable person would consent

     Once the emergency has passed, providers can reassess capacity and if the client remains without capacity, the
     health-care team can connect with a surrogate decision-maker.

     The client right to treatment also includes continuity of care. An example of continuity of care is following up with
     clients after discharge. Haggerty et al. (2003) identified three types of continuity: informational continuity,
     management continuity, and relational continuity. Informational continuity involves tailoring a client's care based on
     their past events and personal circumstances. Management continuity involves reassessing the approach to ensure
     consistency in care as the client's needs change. Relational continuity involves maintaining the therapeutic
     relationship between a client and their providers (Haggerty et al., 2003).

     The Right to Be Treated Fairly and with Respect
     Every individual has the right to be treated fairly and with dignity and respect, meaning that a client has the right to
     be free from any threats and violence, the right to treatment without discrimination, and the right to be treated
     equally, regardless of age, gender, race, ethnicity, color, or disability. For example, when a nurse requests permission
     to enter a client's room or asks a client how they would like to be addressed, this communicates respect for the
     client as an individual. Respect also involves nurses introducing themselves to clients, specifying what they plan to
     do, and showing gratitude to clients who entrust them with their care (World Health Organization [WHO], 2023).

     The Right to Obtain One's Medical Record
     The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996, discussed earlier in the chapter,
     provides clients with a legal, enforceable right to see and receive copies upon request of their medical and other
     health records, including bills maintained by their health-care providers and health plans. A client can also request
     someone else's medical records if given permission in writing to act as their representative in accessing records.
     Health-care providers are required to provide copies of medical records within thirty days of the written request
     (HHS.gov, n.d.).

     The Right to Refuse Treatment
     Clients have the right to refuse treatment in the absence of informed, voluntary, written consent, except during an
     emergency documented by written order of a responsible mental health professional or in the case of a client
     committed by a court to a treatment program or facility. Clients also have the right to refuse to participate in
     research without an informed, voluntary, or written consent, and the right to appropriate protections in connection
     with participation. There are certain circumstances where the client cannot consent (or refuse) for themselves, such
     as clients with advanced dementia or intellectual disability. In these cases, a surrogate decision-maker is put in
     place to consent or refuse treatment.

     The Right to the Least Restrictive Treatment
     As a corollary to the idea that all clients have the right to be treated humanely in an environment that offers privacy
     and protection from harm (CorpusLegalis.com, n.d.), all clients also have the right to the least restrictive treatment.
     As mentioned earlier, nurses play a crucial role in the implementation of restrictive practices, such as seclusion and
     restraint. Guidelines vary by state and facility, but all agree that seclusion and restraints should only be used as a
     last resort after the providers have exhausted all attempts and techniques to de-escalate a situation. De-escalation
     techniques that nurses may use include using simple, nonthreatening language, setting clear boundaries,
     decreasing environmental stimuli, and providing diversions. Another option could be to offer the client an
     antianxiety medication. If no less restrictive measures work to de-escalate a situation, individuals who are at risk for
     behaviors that may result in harm to self or others may require the use of restraints (physical, chemical,
     environmental).

     In the event a client needs restraints, the nurse must follow the facility's policies and procedures and secure a
     medical order. In an extreme emergency, such as when a serious threat of harm to the client or others exists and
     only after all alternative interventions were unsuccessful, a nurse can apply the restraints without a medical order

for nonviolent restraints. The provider must put in place an order for the restraints as soon as possible after their
application, however, and the provider or trained RN must complete an in-person assessment within one hour of
initiation of restraints or seclusion and every twenty-four hours to renew the order. For violent or self-destructive
restraints, which are used for an imminent physical risk of harm to self or others, the provider must evaluate the
client in person prior to, during, and immediately after initiation of the restraint as well as place the order.

Federal regulations regarding seclusion and restraints require the client to be evaluated by an RN or provider within
four hours for adults, two hours for children and adolescents between the ages of nine and seventeen, and one hour
for children under nine years old (called the "4/2/1 rule"). A new order and a face-to-face evaluation are required
every twenty-four hours by the provider if restraints are still required (Electronic Code of Federal Regulations,
2023). Federal regulations also prevent the health-care provider from writing PRN (as necessary) orders for
restraints. This means that if a client is in restraints and then has them removed, and then later needs restraints
reapplied, this requires a new order. The procedure must be followed each time restraints are applied.

        LINK TO LEARNING

These guidelines from American Nurse Today (https://openstax.org/r/77restraints) include some practical examples
of restraint use, a restraint use decision tree, and critical thinking suggestions for restraint use.

Another consideration when using restraints involves required nursing care and documentation. A nurse must
understand and follow agency policy, which should meet or exceed guidelines set by federal and state laws and
regulations. For example, when a client is in restraints, the nurse must assess the client every fifteen minutes and
check vital signs, provide range-of-motion exercises, check skin integrity under the restraints, and provide fluids and
toileting every two hours. When documenting, the nurse must document the type of restraints, the reason for the
restraints, how long the client is in restraints, the care offered and provided during restraint use, and times care is
offered or provided. Documentation is part of the client record and is considered a legal document.

     The Right to Informed Consent
     The communication between a client and a health-care provider that results in agreement and permission by the
     client for treatment or services is called informed consent. Every client has a right to understand and ask questions
     prior to consenting to treatment. Informed consent, generally governed by state law and regulation, is the
     fundamental right of an individual to fully understand their health-care decisions before making those decisions.
     Most states allow a client to sue for battery if providers do not obtain consent before providing medical treatment.
     Informed consent requires that the client must voluntarily provide consent, must be mentally capable to consent
     and of legal age (eighteen or older), and must be properly informed. Proper information generally includes the client
     understanding the provider's explanation of the diagnosis, the reason for the treatment or procedure, chances of
     success, and available alternative treatments and their risks. The client also has the right to change their mind at
     any time.

     More specifically, the five elements required for documentation of informed consent include (1) disclosure of the
     nature of the procedure, (2) competency and comprehension of risks and benefits, (3) reasonable alternatives and
     voluntariness, (4) competence and understanding of risks or benefits of alternatives, and (5) the client's
     understanding of elements one through four as evidenced by the written consent (Shah et al., 2022). Disclosure is
     when a health-care provider offers information to clients about treatments or tests regarding the process, risks, and
     benefits, and allows a client to make informed decisions whether to undergo such treatments or tests. Client

competency and comprehension mean that the client is able to and understands the risks and benefits. It includes
having the knowledge and skills needed to understand risks and benefits and decide effectively. Reasonable
alternatives refer to the provider fully explaining available alternatives so that the client knows the options.
Voluntariness refers to clients giving their agreement free of any coercion or pressure. A written form that includes
all of this information is the actual informed consent.

There are several exceptions to the requirements of informed consent. One exception is when a client is
incapacitated, in which case the surrogate decision-maker provides the informed consent. Another exception is a
life-threatening emergency where there is not enough time to obtain consent. The law assumes that an unconscious
person would consent to emergency care if the client were conscious and able to consent. Likewise, "there is no
duty to disclose if the patient is so upset or mentally unstable that the provider reasonably believes that disclosure
would be detrimental to the patient's well-being. The burden of proof is on the provider to prove this."
(Lawshelf.com, 2023, para 30). Another exception is when a client voluntarily waives or gives up the right to
consent. In addition, a legally emancipated child may provide their own informed consent, although legislation
regarding minors and informed consent may vary by state (Shah et al., 2022).

        LINK TO LEARNING

Temple Health published a toolkit on informed consent that contains a lot of helpful information, including a
checklist (https://openstax.org/r/77InformConsent) to assess and evaluate the informed consent form.

One point to keep in mind is that in order to give legitimate informed consent, a client must have capacity and be
legally competent to do so. Legal competency is a determination made by a judge about a person's legal ability or
inability to make medical decisions, stand trial, or sign a contract, among other legal decisions. Capacity, by
contrast, is assessed by a health-care provider and is a clinical opinion regarding a client's ability to make health-
care decisions. Capacity can be determined by a provider by performing a few structured assessments, including
cognitive testing and a competency assessment. For those deemed not competent to give informed consent, a legal
guardian or person with medical power of attorney can be authorized to offer the consent.

        PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Competency to Stand Trial and the Insanity Defense

Mental health clients have a right to a determination of whether or not they are competent to make decisions on
their own behalf. This comes up in informed consent but also arises when these clients have encounters with the
law. They have the right to an evaluation of their mental state before they endure a trial and to determine if they can
be held legally accountable for a crime.

In cases where there are questions about an individual's mental competency and/or ability to stand trial, for
example, the court system may order that the offender be evaluated for their competency to stand trial. To be
competent to stand trial, a person must be able to understand the character and consequences of the proceedings
against them and able to properly assist in their defense. The evaluation is performed by a psychiatrist or
psychologist certified in forensic psychology.

In another circumstance, when evaluating for an offender's mental condition at the time of an alleged crime, the
evaluator must examine the person and review records, both medical and psychological, to determine if the
person's mental state at the time of the crime met the requirements for a major mental disease or defect. They then
have to give an opinion if that condition majorly impaired the offender's ability to appreciate the wrongness of the
criminal act that they are accused of, if the offender's mental condition substantially impaired their capacity to
behave within the requirements of the law, or both.

A person who has been found to be legally mentally incompetent when they committed a crime may be found "not
guilty by reason of insanity." Or the person may be found guilty but receive a lessor or different punishment due to
their mental impairment. The defendant must prove to the court that they did not understand what they were doing,
322  10 · Legal and Ethical Guidelines

     did not know right from wrong, acted on an uncontrollable impulse, or all of these factors.

             LINK TO LEARNING

     An article by Cornell Law School Legal Information Institute about the insanity defense (https://openstax.org/r/
     77insanityplea) gives an overview and history of this affirmative defense.

     The Right to Privacy and Confidentiality
     Another client right, client confidentiality is the expectation that information shared with the health-care providers
     or organization will not be divulged. Closely connected, so discussed together here, the right to privacy refers to the
     belief that one's personal information is protected from public access. As a client advocate, a nurse is responsible
     for protecting client confidentiality and privacy.

             CULTURAL CONTEXT

     Ethics in Using an Interpreter

     Age and culture may affect the steps a nurse takes to ensuring client confidentiality. For example, a sensory deficit,
     such as hearing loss, or cultural differences, such as language barriers, may require an interpreter to be present
     when explaining and providing care. This may compromise client confidentiality.

     The International Medical Interpreters Association created an interpreter Code of Ethics (https://openstax.org/r/
     77interprtethic) to help maintain standards of conduct. Some of the tenets included relate to maintaining
     confidentiality, accurately interpreting the client's message in their preferred language, keeping their own opinions
     out of the interpretations, and engaging in client advocacy to ensure accurate communication of cultural differences
     or preferences (International Medical Interpreters Association, 2006).

     All clients have the right to confidentiality and privacy. This includes respecting someone's privacy and abstaining
     from sharing personal or potentially sensitive information about an individual, especially if that information was
     shared in confidence or during a professional relationship. In the psychiatric-mental health setting, there may be
     additional exceptions to disclosure of information. For example, if the client is a risk to self or others, or in situations
     to protect the client or others from harm, it may be necessary to disclose confidential information with the duty to
     inform.

     On a residential or inpatient care basis, the right to privacy and confidentiality includes the right to speak with others
     in private, to view visitors during regularly planned hours, and to have fair and easy access to the phone and mail,
     except when a mental health professional determines that denial of access to a particular visitor is necessary for
     treatment purposes. The mental health professional may, for a specific, limited, and reasonable period, deny such
     access in writing and incorporate the order in the treatment plan. An order denying such access should include the
     reasons for such denial.

     Only members of the health-care team who are involved in a client's care have the right to access client information.
     The client must provide written consent for the information to be shared with anyone outside the treatment team.
     The Privacy Act of 1974 prohibits the disclosure of a client's medical record without written consent of the individual
     unless the disclosure is based on one of twelve exceptions. Transfer of information must be done carefully and by
     facility procedure; inappropriate disclosure of information may constitute a breach of client confidentiality (Conlon
     et al., 2019). Client confidentiality is protected under the law and if that is breached without authorization, and
     causes harm to the client, then the client may have cause to take legal action against the responsible party or group.
     For example, suppose a parent of a minor client calls for information and the parent is not the legal guardian, if the
     parent is still given the information requested, this is a breach of confidentiality. Another breach of confidentiality
     takes place when a parent of an adult calls for an update on a client in a residential treatment facility and is given
     information without there being client authorization on file to provide that parent with that information.

        LINK TO LEARNING

There are twelve exceptions of the Privacy Act of 1974 (https://openstax.org/r/77privacyexcept) that dictate when a
client's medical record can be disclosed without written consent of the individual.

Client Rights in Facilities
Clients with acute mental health symptoms, or those who are at risk for hurting themselves or others, may be
hospitalized. They are often initially seen in the emergency department for emergency psychiatric care. Clients may
seek voluntary admission, or in some situations, may be involuntarily admitted after referral for emergency
evaluation by law enforcement, schools, friends, or family members. Incarceration facilities are other settings where
a number of mental health clients reside. In all facilities, voluntary or not, these clients have specific rights under
federal and state laws and regulations.

Caring for the Client in a Hospital Setting
Acute care psychiatric units in general hospitals are typically locked units on a separate floor of the hospital with the
purpose of maintaining environmental safety for clients. State-operated psychiatric hospitals serve clients who have
chronic serious mental illness. They also provide court-related care for criminal cases where the client was found
"not guilty by reason of insanity." This judgment means the client was deemed to be so mentally ill when they
committed a crime that they cannot be held responsible for the act, but instead require treatment.

Commitment
There are two types of commitment for care and treatment in inpatient or outpatient mental health facilities.
Voluntary admission happens when a person agrees to treatment in a mental health facility and is not an immediate
threat to themselves or others. They are admitted and are free to leave at any time. Involuntary commitment can
also be either inpatient or outpatient, but the person is confined against their will. In an involuntary hold, a person
may be held for up to seventy-two hours (may vary by state), but the client must be a danger to themselves or
others. After the seventy-two hours, the case/situation must go to the court system to determine if the hold should
continue.

The specifics of the laws as far as how long and the reasons for a person to be committed vary by state. In general, a
person must be a danger to the public or themselves. There are several types of involuntary commitment. In an
emergency hospitalization, the client is held for a limited time in response to a crisis situation. In an inpatient civil
commitment, there is a longer-term hold while the courts determine if the client meets the criteria for continued
commitment. The last option is outpatient civil commitment (available in all states except Maryland and
Massachusetts) where the person may be required to participate in outpatient treatment.

With an involuntary commitment, the client is not permitted to check out of their own accord from a health-care
facility. When a client leaves an inpatient facility without permission, including if they fail to return from an
authorized leave, it is called absconding. This is a significant health and safety issue to the client, the facility, client
families, and, potentially, the public. Good therapeutic communication between clients and clinical teams helps
reduce the occurrence of absconding events. Absconding has been linked to an increased risk of self-harm and
suicide (Verma et al., 2020).

Caring for the Client in a Punitive Setting
The United States has the largest number of people incarcerated in the world. Almost 870 out of every 100,000
people in the United States are in jail or prisons (Davis et al., 2018). This population has very high rates of
psychiatric conditions, substance use disorders, as well as many other acute and chronic health conditions. These
individuals require care by nurses. One of the largest roles of nurses in corrections facilities is advocacy. It can be a
challenge for nurses in this setting to provide the care that is needed on limited budgets. Some of these people have
very serious psychological issues or psychiatric illnesses that require monitored medication regimens. Others have
substance misuse issues that are high risk for serious complications of withdrawal. The nurse must be prepared to
screen and handle these clients as well as advocate for the care that is needed and may be lacking.

     Nursing Challenges When Upholding Client Rights

     There are many legal and ethical challenges in health care. Vigilantly keeping client confidentiality in a digital age is
     a challenge legally and ethically. From a mental health viewpoint, maintaining the client's autonomy while ensuring
     their safety can be a challenge, especially when their competency or capacity is in question.

     CLINICAL JUDGMENT MEASUREMENT MODEL

     Applying the CJMM to Legal Guidelines

     Rachel is a psychiatric nurse working in an inpatient psychiatric unit. She is assigned to care for Walter, a thirty-
     five-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia who was admitted involuntarily due to paranoid delusions and
     aggressive behavior. Walter has a history of noncompliance with medication and has been refusing to take his
     antipsychotic medication during his current hospitalization. Rachel is responsible for ensuring Walter's safety
     and providing therapeutic interventions to address his symptoms.

     Using the Clinical Judgment Measurement Model, we can analyze Rachel's clinical judgment in this scenario.

     CJMM Step CJMM Data

     Recognize    Rachel recognizes the cues indicating Walter's paranoid delusions and aggressive behavior,
     Cues         including his refusal to take medication, agitation, and verbal threats. She assesses his mental
                  status and identifies potential risks to his safety and the safety of others on the unit.

     Analyze      Rachel analyzes Walter's behavior in the context of his psychiatric history and current
     Cues         symptoms. She considers the potential consequences of his noncompliance with medication,
                  including worsening psychotic symptoms and the risk of harm to himself or others.

     Prioritize   Rachel prioritizes the need to address Walter's noncompliance with medication and manage
     Hypotheses   his paranoid delusions and aggressive behavior. She considers the underlying factors
                  contributing to his refusal and develops a plan to engage him in treatment while ensuring
                  safety.

     Generate     Rachel develops a therapeutic relationship with Walter, using communication techniques to
     Solutions    build trust and rapport. She educates him about the importance of medication adherence and
                  explores his concerns and fears related to taking medication. Rachel collaborates with the
                  treatment team to explore alternative interventions, such as psychosocial interventions and
                  medication adjustments, to address Walter's symptoms effectively.

     Take Action  Rachel implements the plan of care, including ongoing monitoring of Walter's mental status
                  and behavior, therapeutic communication, and collaboration with the treatment team. She
                  intervenes promptly to address any escalation of symptoms or safety concerns, ensuring a
                  proactive approach to managing Walter's care.

     Evaluate     Rachel evaluates the effectiveness of interventions by assessing Walter's response to
     Outcome      treatment, including changes in his symptoms, behavior, and medication adherence. She
                  documents his progress and any modifications to the plan of care, collaborating with the
                  treatment team to adjust interventions as needed.

     In psychiatric-mental health nursing, several legal issues could arise in this case:

         · Involuntary hospitalization: Walter was admitted involuntarily due to his psychotic symptoms and risk of
             harm to himself or others. Rachel must ensure that Walter's rights are protected and that all legal
             requirements for involuntary hospitalization are met, including proper documentation and adherence to

          due process.
      · Medication administration: Walter's refusal to take medication raises legal and ethical considerations

          regarding his right to refuse treatment. Rachel must follow institutional policies and legal guidelines for
          managing medication refusal, including documenting Walter's decision-making capacity and exploring
          less restrictive alternatives to involuntary medication administration.
      · Client safety: Rachel is responsible for ensuring Walter's safety and the safety of others on the unit. She
          must take appropriate measures to prevent harm, including implementing de-escalation techniques,
          enlisting support from security or crisis intervention teams when necessary, and documenting any
          incidents or interventions related to safety concerns.
      · Confidentiality: Rachel must adhere to laws and regulations governing client confidentiality, including the
          Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). She must ensure that Walter's personal
          health information is protected and shared only with authorized individuals involved in his care.

  In this use of the CJMM, Rachel demonstrates effective clinical judgment in managing Walter's symptoms of
  schizophrenia and addressing his refusal to take medication. However, she must also navigate legal issues
  related to involuntary hospitalization, medication administration, client safety, and confidentiality. By applying
  the Clinical Judgment Measurement Model and adhering to legal standards, psychiatric-mental health nurses
  like Rachel can provide high-quality care while protecting client rights and minimizing legal liability.

Challenges to Maintaining Confidentiality and Privileged Communication
All health-care providers have a critical responsibility to maintain the clients' right to security, privacy, and
protection of client health-care information. Nurses must be mindful all of the time and careful not to discuss clients
in any setting where they can be overheard. Keeping laptops with any personal health information secure and
protected is imperative. Dispose properly of any paper that has any identifying information. Maintaining
confidentiality is challenging for all nurses in all areas. Discussing clients with other nurses who are not involved in
their care to decompress, or to confer with a question can easily breach confidentiality. Avoid posting anything on
social media related to a client. Leaving messages for clients on possibly unsecure voicemail or with another person
is also inappropriate. Nurses must be aware of the surroundings when talking to a client to make sure that they
cannot be overheard if asking about confidential information. In mental health, it is particularly easy to breach
confidentiality, because talking is a large part of the treatment and the situations can be very personal.

Any communication taking place within a therapeutic relationship between a client and the provider or counselor,
among others, is considered to be privileged communication. In some states, this confidentiality extends to nurse-
client relationships as well. Conversations and relayed information should remain confidential unless the client
reports a threat to themselves or others. Information that falls under the confidential umbrella cannot be the
subject of testimony in any legal proceedings unless the client has waived the privilege. Parties who are considered
to have privileged communication cannot be legally compelled to divulge anything that is discussed between the
parties, with the exception of the duty to warn or in case of the client being a danger to themselves.

Challenges with Mandatory Reporting
Many states require health professionals to report suspected neglect or abuse. For example, in Wisconsin,
suspected neglect or abuse is reported to Child Protective Services (CPS), Adult Protective Services, or law
enforcement. Nurses should be aware of the county or state agencies to whom they should report suspected abuse.
Reporting to authorities is not without its own set of difficulties. There can be issues with the reporter feeling guilt
about reporting, worrying that they are sending a child or adult into a worse situation of the "system" rather than the
known difficulties of the home. There is also the guilt of reporting if not absolutely sure that there is abuse. Even
harder still, if the abuse is not reported and something happens, the nurse can be held liable for not reporting. There
are also times when a nurse suspects abuse and they are not supported by the provider or their management staff;
this is a difficult situation. Reporting sexual abuse can be very difficult when the client does not want to report it. If
the nurse is in a mandatory reporting state, they do not have a choice but to report it because they can be held
responsible for not reporting. This can be very difficult to explain to a client, particularly one already in distress or
who has been convinced by their abuser that there will be consequences to telling. There is rarely an easy answer
when it comes to abuse of any kind.

             LINK TO LEARNING

     Consider some of the circumstances that involve mandatory reporting (https://openstax.org/r/77mandatedreprt) for
     nurses.

     Challenges to Boundaries
     Professional boundaries are very important for nurses to maintain particularly when working in mental health. It is
     not uncommon for those with mental health struggles to have difficulty setting their own boundaries, so it makes it
     even more important for the nurse to have firm boundaries. At the same time, the professional standing and access
     to private information that nurses possess creates a power imbalance between the nurse and the client. In order to
     maintain a client-centered relationship while being mindful of the power imbalance, nurses must make every effort
     to set and uphold clear boundaries. When the client's needs and the nurse's needs are not clear, it can create
     boundary conflicts, such as:

         · sexual misconduct
         · inappropriate touching of clients
         · romantic relationships with clients
         · violation of HIPAA privacy regulations
         · conflicts of interest
         · accepting and giving gifts
         · overinvolvement with clients
         · social media communication between nurses and clients

     Priorities must start with client safety. A nurse should speak with a dependable supervisor or colleague if a health-
     care professional is acting in an unprofessional manner or if the nurse is unclear of how to interpret a particular
     circumstance. Nurses should promptly and completely document any such events. It is imperative that nurses
     adhere to professional standards in their practice. It is critical for nurses to possess expertise in defining and
     upholding professional limits.

     Challenges When Treating Clients Who Have Committed Crimes
     Working with clients who have committed crimes can be very challenging. When providing nursing care to
     incarcerated clients, for instance, nurses may encounter people who have perpetrated violent crimes, such as
     sexual abuse of minors. Maintaining professionalism is of primary importance, as is taking a step back to recognize
     and regulate emotions that may arise with the interaction.

             PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

     Mindfulness and Reflection for Self-Care and Awareness of the Nurse

     There are several tools nurses can use to care for themselves when feeling morally ambivalent about treating clients
     who have committed crimes. One tool is journaling. Writing about an experience and their feelings about the
     experience in private and without judgment is a way to gather perspective, sort out emotions, and determine a path
     forward.

     Another method nurses use is reflecting with colleagues and peers. By sharing potentially common experiences with
     others, it gives the nurse different viewpoints and unique takes on how different people handle similar situations. It
     broadens the nurse's perspective and offers options the nurse may not have thought about previously.

     A third tool practitioners use is reflecting in the moment. Slowing down, where possible, and taking a second to
     think and, importantly, listen before acting can make a difference in a nurse's approach (Aussie Nurse, 2020).

     Challenges Regarding Payment for Services in Mental Health Care
     Payment is another legal/ethical consideration nurses face when treating clients who may or may not have
     insurance. Insurance is the primary way clients pay for mental health care, including private insurance, Medicaid,

     Access for free at openstax.org
10.3 · Ethical Standards in Mental Health Nursing                                                                        327

and Medicare. For those who do not have insurance or have insurance that does not cover mental health, paying for
treatment may be very expensive. Nurses should familiarize themselves with the options in their communities. In
many areas, there are free clinics, community mental health centers, local nonprofits, and local safety net health-
care systems. Many of these options require applying for the services or working with the hospital for a payment
plan. Many nonprofit hospitals have charity care to provide a certain amount of care for free or at a discount.
Nonprofit hospitals that accept Medicare and Medicaid are required to offer a certain amount of charity care each
year. Another set of options includes support groups and hotlines. Many mental health providers offer some pro
bono services as well. All of these options can be found online, by calling nonemergency help lines, or through
community social workers.

Keep in mind, however, that if a person has an emergency mental health condition or is determined to be dangerous
to self or others, they cannot be turned away from an emergency room or transferred to another hospital; that is
known as "dumping." They must be stabilized or admitted and stabilized until the emergency medical condition no
longer exists.

The Role of Health Insurance
Nurses should be aware of the critical role health insurance plays in treatment and in treatment decisions. Here is a
brief summary of insurance options; veterans also may qualify for their own insurance arrangements.

    · Medicaid and Medicare cover mental health care for those who qualify.
    · Medicaid coverage is based on multiple factors, including income.
    · Medicare covers those over the age of sixty-five and those who are disabled and have received Social Security

        for at least two years.
    · Private insurance covered, at least in part, by an employer.
    · Insurance purchased through the private market, paid monthly. Private market plans may have high

        deductibles and high out-of-pocket visit costs.

Disability Benefits for Mental Health Clients
Mental and psychological disabilities are conditions that can qualify individuals for benefits from the Social Security
Administration (SSA). To qualify for benefits, a client must have a formal diagnosis of a potentially disabling
condition, one that will cause a disability for twelve months or longer. The SSA performs a detailed review to
evaluate each disability application. Each illness that is eligible has a severity level requirement and the specific
medical information needed to support the claim. For most mental illnesses, the client needs to demonstrate that
they have been on medication for two years without their condition improving.

Forensic Services in Mental Health Nursing

Forensic psychiatric nursing is a developing specialty. These nurses play a key role in linking health care to the
judicial system. Historically, forensic nurses worked with crime victims during examinations, preserving evidence
and providing court testimony. Now, a forensic psychiatric nurse can provide a psychiatric evaluation intended for
use by the judicial system. They also frequently connect offenders with medical and social services that are needed
to assist with the offender's rehabilitation. There is some crossover in roles with correction nurses who provide care
in correctional institutions.

10.3 Ethical Standards in Mental Health Nursing

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Recall the key ethical principles related to nursing practice
    · Outline the role of the nurse's own moral philosophy in providing care to clients

Nursing and ethics are intertwined and inseparable; even student nurses encounter situations where they must
make ethical decisions. The personal values that a person has, perhaps based on their religious or moral
perspectives, influence any ethical decisions they may have to face. Ethical values differ from laws. Rather, they are
universal rules of conduct that provide a practical and moral basis for identifying appropriate actions, intentions,
and motives. Taking into consideration the complexity of mental health nursing, ethical issues abound. Nurses must
deliver quality care and make quick decisions while juggling the client, families, and other health-care professionals.
328  10 · Legal and Ethical Guidelines

     Health-care workers must make constant judgments, staying true to their own morals and values while staying
     within the laws and ethical standards that govern practice. To complicate matters, clients will likely have had
     different life experiences shaping their own moral compasses. Nurses must manage to balance their own moral
     philosophies with those of their clients. Being open-minded and understanding of the moral, religious, and
     philosophical differences will allow the nurse to provide holistic and ethical care for their clients.

     The concept of nursing ethics has been around since the 1870s and became more formal in the 1950s with the ANA
     Code of Ethics (Haddad & Geiger, 2023). It was not until the 1970s, however, that ethics began being taught in the
     nursing curriculum. Over the years, nursing ethics has evolved from a generalized list of responsibilities to a guide
     for nurses in their decisions and conduct. By 2015, the Code "address[ed] individual as well as collective nursing
     intentions and actions; it require[d] each nurse to demonstrate ethical competence in professional life" (American
     Nurses Association [ANA], 2015, p. vii).

     Ethical Principles

     Ethical principles are used to define right from wrong action. Although there are many ethical principles that guide
     nursing practice, foundational ethical principles include respect for autonomy (self-determination), beneficence (do
     good), nonmaleficence (do no harm), justice (fairness), fidelity (keep promises), and veracity (tell the truth).

     Autonomy
     The ethical principle of autonomy recognizes each individual's right to self-determination and decision-making
     based on their unique values, beliefs, and preferences. The American Nurses Association (ANA) defines autonomy
     as the ability to make decisions with one's own free choice, if competent to do so. One of the nurse's primary ethical
     obligations is to uphold client autonomy. Based on this principle, clients have the right to give informed consent and
     to refuse nursing care and medical treatment. In mental health care, there may be barriers to maintaining autonomy
     if the client is a danger to themselves or others or lacks capacity. A person may be declared incompetent and
     therefore not have the ability to make their own decisions. In this case, the surrogate decision-maker can act to
     respect the autonomy of the person by acting on the person's previously expressed wishes. In the case of a person
     who is under involuntary commitment, they cannot leave the inpatient setting, but they can have a part in making
     decisions on what they choose to participate in. They also have the right to refuse medications or treatments as long
     as they are not a danger to themselves or others.

     Beneficence
     The concept of beneficence is the act of helping others or taking them out of harm's way, doing good for others
     beyond that which is required by law. When caring for clients with mental health disorders, nurses practice
     beneficence when, for example, they advocate for evidence-based treatment for clients' mental health and make
     sure that client does not come to any harm.

     Nonmaleficence
     Opposite of beneficence, nonmaleficence is an ethical idea that dictates that providers not cause any detriment to
     clients. A classic example of doing no harm in nursing practice is reflected by nurses checking medication rights
     three times before administering them. Another example in mental health-care nursing is ensuring that clients are
     not harmed by adverse effects of psychotropic medications.

     Justice
     The ethical principle of justice is a moral duty to treat everyone in society in a fair and equitable manner. The
     principle of justice requires that health-care providers care for all people in a fair and equitable way, providing
     treatment and care for all those who need it. Nurses provide quality care for all individuals with the same level of
     fairness despite their personalities or characteristics, such as financial status, cultural beliefs, religion, gender, or
     sexual orientation. An example of a nurse using the principle of justice in mental health-care settings is ensuring
     provision of quality care to all clients, even those who do not have the cognitive ability to communicate their needs.

     Fidelity
     Role fidelity means responsible for providing competent nursing care and being loyal to the profession and to
     clients. An example of role fidelity in nursing is remaining up-to-date with evidence-based practice and
     implementing effective mental health interventions.

Veracity
The ethical principle of veracity simply means telling the truth. An example of veracity in health care is providing
informed consent. Nurses ensure that clients have a good understanding of the benefits and risks of a prescribed
procedure or psychotropic medication.

The Role of the Nurse's Moral Philosophy in Ethical Caring

Nursing care entails that the nurse must see the client as a person, forming relationships, and taking responsibility.
Caring can only happen with person-to-person contact. Lack of caring creates a disconnect that leads to poor client
satisfaction and leads the client to feel like an object or like they are not a participant in their care. Leininger (1988)
states that care is "one of the most essential and powerful forces to help people recover from illnesses, maintain
health, and survive" (p. 11). Watson (1985) saw caring as a science, developed from a humanistic philosophy, which
is at the core of nursing. Hildegard Peplau felt that nurses create a shared experience with a client that empowers
the client to be engaged in their care (Nursing Theory, 2023).

A nurse's beliefs, attitudes, and values, together with their reasons for entering the field, become their nursing
philosophy. A person's moral background, perhaps based in part on their religious values, leads to the ethical
decisions that they make. In general, people take their moral feelings and beliefs and act on them to make ethical
decisions and actions. People can learn to make critically thought-out ethical decisions, but it takes training and
practice.

The ANA Scope and Standards of Practice, most recently revised in 2022, is updated on a routine basis. Wrapped
into the scope of practice is the code of ethics. Since 2004, the scope of practice includes specific competencies
that are measurable for each standard of professional practice. In terms of ethics, within the "what" involves
advocacy for the care of individuals, groups, families, communities, and populations. The "why" involves outcomes
and the obligation to society to care. Relationships and obligations are themes that run through both the scope of
practice and the code of ethics and bind them together.

Summary

10.1 Client Rights and Protections

Maintaining understanding and compliance with the tenets of HIPAA is critical for client safety and trust. Under
HIPAA, PHI cannot be used or shared without the client's written permission. This is one of the client rights
provided under federal law. Other client rights offered under federal statute include those in the Affordable Care
Act. Its original premise, which continues, is to expand access to health insurance to uninsured Americans. The
main points of the law were to expand Medicaid eligibility, create a Health Insurance Marketplace, and prevent
insurance companies from denying coverage due to preexisting conditions.

10.2 Legal Issues Relating to Mental Health Nursing

Legal issues in mental health can be complicated and overwhelming. The best way to protect yourself, your license,
your clients, your community, and society is to know as much as possible about the laws and regulations that apply
to your job. Another way to accomplish this is to surround yourself with others who are knowledgeable by joining
professional organizations, keeping up-to-date with your board of nursing, having mentors, and engaging with
trusted professionals.

Nurses can come into contact with the legal system in a variety of manners. They can face criminal charges, such as
battery, if they touch a client without receiving informed consent. Or they may face civil liability for negligence if, for
instance, they make a medication error that leads to damages. Diligence in treating clients is the best way to avoid
professional legal or disciplinary action. The legal system also affects nursing when a client is not equipped to make
decisions on their own about their treatment and when clients need to be assessed for fitness to make those
decisions. Nurses should familiarize themselves not only with pertinent state and federal laws, but also with
professional boundaries, hospital policies, and relevant nursing board regulations.

10.3 Ethical Standards in Mental Health Nursing

Ethics in nursing is all about providing caring, quality, and responsible care to clients. This sounds simple but
frequently is not. There are many gray areas in ethics, and it is important to provide care that takes into
consideration the ethics, values, and morals of the nursing profession, the client, and the nurse. It is the human
connection that provides the most healing in nursing, but professional and ethical boundaries are imperative to
protecting both nurses and clients.

What Should the Nurse Do?

Carla, a twenty-eight-year-old female, seeks care at a local mental health clinic due to recent symptoms of
persistent sadness, decreased energy, and changes in sleep patterns. Carla has a history of depression and anxiety
and is currently taking medication prescribed by her psychiatrist. During the initial assessment, her vital signs are
stable, with a blood pressure of 120/80 mm Hg, a heart rate of 75 beats per minute, and a respiratory rate of 16
breaths per minute. As part of her care plan, the nurse is required to discuss treatment options and share
information with other health-care providers while ensuring compliance with HIPAA rules within the mental health
practice setting.

    1. What nonverbal cues might Carla exhibit during the assessment that indicate her awareness or concern about
        maintaining privacy? How can the nurse recognize and respond to these cues effectively?

    2. If the nurse successfully maintains HIPAA rules, what specific indicators of positive outcomes would you
        monitor to assess the effectiveness of the nurse's actions? How can the nurse measure Carla's satisfaction
        and sense of privacy throughout her mental health care?

Theresa, a sixty-five-year-old female, arrives at the community health clinic seeking medical attention. She presents
with a history of chronic back pain and has been experiencing increased discomfort over the past month. Theresa
explains that her primary care physician prescribed a new pain medication, but she is hesitant to take it due to
concerns about potential side effects. She expresses worry about the impact of the medication on her overall well-
being. Theresa has a medical history of hypertension and osteoarthritis. Her vital signs include a blood pressure of
140/90 mmHg, heart rate of 82 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and temperature of 98.6°F (37°C).

    3. What cues from Theresa's case suggest potential ethical concerns related to her pain management?
    4. As a nursing student, what specific actions would you take to implement the selected solution and address

        Theresa's concerns?
    5. How would you evaluate the success of the chosen interventions in meeting Theresa's pain management

        needs and addressing ethical considerations?

Competency-Based Assessments

    1. Consider a client who is concerned about losing a job and its related health insurance coverage due to a
        preexisting condition. Draft an explanation to the client of the protections under the Patient Protection and
        Affordable Care Act to address their concern.

    2. You are a nurse who has been asked to speak to a group of student nurses to briefly explain the difference
        between restraint and seclusion. Provide brief explanations.

    3. In a scenario where a client's right to refuse treatment conflicts with your obligation as a nurse to provide
        necessary care, critically analyze the ethical considerations. How can you navigate these situations while
        upholding both legal and ethical principles?

    4. Analyze how the ethical principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence apply to your role as a nurse in
        managing Theresa's pain while considering her medical history.

    5. Write about a situation where your own moral philosophy might conflict with a client's preferences or
        decisions. How would you navigate this ethical dilemma?

11.4 Guardianship and Conservatorship
INTRODUCTION Nurses have a responsibility to uphold ethical and legal practices, and, when complex issues arise
and cause dispute, courts of law can intervene. The need for psychiatric care itself may become one of these
complex issues. Federal and state laws provide for involuntary mental health services when a person's mental
health status presents a danger to themselves or other people or if they are gravely disabled. These laws vary by
state (Legal Information Institute, 2023) and there is an expectation that nurses will understand their state
requirements and nursing practice expectations.
States have an interest in protecting the public and the individual. At the same time, individuals have the right to
refuse treatment. Involuntary care poses the fundamental right to refuse treatment against the rights of public
safety and the safety of the individual. While striving to preserve autonomy, the law must balance rights with risks. If
a person's health state includes symptoms that alter their ability to make rational decisions--that is, resulting in
harm to self or others--it may justify involuntary treatment. Nevertheless, in order to impose involuntary treatment
on a person without their expressed consent, they must first be adjudicated incompetent.

     11.1 Reasons for Court-Ordered Treatment

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Cite the reasons for court-ordered therapy
         · Give examples of the types of court-ordered therapy
         · Outline the process for putting involuntary court-ordered treatment in place

     The basic reason for court-ordered treatment is that an individual presents a danger to self or others or is unable to
     perform self-care due to mental illness. Each state determines its own guidelines, so they differ in some details.
     Being referred for involuntary assessment and treatment with conditions of release is not a crime. It is a function of
     civil, not criminal law. In terms of criminal law, there is a branch of psychiatry for forensic cases, wherein the person
     may have criminal charges or eventually be adjudicated "not guilty by reason of insanity." In those cases, the
     individual convicted of a crime may be ordered to receive psychiatric services as well.

     The term civil commitment denotes a legal process that keeps involuntary hospitalization from qualifying as false
     imprisonment. Those seeking the commitment bear the burden of proof to justify the need for this care and the care
     must be offered in the least restrictive environment. Nurses have a significant responsibility to act as advocate for
     persons and families throughout the processes described in this section. Nursing care also comes into play as
     education, emotional support, and collaborative care with the health-care team. Nurses maintain the therapeutic
     relationship with persons and families and adhere to professional practice guidelines. Nurses in these situations
     should be mindful to reflect on their own perceptions and be self-aware of how these relationships are affecting
     them in order to maintain self-care.

             CLINICAL SAFETY AND PROCEDURES (QSEN)

     Teamwork and Collaboration

     One QSEN competency is teamwork and collaboration, which stresses the importance of working in teams
     effectively and with the shared goal of quality client care. Consider how the nurse will monitor the therapeutic
     relationship in situations of court-ordered treatment.

courts of law may intervene and legally compel the person into treatment. Treatment may be inpatient in a facility,
outpatient in the community, or in a clinic setting.

Court-ordered therapy is mandated and compulsory. The court may keep track of the person's compliance, holding
providers accountable to report the person's progress. The individual receiving treatment and/or their health insurer
is responsible for the payment for the services. The person or their representative must inform the court of financial
hardship in order to receive financial aid. Persons mandated for treatment who do not adhere to the plan of care
may be found in contempt of court, apprehended, and potentially incarcerated, hospitalized, or face further legal
repercussions. The most common reasons for court-ordered therapy include custody disputes and custody issues
involving abuse or neglect, being convicted of a sex crime, an alternative to jail for someone with a mental illness or
who misuses drugs, a condition of release from jail, or presenting a threat to oneself or others.

        PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Court-Mandated Treatment in Custody Cases

One type of court-ordered mental health treatment involves child custody cases and divorce proceedings. Due to
their understanding of child developmental stages and needs at each stage, courts sometimes consult psychologists
to evaluate children's best interests in family law proceedings. Required interviews, observations in the home or
other settings, and formal psychological testing can collect data for the evaluation, along with medical records and
reports from child welfare agencies or schools. Confidentiality guidelines provide for access to these documents.
Information gathered can inform custody arrangements, visitation, and other facets of divorce proceedings.

Types of Court-Ordered Treatment

Each state designates the guidelines for mental health treatment when necessitated by court order. These directives
address circumstances, length of time, and individual rights. Court-ordered treatment may take place inside a
health-care facility, out in the community (whether residential or day treatment, including mandatory support group
attendance), or in visits to mental health-care providers (Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration
[SAMHSA], 2019a). In all these settings, providers document the client's progress toward established treatment
goals, which includes them adhering to medications as prescribed and obtaining appropriate laboratory test results.
A long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotic medication may also be legally mandated for the client to receive on a
schedule. Courts have access to the medical record.

When a person's behavior affects others or has legal implications, a court may order various types of mandated
treatment rather than incarceration. If treatment is not completed as ordered, incarceration may still occur. While in
mandated treatment, the client may receive medication and work with a therapist. Table 11.2 outlines various forms
of mandated therapy.

     Emergency Admission and Treatment Orders
     Some states permit emergency treatment orders (ETO), which allow provision of medically prescribed treatment
     with or without consent. ETO are obtained from the provider when the person's behavior presents a danger to self or
     others. Interventions under emergency orders are time-limited and require ongoing assessments and special
     documentation. Documentation should include approaches providers tried prior to the emergency order. These
     orders have serious legal and ethical implications.

     Persons received under emergency admission are reasonably determined to have mental illness making them
     dangerous to self or others. Persons admitted on an emergency basis remain in the facility for a waiting period of
     twenty-four to seventy-two hours for a psychiatric assessment and crisis treatment; this is typically known as a
     psychiatric hold. The action is legally and ethically justified due to the emergency aspect of the person's need.
     Every U.S. state sets its own criteria for hospitalization due to mental health emergency. Generally, such clients
     should only be involuntarily admitted if they can benefit from the hospitalization and if it is the least restrictive
     means for treatment.

             LINK TO LEARNING

     The Treatment Advocacy Center has compiled a survey of the mental health commitment laws of the states
     (https://openstax.org/r/77mentalhlth) looking at the types of involuntary admission laws, as well as issues such as
     outpatient commitment.

     During an emergency admission, a mental health-care team is available to the person for medical and psychosocial
     care. Psychiatrists, social services professionals, mental health nurses, and care managers participate in
     coordinating and planning the person's stabilization. After the required waiting period, some persons may be
     released from the facility into the care of their family members or to another treatment setting. Some persons agree
     to remain on a voluntary basis for continued treatment. Still others may be kept in custody through involuntary
     commitment--involuntary hospitalization of a client--which is the legal means to hold an individual in a psychiatric-
     mental health facility for a mental illness without that person's consent. Involuntary stays can be days or weeks as
     determined by the attending psychiatrists and courts.

     Mandated Treatment in the Community
     One form of civil commitment within the community, not confined to a facility is assisted outpatient treatment
     (AOT). It is intended to reduce rehospitalization and assist community reentry. Again, programs vary by state. This
     care is mandated by the court and sometimes results in return to the hospital environment if the individual does not
     adhere to the mandates.

     Persons may be referred to community care after release from a facility. The best candidate for community care is
     one who has stabilized from treatment and has a support system of people in the community. Persons in AOT may
     receive case management, home visits, therapy sessions, medication, and housing support. Community treatment
     can have benefits to the person, such as avoiding hospitalization, feeling less restricted, and experiencing less

stigma, according to Mikellides et al. (2019).

        LINK TO LEARNING

Review this guideline to involuntary commitment (https://openstax.org/r/77invcommit) from SAMHSA, called Civil
Commitment and the Mental Health Care Continuum: Historical Trends and Principles for Law and Practice.

Process of Involuntary Evaluation and Treatment

There are two processes to initiate involuntary commitment: (1) emergency and (2) judicial. The emergency process,
mentioned previously, arises when an individual poses immediate harm because of their mental illness. The
commitment happens immediately. The judicial process is not an emergency, but begins when someone concerned
determines that a person requires mental health treatment that they will not willingly obtain. There may be a wait
while the court decides whether or not to grant the order (Disability Rights South Carolina, 2023).

Family members or other concerned individuals may call local law enforcement, clerks of court in the county where
the individual resides, or the person's primary care physician or mental health professional to initiate this judicial
process and an involuntary examination to determine need for treatment. Clerks of court can file petition for an ex
parte (meaning that all the parties are not yet involved) order asking a judge to authorize a psychiatric evaluation.

If the person needs an escort to the mental health-care facility, this may involve civil arrest, being taken by law
enforcement (possibly in handcuffs, in a patrol car) to a psychiatric receiving facility or medical hospital emergency
department. Additional resources regarding court-ordered mental health treatment include:

    · Crisis Text Line: text the word 'Home' to 741741

        LINK TO LEARNING

The Policy Surveillance Program compiled information by state for short-term emergency commitment. Their map,
containing the data, provides sample questions (https://openstax.org/r/77srttrmEmer) the data answers.

With variations in state laws, upon completion of the involuntary psychiatric evaluation, the person may:

    · be released
    · give express and informed consent to stay for treatment on voluntary status
    · be held for treatment on involuntary status
    · be referred for mandated community treatment, a form of conditional release/discharge, meaning that the

        person must adhere to prescribed treatment (medication, counseling, follow-up appointments) or be returned
        to the hospital

If the person has health insurance, the cost of treatment will be billed to the insurance company. Sometimes, the
state pays the facility to care for the person, or the court may order another source of funding.

Facilities Used for Court-Ordered Evaluation and Treatment
Determined by the individual states, facilities may include acute care general hospitals, psychiatric hospitals,
designated treatment centers, crisis centers, and specialty services, such as women's centers or child/adolescent
facilities. Hospitals without psychiatric services may hold persons in the emergency department while awaiting
psychiatric placement. Persons in jail will wait for forensics units or hospitals that will receive them. Due to the
overrepresentation of individuals with mental illness in corrections settings in the United States (National Alliance
on Mental Illness [NAMI], 2023), many clients may be found in any of these settings, depending on the state.

     11.2 Violence and Safety

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Recall issues relating to mental health and safety
         · Outline approaches that are used to deal with safety in the clinical setting
         · Understand approaches to ensuring staff safety in clinical settings

     Safety is paramount for both clients and staff at mental health-care facilities. Sometimes clients in mental health
     treatment settings can pose a threat to themselves or others. It is incumbent upon nurses to understand the
     circumstances surrounding potential safety issues and to know how to approach them from therapeutic, ethical,
     legal, and environmental perspectives. Maintaining a safe environment for clients and staff is, in part, a nursing
     responsibility guided by professional standards and by the principles of person-centered care.

     Mental Health and Safety Issues

     Client safety is a nursing priority. Nursing assessment involves analysis of cues in the client's presentation that could
     put the client or others at risk. This leads to planning effective care. Nurses must remain self-aware, considering
     their own biased assumptions and the influence of others regarding safe practice and safe environments. Medical
     diagnosis and prior experience cannot stand alone as predictors of client behaviors; every individual comes from
     unique circumstances and has their own reactions to different triggers.

     To be clear, most people with serious mental illness do not perpetrate violence, and when they do, it is often related
     to other coexisting issues, such as substance use or abuse (DeAngelis, 2021). Nevertheless, nursing interventions at
     early signs of client distress can mitigate violent events. Nursing assessment can easily identify overtly aggressive
     behaviors, such as posturing, gesturing, shouting, or physical contact. But just as important is nursing recognition of
     clients' levels of anxiety, physical agitation, suspicion, fear, and emotional reactions to others. Nursing awareness of
     clients' tolerance to environmental stimuli, such as visitation time, meal times, competitive activities, or crowding
     and noise can provide cues to nursing action.

     Risk Factors for Aggression or Violence in Serious Mental Illness
     Nurses should be aware of and understand risk factors in each client's history in order to inform preventative care.
     Medical causes, such as substance withdrawal or hypoxia, or metabolic conditions, such as fever or delirium, may
     also contribute to uncooperative or acting-out behaviors. Early childhood events, exposure to trauma (including
     traumatic brain injury), and substance use can shape behavior and mental health in general. These factors may
     contribute to potential for violence due to acquired protective responses, learned ineffective coping behaviors,
     dysregulated neurological responses, substance influence or substance withdrawal, work demands, or stressors in
     the home. Other risk factors for aggression by clients with mental illness are related to mental health symptoms,
     including persecutory delusions often related to schizophrenia, grandiosity and mania, and antisocial personality
     traits (DeAngelis, 2021).

     Cues in Types of Behavior
     According to the Centers for Disease Control, there are a number of common cues indicating an increased potential
     for violence (2020). They include screaming or loud talking, cursing, menacing voice, uncared-for physical
     appearance, pacing, panting, arm crossing, hand clenching, staring, looking fearful, throwing items, or being drunk
     or high.

     Some behaviors distressing to the person may not appear as problematic to others. Behaviors such as social
     withdrawal, silence, or guarded body posture may not be reported by family members or seen as relevant by health-
     care workers. Yet these behaviors, especially if noticed as a change, could be outward expressions of fear or pain
     that nurses should note in the context of safety. Highly active, disruptive behaviors, such as damaging property or
     threatening others, are likely to draw more attention. Impulsivity may be driven by paranoia or hallucinations or the
     energy of a manic episode. Socially inappropriate remarks, insults, or actions that evidence disregard for others may
     be associated with disorders of conduct or personality, or may be learned intimidation behaviors. Persons with low
     self-esteem and ineffective coping abilities may present as deceitful or manipulative. Medications that are
     ineffective or not taken or have agitation as a side effect can also account for client behaviors. No matter the cues,
     respect for client autonomy and early detection are key to appropriate interventions.

Nurses have to be aware of boundary issues with clients, particularly if there is the potential for any violent and
aggressive behavior. This informative brochure from the National Council for State Boards of Nursing
(https://openstax.org/r/77boundary) provides information on boundaries in the therapeutic relationship.

Handling Aggression and Violence in the Clinical Setting

The Joint Commission (2019), an accrediting body for health-care organizations, has identified de-escalation of
aggressive behaviors in health-care settings as a safety initiative, including interventions that are verbal, physical, or
involve medication. Other partners in this initiative include Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA),
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), as well as
professional organizations worldwide (Lim et al., 2022).

For psychiatric-mental health nurses, management of aggressive behavior starts with the therapeutic relationship
and ongoing assessment. Nurses act as educators and mentors to other health-care staff through role modeling and
direct instruction. Interventions for these behaviors are taught to staff members through in-service instruction.
Methods and rationale are also reviewed and reinforced during debriefing after events.

Least Restrictive Alternatives to Managing Aggression
The foundational guideline to handling aggressive behavior is that providers must use the least restrictive measures
that are safe. Nursing management of aggressive behaviors starts with client-centered care, which includes an
introduction, respectful interview processes, and professional exchange of information at handoff of care reports.
Nurses must have a keen awareness of their own body language, like where they place their hands, and their own
tone of voice when interacting with clients.

Early nursing interventions, such as distraction and redirection, engaging the client in problem-solving, managing
environmental stimuli, offering calming techniques, and providing comfort measures or physical activity can be
highly effective, unrestrictive methods to redirect behaviors away from violence. Honest praise for the client's ability
to maintain personal control is part of these interventions. Taking a break from a situation through having time-outs,
which are temporary, brief removals from adverse stimulation to reduce stressors, and medications are also less
restrictive alternatives to managing aggression. With a time-out, the client is offered a choice to withdraw from a
stressful situation and go to another location. This may be to the client's bedroom, a designated quiet room, or a
recreation area. A client in time-out is free to leave the time-out area at their will.

Stress reduction teaching, another less restrictive method of managing aggression and often used in conjunction
with medication, is most effective approximately thirty minutes after medication administration, when the client will
be getting some benefit from the pharmacological effect. This, together with the calming techniques prompted by
the nurse, gives the client a chance to experience personal success. Such empowerment can transfer to future
situations.

The Use of PRN Medication
Medication works best when offered to clients in early stages of anxiety before escalation of aggression. The term
PRN is a medical abbreviation for the Latin pro re nata, meaning, "as it is needed." In many situations, clients
request PRN medications, such as needed for headache, sleep, or pain. Psychiatric nursing is somewhat unique in
this regard in that PRN medications can be part of the nursing intervention when the nurse recognizes cues of
potential aggressive behavior during assessment. Clients may not ask for antianxiety medication and may not be
able to ask for antipsychotic medication, so the nurse determines the need. Nurses should offer PRN medication
along with supportive interaction within the therapeutic relationship.

Nurses should not administer medication covertly, such as hiding it in food, or misrepresenting the type of
medication or its action to the client. An ethical dilemma exists, however, for families and care providers when a
client refuses medication as part of their illness or incapacity for decision-making, and the person's health is
deteriorating. Each state provides guidelines for administration of medication without the client's consent. Only
situations where there is an extreme threat to safety to the client or others merit this type of medication
346  11 · Court Involvement

     administration, and it requires specific documentation. Medical staff and supervisory nursing staff must be part of
     this decision and the documentation must clearly show what information was provided to the client and the client's
     response (Latner, 2022).

     Emergency medication orders are interim measures only, with care planning ongoing.

     Nurses should confer with mentors and colleagues regarding trauma-informed care during mandated medication
     administration. Medication in these situations will likely be administered by intramuscular injection. The client's
     movement may be stabilized by physical holds or restraint devices, though best-case scenario involves the client
     accepting the injection. Statements such as, "you need this," or "we have to give this to you" are unhelpful, as is
     leaving the client alone after medication administration. Nurses should remain with, or near, the client after the
     medication is given to monitor medication effects and provide support.

     Medications to treat severe mental illness have significant side effects and some potential lethality. Ideally, persons
     in need of these medications should be full participants in treatment decisions. The rationale for medically and
     legally ordered medications without the person's consent is that with improvement from the medication, the person
     will be able to engage in their own care.

     The Use of Seclusion
     The American Psychiatric Association Resource Document Seclusion or Restraint (2022, page 2) describes
     seclusion or restraint as interventions "of last resort in the management of severe agitation" (e.g., violence). Both
     are highly regulated by local, state, and federal law and other health-care accreditation organizations, and both
     carry significant risks. As one of the most restrictive methods to manage aggressive behavior, seclusion is one form
     of coercive treatment. Restraint is the other most restrictive form. The ethical and legal challenges posed by these
     interventions should prompt mental health nurses to invest fully in the therapeutic relationship and embrace the
     role of client advocate.

     While time-out is an intervention that the client can choose at the lower stages of anxiety, seclusion, by contrast, is
     staff placement of the client in a room designed for protective confinement. If there is furniture, it is generally fixed
     to the wall or floor. If there are windows, the covering is of a safety material. There are no electrical outlets or light
     switches and the door cannot be opened from inside once it is closed or locked from the outside. A ceiling light
     fixture and a security camera will be encased and the door may have a small, covered opening for observation or an
     intercom. Some seclusion rooms have padded covering on the walls and floor; some have drain openings in the
     floor. The person must be escorted out to toilet facilities, and there should be emergency resuscitative equipment
     nearby. Seclusion has traditionally been used when clients are dangerous to others or self-destructive and less
     restrictive measures have not proven effective. The person must be observed continually by staff or via camera with
     frequent documentation and provision of care.

             LINK TO LEARNING

     The American Psychiatric Association has published a resource document on the practices of seclusion and restraint
     (https://openstax.org/r/77restraint) in psychiatric care. (Key points are summarized on pages 14 and 15.)

     Using Restraints
     A measure designed to confine the person's bodily movements and, subsequently, access to their own body is called
     a restraint. There are a number of different types of restraints: soft restraints, chemical restraints, medical
     restraints, behavioral restraints, and environmental restraints. In medical/surgical care facilities, some of these
     types of restraints prevent dislodging medical support interventions, such as oxygen masks, intravenous lines, or
     feeding tubes. Chemical restraint is the sedating effect of medication. All types of restraints are intended to limit the

person's movement, require specific documentation and provider orders, and present ethical and legal
considerations.

Devices applied to the person's limbs or body may be made of soft material, hard rubber, plastic, canvas, or leather.
Straps of leather or fabric are buckled or tied to a fixed object, generally a bed or chair. The client may be positioned
supine or sitting in standard or semi-Fowler's position. Prone position is not safe or ethical.

In general, restraint in psychiatry has been used when clients are injurious to themselves or others. Time in restraint
should be minimal with continuous nursing assessment. According to the APA, "these details (`last resort,' `less
restrictive means' and `minimum time requirement') are codified in many state and federal laws" (2022, page 4).
Nursing judgment can determine when clients can demonstrate personal control. As with seclusion, the restrained
person must be observed continually by staff, and staff must document their observations. During a restraint
episode, the nursing observations include assessment of the limbs, circulation, food, water, toileting, and when and
how to know when the client can be released from the restraint.

Individual facilities have specific guidelines for application of restraints, and the cleaning, storage, and maintenance
of the devices. Employees usually learn these guidelines during new employee and annual skills training. This
training includes care of the person in restraints, such as provision of hygiene. Hygiene entails inspection of the
client's skin, nourishment, airway protection, proper positioning, and assessment for release. Additionally, each
state sets specific guidelines regarding provider orders, documentation, and time limits on seclusion or restraints.
All will likely contain the following:

    · Intervention must be ordered by licensed practitioners permitted by the state and the facility.
    · Least restrictive emergency safety interventions are required.
    · Verbal orders must be verified in a signed, written form, outlining all details.
    · The provider must be available for contact and consultation.
    · Orders for restraints and seclusions should be renewed every four hours for adults over the age of eighteen,

        every two hours for children and adolescents ages nine to seventeen, and every hour for children under the
        age of nine.
    · Within one hour, a licensed practitioner permitted by the state and the facility must conduct a face-to-face
        assessment to determine physical and psychological well-being.
    · Staff must document the intervention in the health record:

          the time the intervention began and ended
          the time and results of the one-hour face-to-face assessment
          the emergency safety situation that required the intervention
          the names of the staff involved in the emergency safety intervention
    · The facility must maintain records of each emergency safety situation, the interventions used, and their
        outcomes (Legal Information Institute, 2001).

Seclusion and restraint may cause substantial detrimental psychological and physical outcomes, including death.
The therapeutic relationship, and early intervention in clients' anxiety and stress states, can preclude the need for
seclusion and restraint. They are emergency safety measures of last resort.

Staff Safety When Dealing with a Violent Client

Agitation and violence are behaviors driven by emotion, not logic. Therefore, staff working with acting-out clients
should strive to address the emotion and not to engage in debate. Clients may feel disrespected if staff utilize
restrictive methods too quickly in the process and this can lead to increased agitation. Physical intervention by staff
(escorting to seclusion room, application of restraints) may reinforce to the client that violence is a form of conflict
resolution. As soon as an assessment reveals violent behavior to be imminent, or it begins, staff should manage the
348  11 · Court Involvement

     situation to increase privacy for the client and focus for the staff. The acting-out person may accept the nurse's
     invitation to "walk with me," and agree to leave a populated area. Walking will discharge some physical energy and
     reinstate the relationship between the client and the nurse. Prevention of escalation is key to staff, client, and
     environmental safety. Employees are entitled to a safe work environment. Even though some clients may escalate
     quickly, or enter the facility in agitated states, the treatment goal is still person-centered, trauma-informed care.

     All staff approach to the violent client should be with open body posture (hands visible and open, stand on slight
     diagonal to the client, do not block doorways), no taunting or challenging, accepting and validating the client's
     feelings without justifying the behavior, for example, "I can see your point; help me understand; we can't let anyone
     get hurt."

             REAL RN STORIES

     Nurse: Sydney O., RN BSN
     Years in Practice: 4 years
     Clinical Setting: Crisis intervention unit
     Geographic Location: Mississippi

     I witnessed the Clinical Nurse Leader of a psychiatric unit where I worked de-escalate a tense situation. The client
     was backed up against a wall by five male staff members who were shouting at him to calm down and be quiet. The
     CNL walked up to the scene, stood close enough to make eye contact with the client, and said, "Hey, Arnell. What's
     going on right now?" The client answered, "They're trying to keep me in here! I wanna get outta here! I got to get
     outta here!"

     The CNL motioned for the other staff to step aside, and she held out her hand to the client, saying, "I believe you;
     you don't want to stay here any longer than necessary. I can help you with that; let's do it the right way." The client
     stepped forward and walked with the CNL to an open seclusion room where the client sat on the bed and the CNL
     brought in a chair, sat down, and said to the client, "Arnell, I'm going to ask Dina to bring you some medicine. Do you
     want a soda with that?" The client smiled and said, "A soda would be great." The CNL talked to the client while the
     med nurse brought the medication and a soda; within 20 minutes, the client was back in his room and the crisis had
     been averted. The CNL continued to check in with the client throughout the shift and included him in the change of
     shift report, where she said to the oncoming nurse, "Arnell has been concerned about his discharge plans, and we
     agreed that he will speak to his social worker in the morning." The oncoming nurse continued the therapeutic
     relationship by saying, "Arnell, sounds like you really handled yourself well today."

     I saw a lot of techniques in the nurses' approach that day, and I have always tried to be this effective in my own
     practice.

     Staff Training
     Many health-care settings teach the "Management of Aggressive Behavior," sometimes abbreviated MAB. These
     programs have several concepts in common, with specifications made for child/adolescent, older adults, or forensic
     populations. Early programs (1970-1980s) were largely based on self-defense techniques, relying on blocking
     attacks or releasing from holds. Currently, programs present more therapeutic interventions. Some may be provided
     as part of first responder training, or are based on trauma-informed care, such as the Safe Crisis Management (SCM)
     Program. The following programs are available for MAB training.

         · Association for Psychological Therapies (https://openstax.org/r/77/APT)

These models may be part of the organization's quality improvement process and chosen based on feasibility and
cost. General concepts of MAB include that staff should:

    · communicate clearly and in a nonthreatening manner
    · allow the client time to process the information; repeat information
    · listen to the client; validate their feelings
    · use open-ended questions; ask for the client's input
    · provide the client with alternative solutions

If there is a potential need for more restrictive interventions, consider and plan them in advance:

    · Only one staff person should give direction.
    · Members of the staff group should move quickly and efficiently to escort the client away from the scene to the

        area of seclusion or restraint.
    · Room and equipment should be readily available.
    · Attend to other clients.

Ulrich et al. (2018) make the point that the environment itself (furniture type and placement, light, sound, and
space) can be a form of prevention of aggressive behavior and reduction of need for most restrictive interventions.
Features like an accessible garden, nature paintings, low density communal settings, and noise reduction design
have been proven to decrease the need for the most restrictive interventions. Mental health treatment settings can
offer newly admitted clients a questionnaire to complete, designating which stress reduction methods they find
helpful (Ulrich et al., 2018).

The Use of Security Staff in Clinical Situations
Safety officers in health-care facilities likely see their role as prevention, protection, and security by patrolling,
monitoring, and managing threats (Parker et al., 2020). When called to client situations, they may be more prepared
for hands-on rather than therapeutic communication. In reality, the role of security officers may by defined in facility
policy (Lawrence et al., 2018). Still health-care workers in various departments may have differing views of the role
of security staff.

From a nursing perspective, if security personnel are called to assist with client care, they should be functioning
under direction of the nurse. The relationship dynamic between nursing staff and security staff may be one of
respect and cooperation, or not. Resentment can be part of the scenario if security staff believe they are called for
hands-on interventions and the nurses are "still talking" to the client. Psychiatric-mental health nurses should
participate in planning management strategies that involve security staff with client-centered care in mind. These
efforts should be proactive in nature and well communicated to all stakeholders in the organization.

An alternative to assistance of security personnel for mental health clients is implementation of behavioral
emergency response teams (BERT). Based on the concept of rapid response teams' proactive intervention for
medical status changes, BERT offers the opportunity to bring specialized knowledge and care to an urgent situation
wherein the client is experiencing extreme psychological stress. BERTs have been proven to assist with reducing
assaults directed at staff and advancing staff cooperation, client satisfaction, and client and staff safety (Rajwani et
al., 2023). A BERT's multidisciplinary team may include clinicians, social workers, and counselors, who will learn or
improve their skills, which in turn may reduce the need for the BERT (Choi et al., 2019).

Debriefing after a Violent Incident
Violent incidents are critical events and should be followed with debriefing measures similar to a cardiac code or
client injury. The focused, purposeful discussion employed to enhance education or make improvements is called
debriefing (Edwards et al., 2021). In this case, it will assist all staff members to process the event to help them
cope and recover. It will offer resources for further assistance in order to prevent post-traumatic stress and burnout.
It will involve a review of all elements of the event, prior and during, including areas in need of improvement. It will
include a brainstorming session about how the incident could have been handled better operationally. The
debriefing should also consider the client's perspective and offer staff members emotional support and an
opportunity to express feelings, fears, and learning needs.

     11.3 Powers of Attorney and Advance Directives

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the purpose of a power of attorney and its application to mental health nursing
         · Outline how a proxy directive can be used in a mental health situation
         · Define psychiatric advance directives and the way in which they are utilized in mental health care

     Individuals and families can make plans in advance of the need for action in mental health crisis situations. They can
     create an advance directive, which is a document that allows a person to make decisions when they are still
     capable of making them; they include three components: power of attorney, living will, and health-care proxy. These
     instructions allow for decision-making by designated others when a person is not capable of self-care, including
     making decisions on their care. It is important to become aware of the implications, limitations, and benefits of
     advance directives for those with mental illness.

     Power of Attorney (POA)

     Variable by state, a power of attorney (POA) is a written designation of authority to act for another person in
     specified matters (Table 11.3). It is one type of advance directive. Medical or health-care power of attorney gives the
     designee (agent), who must be over the age of 18, the permission to make decisions in the event the designator
     (principal) is incapacitated. A person living with mental illness may experience episodes of incapacity for decision-
     making, whether this involves psychological detachment from reality, extreme social withdrawal, or mental health
     crisis, including self-harm or danger to others, so it often makes sense to appoint a power of attorney in case these
     situations arise. Limitations of the POA are that no one can transfer authorization and no decisions can take place
     after the death of the principal.

     TABLE 11.3 Types of Power of Attorney

     Power of attorney status, in general, authorizes the agent to manage personal and business matters for a principal
     person. These matters may include financial, personal property, real estate, or contracts. The health-care power of
     attorney can speak for the person if the person cannot make their own health-care decisions. The health-care POA
     will follow the person's known wishes or directions as documented in the advance directive. Agents only make
     decisions if the principal is unable to do so. Agents may have access to the medical record and make decisions
     regarding admission/discharge, treatment, and medication.

     Psychiatric Advance Directives
     The application of the health-care POA to mental health nursing involves psychiatric advance directives (PAD), a
     legal document, variable by state, created by the person for use if the person becomes unable to make their own
     mental health-care decisions. The PAD can specify the person's choices regarding hospital admission, treatment,
     and medication in the case of a mental health emergency.

     Living Will
     Upon signing POA documents, the principal specifies their wishes, usually via a living will, a document that

11.3 · Powers of Attorney and Advance Directives                                                                           351

identifies acceptable medical treatment, especially at end of life. For persons living with mental illness who may
have a potential need for assisted or assumed decision-making, a living will sets forth the person's wishes while the
person is stable to decide. A person's directions specified in the living will document are intended to apply when
medical care is proposed to prolong life for an uncertain time frame to prevent death.

End-of-life care and hospice care directions may be part of the living will document. These directions include
treatments the person wishes to avoid, such as artificial feeding intubation, defibrillation, and so forth. If the person
cannot communicate at end of life, the living will can designate what treatment is acceptable. This may include the
person's preferences about resuscitation and organ donation after death.

Issues Related to Making Life Better
Quality of life is defined by the person themselves, and loved ones may or may not agree. For a person living with
mental illness, quality of life may involve aspects of treatment, personal freedoms, and a sense of personal control.

Autonomy is an ethical principle and an important factor in quality of life (Varkey, 2021). advance directive with
power of attorney designation can communicate a person's preferences for their future if the person becomes
incapable of making their own decisions. The hope and belief may be that the representative decision-makers will
make the "right" decision at the right time, though this is not guaranteed. Faced with medical decisions, input from
others, fear, uncertainty, and financial concerns, family members may struggle with these decisions, despite
knowing what the person may have wanted. A person's autonomy can conflict with loved ones' guilt or concerns
about the need for institutional care.

The Patient Self Determination Act of 1990 in the United States required health-care facilities accepting Medicare
and Medicaid to inform consumers of their rights to make preferences known. PAD can accomplish this and create a
partnership between the person and systems of care, possibly balancing the person's independence with
obligations of health-care providers. Resources available for individuals and families regarding advance directives
are available at:

        r/77APAdirective)

Proxy Directives

Proxy means representative. As with all advance directives, proxy designation varies in the United States by state. A
health-care proxy, also called durable medical power of attorney or health-care surrogate, is a person with legal
authorization to represent a client in their health-care decisions. The proxy will decide as the person would have
decided. The designated health-care proxy may have limited or broad authority, as designated by the principal,
including whether any other persons may be involved in decisions. An alternative proxy can be named, should the
primary proxy be unreachable at a needed time. In mental health-care situations, proxies are often involved with
decisions regarding quality of life and end-of-life care.

According to Medicare Rights (2023), there are specifics to consider when planning for representation in health-care
matters, such as:

    · Someone designated as health-care proxy may have access to the person's medical record. Any limits on this
        access should be designated.

    · Persons should ensure the proxy is aware of their beliefs and attitudes about care during illness and end of
        life, as well as preferences for facilities or providers. Documents should be updated if preferences change.

    · The person may change the proxy. If so, a new document is required.

Laws and guidelines vary by state, so persons should be aware that:

    · The proxy is a decision-maker for health care; arrangements concerning health-care costs and health
        insurance may be categorized as financial decisions.

    · State law may designate a decision-maker in the absence of the person's documented directives.
352  11 · Court Involvement

         · States may combine the living will and health-care proxy in the single advance directive document.

     Domingues et al. (2022) advocate for the person diagnosed with a mental health disorder to outline health-care
     proxies and advance directives during periods of stability. A person faced with death may cycle through thoughts
     and reactions related to multiple emotions. These changing emotional states may not coincide with actions
     specified in the advance directive. In these cases, or in periods of exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms, some
     forms of paternalism within the health-care systems may not sanction death without intervention for a person
     diagnosed with a mental illness (Domingues et al., 2022). While acknowledging that medical education and
     research should address these concerns, Domingues et al. (2022) assert that persons' autonomy is fundamental to
     health care.

     In a comprehensive literature review, Wilkinson et al. (2007) describe end of life as a "value-laden issue" due to the
     many aspects of chronic disease and the multiple methods of prolonging and sustaining a living state. End-of-life
     issues also apply to those clients who may have a mental health problem. Wilkinson et al. (2007) cite the concern of
     significant others to those with psychiatric diagnoses and found that "facilitated discussion" was helpful. Further,
     this review of literature found studies to support the interest and ability of persons living with mental illness to
     complete advance directives for psychiatric care. Specific to end-of-life care, nearly half of older persons studied
     who were diagnosed with depressive disorders had "do not resuscitate" orders and more than 10 percent rejected
     ventilation at end of life (Wilkinson et al., 2007).

     Concerning designation of proxy decision-makers, Wilkinson et al. (2007) cited a community study of those living
     with mental illness, which found more than 70 percent supported the idea of proxy and more than 60 percent were
     able to select a proxy.

     Concepts for end-of-life care include:

             LIFE-STAGE CONTEXT

     Considerations at End of Life

     For clients nearing the end of life, nurses should self-reflect, focus on self-care, and honor their therapeutic
     relationship with their clients in the following ways:

         · begin by asking clients about their beliefs related to end-of-life care
         · be aware of their own personal biases that can interfere with therapeutic communication
         · convey empathy, provide information, follow the client's cues
         · assure the client of provision of symptom relief
         · allow time for clients to express themselves and ask questions
         · reassure family members as indicated
         · perform ongoing psychosocial assessment for changing needs
         · intervene on acute distress, hopelessness, pain, or refusal of care with emotional support, stress reduction

             techniques, collaboration with other providers for change in plan of care

     (Vazquez & Santone, 2011)

     Implications of Psychiatric Advance Directives

     According to the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA, 2023), psychiatric advance
     directives (PAD) must comply with the state guidelines and typically include a notarized signature page with two
     additional witnesses signing. Frequently, the PAD may contain a statement of the person's intent in creating the

11.4 · Guardianship and Conservatorship                                                                                 353

PAD; the designation of another decision-maker if the person is adjudicated incompetent; designation of a guardian
if a court appoints one; the person's preferences for hospitalization, alternatives to hospitalization, specific
medications, or the use of electroconvulsive therapy; the person's preferences for emergency interventions, which
may address the use of seclusion, restraint, and emergency medication administration; willingness to participate in
experimental studies or research; people to notify upon the person's admission to a psychiatric facility; the person's
preferences regarding visitation if hospitalized and the care of dependent family members or pets; and the person's
right to suspend or terminate an advance directive while incapacitated, as allowed by state law (SAMHSA, 2023).

When conducting client and family education with regard to PAD, nurses should discuss the following benefits and
barriers to encourage informed decision-making. Collaborative care with social services and counselors is helpful.
Benefits and barriers associated with PAD as defined by the Joint Commission (2023) include:

    · Benefits
          client's autonomy
          improved relationships with providers
          treatment adherence
          less coercive interventions, especially if the person has specified certain medication
          better follow-up after discharge

    · Barriers
          lack of safe storage or ready access to the document
          lack of awareness or understanding by others
          lack of communication among treatment staff, especially emergency response teams
          some state laws provide for court petition to overrule the PAD

Nursing Responsibility Regarding PAD
According to Chan et al. (2019), completion rate in American states for advance directives is approximately 26
percent of the general population. Because acceptance of the idea is higher than the completion rate, this creates a
teaching opportunity for nurses. Especially in psychiatric-mental health nursing where nurse-client interaction is
basic care, the nurse can teach and advocate for clients interested in completing a PAD. Nurses can listen to clients
as they identify their values and assist them to access resources. This education may include involvement of the
family or trusted others. Nurses should evaluate client understanding of the process and provide additional
instruction or referral as appropriate. Nurses should also ensure that advance directives are included as a portion of
the client's care plan. They should review them with the clients in their first meeting and regularly thereafter to
ensure accuracy and currency. Nurses also should document advance directives in the medical record and
communicate their existence and content to all members of the interdisciplinary team.

Collaborative Care in Mental Health Advance Directives
Mental health case managers, social workers, therapists, counselors, and medical, nursing, and legal professionals
should work together in assisting clients and families to create a PAD. Collaboration may be through team treatment
meetings, through referrals, or in clinic-based care in community settings.

11.4 Guardianship and Conservatorship

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Define the role of a guardian/conservator
    · Outline the process for appointing a guardian/conservator
    · Discuss ethical concerns in appointment of a guardian/conservator

Guardianship and conservatorship processes will vary in the United States by individual states.

A guardianship is created through the courts to manage financial, legal, and personal matters for a person who
lacks capacity to do so. A conservatorship is similar but can be created due to the absence of responsible parties,
such as for children with absent parents, and may focus more specifically on financial aspects. Both guardianship
and conservatorship are court-appointed, legally protected designations and both have ethical implications in
nursing practice. Conservators are paid to serve, and these funds come from the person's estate, or the court may
designate the payment arrangement. Conservators can act as a neutral party if there are conflicts in the person's
354  11 · Court Involvement

     family about the person's care. Conservatorship is a matter of public record, which may raise privacy concerns
     (Family Caregiver Alliance, 2012).

     Defining Guardianship and Conservatorship in Relation to Mental Health

     The guardian or conservator is the court-appointed agent to represent the declared-incompetent person as
     decision-maker, on a temporary or permanent basis, in legal, financial, and/or personal matters. Barton et al. (2014)
     acknowledge that definitions vary across American states, though a common definition of competency in guardian
     and conservator cases is the ability for self-care, with decision-making and communication as essential
     components. The person still has the right to participate in their own care to the extent of their ability (Barton et al.,
     2014). In some states, a health-care proxy may take precedent over an appointed guardian by state law.

             PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

     Reasons for Having a Guardian or Conservator

     Here are some examples of instances when a guardian/conservator may be required:

         · mental illness impairs judgment to make legal, financial, and personal decisions
         · unable to meet basic needs for health or housing
         · cognitive impairment, intellectual disability, dementia
         · frail older adult or impaired by illness or injury
         · medical conditions, such as traumatic brain injury or stroke
         · vulnerable to exploitation

     (Copenhaver, Ellet & Derrico, n.d.)

     Suitable Guardians
     The guardian or conservator must be someone willing to take the responsibility as an officer of the court. The
     guardian or conservator should be someone the person chooses and often is a family member. If the court finds the
     guardian or conservator unsuitable, another relative of the person or even an attorney may be court-appointed.
     Recognizing variations by state, guardians may be required to submit ongoing reports to the court on the person's
     status. More than one guardian may be appointed and some guardianships and conservatorships may be temporary
     or limited in scope (Barton et al., 2014).

     Alternatives to Guardianship
     As discussed, psychiatric advance directives can be a method to designate a personal representative while the
     person is capable of making decisions, prior to an emergency need. Short-term guardianships (for such time as the
     parent or responsible party is absent) and supported decision-making agreements (authorizing a trusted other) can
     be created with legal advice within each state.

     Appointing a Guardian or Conservator

     Courts must be petitioned for guardianship or conservatorship, and each state has established procedures for
     seeking these designations. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, most states allow "any person" to file a
     court petition for guardianship. Persons who file may be friends or family members, health-care providers, or
     members of the community, including organizations and agencies of the government. In general, after the individual
     or agency files a petition, the person in question receives notification and attends a court hearing. An investigation
     may proceed the hearing, and the entire process can take weeks to months (Barton et al., 2014).

     Ethical Concerns

     Actions that are legally allowed may still raise ethical concerns. Guardianships and conservatorships are forms of
     surrogate decision-making, wherein the person being represented is removed from personal and material decisions
     and loses control in the process. Another concern involves how competence and capacity, which both mean
     "ability," are evaluated and whether the status can change. Competency is usually considered to be a legal term,
     while capacity is regarded as being a medical term (Libby et al., 2023). A competency hearing in court includes
     expert testimony from mental health professionals and statements from the person and significant others. The

     Access for free at openstax.org
11.4 · Guardianship and Conservatorship                                                                                   355

witnesses may offer evidence of how the person made decisions that had harmful effect. The court may question
the person to determine understanding of the information presented and may be asked to verbalize the significance
of the situation. So even though there are objective criteria for a legal determination of incompetence, there still
exists a subjective component to it, which creates an ethical challenge.

In addition, conflicts of interest may exist between clients and their potential guardians; the court is responsible for
determining potential sources of conflict. Conflicts may arise over custody of children, inheritance awards, property
ownership, or residence. Cultural values or religious beliefs likewise could pose conflicts between persons and
those appointed to be their guardians or conservators. There is also no central tool to evaluate the process.

Nursing Role
In care of clients under guardianship or conservatorship, nurses may feel a conflict between two essential concepts
in client care: autonomy and safety. While respecting the need for protection for vulnerable clients, nurses may
struggle with the loss of aspects of the person's self-determination. This may be especially so when clients show
improvement in treatment.

Catlin et al. (2021) found clinicians' (including nurses) experience with guardianships was variable, though seen as
generally positive. Overall, the study revealed that clinicians view guardianship as appropriate to resolve issues for
persons unable to make their own decisions. Nurses reportedly feel unprepared to address issues of guardians'
neglect or mismanagement of clients' affairs and such distress could even contribute to burnout in the profession
(Catlin et al., 2021). Nurses are encouraged to connect with mentors and colleagues for support and to stay
informed in these aspects of client care.

  CLINICAL JUDGMENT MEASUREMENT MODEL

  Recognize Cues: What Findings Require Action?

  What does the nurse notice about the client and family and what seems to matter most?

  The nurse collects the data that the family member expresses guilt about seeking guardianship for their loved
  one. The nurse invites the family member to talk and share their concerns. The nurse processes with the family
  member what options for the client's safety had been available and what may have been the outcome if
  guardianship were not established. The nurse takes the action of determining what information about
  guardianship the family requires and what supportive resources can be obtained.
356 11 · Summary

Summary

11.1 Reasons for Court-Ordered Treatment

The reasons for court-ordered treatment can be complex. If a person is thought to be a danger to themselves or
others, or has a grave incapacity, they may be treated on an involuntary basis. This involves court recommendations
and the continual monitoring of the client through the medical and court system. Each state designates the
guidelines for mental health treatment when necessitated by court order. These directives address circumstances,
length of time, and individual rights. Court-ordered treatment may take place inside a health-care facility, out in the
community (whether residential or day treatment, including mandatory support group attendance), or in visits to
mental health-care providers. There are two types of processes to initiate involuntary commitment: (1) emergency
and (2) judicial. Some states permit emergency treatment orders, which allow provision of medically prescribed
treatment with or without consent.

11.2 Violence and Safety

Nurses should not assume that clients are choosing to act violently; often clients may not be in control of personal
responses. Ongoing nursing assessment with early intervention at lower stages of clients' anxiety will contribute to
safety for everyone involved. Further, appropriate nursing care includes teaching to increase the client's self-
management ability.

Though policies and procedures vary across facility settings in all states, safety for clients and staff and ethics in
nursing practice are the truest guides. Person-centered, trauma-informed care directs nursing action. Least
restrictive methods for management of aggressive behavior include the therapeutic relationship, time-out, and PRN
medication. Most restrictive measures include the use of medication by court order, seclusion, and restraint.

11.3 Powers of Attorney and Advance Directives

Powers of attorney, health-care proxies, and other advance directives address decision-making by designated
others when a person is not capable of making decisions themselves. State law varies as it applies to these
concepts in terms of who a client can designate and the manner and documentation that must be used to designate
them. The rate of psychiatric advance directives completion is low in the United States, which may suggest an
opportunity for education in nursing practice. The nurse as advocate and educator is in position to inform individuals
and families of the option to make an advance directive for mental health care.

11.4 Guardianship and Conservatorship

Guardianships and conservatorships are created through the courts to manage financial, legal, and personal matters
for a person who lacks competence to do so. Competence is a determination also made by the courts; it is defined
by state law, and these laws vary. Someone can petition a court to secure a guardian for a client for a number of
reasons, such as mental illness impairing judgment to make legal, financial, and personal decisions; inability to
meet basic needs; cognitive impairment; or impaired by illness. While the purpose of guardianships is to honor the
person's wishes by appointing someone to make decisions in line with what they might have wanted, ethical
considerations abound. Nurses grapple with the loss of autonomy experienced by these clients as weighed against
ensuring their safety.

Reflection Questions

    1. The nurse, Jorri, meets with an older adult client who will be discharged from the hospital later today. The
        discharge plan includes assisted outpatient treatment, mandated as a condition of the client's release. The
        client, Edward, sits without speaking, arms crossed, looking down at the floor. The nurse opens a
        conversation:

        Jorri: It seems to me you have something on your mind. If so, can we talk about it?

        Edward: What's there to talk about? All my decisions are made for me.

        Jorri: Your decisions . . . ?

        Edward: Yeah, like how I live when I get out of here. Going to therapy appointments every week and even
        having somebody come to my house to check on me. Like I'm not a grown man!

        Jorri personally feels community care is appropriate for Edward, though Jorri can see Edward's distress.
        Consider the QSEN competency regarding the limits and boundaries of therapeutic client-centered care. In
        this scenario, what knowledge, skills, and attitudes should the nurse consider to guide a response to the

        person living with mental illness, and offer strategies to address these.

What Should the Nurse Do?

Elin, a forty-five-year-old female, has been brought to the outpatient mental health clinic by her family. She has a
history of severe alcohol use disorder and has been involved in multiple legal incidents related to her substance
misuse. These incidents range from driving under the influence (DUI) charges to public intoxication and altercations
related to her aggressive behavior. Family members have expressed great concern about her safety as well as the
safety of others, highlighting the urgency of a comprehensive intervention. She presents with symptoms of anxiety,
depression, and occasional episodes of aggression. Elin's medical history includes chronic liver disease due to her
alcohol consumption. She has previously engaged in outpatient treatment for substance misuse, but has struggled
to maintain sobriety.

    1. Considering Elin's history of legal incidents and the potential threat to her own safety and others, discuss why
        court-ordered therapy might be deemed necessary for her case. How do the legal implications of her
        substance misuse contribute to the decision for involuntary intervention, and, what ethical considerations
360 11 · Assessments

        should be taken into account?
    2. Given Elin's complex needs, provide examples of specific types of court-ordered therapy that could be

        beneficial in her case. How might inpatient rehabilitation, dual diagnosis treatment, and counseling programs
        address the multifaceted challenges presented by her severe alcohol use disorder, chronic liver disease, and
        co-occurring anxiety and depression?
    3. What legal criteria and procedures would need to be considered when initiating involuntary court-ordered
        treatment for Elin? Identify and discuss the steps involved in determining whether she meets the necessary
        criteria for involuntary intervention.

Alexandra, a thirty-five-year-old female, has presented at the emergency department (ED) seeking assistance for
escalating symptoms of severe anxiety and depression. She reports experiencing persistent feelings of
hopelessness, insomnia, and a significant loss of interest in daily activities. Alexandra has a history of bipolar
disorder and is currently prescribed mood stabilizers. Her medical history also includes a recent hospitalization due
to a suicide attempt. In the ED, Alexandra's vital signs reveal an elevated heart rate of 110 beats per minute, blood
pressure of 150/90 mmHg, and shallow breathing. Given her history and the acuity of her symptoms, staff safety is a
concern. Alexandra appears agitated, and her affect is labile.

    4. Identify three specific mental health issues that Alexandra is currently facing based on her reported
        symptoms and history. How do these issues contribute to concerns regarding her safety in the emergency
        department?

    5. Outline at least three immediate approaches nurses can employ in the ED to address Alexandra's safety
        concerns based on her elevated vital signs and agitated state. How can the physical environment and
        communication strategies contribute to ensuring her safety during this encounter?

    6. Considering Alexandra's case, what specific challenges might nurses face in ensuring their own safety while
        providing care? How can interdisciplinary collaboration and clear communication contribute to enhancing
        staff safety in the context of this emergency situation?

Sunil, a fifty-five-year-old male, has been admitted to the psychiatric unit with a history of bipolar disorder. He
presents with symptoms of severe mood swings, impulsivity, and decreased need for sleep. Sunil has a well-
documented psychiatric history, including multiple hospitalizations due to manic episodes. Upon admission, his vital
signs are stable, with a heart rate of 78 beats per minute, blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, and normal respiratory
rate. Given the recurrent nature of his condition, Sunil has a comprehensive mental health-care plan that includes a
power of attorney designating his sister as his legal representative. Additionally, he has a living will specifying
preferences for treatment during periods of incapacitation. Sunil has also provided a psychiatric advance directive
outlining his preferences for specific psychiatric interventions in various scenarios.

    7. Sunil's psychiatric history includes multiple hospitalizations due to manic episodes. How might the power of
        attorney designated to his sister play a crucial role in ensuring continuity of care during his hospitalizations?
        Discuss specific scenarios where the sister's involvement might be essential.

    8. Sunil has a living will specifying treatment preferences during periods of incapacitation. How can the nurse
        effectively communicate and collaborate with Sunil's sister to tailor his care to his preferences while
        balancing the legal and ethical aspects of mental health nursing?

    9. Define the role of psychiatric advance directives in mental health care. How might Sunil's psychiatric advance
        directive influence decision-making in specific psychiatric interventions, and what challenges could arise in
        implementing these directives within the clinical setting?

Geraldine, a sixty-eight-year-old female, has been admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of advanced Alzheimer's
disease. She presents with symptoms of severe cognitive decline, including disorientation, memory loss, and
difficulty performing activities of daily living. Geraldine's medical history includes a gradual deterioration of cognitive
function over the past two years, leading to increased dependency on others for basic care. During this admission,
her vital signs are within normal ranges, with a heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure of 130/78 mmHg,
and a regular respiratory rate. Due to the progression of her Alzheimer's disease, concerns have arisen about
Geraldine's ability to make decisions regarding her health care and living situation.

  10. Given Geraldine's advanced Alzheimer's disease and cognitive decline, how would you define the role of a
        guardian or conservator in her situation? Consider the specific responsibilities and decision-making authority
        that a guardian or conservator might have in managing her health care and living arrangements.

        her advanced Alzheimer's disease. Consider the legal and procedural aspects involved in initiating and
        completing this process.
  12. In Geraldine's case, how might the appointment of a guardian or conservator impact her overall well-being,
        considering not only medical decisions but also aspects of her daily life and personal preferences? Discuss
        potential benefits and drawbacks of such an appointment.

Competency-Based Assessments

    2. Why is client safety a nursing priority, and what factors should nurses consider in assessing potential risks?

    3. What are some early nursing interventions to address aggressive or violent behaviors, and why are they
        considered effective?

    4. How can health-care staff ensure their safety when working with clients exhibiting mental health diagnoses
        and symptoms?

    5. What is a psychiatric advance directive (PAD), and how does it contribute to mental health-care decision-
        making?

    6. What is the general process for appointing a guardian or conservator, and why might it be necessary to seek
        such designations?

    7. What ethical concerns may arise in the appointment of a guardian or conservator, and how might these
        concerns impact the individual under guardianship or conservatorship?

Self-Determination and Advocacy

CHAPTER OUTLINE
12.1 Client Representation for Empowerment and Relationship Rebuilding
12.2 Autonomy and Independence
12.3 Self-Advocacy
12.4 Client Advocacy

INTRODUCTION When a person has autonomy, they are able to make appropriate choices in their life. They are
empowered and can form meaningful relationships that provide them the self-determination required to make their
own life decisions. To have autonomy and self-determination, the person may have to advocate for themselves and
feel comfortable in doing so to achieve their required outcomes.
When nurses encounter clients in the mental health-care field, the clients have often experienced some type of
trauma. Whatever the cause, the client may feel or live with symptoms that make them feel as though they have lost
control of their emotions, actions, and/or ability to self-determine. Often the disturbance in their equilibrium results
in embarrassment, anxiety, and stigma. The effort to achieve a more balanced state includes a variety of
interventions that can return them to a place where they can advocate for themselves and have the ability to make
autonomous decisions.
Nurses will encounter clients at various levels of functional ability. Therefore, nurses must recognize each client as
an individual and meet them where they are. According to the American Nurses Association (ANA) Scope and
Standards of Practice, advocacy, respect, and communication begin the process of caregiving; they also require
consideration of cultural differences and absence of stigma (ANA, 2015). For each client, the mental health nurse
366  12 · Self-Determination and Advocacy

     works to complete an assessment, establish a trusting relationship, and meet the immediate needs through
     collaboration with other members of the health-care team. Supporting the client's ability to self-determine, increase
     the level of functioning, and enhance client empowerment are roles of the mental health team.

     12.1 Client Representation for Empowerment and Relationship Rebuilding

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Identify circumstances where client representation is required for clients with a mental health problem
         · Describe the issues relating to a client who has diminished responsibility
         · Outline ways to encourage the empowerment for clients with a mental health problem
         · Identify situations when the empowerment approach would be used in providing care to a client with a

             mental health problem

     Client representation entails that the mental health nurse put aside their own bias and provide culturally sensitive
     care to each client. Effective client representation means increasing the comfort of the client, protecting their rights,
     and including the client and family in the assessment and creation of a plan of care. Clients may enter mental health
     services through a variety of situations, including the justice system. Nurses and other mental health professionals
     work to create a feeling of empowerment through various avenues and protections.

     Client Representation

     In legal terms, client representation means to consult with the client regarding the client's objectives, how the
     client wants to proceed, and then take the action approved by the client (American Bar Association, 2024). Mental
     health nurses can participate in this role. Nurses are empowered by self-awareness, which can transfer to advocacy.
     Mental health nurses who speak as representatives for their clients are called to take every opportunity to
     understand the lived experience of those in their care.

     When the client enters the care environment following an interruption in their equilibrium, it is important for them to
     be treated with respect and appropriate decisions made regarding their treatment plan. Sometimes, significant
     others may be available to express the concerns of a client who is unable to express their own needs and assist with
     establishing an acceptable plan of care. Other times, health-care facilities have recognized the need for client
     representatives to serve as a liaison between clients and family members and health-care workers, advocating for
     the rights of the client.

     The Criminal Justice System
     Studies indicate that 18 percent of the general U.S. population lives with mental illness and that approximately 37
     percent to 44 percent of those in jails or prisons have mental illness. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health
     Services Administration (SAMHSA, 2022) describes an overrepresentation of individuals with mental health
     conditions in the criminal justice system. In an effort to divert these clients, Mental Health America (MHA) has
     suggested that timely and accurate screening and evaluation can successfully result in the placement of individuals
     with mental health concerns in the appropriate care setting, avoiding falling into the criminal justice system (MHA,
     2023). Another suggestion includes allowing access to a mental health professional for those who do find
     themselves in the criminal justice system, leading to appropriate assessment and treatment for adults and
     adolescents.

     The Americans with Disabilities Act
     It is important for nurses to understand that mental health issues can be considered disabilities under federal law.
     The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is the civil rights law ensuring that persons with disabilities receive
     protections from discrimination with respect to employment, public services and accommodations, transportation,
     and other aspects of daily living. Physical and mental diagnoses that limit participation in activities of daily living

(ADL) are considered to be disabilities under this law. Such disabilities include impairments or limitations in basic
activities like eating, sleeping, physical movement, thinking, concentrating, communicating, and emotional or
thought regulation, especially as these impact public social and workplace interactions (ADA National Network,
2018; Spriggle, 2017). It is also important to note that mental health challenges can exacerbate physical disabilities
that individuals may have.

Diminished Responsibility

Reduced liability for a criminal act on the part of a defendant who has been proven to have certain alterations in
thought processes is called diminished responsibility (Johnston, 2024). It provides a mitigating defense when the
mental health disease is not severe enough to excuse criminal responsibility completely. In certain circumstances,
the diminished responsibility defense replaces, and is a lesser version, of an insanity plea; the individual often will
receive a sentence for a lesser crime, for example, manslaughter instead of murder.

Nurses' Response to Clients with Diminished Responsibility
A court conviction for a lesser charge by reason of diminished responsibility is brought due to finding of the
defendant's inability to comprehend the legal aspects of the situation. Examples of mental health conditions that
may support a finding of diminished responsibility include:

    · neurodevelopment disorders
    · psychotic disorders
    · bipolar disorders
    · depressive disorders
    · trauma and stress-related disorders
    · neurocognitive disorders (Missouri State Public Defender, 2016)

Nursing care for clients with these diagnoses requires interventions to address alterations in thought processes and
sensory perception, such as presenting reality, safely confronting delusions, and monitoring mood and risk for
harmful behaviors. Medications and collaborative care will be essential for these clients. In addition, communication
and coping skills will be included in client and family education.

Nonjudgmental care is a professional standard even when a client has been accused or convicted of a crime.
Hammarström et al. (2019) found that nurses' identity as caring professionals was challenged in these situations.
Nurses reported feeling frustrated, while also wanting to be open to the client's experience and condition. These
researchers suggest that nurses utilize strategies of reflection and basic self-care, look at their roles realistically,
and strive for ethical practice (Hammarström et al., 2019).

Lehrer (2021) addressed the problem from a trauma-informed care perspective and acknowledged that a
compassionate connection is necessary in the therapeutic relationship. Lehrer calls for nursing competence in
communication, assessment, and a commitment to the human right of unbiased health care.

Empowerment

Empowered individuals are able to mobilize existing resources to accomplish goals. The World Health Organization
(WHO, 2024) calls for the empowerment of communities, which means assisting people to take action toward
improving their own health. This action requires development of personal skills for members of these communities
through health promotion education (WHO, 2024).

Individuals can learn to take control of their lives and make decisions that affect their well-being. In other words,
nurses can help clients to become more empowered. Assisting mental health clients to gain self-confidence, self-
esteem, and self-awareness can result in clients experiencing empowerment in different areas of life, such as
career, finances, health, and relationships. With empowerment, clients enhance communication, build trust, and
maintain boundaries, which can improve relationships.

Empowerment in Mental Health Care
According to the Directorate-General for Health & Consumers (2010) of the World Health Organization,
"Empowerment is not a destination, but a journey" (p. 1). Empowerment involves people learning to adopt self-
reliance, participating in decisions, possessing dignity and respect for others, feeling a sense of belonging, and
368  12 · Self-Determination and Advocacy

     contributing to a wider community. Self-determination and autonomy are included in this process.

     Review this document from the World Health Organization titled User Empowerment in Mental Health
     (https://openstax.org/r/77caregvrempwr) to better understand worldwide efforts to empower the caregivers in
     mental health as well as the recipients of mental health care. This document addresses perspectives and taking
     action at societal, service, education, and individual levels.

     Differentiating Between Empowerment and Enablement
     It is important to recognize the difference between empowerment and enablement in efforts to assist clients.
     Empowering someone helps them change their behavior on their own. Nurses can empower clients by guiding them
     to resources and teaching them life skills. Empowerment will give them the power to make and live with their own
     choices (BRC Healthcare, 2021). When a person attempts to make life easier for an individual that leads to negative
     consequences, it is called enablement. Enabling someone reinforces negative behaviors. Some examples of
     enabling are ignoring or tolerating negative behaviors, providing excessive monetary assistance, covering or making
     excuses, doing work for them, denying there is a problem, and failing to follow through with established
     consequences. When nurses empower in place of enable, they give mental health clients the ability to confidently
     assess their options, make choices that align with their values, and live by their choices.

             LINK TO LEARNING

     Read the article Are you empowering or enabling? (https://openstax.org/r/77enabling) to understand the differences
     between empowering and enabling and to more effectively help mental health clients.

     The Empowerment Approach in Mental Health Care

     The overall process of empowering clients in mental health care entails the following: helping to restore hope and
     respect, enabling clients to reclaim their life, helping them to feel connected, recognizing and helping them
     recognize their rights, following client preferences for learning skills, moving from secrecy to transparency, and
     assisting with self-initiated growth and change.

     Dimensions of Empowerment
     Empowerment is the process of taking control and responsibility for one's own actions. Four dimensions identified in
     this process include:

         · self-reliance
         · participation in decisions
         · dignity and respect
         · belonging and contributing to a wider community (Directorate-General for Health & Consumers, 2010)

     Many clients experience powerlessness; the process of empowerment can assist them in gaining control of their life,
     resulting in increased self-esteem (Directorate-General for Health & Consumers, 2010). Learning to trust in one's
     ability to take care of self and collaborating with supportive others creates an environment wherein clients' well-
     being is protected and enhanced.

     Empowerment and Relationships
     Nursing practice is relationship-based. The nurse-client relationship is based upon shared decision-making,
     empathy, and effective communication. Molina-Mula and Gallo-Estrada (2020) state that nurses should strive to
     preserve the client's values in health care and respect the client's experience. This is the meaning of person-
     centered care, which promotes client autonomy (Molina-Mula and Gallo-Estrada, 2020). Empowerment helps
     clients experience strong, healthy relationships in their personal lives. With empowerment, individuals have more
     confidence and are more able to build trusting relationships. Empowerment promotes stability in relationships and
     enhances problem-solving skills due to the individual's comfort in representing their own interests.

        PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Empowerment-Based Practice with Children with Autism

Edmunds, in a post in Psychology Today, discusses the importance of recognizing that children with autism need to
be supported with respect and dignity. Researchers noted the importance of seeing the person with autism as a
valued member of society. In order to advocate for children with autism, health-care workers should not make
assumptions of ability based upon outward expressions or behaviors alone; they should validate persons on the
autism spectrum, and they should avoid correcting the person with autism because it interferes with equitable
treatment.

(Edmunds, 2013)

12.2 Autonomy and Independence

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Explain the elements of autonomy
    · Describe why restrictions might be placed on the autonomy of a person with a mental health diagnosis or

        symptoms
    · Discuss power sharing in the therapeutic relationship

The concepts of autonomy (ability to make decisions) and independence (ability to function without assistance) are
often discussed together. While autonomy is related to the right to make one's own decisions with minimal
interference from others, independence encompasses the client's ability to do things on their own, without any
assistance from others (Toledano-Gonzalez et al., 2019). For instance, a client may need assistance with ADLs, but
continue to have the ability to make informed decisions in a meaningful way.

In mental health care, clients may need assistance in making decisions, due to the severity of mental health
symptoms, so it might compromise autonomy. If thought processes are impaired and clients are unable to interpret
reality, or if clients are at risk for behaviors dangerous to self or others, it may call for restriction of autonomy and
independence therapeutically or legally. Personal power can be restored as mental health is restored and the nurse-
client relationship is instrumental in this process.

Defining Autonomy for Mental Health Clients

One of the fundamental ethical principles in health care, and often at the heart of nursing care, is freedom for clients
to make decisions for themselves (ANA, 2015). In mental health care, individuals may be unable to make decisions
for themselves perhaps until they have received treatment, which can become complicated when an individual is
unable to make the decision to receive the treatment. Clients may enter the mental health system demonstrating an
inability for self-care due to the exacerbation of their diagnosis. For example, a client with bipolar disorder in their
euphoric state may demonstrate the lack of ability to make appropriate decisions related to spending money.

Freedom is a component of autonomy and when individuals are restricted for their safety, for example, court-
ordered into treatment, it limits autonomy. One argument in favor of such limitation is that the disease process itself
has already altered the person's autonomy; therefore, protections are indicated (SAMHSA, 2019).

        PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Substitute Decision-Making: Alexandra's Story

Involuntary hospitalization was necessary for Alexandra due to her diagnosis in childhood. Now, as an adult, she
feels that the loss of control and inability to participate in her care damaged her self-esteem and complicated her
condition, leaving her without confidence.

Though substitute decision-making may be deemed necessary for those who lack capacity, the experience of the
370  12 · Self-Determination and Advocacy

     person cannot be discounted. The subsequent fear and mistrust resulting from restrictive methods of behavior
     management leave lasting impressions and interfere later in life with health-seeking.

     Alexandra relates her work with a therapist who empowered her to regain her sense of self.

     See the World Health Organization article Autonomy in health decision-making--a key to recovery in mental health
     care (https://openstax.org/r/77autonomy) for her personal insight into the role of autonomy recovery for a mental
     health client.

     The Influence of Autonomy on Behavior
     The ability to exercise autonomy allows the client to demonstrate responsibility, integrity, dignity, individuality, and
     self-knowledge (Liu et al., 2022). Mental health clients can lose this ability with an exacerbation of their disease,
     creating the need for someone to be responsible for making decisions for them.

     Agency
     The term agency, according to Wheeler (2020), means feeling control over one's decisions and well-being. It is the
     component of autonomy that involves individuals being in control of what happens to them. In mental health
     recovery, agency plays a large role as the client begins to regain an ability to be in charge of their lives and become
     the owner of their thoughts, feelings, and actions.

     Restrictions on Autonomy and Independence

     There are certain circumstances under which restrictions on a client's autonomy are justified legally, medically, and
     ethically. Nurses should be aware of these instances, should understand the appropriate ways to limit autonomy in
     the least restrictive means necessary, and should work with clients to implement interventions that will help them
     to regain autonomy as quickly as possible. When a client is in an impaired state--for example, in pain, emotionally
     traumatized, or unable for any reason to make an informed decision--the client's autonomy may be restricted.

     Nurses are bound by their ethical duty to keep clients' confidentiality, respect clients' right to refuse treatment, and
     ensure that clients receive emergency and continuous care. All this within the condition that if harm would ensue to
     the client or to others, the nurse may be in a position to modify some of these aspects of care. Careful
     documentation and consultation are essential for such restrictive nursing action in relation to restrictions on
     autonomy and independence for the client.

     Independence
     Independence represents an individual's ability to perform activities of daily living without assistance. Included are
     things like bathing, dressing, eating, ambulating, housework, and managing medication. With independence comes
     the ability to live alone. Often the mental health client temporarily loses the ability to live independently until they
     are returned to their pre-exacerbation level of functioning. For some individuals, however, they may come to a point
     where loss of independence is permanent and long-term arrangements must be made.

     Rationality
     According to Pugh (2020), autonomous decision-making is based on a person's concept of what options they have.
     Therefore, if an irrational thought process drives a chosen action, the action may be inappropriate, illegal, or
     harmful. In that situation, the autonomous decision may actually have been involuntary (Pugh, 2020). Another name
     for guidance of reason is rationality. This is in contrast to rationalization, which is a defense mechanism used in
     attempts to explain experiences that prompt unacceptable feelings. As a short-term defense against anxiety,
     rationalization can be a coping mechanism. However, when used frequently or if preventing emotional resolution, it
     can be unhealthy. With mental illnesses, it can prevent the client from accepting truth and delay a return to their
     previous level of functioning.

             CLINICAL SAFETY AND PROCEDURES (QSEN)

     Client-Centered Care: Autonomy

     The QSEN competencies provide a framework for nursing education and practice, emphasizing the importance of

     Access for free at openstax.org
12.2 · Autonomy and Independence                                                                                         371

client-centered care, safety, quality improvement, teamwork, and evidence-based practice. Advocacy in psychiatric-
mental health nursing aligns closely with several QSEN competencies:

Client-centered care: Advocacy in psychiatric nursing involves prioritizing the needs, preferences, and rights of
clients. Nurses advocate for client-centered care by ensuring that treatment plans are individualized, respecting
clients' autonomy and self-determination, and actively involving clients in decision-making processes regarding
their care and treatment options.

Safety: Advocacy in psychiatric-mental health nursing also encompasses ensuring the safety and well-being of
clients. Nurses advocate for safety by assessing and managing risks, such as suicidal ideation or aggression, and
implementing appropriate interventions to prevent harm while promoting client autonomy. This may involve
collaborating with interdisciplinary teams, implementing de-escalation techniques, and advocating for the use of
least restrictive interventions.

Teamwork and collaboration: Effective advocacy in psychiatric-mental health nursing often requires collaboration
with interdisciplinary teams, including psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and other health-care
professionals. Nurses advocate for clients by collaborating with team members to develop comprehensive care
plans, ensuring that clients' needs are addressed holistically and that their voices are heard in the care process.

Evidence-based practice (EBP): Advocacy in psychiatric-mental health nursing is informed by EBP, which involves
integrating the best available evidence with clinical expertise and client preferences. Nurses advocate for evidence-
based interventions and practices that promote client autonomy, recovery, and well-being. This may include
advocating for the implementation of psychoeducation, cognitive behavioral therapy, and other evidence-based
therapeutic modalities.

Quality improvement: Advocacy in psychiatric-mental health nursing also involves participating in quality
improvement initiatives aimed at enhancing client outcomes and safety. Nurses advocate for quality improvement
by identifying areas for improvement in the delivery of psychiatric care, such as reducing stigma, improving access
to mental health services, and promoting client empowerment and self-advocacy. By participating in quality
improvement efforts, nurses contribute to the enhancement of psychiatric nursing practice and the delivery of high-
quality, client-centered care.

Informatics: Technologies such as electronic medical records (EMRs) and medication distribution systems help to
promote client safety, preventing harm and promoting client autonomy.

By incorporating advocacy into psychiatric-mental health nursing practice in alignment with QSEN competencies,
nurses can effectively promote the rights, well-being, and recovery of individuals experiencing mental illness while
contributing to the delivery of safe, high-quality care in psychiatric-mental health settings.

The client-centered care competencies (https://openstax.org/r/77clientcare) of knowledge, skills, and attitudes
(KSAs) are expected of the student nurse as they transition to practice as a licensed nurse. The table serves as a
resource to guide curricular development in formal academic nursing programs.

Power Sharing in the Therapeutic Relationship

The power to change and recover belongs to the client, and nurses share in the client's success. The therapeutic
relationship is a helping relationship wherein a space is created for nursing interventions and client response. Goals
of treatment are developed with the client and adjusted as care progresses; therefore, power is shared from the
beginning. Allande-Cussó et al. (2022) assert that the nurse-client relationship is the foundation of nursing care,
nursing skill, and nursing intervention simultaneously.

Nurse-client relationships function with respect and mutual decision-making, which promote independence and
self-care for the client (Akpotor & Johnson, 2018). Nurse appreciation of the client experience enhances client
participation. In focus group research, Beyene et al. (2018) found that clients may need differing levels of support to
participate in care planning, even relying on nursing to make decisions. Nurses must respect this process of
balancing responsibility with power, as this balance is essential in order to provide safe and optimal care (Beyene et
al., 2018).
372  12 · Self-Determination and Advocacy

     Challenges in Power Sharing
     Nurses may view clients as incapable of participating in their own care due to their illness. Nurses may consider
     clients lacking in sufficient knowledge, motivation, or energy to resolve their own problems, especially if clients
     enter the health-care system frequently. Unfortunately, nurses may blame clients for their health-care needs.

     Nurses may approach client care from a rescue perspective, believing that the nurse is the one to heal the client. If
     nurses approach client interactions with these concepts in mind, there could be an implied message of the nurse's
     greater power in the relationship. As mentioned, clients may present as dependent and be mindful of the imbalance
     in power between the client and the nurse. In these cases, nurses' attitudes may be reinforced and a cycle of
     imbalanced power results.

     Application of Power-Sharing Techniques
     Nurses must look honestly at their own beliefs before power-sharing skills can be acquired.

     The practice of trauma-informed care (TIC) means that nurses realize the far-reaching effects of trauma in people's
     lives and refine nursing care accordingly in a manner that helps to share the power in the relationship through
     recognizing the needs of the client. The strategies in Table 12.1 utilize concepts of TIC from the Substance Abuse
     and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA, 2023).

     Concept        Technique/Example

     Safety         Manage the physical environment and provide information
                    Example: The nurse ensures lighting and comfort for the interaction and explains what the
                    conversation or procedure will be about.

     Trust          Use open communication, transparency, and advanced notice
                    Example: The nurse introduces self and invites the client to share. The nurse informs the client
                    of scheduled activities.

     Supportive     Include family members and peers
     others         Example: The nurse acknowledges the client's supportive others.

     Partnering     Level power differences between staff and client
                    Example: The nurse speaks of staff members as collaborating to assist the client.

     Empowerment    Build upon client's strengths and experience
                    Example: The nurse assists the client with strengths identification. The nurse acknowledges
                    the client's experience.

     Cultural and   Move beyond stereotypes and bias
     gender issues  Example: The nurse examines own values, is nonjudgmental of client's beliefs, and considers
                    the client's perspective and incorporates it into mutual decision-making.

         · Define the components of self-advocacy
         · Outline the strategies that a nurse can use to help promote self-advocacy for clients

     Mental health clients enter treatment for various reasons, and it is important to remember that treatment is done
     with or alongside a client, not to a client. The goal is to work with the client in a collaborative fashion to achieve what
     they want and what they need, considering the client's values and beliefs. Mental health recovery belongs to the
     client, not the nurse. The objective is to accompany the client on their journey.

Defining Self-Advocacy in Mental Health

In a mental health context, self-advocacy means the ability to speak for oneself, have full autonomy, and complete
agency. Self-advocacy means expressing personal beliefs, and making needs known, toward meeting personal
goals. Ways to enhance and encourage self-advocacy in clients include asking the client to identify what they want
and what they need and collaborating with them and their family to achieve the goals the client sets. Self-advocacy
according to Davis (2021) includes the following:

    · speaking up for yourself
    · making your own decisions
    · identifying support
    · knowing and owning your rights
    · using problem-solving skills
    · learning about self-determination
    · fighting for your independence
    · owning your actions and words
    · deciding what is suitable for you and going to get it

Self-advocacy can empower the individual, just as support and advocacy from others can promote empowerment.
Empowerment is the ability to take the necessary action. For example, clients should feel empowered to ask
questions if they feel unsure of something concerning decisions and treatment.

        LINK TO LEARNING

Visit this website for a wealth of resources for mental health advocacy (https://openstax.org/r/77mtlhltresorcs)
presented by the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI).

Knowing oneself is a fundamental part of self-advocacy (Disability Resource Center, 2019). The support and
encouragement of nurses and family members can hasten the client's ability to know who they are and begin the
process of achieving self-advocacy. The ability to define their illnesses, strengths, and weaknesses is another
important part of knowing their needs. The client is the best resource for their needs and accommodations they may
require. As they evaluate previous experiences, they can identify what has worked and what has not. Knowing their
individual needs can be an asset when conferring with nurses and other mental health-care professionals. Through
identifying and putting into words the accommodations they may require, they are more likely to receive what they
truly need.

National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) advocate Tracie Noelle writes that mental health-care laws, government
regulations, existing research, and standards compose a complex system for users to navigate (2016). Noelle
endorses the following strategies for self-advocacy:

    · Participate in the wider community and speak up for mental health resources.
    · Strive for a balance between work and personal life.
    · Work with professional organizations and personal support systems.
    · Vote for political candidates who advocate for mental health needs and contact your representatives.

The Role of the Nurse in Promoting Self-Advocacy in Clients

Mental illness and other medical conditions share characteristics, such as chronicity, loss of control, and numerous
treatment methodologies. Client advocacy is part of every nurse's role. When nurses keep clients safe, find answers
to clients' questions, and bring clients' concerns to those able to address the concerns, this is client advocacy. When
nurses teach and role model these actions, this is the promotion of client self-advocacy. The role of the psychiatric-
mental health nurse in promoting self-advocacy in clients is critical because clients are socially and legally
vulnerable (Faleti, 2020).

     twenty-five-year-old female admitted voluntarily for treatment of severe depression and suicidal ideation. Janet
     has a history of trauma and has been struggling with feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness. Kimberly is
     responsible for providing therapeutic interventions and ensuring Janet's safety during her hospitalization.

     Kimberly uses the Clinical Judgment Measurement Model to advocate for Janet.

     educating, supporting, collaborating with, and ensuring the safety of her client, Kimberly promotes
     compassionate and client-centered care in a psychiatric-mental health nursing situation.

     Nurse as Educator
     Client teaching may occur in formal or informal settings and may include instructions for significant life changes or
     simple tips for immediate change. The nurse's first step is to determine what the client already knows about the
     subject, then what, and how they would like to learn.

When teaching self-advocacy, the nurse may suggest the client keep a list of their questions to ask the provider on

rounds or the social worker in a team treatment meeting. The nurse can pose questions to the client such as, "What

is most important to you about  ?" or "How do you think we could best help you with this?" Then, the

nurse develops strategies with the client to have their needs met, such as, practicing with the client how they will

present their questions or how they will access resources.

Nurse as Role Model
When nurses are observed by peers and coworkers encouraging clients to participate in their care, this has
influence. Other caregivers may witness how the nurse encourages and assists the client to advocate for self and
realize the positive impact this can have on outcomes of care.

During interactions with other professionals, the nurse may prompt the client, "Was there more you wanted to
discuss today?" or "Did you have another question about your medication?" This provides an invitation for the client
to speak for self and feel successful in having their own needs met.

12.4 Client Advocacy

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Define the concepts involved in advocating for clients with a mental health problem
    · Outline opportunities where nurses can advocate for clients
    · Suggest ways that nurses can overcome any barriers to client advocacy

The ANA Code of Ethics defines one of the roles of a nurse as client advocate. In general terms, advocacy is
supporting a cause or proposal; in nursing, advocacy for individual clients can include giving clients a voice; opening
access to information and education on their condition; protecting and informing clients of their rights; ensuring
accuracy, updates, and access to client records; and locating the resources the client needs. Some results of
advocacy in nursing are improvement in quality of care, increases in client empowerment, enhancements to client
safety, and improved access to health care (Hawai'i Pacific University, 2023).

Advocating for Clients

Client advocacy is an integral part of the nurse-client relationship, beginning with admission and gathering data
concerning the client, their health, their medications, and their living conditions. True advocacy requires trust
between the nurse and the client. Through the process of spending time listening to the client, the nurse and client
establish a trusting relationship, which enables the client to share information. This kind of information is
instrumental in nurses advocating for their clients, protecting clients' rights, and avoiding disparities in health care.

More broadly, some of the principles involved in client advocacy include protecting and advocating for the client's
safety, rights, and health; providing optimal care and promoting clients' health; upholding clients' rights across the
continuum of care; and incorporating social justice principles in health policies (ANA, 2015).

The American Psychiatric Nurses Association (APNA) notes that "As trusted healthcare professionals psychiatric-
mental health nurses are positioned to be a voice for persons living with mental illness and those who care for
them" (para 1). They provide a range of tools and links that can be used by psychiatric-mental health nurses to
advocate for clients in the wider sense, for example with government representatives, newspaper editors, health-
care organizations, and so forth (APNA, n.d.).

        REAL RN STORIES

Nurse: Jordan
Years in Practice: Nine
Clinical Setting: Mental health inpatient facility
Geographic Location: Arizona

In the critical unit in a psychiatric hospital, Jordan, a registered nurse, encountered a challenging situation with a
client named Harrison, a forty-year-old male admitted for treatment of severe bipolar disorder. Harrison had a
376  12 · Self-Determination and Advocacy

     history of recurrent manic episodes and had been involuntarily admitted due to concerns for his safety and the
     safety of others. Despite his psychiatric diagnosis, Harrison was highly articulate and expressed a strong desire for
     autonomy in his treatment.

     Upon admission, Harrison adamantly refused to take any psychotropic medications prescribed by the psychiatric
     team. He argued that the medications interfered with his creativity and autonomy, and he believed he could manage
     his symptoms through alternative therapies, such as meditation and exercise. Despite the medical team's concerns
     about the potential risks of untreated bipolar disorder, Harrison insisted on his right to refuse treatment.

     Jordan recognized the importance of upholding Harrison's right to self-determination while also ensuring his safety
     and well-being. She engaged in therapeutic communication with Harrison, taking the time to listen to his concerns,
     validate his feelings, and understand his perspective. Jordan acknowledged Harrison's autonomy and his right to
     participate in decisions about his treatment plan.

     Using her clinical judgment and advocacy skills, Jordan collaborated with the treatment team to explore alternative
     approaches to address Harrison's symptoms and promote his recovery. She advocated for the incorporation of
     nonpharmacological interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness techniques, and lifestyle
     modifications, into Harrison's treatment plan.

     Jordan also facilitated open communication between Harrison and the psychiatric team, ensuring that his treatment
     preferences and goals were respected and considered in the decision-making process. She encouraged Harrison to
     actively participate in therapy sessions, psychoeducation groups, and self-management strategies to empower him
     in managing his condition.

     Throughout Harrison's hospitalization, Jordan maintained a therapeutic relationship built on trust, empathy, and
     mutual respect. She monitored his mental status and safety closely, collaborating with the treatment team to
     develop contingency plans in case of symptom exacerbation or crisis situations. Jordan remained committed to
     supporting Harrison in his journey toward recovery while honoring his right to self-determination.

     Despite the complexities of managing Harrison's bipolar disorder without medication, Jordan's client-centered
     approach and advocacy efforts resulted in positive outcomes. Harrison gradually engaged in therapy and adopted
     self-care practices to manage his symptoms effectively. With Jordan's support and encouragement, Harrison
     developed a sense of empowerment and self-efficacy in managing his mental health, paving the way for a more
     collaborative and autonomous approach to his treatment.

     Opportunities for Nurses to Advocate for Clients

     Nurses encounter the opportunity to advocate for clients throughout their day. Some areas include double-checking
     for errors in medication dosages, being proactive in communicating with the client's health-care team to avoid
     errors in treatment, ensuring family members understand the client's diagnosis and treatment plan, protecting the
     client's privacy rights by asking permission prior to discussing care while others are present, and teaching clients
     how to advocate for themselves (Hawai'i Pacific University, 2023).

             LINK TO LEARNING

     According to this article about the role of the nurse in client advocacy (https://openstax.org/r/77advocacy) from
     Hawai'i Pacific University, nurses spend a great deal of time with their clients, and fulfilling their obligation under the
     nursing code of ethics to advocate for their clients can make a significant difference in client outcomes.

     In relation to how to conduct advocacy, Abbasinia et al. (2020) conducted a concept analysis of client advocacy and
     identified the following attributes: apprising, mediating, safeguarding, valuing, and championing social justice.

     Apprising Clients
     The definition of apprising is communicating something that is important to someone and updating when new
     information is available. With clients, this involves updating them concerning lab results, new orders, and
     responding to questions. Apprising is one way that a nurse advocates for an individual client. After all, an informed

client has more autonomy and is able to self-advocate more effectively, so this is one way of boosting client self-
determination.

Mediating for Clients
There are situations when the nurse may be asked to speak for a client, to settle a dispute, or create agreement,
which is called mediating. In such situations, a nurse is a liaison for the client with family members, other medical
professionals, or the criminal justice system. This can involve informing other health-care professionals concerning
the cultural values and preferences of the client. Dos and don'ts for mediation are listed in Table 12.3.

Safeguarding Clients
Through attention to details, asking questions, checking in regularly with clients, and reviewing treatment plans,
medications, and new orders, the nurse can protect, or safeguard, the client from mistakes, incompetence, or
emotional or physical abuse. Reviewing the medical record for accuracy and protecting the confidentiality of client
information are other essential actions. At the organizational level, nurses can participate in care conferences and
ethics committees. Safeguarding is another subtle form of client advocacy.

Valuing Clients
Another way nurses can advocate for clients is by showing them that they have value, or respect for the person
regardless of social factors, through meeting clients' physical, safety, belonging, self-esteem, and self-fulfillment
needs. By demonstrating true caring through each of these needs, nurses show clients that they have value.
Referrals to the appropriate outside resources also demonstrate that they have value (Sage et al., 2021).

Championing Social Justice in Health Care
Nurses also have a broader societal role to advocate for social justice in health care. Championing social justice in
health care includes facilitating clients' access to health resources, addressing inequalities in health-care delivery,
and identifying and confronting rules or policies in a health-care system that are inappropriate.

Nurses can champion social justice through the following strategies (Harris, 2023):

· creating a safe and inclusive space
· educating themselves and others
· providing resources and support
· taking breaks and prioritizing self-care
· seeking outside support

Barriers to Nursing Advocacy in Mental Health Care

Barriers to nursing advocacy exist in health-care settings and in mental health care. A major barrier is the overall
lack of cooperation from clients, health-care providers, and health-care organizations. Other barriers include health-
care organizations' bureaucracy, lack of support from doctors or limited supplies/medical equipment, inadequate
communication among staff, lack of support from legal teams of the health-care organization and from families of
clients, client lack of financial resources, fear of repercussions for advocating for clients, and limited knowledge
378  12 · Self-Determination and Advocacy

     about client advocacy. Advocacy issues are often specific to the health-care setting in question, so solutions call for
     individualized approaches.

             LIFE-STAGE CONTEXT

     Self-Determination and Client Advocacy

     In psychiatric-mental health nursing, client self-determination is a fundamental principle that applies regardless of
     age. Self-determination refers to the right of individuals to make decisions about their own treatment and care,
     based on their preferences, values, and goals, even in the context of mental illness. This principle is grounded in
     ethical principles such as autonomy and respect for persons. While self-determination is applicable to individuals of
     all ages, the capacity for decision-making may vary depending on developmental stage, cognitive abilities, and
     mental health status. Psychiatric-mental health nurses must assess each client's decision-making capacity on an
     individual basis, and advocate for them based on considering factors such as cognitive functioning, insight into
     illness, and ability to understand and appreciate treatment options.

     In pediatric psychiatric nursing, nurses may encounter challenges related to assessing the self-determination of
     children and adolescents with mental health disorders. While younger clients may have limited decision-making
     capacity due to their developmental stage, nurses still strive to involve them in treatment decisions to the extent
     possible, advocating for their needs considering their evolving capacity for autonomy and involvement in care
     planning.

     Cultural beliefs, values, and preferences may influence clients' attitudes toward self-determination and mental
     health treatment. Psychiatric-mental health nurses must consider cultural factors when engaging clients in
     discussions about treatment options and respecting their autonomy within cultural contexts.

     Client self-determination in psychiatric-mental health nursing transcends age and requires a holistic approach that
     considers individual needs, capacities, and cultural backgrounds and these are used as a basis for advocating for the
     needs of the client.

     Resources and Support
     The lack of support from doctors or legal teams of the health-care organization, lack of client financial resources,
     and limited supplies were found to have interfered with nurse advocacy.

     Possible solutions include the following:

         · creating and disseminating guidelines for bringing advocacy issues forward
         · developing policies protecting advocates from negative consequences
         · promoting an overall culture of advocacy with necessary reporting and oversight
         · involving nurse leaders and front-line nurses in resources planning

     Knowledge and Communication
     Limited knowledge about client advocacy; nurses' concerns surrounding clients' culture, religious beliefs, and
     literacy; and health-care organizations' bureaucracy hindered advocacy efforts. Inadequate communication among
     staff was also an obstacle. Possible solutions include the following:

         · Organizational leadership should make information available throughout the institution and work to streamline
             processes connected with advocacy.

         · Nurses should allow for cultural variation and let clients know they have choices, for example, asking, "How
             can we work within your values to provide your care?" or inviting the spiritual advisor to a care conference.

         · Organizational leadership should provide nurse training on the implementation of clients' rights, which may
             include refusal of care, so that advocacy can be appropriately applied.

         · Organizational leadership should include therapeutic communication and interpersonal skills training in all
             nursing educational offerings.

     Fear
     Nurses may be afraid of repercussions from advocating for clients. Nurses may not be assertive at heart, similar to

members of other service professions where giving is the intended action and the dissenting voice is not natural.
Hierarchal relationships may prevent communication flow.

Possible solutions include the following:

    · Nursing leaders should apply clinical supervision to promote client advocacy.
    · Nursing leaders should acknowledge awareness of barriers to nursing advocacy and open problem-solving

        among nursing staff.
    · Physicians' viewpoints should be requested on nursing advocacy.
    · Health-care organizations must embrace client advocacy as an inclusive effort to promote safety and quality in

        the care setting.
380 12 · Summary

Summary

12.1 Client Representation for Empowerment and Relationship Rebuilding

Nurses play a role in client advocacy, particularly in circumstances where clients are unable to adequately represent
themselves, or have the legal designation of diminished responsibility. Nurses should be aware of the civil rights of
those with mental illness diagnoses. Empowerment leads to self-reliance, participation in decisions, dignity and
respect for us and others, and the knowledge of belonging and contribution to a wider community.

12.2 Autonomy and Independence

Autonomy and independence are not the same. Autonomy is the ability to make decisions for self. Independence is
the ability for self-care. Mental health issues can impair clients from making appropriate decisions and taking care
of themselves. Restrictions on autonomy are justified by ethics, law, and welfare in situations where clients are
unable, because of impairments, to self-determine or act independently in their best interests. The nursing skill of
power sharing can enhance nurse-client relationships and is flexible if there are levels in the client's self-care ability.

12.3 Self-Advocacy

Self-advocacy evolves through empowering and assisting clients to speak for themselves to express needs,
concerns, and questions about their condition and their treatment. Self-advocacy is a skill to be acquired and nurses
have a significant role in this learning through direct instruction as well as through role modeling.

12.4 Client Advocacy

Client advocacy comes into play as nurses care for clients daily, despite barriers that do exist. Included in advocacy
is keeping clients informed of the plan of treatment, mediating for clients with others, being diligent to safeguard
clients through assessment for possible abuse, and ensuring clients know the value placed on them through the
care, compassion, and support. Nurses place importance on championing the role of social justice in ensuring all
clients receive the same level of care. Barriers to client advocacy include nursing fear, lack of organizational
cooperation and materials, bureaucracy, and limited client financial resources.

Max, a forty-five-year-old male, has presented himself at the community health clinic due to recent changes in his
mental health. Upon further exploration, it is revealed that Max's medical history is quite complex. Diagnosed with
bipolar disorder several years ago, he has been actively engaged in his treatment plan, which includes a
combination of mood stabilizers and regular therapy sessions. Over the years, Max has demonstrated resilience in
managing his mental health. However, the recent alterations in his emotional well-being have prompted his visit
today. He reports feeling overwhelmed and anxious, accompanied by persistent feelings of sadness, which he
describes as more intense than his usual mood swings associated with bipolar disorder. This shift in his emotional
state raises concerns about the efficacy of his current treatment plan and the need for a comprehensive
reassessment. Vital signs assessment reveals an elevated heart rate and increased blood pressure, indicating a
physiological response to his heightened emotional distress. Understanding the physiological impact of his mental
health challenges is integral in devising a holistic care plan that addresses both the psychological and physical
aspects of his well-being.

    1. In Max's case, where could client representation be essential, considering his recent changes in mental
        health? How might effective representation positively impact Max's overall care and treatment?

    2. Given Max's diagnosis of bipolar disorder, how might diminished responsibility manifest in his case? Discuss
        potential legal and ethical considerations for the mental health nurse when dealing with Max's diminished
        responsibility.

    3. Considering Max's recent emotional distress, discuss how the empowerment process could benefit him in
        regaining control of his life. How might empowerment contribute to Max's ability to navigate the complexities
        of his mental health?

Pilar, a fifty-eight-year-old female, visits a community health clinic, offering a glimpse into the intricacies of her
mental health challenges. Beyond the evident emotional symptoms of persistent sadness, social withdrawal, and
difficulty concentrating, Pilar unfolds a comprehensive health history that enriches the understanding of her current
situation. In the realm of psychiatric history, she reveals a long-standing journey with depression and anxiety,
punctuated by interactions with mental health professionals and intermittent use of antidepressant medications.
This context provides valuable insights into the recurrent nature of her symptoms and underscores the need for a
nuanced approach to her care. On the health front, Pilar manages hypertension with antihypertensive medications,
introducing a chronic condition that adds a crucial layer to her overall well-being. Furthermore, sporadic palpitations
and shortness of breath hint at a potential interplay between her mental health challenges and cardiovascular
symptoms, emphasizing the importance of a holistic care strategy. During the clinic visit, vital signs are recorded,
indicating an elevated blood pressure that underscores the ongoing challenge of hypertension management and a
heart rate within the normal range but reflective of increased sympathetic activity, possibly linked to the emotional
distress Pilar is experiencing.

CHAPTER OUTLINE
13.1 Clinical Guidelines and Standards
13.2 DSM-5 Criteria and Use
13.3 Nursing Assessment and Care Plans
13.4 Promoting Recovery in Psychiatric Nursing
13.5 Special Considerations for PMH Practice

INTRODUCTION The American Psychiatric Nurses Association (2023) describes the practice of psychiatric-mental
health (PMH) nursing as the provision of relationship-based care, holistic in scope, and oriented toward recovery and
wellness. This practice encompasses work with individuals, families, and communities and in collaboration with an
interprofessional team. PMH nurses incorporate cultural considerations, social determinants of health, and ethical/
legal guidelines into their practice.
In the United States, individual state boards of nursing set the regulatory practice standards for each state.
Additional guidelines and standards also exist at both federal and institutional levels for nurses to follow. Care
planning is performed in conjunction with an interdisciplinary care team--psychiatrists, psychiatric-mental health
nurse practitioners, clinical psychologists, licensed professional counselors, social workers, therapists, and other
disciplines--with guidance by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision
(DSM-5-TR) (2022) published by the American Psychiatric Association. The DSM-5-TR is the standard reference in
clinical practice for the diagnosis of mental health disorders. These diagnoses form the basis for understanding the
signs, symptoms, and recommended evidence-based approaches to treatment and care for the wide range of
390  13 · Clinical Guidelines and Practice

     disorders that clients with PMH disorders may present.

     13.1 Clinical Guidelines and Standards

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Outline the governing entities of nursing that have the authority to set nursing standards
         · Describe the role of state boards of nursing
         · Provide examples of how standards are set at the federal and local levels

     A range of governing entities oversees nurses, as health-care professionals, in order to ensure that they are
     complying with the required standards of practice; these standards may be federal, state, local, or institutional. The
     understanding of nursing standards and regulations begins during nursing education and is continued through the
     licensure process, and for the length of the nurse's career. To ensure that nurses maintain and uphold these
     standards, the regulations developed for nursing practice are set, and compliance is monitored, by professional
     bodies, federal and state governmental bodies, and the health-care organizations themselves.

     Standards of Nursing Practice

     The standards of nursing practice are developed to ensure best practices and expectations in nursing care. These
     standards can be utilized to compare the nurse's performance with the current standard of nursing care and are
     used to maintain safety and competent nursing practice. Specifically, standards of nursing practice help to guide the
     provision of care to clients by nurses, give organizations rules by which to evaluate nursing care, and allow for
     accountability for clinical decisions and actions. Several organizations develop professional standards of practice,
     such as the American Nurses Association (ANA) and the American Psychiatric Nurses Association (APNA).
     Standards of practice are established for the generalist nurse as well as specialty nursing areas, including
     psychiatric-mental health nursing.

             LINK TO LEARNING

     The American Nurses Association (ANA) describes the Standards of Practice (competence in use of the nursing
     process) and the Standards of Professional Performance (competence in role behavior) in the publication Nursing:
     Scope and Standards of Practice, Fourth Edition (2021). Read this sample chapter (https://openstax.org/r/
     77ANAStdPrac) to get a glimpse into the full document.

     The American Nurses Association
     The American Nurses Association (ANA) is a professional organization that advances and protects the nursing
     profession. The nurse will find many valuable tools on the ANA website that can be applied to their practice and
     improve the care of clients. Founded in 1896, the ANA intends to: "foster high standards of nursing practice;
     promoting a safe and ethical work environment; bolstering the health and wellness of nurses; and advocating on
     health care issues that affect nurses and the public" (ANA, n.d.-a, para 3). The ANA partners with the Standards for
     Excellence Institute to provide resources for best practice (ANA, 2015). Professional standards published by the
     ANA are meant to provide direction to nurses across the nation, influence legislation, and implement a framework to
     evaluate nursing excellence (ANA, 2015).

     The ANA standards include the Code of Ethics for Nurses, which guide nursing responsibilities and ethical
     obligations. The ANA Nursing Standards also include the scope and standards of practice describing the art and
     science of nursing, as well as Standards of Professional Performance. The nursing process is a critical thinking
     model, which includes six components as reflected in the first six standards (Figure 13.2):

               Standard 1. Assessment: The registered nurse collects pertinent data and information relative to the
                   health-care consumer's health or the situation.

               Standard 2. Diagnosis: The registered nurse analyzes the assessment data to determine actual or
                   potential diagnoses, problems, and issues.

               Standard 3. Outcomes Identification: The registered nurse identifies expected outcomes for a plan
                   individualized to the health-care consumer or the situation.

 Standard 4. Planning: The registered nurse develops a plan that prescribes strategies to attain expected,
    measurable outcomes.

 Standard 5. Implementation: The registered nurse implements the identified plan.
       Standard 5A. Coordination of Care: The registered nurse coordinates care delivery.
       Standard 5B. Health Teaching and Health Promotion: The registered nurse employs strategies to
          promote health and a safe environment.

 Standard 6. Evaluation: The registered nurse evaluates progress toward attainment of goals and
    outcomes.

The ANA Position Statements describe the stance of the ANA on various topics that may arise. These topics include
artificial intelligence in nursing practice, racism in nursing, risk and responsibility in providing nursing care, nursing
role and workforce issues, and technology in health care. The ANA Principles for Nursing Practice describe the more
day-to-day guidelines as "aimed at giving you practical information for your professional practice" (ANA, n.d.-b, para
10). Areas addressed include documentation processes, delegation, and staffing. They also address nursing pay and
offer solutions of changing insurance reimbursement to health-care organizations through a pay for quality process.

Councils for State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN)
The National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) is composed of the state nursing regulatory bodies (NRB)
whose mission is to protect the public by ensuring licensed nurses provide safe and competent care (NCSBN, 2023).
The NCSBN, which is the body that affiliates all of the NRB, guides the NRB on topics like risk analysis, monitoring of
nursing education programs for curriculum content, pass rates, and employment rates. The nursing regulatory
bodies are the state boards of nursing in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and four U.S. territories. The NRB's
role is to "monitor licensees' compliance to jurisdictional law and take action against the licenses of those nurses
who have exhibited unsafe nursing practice" (NCSBN, n.d., para 2). Each state board of nursing enforces the Nurse
Practice Act of each jurisdiction. Each act contains qualifications for licensure, including what titles may be used;
defines the nurses' scope of practice; and outlines the outcomes if the nurse does not follow the law. The guiding
principle of the NRB is to "develop policy, design regulation, administer and enforce regulatory law and rules to
accomplish their mandates of protecting the safety of the public" (NCSBN, 2022, para 2). Moreover, the NRB
develops regulations based upon the NCSBN Model Act (2021) whose purpose is to protect the health, safety, and
welfare of the public. The NCSBN Model Act defines the scope of practice for all levels of nursing, from licensed
practical/vocational nurses and registered nurses to advanced practice registered nurses, and each is different. The
NCSBN also defines the makeup of the membership of each individual board of nursing to include members from
each licensure field as well as a member from the public. One specific role of state boards of nursing is to assure the
public of nursing competency. Nurse licensure ultimately serves to protect the public, as defined by law. Therefore,
non-nurse members of the public serve on state boards (NCSBN, 2021).
392  13 · Clinical Guidelines and Practice

     The NCSBN also developed the Clinical Judgment Measurement Model (CJMM) to guide decision-making on the
     nurse licensure exam Table 13.1. The ANA Standards apply to clinical reasoning nurses must utilize in practice.
     Terminology may differ, as indicated in the following table, but the concepts are synonymous. Both the CJMM and
     the ANA Standards outline a cyclical process strategy to ensure a competent level of nursing care and to evaluate
     that process--whether by testing or in actual practice. The overall term nursing process is the nurse's thinking that
     drives nursing action.

     TABLE 13.1 Comparison of Terminology--ANA Standards, CJMM and Nursing Process

     The American Psychiatric Nurses Association
     The American Psychiatric Nurses Association (APNA) is a professional organization that provides leadership in
     issues related to all nurses working in the mental health field in all practice settings. The APNA publishes the
     Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing, Scope and Standards of Practice, Third Edition. These standards were developed
     in collaboration with the ANA and the International Society of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurses (ISPN). The
     standards are authoritative statements that describe the responsibilities for which its practitioners are held
     accountable (APNA-ISPN Scope and Standards Revision Joint Task Force, 2022) for psychiatric mental-health
     nurses. There are seventeen standards published and each standard has associated competencies. These standards
     outline the nursing process and coordination of care, health teaching and literacy, as well as pharmacological and
     biological, complementary/integrative therapies, and milieu therapy. They discuss the importance of therapeutic
     relationships, counseling and psychotherapy, and evaluation. The standards also cover professional performance,
     including ethics, cultural humility, communication, professional collaboration, leadership and education, evidence-
     based practice, and research as well as quality, professional practice evaluation, resource utilization, recovery-
     oriented care, and environmental health.

             PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

     American Psychiatric Nurses Association Standard Regarding Cultural Humility

     The APNA's Scope and Standards of Practice (2022) indicate that a Psychiatric-Mental Health Registered Nurse
     (PMH-RN) must practice from a perspective of cultural humility.

     Awareness, through self-reflection, is important so that nurses can open their thinking to consider inclusivity; one
     good place to start is through collaborating with colleagues of different cultures. Nurses can also accomplish this by
     reading professional publications, such as Minority Nurse, Journal of the National Black Nurses Association, and The
     Journal of Transcultural Nursing, or scholarly articles, such as "Health Inequities in LGBT People and Nursing
     Interventions to Reduce Them: A Systematic Review" by J. Medina-Martínez et al., published in the International

Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health (2021).

Exposure to this information may enable the nurse to recognize personal views that may have been obstacles to
cultural humility. Next, the nurse should seek opportunities to attend culturally diverse presentations and events. A
good starting place is the recorded presentations (https://openstax.org/r/77USDeptHlthHumn) available from the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

National League for Nursing (NLN)
The National League for Nursing (NLN) was the first nursing organization in the United States, started in 1893. The
NLN's mission and focus is on nursing education, specifically to promote "excellence in nursing to build a strong and
diverse nursing workforce to advance the health of our national and the global community" (NLN, n.d., para 1). The
NLN reports its core values as caring, integrity, diversity and inclusion, and excellence. Its commitment includes
enhancing the NLN both at a national and international level as a leader in nursing education. The NLN reports a
commitment to, and seeks to be the voice of, nurse educators in all specialties, including performing and publishing
research and evidence regarding nursing education and teaching. For nurse faculty, the NLN offers professional
development opportunities, access to data and grants, and certification as a Certified Nurse Educator (CNE).
Students benefit from the NLN's efforts to contain costs and facilitate access to nursing education, diversify the
nursing workforce, and ease transition to higher degree programs (NLN, 2011).

Quality and Safety Education for Nurses (QSEN)
The Quality and Safety Education for Nurses (QSEN) initiative addresses the knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSA)
required to improve the quality and safety of the health-care system. Its website provides information on the QSEN
(https://openstax.org/r/77QSENinfo) competencies, KSAs, teaching strategies, and faculty development to support
safety and quality in health care.

In 2000, the Institute of Medicine published reports calling for systems redesign in health care to address safety
and quality. In 2005, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation provided funding for nursing leaders to develop quality
and safety competencies for nursing. These competencies were included in nursing education curricula, and now
are incorporated into the ANA's Nursing Alliance (https://openstax.org/r/77competencyANA) for Quality Care.

QSEN utilizes the Institute of Medicine competencies, QSEN faculty, and a national advisory panel to define quality
and safety competencies for nursing both at the graduate and undergraduate levels. QSEN focuses on KSAs in the
areas of client-centered care, teamwork and collaboration, evidenced-based practice, quality improvement, safety,
and informatics.

QSEN competencies are integrated into nursing education programs to ensure that students are adequately
prepared to meet the challenges of providing safe, high-quality care in a rapidly evolving health-care landscape. The
QSEN initiative emphasizes the importance of interprofessional education and collaboration, recognizing that safe
and effective care requires a team-based approach. The aim of incorporating QSEN principles is to provide client-
centered care, work effectively in teams, utilize evidence-based practice, contribute to quality improvement efforts,
prioritize client safety, and leverage informatics to support decision making.

Boards of Nursing

The Boards of Nursing are the regulatory bodies that oversee the practice of nursing within a certain jurisdiction,
such as a state or territory. In the United States, each state, including the District of Columbia, American Samoa,
Guam, the Northern Mariana Island, and the Virgin Islands, has an individual board of nursing that, together, make
up the NCSBN. Puerto Rico is an associate member of the NCSBN and has its own Board of Nurse Examiners.

The function of state boards is to evaluate licensure applicants, issue licenses when appropriate, renew licensures,
ensure each participant is in good standing, and take disciplinary action when needed. State boards of nursing are
governed by the laws in each individual state's Nurse Practice Act. Each individual state board of nursing has the
394  13 · Clinical Guidelines and Practice

     ability to enforce the law; nurses must understand the law and how it can affect their practice.

     Licensing and Accreditation of Nursing Programs
     Registered nurses receive their education through either an accredited bachelor's degree program in nursing (BSN),
     which typically takes four years; an associate's degree program in nursing (ADN), which takes two to three years; or
     a diploma in nursing, typically for licensed vocational nurses, which is not as common. Nursing education programs
     are required to provide the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) set forth by the NLN. The American Association of
     Colleges of Nursing (AACN) establishes quality standards for nursing education. The AACN utilizes a national
     consensus-based process to develop "essential documents that outline competency expectations for graduates of
     baccalaureate, master's, and Doctor of Nursing Practice programs" (AACN, n.d., para 4). Utilizing these essential
     documents, the AACN ensures consistently high standards of nursing education programs. The AACN publishes The
     Essentials: Core Competencies for Professional Nursing Education, which outlines different domains and
     competencies that must be included and taught in nursing curricula. Nursing education programs must adhere to
     these standards and undergo an accreditation process to maintain their approval from the AACN. The AACN also has
     several arms to help improve the education of nurses, including health policy advocacy, research and data services,
     conferences and webinars for faculty development, leadership development, programs on diversity and inclusion,
     and special education projects such as end-of-life nursing care. The Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education
     (CCNE) is an accrediting arm of the AACN, developed to advocate for baccalaureate, and higher, nursing degree-
     granting programs in the United States. The CCNE promotes self-regulation and peer review by nursing programs
     and the accreditation is voluntary.

     Two other accrediting agencies oversee nursing programs: the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing
     (ACEN) and the National League of Nurses Commission for Nursing Education Accreditation (CNEA). Both entities
     help to establish standards of accreditation, peer evaluation of nursing programs, and resources to ensure quality
     education that meets the expectations and core competencies for future nurses.

     The Nurse Practice Act
     The Nurse Practice Act (NPA) is a set of state laws and regulations that govern the practice of nursing within a
     specific jurisdiction. Specific details of each NPA may vary between jurisdictions. The NPA governs licensure and
     certification, such as criteria for education requirements for licensure, as well as continuing education requirements.
     The NPA for each area defines the activities and responsibilities that fall within the scope of nursing practice,
     outlining what nurses are allowed and not allowed to do, or activities that may require collaboration with other
     health-care professionals. The NPA establishes the standards of care that nurses must adhere to and encompasses
     such items as client safety, confidentiality, documentation, and ethical considerations. The NPA also sets the
     grounds for disciplinary action against any nurse who violates the law or fails to meet professional standards. This
     may include misconduct, negligence, substance misuse, or other behaviors that jeopardize the safety of the client or
     violate the standards of practice.

             REAL RN STORIES

     Nurse: Brenda B., ADN, RN
     Years in Practice: Four
     Clinical Setting: Medical-surgical floor of a small, rural hospital
     Geographic Location: Tennessee

     Brenda is a nurse working in a small rural hospital on the medical-surgical floor. Brenda encountered a client with a
     large wound on their lower extremity that will require extensive surgery. Brenda used her phone to take a photo of
     the client's wound without the client's permission and posted the photo on her social media page. The client and
     their family were notified by other members of the community who were able to identify the client based on the
     social media photo. The family notified the hospital administration and obtained a lawyer to bring charges against
     both Brenda and the hospital due to a breach of confidentiality. Brenda was fired from her position at the hospital,
     the State Board of Nursing temporarily suspended her license, and she was required to face the State Board of
     Nursing hearing board. After six months and continuing education, the board reinstated her license. Brenda learned
     a valuable lesson regarding the importance of client confidentiality.

Standards Set by Institutions, Federal Regulations and Programs, and Accrediting Bodies

Nursing practice standards and legal regulations for nursing care are outlined by the Nurse Practice Act (NPA), which
in turn informs professional organizations, federal regulators, and state boards of nursing. These standards and
regulations include authoritative statements that describe scope of and competence in practice.

Standards Set by Employers and Agencies
Individual employers, agencies, and institutions also set standards and guidelines for nursing practice. These
guidelines may reflect state laws or they can be more restrictive than the state laws, but they cannot be more
lenient than the standards and laws set by state boards of nursing. Guidelines set by individual institutions to guide
nursing care are normally developed to help nurses practice within the scope of their licensure. These guidelines
may be posted as institutional policies, practices, protocols, or procedures to follow.

Federal Regulations
Nurses must also be aware of the federal influence on the practice of nursing. There are several federal agencies
and programs, along with their guiding laws and regulations, that intimately affect nursing care. For example, the
Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Healthy People 2030, and
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration play a role in most health-care institutions. They help to
establish criteria for reimbursement and quality measures for care of clients.

Department of Health and Human Services
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is a department of the United States government that is
responsible for the health of all residents of the United States. The HHS works with various federal, state, and local
agencies, as well as private organizations, that influence public health, health care, social services, and medical
research. The HHS administers various health-care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, which provide
health coverage to older adults, low-income individuals, and those with disabilities. HHS addresses public health
emergencies; helps to prevent and control the spread of diseases by research, policymaking, and making
information available for health-care providers; conducts research on diseases; and promotes healthy behaviors.

Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
It is important for nurses to understand federal insurance coverage, run by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (CMS), that may impact their clients. CMS is under the direction of the Department of Health and Human
Services. It is dedicated to advancing health equity, expanding coverage, and improving health outcomes. CMS
offers insurance coverage for three groups of individuals: people aged sixty-five or older, individuals under age sixty-
five with certain disabilities, and people of all ages with end-stage renal disease. Medicare part A covers care in
hospitals and skilled nursing facilities as well as hospice care and some home health care. Medicare part B helps to
cover doctor's office fees and community care, as well as some medical supplies; it requires a monthly fee.
Medicare part D is a prescription drug coverage service available for those who qualify for Medicare and want to
purchase a plan. CMS also offers insurance coverage to low-income adults, children, pregnant women, older adults,
and people with disabilities through the Medicaid program. This program is jointly funded by individual states and
the federal government.

Healthy People 2030
Nurses must have a vested interest in the problems affecting the health of the nation. The Healthy People 2030
initiative is a program in the United States that sets objectives and goals to improve the nation's health over a
specified period. The Healthy People 2030 initiative is sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. It sets health-care priorities based on leading health
indicators, as well as overall health and well-being measures. Priority areas for 2030 include the elimination of
health disparities and equality for people to live healthy lives. This includes health equity but also an increase in
health literacy and addressing the social determinants of health across the nation. Healthy People 2030 also
publishes evidence-based resources to help those working in health care identify sources to improve health. For the
mental health nurse, Healthy People 2030 provides links to pertinent information on mental health, such as
screening for anxiety in children and adults, and an evidence-based practices resource center.

     the person's environment affecting health and well-being.

     OSHA
     The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is a regulatory agency in the United States that
     operates under the Department of Labor. OSHA's main purpose is to ensure safe and healthy working conditions for
     employees in various industries. OSHA develops and enforces workplace safety and health regulations. These
     standards cover a wide range of industries, including hospitals and other medical facilities. OSHA addresses specific
     hazards and risks to protect workers' safety and well-being. An example for nursing includes the use of safety
     needles to avoid unnecessary needlesticks. OSHA may regulate hazardous materials in the workplace and have
     specific guidelines for using and disposing of such materials.

     OSHA conducts inspections of workplaces to ensure compliance with safety and health regulations. These may be
     routine inspections or may be in response to a reported incident. OSHA provides training programs and educational
     materials as well as resources to employers and workers to raise awareness about workplace hazards, prevention
     strategies, and workers' rights.

     The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations
     Many public service and health-related entities, such as hospitals, schools, and universities, have accreditation
     programs. The Joint Commission for Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), or the Joint
     Commission, an independent, nonprofit organization, accredits and certifies health-care organizations and programs
     in the United States. It focuses on quality improvement and client safety. The Joint Commission surveys hospitals
     for compliance with its set of standards in health care. These standards may change each survey year and are
     related to areas, such as safety. Surveys may include such items as policy and procedure review, protocols in place
     for medical diagnoses, such as myocardial infarctions or deep vein thrombosis, and equipment examination.

     National Patient Safety Goals
     The National Patient Safety Goals (NPSGs) are one set of standards the Joint Commission establishes for ensuring
     safety for client care. The NPSGs, revised regularly, focus on promoting surgical safety and prevention of infections,
     preventing medication errors, and addressing suicide risk and specific clinical harm. Client safety and prevention of
     adverse events in the health-care setting are a priority for nursing. The NPSGs are designed to promote client safety
     and prevent adverse events in health-care settings. These goals serve as a framework for health-care organizations
     to improve the quality and safety of client care.

     The Joint Commission established the NPSGs in an effort to promote client health and safety in inpatient and
     outpatient settings. Some common goals for NPSGs include identifying clients correctly through the use of two
     identifiers, such as name and date of birth. NPSGs focus on improved communication between health-care
     providers, including the use of effective handoff communication during transitions of care. Medication safety is a top
     priority for NPSGs and includes ensuring the safe use of high-alert medications. Evidence-based practice is also a
     priority and includes such items as handwashing, proper use of personal protective equipment to prevent infections,
     and adherence to infection prevention guidelines. Other areas of focus include prevention of falls, by assessing risks
     for each client and implementing interventions; prevention of surgical errors, by implementing safety measures; and
     improving clinical alarm safety, by addressing things like alarm fatigue.

13.2 DSM-5 Criteria and Use

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Explain the history of development of the DSM-5-TR
    · Summarize how the DSM-5 is used in the diagnosis of mental disorders
    · Outline the disadvantages of using the DSM-5 system of categorization of mental disorders

The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) provides a taxonomy, or
system of classification, and diagnoses of mental disorders. According to the American Psychiatric Association (APA,
2022), the DSM-5 encompasses the "best available description of how mental disorders are expressed and can be
recognized by trained clinicians" (xxiii). Therefore, it is the frame of reference used in health care to describe the
various forms of mental disorders. The evidence-based approaches to treatment are formulated around the
classifications of and diagnostic criteria for the conditions.

History of the Development of the DSM

The Diagnostical and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) was originally published in 1952 by the American
Psychiatric Association to provide the standard criteria for the diagnosis and classification of mental disorders. The
DSM has undergone several revisions and updates since its initial publication (Figure 13.3).

FIGURE 13.3 The DSM-5 was first published in 1952 and has been revised and updated numerous times in the last seventy years.

Structure and Organization of DSM-5-TR
The DSM-5-TR (Text Revision) was designed as a reference guide to clinical practice and is utilized as a common
language for clinicians and researchers from many different backgrounds. The DSM-5-TR is also considered a tool
for collecting and communicating accurate public health statistics on mental disorder frequency, morbidity, and
mortality rates (APA, 2022). It is a tool for concise and explicit criteria for mental health disorders and is intended to
facilitate objective assessment of symptom presentations.
398  13 · Clinical Guidelines and Practice

     The manual begins with an introduction that provides an overview of the purpose, goals, and intent of the
     DSM-5-TR, including its development process and updates from previous editions. The diagnostic criteria section
     outlines specific diagnostic criteria for various mental disorders. Each disorder is described in detail and is organized
     into chapters with related disorders. The DSM-5-TR includes an addition that describes various assessment
     measures and models that can be used in conjunction with diagnostic criteria. The DSM-5-TR recognizes the
     importance of cultural factors in understanding and diagnosing mental disorders. The appendices section includes
     information and resources, including a glossary of terms, codes for billing and reporting, a list of cultural concepts of
     distress, an alternative DSM-5 model for personality disorders, and conditions for further study.

             PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

     The Types of Mental Disorders Covered in DSM-5

     The DSM-5-TR covers a broad range of mental disorders from different categories. Here are the major types of
     mental disorders covered in the DSM-5-TR:

       1. Neurodevelopmental disorders: These disorders usually begin in early childhood and include such conditions
             as intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and specific
             learning disorders.

       2. Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders: These disorders include disorders characterized by
             psychosis, such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and delusional disorder.

       3. Bipolar and related disorders: These disorders include mood disorders, such as manic and depressive
             episodes. Bipolar I, bipolar II, and cyclothymic disorders fall under this category.

       4. Depressive disorders: These disorders include various forms of depression, such as major depressive disorder,
             persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), and premenstrual dysphoric disorder.

       5. Anxiety disorders: These disorders involve excessive and persistent worry or fear, including generalized
             anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobias.

       6. Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders: These disorders include disorders characterized by intrusive
             thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions).

       7. Trauma and stress-related disorders: These disorders are related to exposure to a traumatic or stressful
             event.

       8. Dissociative disorder: These disorders involve disruptions in consciousness, memory, identity, or perception,
             such as dissociative identity disorder and dissociative amnesia.

       9. Somatic symptom and related disorders: These are disorders in which physical symptoms are the primary
             focus, often without a clear medical explanation.

     10. Personality disorders: These disorders include patterns of behavior and inner experience that significantly
             deviate from cultural expectations, such as borderline personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder.

     Relationship of the DSM-5 to the International Classification of Diseases
     The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is a standardized system used globally for classifying and coding
     diseases, disorders, injuries, and other health-related conditions. It is maintained by the World Health Organization
     (WHO) and provides a common language for health professionals, researchers, and policymakers to communicate
     and exchange health information. The ICD is currently in its tenth revision, known as ICD-10, published by the WHO
     in 1992. The DSM-5-TR criteria define disorders identified by the ICD diagnostic names and code numbers. In
     DSM-5-TR, both ICD-10-CM (Clinical Modification) and ICD-10-PCS (Procedure Coding System) codes are attached
     to the relevant disorders in the classification. The codes allow for medical insurance billing and reimbursement, as
     well as collection of health-care statistics. The DSM-5-TR structure corresponds with the organizational
     arrangement of disorders planned for the upcoming ICD-11 scheduled for release in the United States in the future.

Clinical Usage of the DSM-5-TR

In clinical practice, the DSM-5-TR provides a standardized framework for the classification and diagnosis of mental
disorders. The DSM provides a comprehensive list of diagnostic criteria for various mental disorders, defines mental
health conditions, and gives examples of identifying signs and symptoms. Mental health conditions are also
categorized into groups. Clinicians use these criteria to assess and diagnose individuals presenting with mental
health symptoms.

Nurses can use the DSM to help assess clients and build their care plan based on the criteria, presentations, and
risks outlined in the DSM. The DSM also helps those doing research to have a common language and communication
for collaboration.

        CLINICAL SAFETY AND PROCEDURES (QSEN)

Teamwork: The Use of DSM-5 in Promoting Teamwork in the Care of Clients with a
Psychiatric Disorder

The QSEN definition of teamwork and collaboration is to "function effectively within nursing and inter-professional
teams, fostering open communication, mutual respect, and shared decision-making to achieve quality" (QSEN, n.d.,
table 2). During treatment team meetings, health-care professionals (psychiatrists, nurses, psychiatric nurse
practitioners, clinical psychologists, social workers, and licensed professional counselors) may use the DSM-5 as a
resource to collaborate with clients for the plan of care. The DSM information is shared to communicate the criteria
for the medical diagnosis as well as risk factors for the disorder that relate to the client's current clinical status and
needs for care. It allows for interprofessional collaboration among all team members.

Conceptualizing Client Problems
The DSM aids nurses and health-care providers to conceptualize client issues. When conceptualizing the client
problem, it is important to start by gathering important information about the client and their current presenting
problem. For those with mental health disorders, this may take the form of a mental status exam, along with
collecting any other relevant data. The nurse must identify any observable signs or symptoms indicating a problem
and then define the problem statement with priority problem identification. The PMH nurse utilizes the DSM-5-TR
medical diagnosis for reference to the pathology and helps to identify the client's response to the health problem.
The DSM-5-TR is helpful in providing a framework for helping individuals with specific diagnoses in ways that are
evidence-based and culturally considerate.

        LIFE-STAGE CONTEXT

Diagnoses and Older Adults

Many older adults suffer from mental health disorders, but can have very different symptoms and need specific
individualized interventions due to the changes with the aging process. Noted in the DSM-5-TR are several disorders
that apply specifically to this age group. This includes major neurocognitive disorder when cognitive decline is
noted. Many mental health disorders can be exacerbated by the experience of loss by the older adult. This can
include death of a spouse or significant other, loss of mobility, and loss of inability to operate a motor vehicle, further
isolating and leading to worsening mental health disorders. Depressive disorders may present differently than in
younger individuals and may include sadness, loss of interest, changes in appetite or sleep, fatigue, and thoughts of
death or suicide. Symptoms may present as irritability in young persons, rather than sadness. Anxiety disorders are
also experienced by older adults. Substance-related disorders may occur in the older adult and may include alcohol,
400  13 · Clinical Guidelines and Practice

     prescription medications, or illicit drugs, which may have serious implications for their physical and mental health.

     Formulating Treatment Plans
     The DSM helps nurses and care providers to assess and create treatment plans for mental health clients.
     Formulating a treatment plan begins with assessment of clinical findings. A physical and mental health exam,
     including a mental status exam, will help to guide the diagnosis. An evaluation of any test results may reveal a
     physical reason for their symptoms, such as thyroid abnormalities. It is important to rule out a physical and medical
     cause first. After assessment and diagnosis, the team creates a treatment plan. The treatment plan may include
     medications to treat symptoms as well as psychotherapy and other complementary therapies, such as deep
     breathing, mindfulness, and exercise.

       CLINICAL JUDGMENT MEASUREMENT MODEL

       Nursing Priority Problem Identification: How Does It Relate to Medical Diagnosis?

       Clinical judgment is a critical component of nursing practice, including the process of priority problem
       identification. Clinical judgment refers to application of the nursing process to an individual, family, or
       community's response to actual or potential health problems or life processes. The nurse then prioritizes the
       identified problems and formulates nursing interventions. Once carried out, the nurse will evaluate the outcome
       of the interventions and make any revisions identified. Medical diagnosis focuses strictly on the classification of
       a specific disease or condition, based on signs and symptoms as well as diagnostic tests. Nursing problem
       identification differs in that it is a clinical judgment made by a registered nurse in response to a health problem
       and in partnership with the client. Nursing problem identification focuses on the client's physical, psychological,
       sociocultural, and spiritual responses to an illness or disease and then determines the priority order of the
       problems.

     Billing for Treatment
     The DSM makes billing for treatment more efficient and, in many cases, possible. Billing for treatment of mental
     health disorders is completed by health-care providers, such as licensed social workers, physicians, and advanced
     practice nurses utilizing the DSM-5-TR as well as the ICD-10 diagnostic codes. Billing involves assigning a procedure
     code to the services provided to the client. This code is known as the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) and is
     a standardized system of medical codes used to describe specific procedures or services. They are maintained and
     published by the American Medical Association.

     Criticisms of the DSM-5

     The DSM-5 has received both praise and criticism. A strength is that it is a widely used diagnostic tool in the field of
     mental health that identifies disorders, criteria, and risks. Criticisms include lack of scientific validity and subjectivity
     of symptoms and dependence on the practitioner's clinical judgment. Critics have stated that the expansion of
     diagnostic criteria has led to overdiagnosis and labeling those with mild or temporary symptoms with a mental
     disorder that may stay with them for life. Other critics note that the DSM-5 relies on categories and mental disorders
     as distinct entities with clear boundaries, though many may exist on a continuum instead of within such boundaries.
     Some critics identify the undue influence of the pharmaceutical industry, and argue that expansion of criteria may
     lead to overmedication. Critics also point out a lack of cultural sensitivity in the DSM-5; the DSM-5-TR has
     attempted to address the experiences and expressions of mental distress in diverse cultural contexts.

The nursing process is a systematic framework used by nurses to deliver client-centered care. It consists of six
essential steps: recognize cues from assessment data, analyze cues to identify problems, hypothesize priority
problems, generate solutions, take action, and evaluate client care outcomes. This is commonly described as
ADPIE: Assessment, Diagnosis, Planning, Intervention, and Evaluation.

The Nursing Process in Mental Health

The nurse collects comprehensive data about the client's mental health status. This involves conducting interviews,
observing, and utilizing assessment tools to gather information about the client's mental health history, current
symptoms, cognitive abilities, emotional state, and social functioning.

A nursing care plan in mental health begins the same as all care plans, with the assessment process. The nurse
gathers comprehensive information, and in mental health, the mental status exam, to evaluate the client's needs.
Problem identification is based on the assessment findings, prioritizing which needs or problems require immediate
attention.

Assessment and Data Collection
The nurse utilizes the skills of observation and a structured interview to obtain information regarding the client's
mental health status. There are several tools available, based on the client's symptoms, the nurse may employ.
Examples include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), which evaluates symptoms of depression. The General
Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) looks at symptoms of anxiety. There are many tools to choose from based on the
judgment of the nurse and the needs of the client.

Mental Status Exam
The mental status exam (MSE) is an assessment tool used by mental health professionals to analyze an individual's
cognitive, emotional, and behavioral functioning. It provides an overview of a person's mental state at a specific
point in time and helps clinicians form a treatment plan. The MSE evaluates appearance and behavior, mood (as
stated by the client) as well as affect, or emotional expressions observed by the nurse. The MSE also looks at
speech and language, including rate and volume, and observes any abnormalities, such as pressured or rapid
speech. It also includes observation of thought process, including logic and how thoughts are organized through the
client's expression. The examiner assesses thought content for delusions, hallucinations, or suicidal/homicidal
thoughts. Orientation and cognition assessment determines cognitive functions, such as attention or memory.
Insight and judgment assessment determines a client's ability to understand their own condition and make
appropriate decisions.

Risk Assessments
Nurses must assess the level of risk clients have for self-harm or harm to others due to their mental health
condition. This is an essential part of mental health care, especially when dealing with individuals who may be at
risk of self-harm, suicide, or violent behavior. Nurses can utilize the nursing process to gather information, including
the client's mental health history, current symptoms, any social support, and any previous incidents of self-harm or
violence, as well as any protective factors in their life such as family support. Nurses can perform an evaluation of
the individual's current thoughts, feelings, and intentions utilizing validated assessment tools, such as the
Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) (Posner et al., 2010). In order to determine if the client has access
to lethal weapons or means to end their life, the nurse may want to ask specific and important assessment
questions such as: Are there guns in the home? Are there any medications that may be life-threatening if taken in
excess? Utilizing a collaborative approach, involve the individual in the risk assessment process, fostering open
communication, and ensure their participation in safety planning. Include other health-care providers, family
members, and caregivers in the plan to promote safety.

402  13 · Clinical Guidelines and Practice

     Cultural Considerations
     It is important for nurses to approach each client with an open mind, respect, and sensitivity to cultural differences.
     Culture plays a significant role in shaping a person's beliefs, values, attitudes, and behaviors, including their
     understanding and experience of mental health. Cultural competence involves acquiring knowledge about different
     cultures, understanding their beliefs and practices, and being sensitive to the impact of culture on mental health.
     Moreover, language barriers can hinder effective communication and accurate assessment of the client. Nurses
     must be aware of cultural communication styles and nonverbal cues. Different cultures have varying beliefs and
     explanations for mental health issues and the nurse must acknowledge these beliefs, including the stigma that
     many cultures hold regarding mental illness.

     The DSM-5-TR and Nursing Care Planning
     While the DSM provides classification of mental health disorders, client-care problems are identified based on the
     assessment findings noted by the nurse. The nurse identifies actual or potential problems related to the client's
     mental health condition and helps the client to identify their priority problems as well. Problem identification in
     mental health nursing may include such stressors or situations as impaired social interaction for those with social
     anxiety, or risk for self-harm/suicide for those expressing suicidal thoughts. The nurse collaborates with the client,
     their family, and other health professionals to establish accurate problem identification and prioritization.

             PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

     Mental Health Assessment

     Thomas et al. (2020) found that consideration of psychosocial factors in client assessment and planning of care
     contributed positively to health outcomes, especially involving lifestyle changes.

     High-risk health behaviors, such as smoking, high alcohol consumption, inactivity, and poor diet, were shown to
     exist in multiple in certain individuals in the study. While economic factors were recognized, also identified were
     psychosocial factors such as depression, hostility, and ineffective coping. Of note is that healthy psychosocial
     factors (such as positive outlook, hope, and trust) could be protective and contribute to the ability to change risky
     lifestyles.

     Nurses should sharpen their focus on client empowerment for those who live with the burden of chronic disease,
     with less emphasis on clients' personal responsibility for behavior change and more direction toward building
     coping ability.

     (Thomas et al., 2020)

     Nursing Problem Identification in Mental Health Care

     The steps in the Clinical Judgment Measurement Model allow the nurse to assess subjective and objective data and
     synthesize the data to determine which of the problems or symptoms could be contributing to the client's
     presentation or expressed need. The PMH nurse collects this data through observation, interviewing the client and
     or support persons, and obtaining information from medical records, tests, and other outside sources.

     Once the PMH nurse has analyzed the information or assessment data, and connected it to the client's presenting
     problem, the nurse then prioritizes which of the problems to address first, hypothesizing which of the problems
     would be contributing most to the presenting problem. Then, the PMH nurse determines what steps, actions, or
     interventions would improve or prevent the priority problems, and identifies solutions that focus on improving the
     outcome for the client. Finally, the PMH nurse must evaluate, reassess, and link the information to the presenting
     problem and the client's presentation to determine if the plan of care was effective. These steps allow the nurse to
     identify the client's needs and develop appropriate interventions.

     Some common client problems that may present in a psychiatric-mental health nursing assessment process are
     ineffective coping, impaired social interaction, or disturbed thought process. Here are three examples:

          Generate solutions/formulate what to do: Nursing management of medications, present reality, provide
              safety.

Identification of Priority Problems in Mental Health
Nurses must prioritize the issues identified by their evaluation of the client. Safety is a priority for all clients and
especially those with mental health disorders at risk for self-harm or harm to others. The nurse is responsible for
not only prioritizing, but also individualizing a client's plan of care. The nurse uses all steps in the nursing process
and collaborates with the client to individualize their care.

Generating Solutions and Defining Interventions
In collaboration with the client and considering their individual needs and preferences, the nurse should establish
goals and expected outcomes. Outcomes are derived from potential solutions, which are based on hypotheses and
interventions. This is a crucial step in the nursing process, involving communication and collaboration among
medical providers, nurses, social workers, counselors, and therapists in order to provide safe and effective care for
the client.

The American Psychiatric Nurses Association (APNA) Scope and Standards of Practice (2022) reports that outcomes
are based on the client's goals and are individualized per each client's circumstances. Outcomes should consider
age and culture, risks and benefits, as well as costs to the client. The outcomes should provide direction for care and
these outcomes should be in language developed by or understandable to the client. The APNA identifies the
importance of incorporating clinical guidelines linked to positive clinical outcomes.

The APNA encourages development of a client-centered plan that prescribes strategies and alternatives to attain
expected outcomes. Specific to the psychiatric-mental health registered nurse (PMH RN), the APNA identifies
assessment and diagnostic strategies and therapeutic interventions that reflect current evidence. These plans aim
to minimize complications, promote individualized recovery, and optimize the client's quality of life through various
treatment modalities, including psychodynamic, cognitive behavioral therapy, supportive interpersonal therapies,
and psychopharmacology. The APNA stresses the importance of client education on self-regulation skills to promote
resilience as well.

Taking Action in Mental Health Care

Competencies for the PMH RN in the implementation of the nursing process include partnering with the client,
family, support system, and other health-care providers to provide safe, realistic care (APNA, 2022). This includes
utilizing evidence-based care, the principles of recovery and trauma-sensitive care, and cultural humility.
Incorporating community resources may further enhance the care needed by the client as might supervision of
404  13 · Clinical Guidelines and Practice

     ancillary staff in the implementation of the plan of care.

     Nursing Interventions
     Nursing interventions may include strategies to prevent illness, injury, or disease; provide immediate safety and
     stabilization; or promote recovery. The nurse will prioritize the interventions based on safety needs of each client
     and the level of risk for harm to themselves or others. Defining nursing interventions includes recognition of actions
     to be avoided, such as making personal judgments about clients' preferences or confronting a client about a lifestyle
     change before the client is stable. Additional data collection is another form of intervention, as are requests for
     consults and making referrals.

     Complex and Challenging Situations
     The PMH RN may encounter many challenges in the mental health-care arena. This may include the status of the
     client. Particularly difficult challenges may include delirium or delusions that make it difficult to maintain
     orientation. For the client who may be suicidal, safety is of primary importance. This may mean closely monitoring
     the client in the safest yet least restrictive environment possible. For the client who is angry and aggressive, the
     importance lies in not only client safety, but also in safety of the health-care team.

     Documenting Interventions
     The PMH RN must document client progress toward the goals previously developed and any changes made in the
     plan of care. Documentation is an important step in the nursing process and allows the PMH RN to share information
     with the health-care team. Documentation should be objective, free of interpretation and judgment, and assist in the
     communication of the client's assessment and plan of care to the members of the interdisciplinary team.
     Documentation should include the progress the client is making toward their goals.

     Evaluation of Expected Outcomes in Mental Health Care

     An evaluation of the outcomes and goals previously agreed upon and response to interventions should be ongoing.
     Observed outcomes should be compared with expected outcomes to determine the client's status as result of the
     interventions. The APNA (2022) identifies the importance of evaluating intervention outcomes to include optimizing
     wellness and quality of life as well as minimizing unwarranted or unwanted treatment. Further, the nurse should
     consider what alternative interventions may have been effective. Continual reassessment and evaluation of the plan
     of care helps to determine if the nurse should continue or change the plan of care.

     13.4 Promoting Recovery in Psychiatric Nursing

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define the recovery model in psychiatric nursing
         · Outline the history of recovery in psychiatric nursing
         · Explain the role of the psychiatric nurse in promoting recovery

     Recovery is the emergence from a stressful state, incorporating self-care ability, and attempting to reach one's full
     potential. As a model of care, recovery has been applied to mental health and addictions treatment, wherein the
     client defines wellness, and a supportive team fosters resilience. Recovery encompasses social change and utilizes
     person-centered mental health care.

     Defining Recovery and the Recovery Model in Psychiatric Nursing

     The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) defines recovery from mental illness
     and substance use disorders as change that improves health and wellness, empowers a self-directed life, and
     enhances full potential of the individual. Health is defined by SAMHSA as "overcoming or managing one's disease(s)
     or symptoms" and "for everyone in recovery, making informed, healthy choices that support physical and emotional
     wellbeing" (SAMHSA, 2012, para 4) Nurses should take note that the SAMHSA definition does not limit the meaning
     of health to cure, but extends it to the ability to function and make choices in life.

     The Recovery Model--Mental Health
     In mental health care, a recovery focus views the person beyond the limitations of the disease process. Elimination
     of the disease is not the specific goal--rather, the goal might be the person's potential for resilience, even if

symptoms continue. Incorporating hope and optimism and the willingness to take responsibility for self, the
recovery model emphasizes ability and personal control of one's health and well-being, functioning at higher levels,
and achieving a meaningful life even without complete cure.

The Recovery Model--Addictions
In addictions treatment, various methods support recovery. The recovering person assumes ownership in the
process. Some will achieve sobriety, stability, or freedom from dependency through abstinence, while others may
utilize behavioral change or harm reduction strategies. Peer counselors and twelve-step sponsors, along with
professional therapists, collaborate with the recovering person. Communities, such as Alcoholics Anonymous or
Recovering Couples Anonymous, provide mutual support and fellowship within the social network.

Historical Overview of Recovery in Psychiatric Nursing

The recovery model was officially defined by experts working in mental health and substance use. These experts set
out to define a working definition of recovery and to clarify the concepts of recovery.

Some believe that the recovery model started in the 1960s with the deinstitutionalization of psychiatric clients from
state institutions. There was a belief that those living with mental illness would improve in a community setting as
compared with an institution. In 1993, Dr. William Anthony published a paper discussing recovery from mental
illness and described recovery as a "process of changing one's attitudes, values, feelings, goals, and skills in order to
live a satisfying life within the limitations caused by an illness" (p. 11). In February 2001, President George W. Bush
announced his New Freedom Initiative, which ensured that people with disabilities had access to educational and
employment opportunities (President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, 2001). The commission
recommended transforming mental health to focus on recovery-oriented approaches utilizing evidence-based
practices. The commission focused on reducing the stigma against mental health.

Since that time, organizations including SAMHSA and the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) have endorsed
the recovery model as an effective strategy to help clients become partners in their care. SAMHSA reports the
foundation of recovery as being built on persons' strengths, talents, coping abilities, resources, and inherent values.
They also report recovery should be holistic, address the whole person as well as their community, and be
supported by peers, friends, and family members.

Asylums and Mental Illness
According to the National Institute of Health, early Americans cared for mentally ill family members at home, but in
severe cases they would be detained in "almshouses or jails." As the population grew, community institutions arose
to house those who were mentally ill. In 1752, the Quakers in Pennsylvania opened Pennsylvania Hospital, which
had rooms in the basement to house mentally ill clients. In the nineteenth century, new ideas for treatment of the
mentally ill brought the advent of the asylum, which is an institution offering shelter. The focus of treatment was on
recovery and cure. The asylums were meant to provide a quiet, peaceful environment for promotion of health and
recovery. The Friends Asylum, built in 1814, was the first asylum built to promote a program of moral treatment and
was meant for those who could afford to pay for the care provided. In the 1930s, the economic crisis in America cut
funding for any state appropriations to the asylums.

Peer Support and Health-Care Consumers
The concept of peer support, ironically the sharing of experiences and personal stories among survivors of harsh
treatments for psychiatric disorders, likely began in France in the eighteenth century. Public awareness emerged
over the next 200 years as more individuals and families made their experiences known. This awareness promoted
the concept of an individual or family as a consumer of health care, meaning those who purchase a service, and
peer support as beneficial in mental health care (Colorado Mental Wellness Network, 2023).

        LINK TO LEARNING

The National Alliance on Mental Illness has created a free, eight-session educational program called NAMI Peer-to-
Peer (https://openstax.org/r/77NAMEPeer2Peer) intended to help adults with a mental health diagnosis to help
themselves in their recovery.
406  13 · Clinical Guidelines and Practice

     The Civil Rights Movement and Deinstitutionalization
     The civil rights movement of the 1960s focused on human rights and equality among social groups. At the time,
     much mental health care entailed simple confinement and using harsh measures to manage extreme behaviors.
     Political and social pressure came from the public wanting change, along with financial demands to reduce the cost
     of incarceration-type mental health care.

     Dr. Richard Lamb published in 1998 on the subject of deinstitutionalization, which was the policy, process, and
     movement that released thousands of mentally ill persons from state institutions back into the communities. Lamb
     and Bachrach (2001) discussed the lack of support within individual communities, which resulted in many persons
     released from psychiatric institutions being simply displaced. Many years later, lessons revealed the need for
     services planning and continuity of care, as these were lacking in the beginning (Lamb & Bachrach, 2001).

     Consumer Movement and Current Trends
     Consumer rights were formalized in 1962. The term consumer was developed to create a positive term for people
     who were utilizing mental health care and resources. Consumer activists began to collaborate with mental health-
     care policymakers about improving mental health treatment. As the philosophies of consumer rights and the shared
     stories of peer supporters came together, a recovery orientation in mental health care emerged (Moran, 2018).

     The Role of the Psychiatric Nurse in Promoting Recovery

     Because recovery in mental health care includes the person's self-care ability, nurses are essential as coaches,
     educators, and advocates. Nurses must distinguish between simple remedy to empowerment of the person, which
     becomes power sharing within the domain of recovery. The client's definition of success is the guiding principle.

     APNA Recovery Components
     The American Psychiatric Nurses Association Recovery Council envisions PMH nursing practice as incorporating a
     recovery orientation. The therapeutic relationship as basis of care places the PMH nurse in position to foster
     wellness through the shared belief in recovery as a possibility. The use of person-first language, which means
     speaking of the person without focus on the diagnosis, is one of the components. Role modeling this way of
     expression can be a powerful motivator for others. Some phrases in our language can reinforce harmful stereotypes.
     Try substituting these words to promote a recovery orientation. For example:

             Instead of: "Robin is crazy."
                     Say: "Robin lives with a mental health challenge."

             Instead of: "He's schizophrenic."
                     Say: "He's living with schizophrenia."

             Instead of: "She's manic-depressive."
                     Say: "She lives with bipolar disorder."

             Instead of: "Their father committed suicide."
                     Say: "Their father died by suicide/was lost to suicide."

             Instead of: "Denny's an old junkie."
                     Say: "Denny has been in recovery for ten years."

             Instead of: "Mari is an ex-addict."
                     Say: "Mari is in recovery."

     Practicing with a recovery orientation means the nurse speaks and acts with a focus on the client's strengths and
     abilities and the possibility of self-care. Reflection is essential for the nurse, as is peer feedback, in order to increase
     personal awareness.

     Nurses may inadvertently discourage those in their care by emphasizing limitations. Nurses should strive to
     strengthen their own communication skills by asking clients what may be helpful to learn before developing a
     teaching plan, or acknowledging the client's frustration before offering a solution. As in all therapeutic
     communication, the nurse's nonverbal expressions must be congruent with the verbal message. For instance, if the
     nurse is physically preparing to leave the interaction and chooses that moment to ask the client if they have any
     more questions, the message is unclear.

Biden issued a proclamation (https://openstax.org/r/77proclamation) endorsing the recognition of National
Recovery Month in September 2023. This reinforces the government's dedication to prevention, support, and
recovery for those living with mental health or substance use challenges. The document further calls for health
insurance coverage parity for these conditions.

13.5 Special Considerations for PMH Practice

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Discuss special considerations within the nursing scope of practice in mental health nursing
    · Discuss the challenges that nurses face in adhering to the scope of practice

As a specialty practice area, psychiatric-mental health nursing requires a skill set specific to client needs. The
American Nurses Association sets standards for all nursing practice, which address safety, ethical practice, health-
care advocacy, public health, and the well-being of nurses. The American Psychiatric Nurses Association sets
standards for the specialty of psychiatric-mental health (PMH) nursing through the lifespan, including addictions
care. These standards employ the nursing process, specifically including the therapeutic relationship, multiple
therapies and treatment modalities, and treatment settings. The PMH standards separately address professional
performance to include ethical behaviors, evidence-based practice, leadership, interprofessional collaboration, and
recovery-oriented care.

Special Considerations within PMH Nursing Scope of Practice

One of the first hurdles in nursing care of individuals with mental health or addiction challenges is to accept the
nature of these conditions as physiological and not behavioral. Nurses must expand their own awareness to
eliminate the blame that can exist when persons are expected to "behave better."

Review the imagination exercise in Table 13.2 and think about the impact of treating physical illness like one might
treat mental illness.

Imagine someone saying:                                                          To a person who is:

"I don't see that you're even trying to get better!"                             Having coffee-ground emesis

"Well, staying in bed all the time is not helping, is there something else you   In traction for pelvic fracture
could do?"

"Aren't you afraid that medicine is changing the real you?"                      Injecting their insulin

"I understand that you have this infection, but could you just do a little more  Hospitalized for severe sepsis
to help yourself?"                                                               with fever

"Look, just don't give in to this problem!"                                      Diagnosed with inoperable brain
                                                                                 cancer

TABLE 13.2 Imagination Exercise

Based on limited specialized clinical education in nursing programs, the next concern may be that nurses new to the
specialty of PMH may wonder what there is to do for the clients. Talking with the client may happen when the work
408  13 · Clinical Guidelines and Practice

     is done in medical settings, but in the mental health setting, talking with the clientis the work. Some nurses may feel
     at a loss without their own props of stethoscope, alcohol wipes, hemostat clamps, marking pens, or IV start kits. It
     can be a transition for the nurse to conceptualize self as the instrument.

     Psychopharmacology may pose another learning curve for the nurse new to mental health care. Medications are one
     of the essential components of treatment, and it is critical for the PMH nurse to become familiar with medication
     indications and potential side effects.

     The Professional Nurse as Milieu Manager
     The milieu is the treatment area, a safe place created to promote coping, relationships, and recovery. The
     psychiatric-mental health nurse is the milieu manager, meaning they are in charge of the therapeutic value of the
     environment. This may be as literal as the placement of furniture or the volume of the television, or as conceptual as
     the attitudes of the staff. The professional nurse must be physically present in the treatment area, rounding,
     interacting, teaching, observing, and role modeling.

     View the ANA's Principles for Delegation (https://openstax.org/r/77delegation) for nurses, which includes a decision

     Delegation and supervision are components of the professional nurse role in most all settings. In mental health
     treatment, nursing staff may be composed of the RN, LPN/LVN, and mental health worker or unlicensed assistive
     personnel, as well as clerical workers. Delegation guidelines apply for the professional nurse as outlined in state
     Nurse Practice Acts and by the American Nurses Association (ANA), which acknowledges that evolving health-care
     expectations require professional vigilance.

     the licensed nurse's responsibilities as well as responsibilities of the delegate (the one to whom duties are
     assigned).

     Professional Boundaries
     Professional boundaries are the guidelines that frame the therapeutic relationship, and they are particularly
     important considerations in PMH nursing. Nurses recognize the significance of this as distinct from a social
     relationship. Professional boundaries set the limits of the relationship so that it remains focused on the client's
     needs. Self-disclosure from the nurse is used at a minimum to show the nurse's familiarity with the client's
     concerns, such as in acknowledging frustration with decision-making, though this is redirected back to the client, for
     example, "I did struggle with school. What's it been like for you?" Nurses should seek peer feedback and mentoring
     to enhance skills and awareness in setting and maintaining professional boundaries.

     Review A Nurse's Guide to Professional Boundaries (https://openstax.org/r/77nurseboundary) published by the
     National Council of State Boards of Nursing for important information on maintaining professional boundaries.

     Challenges in Scope of Practice

     In all care settings, nurses must provide holistic care. The person in care for a medical illness has psychosocial
     needs and the person in care for mental health has physiological needs. A phenomenon of clinical bias called
     diagnostic overshadowing may occur in mental health treatment when symptoms are attributed to the psychiatric
     diagnosis and medical comorbidities are missed, increasing mortality for these clients (Hallyburton, 2022).

Nurses may struggle to keep a focus on the physiological stability of the client in mental health care, such as
hydration, nutrition, sleep, and activity. Ongoing medical conditions, such as diabetes, cancer, or heart disease
require the nurse's surveillance. A person in mental health crisis may lose the ability to self-monitor for medical
conditions.

Research by Joubert and Bhagwan (2018) found other challenges in mental health nursing to be denial of diagnosis
by clients, clients' refusal of medications, and clients' unpredictable behaviors. Nurses experienced frustration with
clients' aggression and expressed need for ongoing skills support. Leaders in nursing education are called to
incorporate curriculum revisions to capture these challenges before and as they arise (Joubert & Bhagwan, 2018).

Treatments provided through measures that prevent client control and autonomy, coercive measures, were
worrisome to PMH nurses, according to research by Manderius et al. (2023). Coercive measures may begin with
involuntary hospitalization within legal guidelines. Nurses identify difficulty with upholding the ethical principles of
dignity and autonomy in client care, as well as the concept of do no harm, wherein interventions may be withheld if
harm ensues. For instance, nurses may use seclusion (involuntary confinement to a secured area), though
considered a restrictive intervention. The most restrictive intervention, restraint, entails applying devices to restrict
the person's physical movement; nurses can use restraints when the client is self-injuring or a threat to others.
Seclusion and restraint are to be utilized for the minimal time with a provider's order and should be combined with
medication administration and supportive nursing interaction. Table 13.3 lists nursing strategies to address
identified ethical concerns (Manderius et al., 2023).

TABLE 13.3 Nursing Strategies in Response to Ethical Concerns (Manderius et al., 2023)

Delegation and Supervision Issues
The RN (registered nurse) to LPN/LVN (licensed practical/vocational nurse) relationship functions well in most PMH
settings. Medication administration is such an important aspect of mental health care and the LPN/LVN is frequently
assigned in this role. The role of nursing assistants in mental health care, however, was found by Roche et al. (2021)
to lack standardization and differ across settings. Noted is the impact on RN workload for supervision and the need
for identification of outcomes of care delivered by nursing assistant staff in mental health settings.

Similarly, Wilson et al. (2023) conducted a scoping review of delegation practice and found a knowledge gap in
client outcomes. This research cited a professional implication of delegation decisions made at the service level,
which was, in effect, reassignment of nursing duties and not true delegation.
410  13 · Clinical Guidelines and Practice

     In hospital, care center, and treatment facility settings, the nursing workforce hierarchy defines roles and
     relationships. This is generally intended to support decision-making for collaboration between team members,
     meaning that expertise at every level is appropriately and effectively applied. The workplace culture should be one
     of collaboration toward safe client care with staff members at all levels encouraged to contribute to safety and
     quality.

     A hierarchy that feels more oriented toward power, with rigid, disrespectful, or dismissive interactions between
     levels of staff, can negatively impact communication. This may have the effects of increasing risk and compromising
     safety, decision-making, and staff engagement overall.

     According to the Joint Statement of the NCSBN and the ANA (2019), delegation is an essential skill. Registered
     nurses in leadership roles may delegate to other RNs. LPN/LVNs are under the direction and delegation of the RN.
     LPN/LVN staff may provide direction and supervision to UAP (unlicensed assistive personnel, who may be titled
     mental health workers or psychiatric technicians, or be certified nursing assistants). UAP do not have delegation
     authority.

     Delegation is appropriate when the direction fits the scope of practice. For example, the UAP may be directed to
     provide basic hygiene for a stable client or monitor clients on routine safety rounds. The LPN/LVN may be assigned
     blood glucose monitoring and ordered insulin administration with report to the RN. RNs may perform all client care,
     though they are best able to manage unstable clients, admissions, discharges and transfers, and collaborate with
     medical providers if a functional team of nursing staff is in place. Delegation is inappropriate when UAP are assigned
     to determine treatment decisions, for example, moving clients to restrictive care, or when LPN/LVN are asked to
     independently revise the client's plan of care.

     Professional Burnout, Incivility, and Stress
     Kanitha and Naik (2021) surveyed fifty nurses and found almost all had experienced incivility (disrespectful or
     offensive behaviors) on the job. Moreover, Dall'Ora et al. (2020) noted that job stressors of work intensity and
     workload, extended work shifts, inadequate staffing, and nurses' inability to influence these issues resulted in
     burnout, which is a psychological phenomenon characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a
     diminished sense of personal accomplishment related to one's work. The ANA acknowledges workplace stressors
     and calls for system-level mental health promotion for nurses. Melnyk et al. (2021) specifically endorse:

         · creation of more positive work environments
         · creation of more positive learning environments
         · reduction of administrative burden for working nurses
         · provision of technology solutions and support

Summary

13.1 Clinical Guidelines and Standards

Nurses must be aware of the many organizations and agencies that affect their role in the health-care field. These
organizations operate on local, state, and federal levels. It is imperative that nurses know the rules and regulations
that govern the care they provide, how to maintain their license, and the consequences for not following the
regulations. The scope of nursing practice is outlined by the Nurse Practice Act in each nurse's state. There are also
institutional policies of which nurses must be cognizant in order to demonstrate competence and commit to best
practices.

Federal agencies and accrediting agencies also affect nursing practice. Nurses should be familiar with federal
insurance providers, like Medicare and Medicaid, safety protocols promulgated by OSHA, and programs like Healthy
People 2030 and National Patient Safety Goals to help them focus on national priorities and maintain the safest
work and client environments.

13.2 DSM-5 Criteria and Use

The DSM-5-TR provides a widely used diagnostic tool in the field of clinical psychology, PMH nursing, and psychiatry.
It provides a standardized framework for the classification and diagnosis of mental disorders. The DSM has been
updated many times to adapt to current evidence, research, and the evolving practice of mental health care.
Practitioners use it to conceptualize client problems, formulate treatment plans, and bill for services rendered.

13.3 Nursing Assessment and Care Plans

It is important for the PMH RN to utilize the nursing process in helping the mental health client improve and recover.
The APNA, in task force with the International Society of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurses (ISPN), developed the
Scope and Standards of Practice, Third Edition (2022) to guide the PMH RN in the nursing process. The nursing
process includes assessment to recognize and analyze cues to problems, prioritizing hypotheses, generating
solutions, taking action, and evaluating outcomes.

13.4 Promoting Recovery in Psychiatric Nursing

This section has defined the recovery model and orientation in PMH nursing and provided a historical outline of its
development. PMH nurses play an essential role in the recovery process through the therapeutic relationship.
Nurses support persons toward mental health and addictions recovery through education, advocacy, and promotion
of national initiatives like National Recovery Month.

13.5 Special Considerations for PMH Practice

There are a number of challenges and special considerations specific to PMH nursing. First and foremost, nurses
must reflect on their own perceptions of, and stigma toward, mental health issues to ensure that they acknowledge
the physiological basis of these mental health disorders. These clients cannot just be told to "behave better." Nurses
must also become accustomed to the idea of self as the instrument of intervention, talk therapy, for instance, being
the care provided. Other challenges include diagnostic overshadowing, ethical concerns over restrictive treatments
like seclusions and restraints, denial of diagnosis by clients, clients' refusal of medications, and clients'
unpredictable behaviors. Nurses also experience frustration with clients' aggression and lack of ongoing skills
support, and they struggle with stress, incivility in the workplace, and burnout.

What Should the Nurse Do?

Jeff, a forty-two-year-old male, married with two children, has presented to the community health clinic with a
recent onset of concerning symptoms. He works as a software engineer and mentions that his job has been
particularly stressful lately due to increased project demands and tight deadlines. Jeff reports persistent fatigue,
difficulty concentrating, and changes in sleep patterns over the past month. He describes frequent episodes of
insomnia, often waking up in the middle of the night with racing thoughts about work-related tasks. In terms of his
medical history, Jeff has been managing hypertension for the past five years. He takes a daily regimen of
antihypertensive medications prescribed by his primary care physician. His last routine blood pressure check
revealed slightly elevated readings, prompting his visit to the community health clinic. In addition to his
hypertension, Jeff has a psychiatric history that includes a previous episode of depression, which occurred two
years ago. During that time, he underwent therapy, which he found beneficial in managing his emotional well-being.
During the current assessment, Jeff's vital signs indicate an elevated blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg, which is
higher than his baseline. He appears visibly distressed, displaying signs of restlessness, and frequently rubbing his
temples during the conversation. His affect is flat, and he struggles to maintain eye contact. When questioned about
his mood, Jeff admits to feeling overwhelmed and stressed, particularly due to the increased workload and
responsibilities at his job.

distressing symptoms. She reports a persistent low mood, loss of interest in activities she once enjoyed, and
disrupted sleep patterns, experiencing difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep. Ji-Yeon's medical history
indicates no known physical health issues, and she is not currently taking any medications. She discloses a family
history of depression, with her mother and maternal aunt both diagnosed with the condition. During the
assessment, Ji-Yeon describes feeling overwhelmed by her emotions, often on the verge of tears for no apparent
reason. She reports a noticeable decrease in energy, leading to difficulties in completing daily tasks and maintaining
focus at work. Vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate, fall within normal ranges.

Lin, a thirty-five-year-old male, has sought help at the psychiatric clinic, expressing apprehensions about his mental
well-being. In his detailed self-report, Lin describes a persistent and overwhelming sense of sadness that has
lingered for the past six months. He discloses a profound loss of interest in activities that once brought him joy, such
as spending time with friends and engaging in hobbies. Additionally, he notes a noticeable decline in concentration
at work, impacting his overall performance and contributing to heightened stress levels. Exploring Lin's medical
history reveals a noteworthy diagnosis of hypertension, established in the preceding year. Currently managed with
antihypertensive medications, this condition adds a layer of complexity to his overall health. The psychiatric
evaluation, however, uncovers that Lin has no documented history of mental health diagnoses or prior therapeutic
interventions. During the assessment, Lin's physical appearance is marked by signs of fatigue, with noticeable dark
circles under his eyes. Despite this, his vital signs, including blood pressure and heart rate, fall within the normal
range. As the nursing team delves into Lin's history, they inquire about lifestyle factors, sleep patterns, and any
recent life changes that may contribute to his emotional distress.

        foster a recovery-oriented approach, considering Mei's expressed desire for an active role?

Donny, a forty-five-year-old male, has presented to the mental health clinic with symptoms of severe anxiety and
emotional distress. He reports a recent loss of employment due to ongoing panic attacks, and his medical history
reveals a diagnosis of hypertension managed with antihypertensive medications. Psychiatrically, Donny has a history
of generalized anxiety disorder, for which he has been prescribed anxiolytic medication in the past. During the
assessment, Donny exhibits signs of restlessness, increased heart rate, and difficulty maintaining eye contact. His
vital signs, including blood pressure and respiratory rate, show an elevation from his baseline. Donny expresses
concerns about the impact of his mental health on his daily functioning and relationships.

  15. Discuss special considerations within the nursing scope of practice in mental health nursing, considering
        Donny's case. How might the unique aspects of mental health care, such as the therapeutic milieu and
        psychopharmacology, influence the nursing scope of practice in this scenario?

  16. How do challenges in mental health nursing, such as diagnostic overshadowing, relate to the importance of
        professional boundaries and ethical considerations? How can nurses address these challenges while
        maintaining a therapeutic relationship with clients like Donny?

Competency-Based Assessments

    1. How do these bodies of nursing contribute to maintaining the required standards of nursing practice?

    2. Describe the role of Boards of Nursing in regulating nursing practice. How do they contribute to the
        evaluation, renewal, and disciplinary actions related to nursing licenses?

    3. Give examples of how nursing standards are set at both the federal and state levels. How do organizations
        like the ANA and government entities impact nursing practice standards?

    4. How has the DSM evolved since its initial publication in 1952?

    5. How does the DSM-5 guide clinicians in assessing and diagnosing individuals with mental health symptoms?

CHAPTER OUTLINE
14.1 Mild Neurocognitive Disorders
14.2 Delirium
14.3 Dementia
INTRODUCTION This chapter highlights neurocognitive changes that occur in adults. Neurocognitive disorders
affect the way the brain functions. Neurocognitive disorders include conditions such as mild neurocognitive
disorder, delirium, and dementias (now known as major neurocognitive disorder in the DSM-5). Alzheimer disease,
Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, and multiple sclerosis are well-known neurocognitive disorders. These
disorders can have a genetic component and can be associated with environmental factors. They can also be caused
by an underlying medical condition, such as a traumatic brain injury or stroke, metabolic conditions, and even
infections. Continued research is important for discovering new treatments, medications, and preventive strategies
for neurocognitive disorders.

14.1 Mild Neurocognitive Disorders

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Outline the issues involved in diagnosing mild neurocognitive disorders
    · Describe the care planning for and the role of the nurse in treating clients with mild neurocognitive

        disorders
424  14 · Neurocognitive Disorders

     A group of disorders known as neurocognitive disorders (NCD) affects an individual's cognition with a gradual
     decline in at least one of the following domains of cognition: "executive function, complex attention, language,
     learning, memory, perceptual-motor or social cognition" (Emmady et al., 2022, para 1). For information on
     neurodevelopmental disorders that occur in younger clients, see Chapter 23 Children and Adolescents. According to
     the Alzheimer's Society (2023b), 5 to 20 percent of people sixty-five and older are living with mild cognitive
     impairment. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) happens when normal changes in brain cognition that occur with aging
     begin to gradually increase and negatively impact daily living. People with MCI have more problems with memory
     and thinking than other people their age. Because the symptoms are not as severe as in some of the major
     neurocognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer disease or other dementias, people with MCI generally are able to
     continue to care for themselves and carry out their normal daily activities. Signs and symptoms include being unable
     to follow a conversation or difficulty making decisions, getting lost in a known place, missing appointments, and
     forgetting things more often (Mayo Clinic, 2023). Many people remain in this stage for years, while others will
     progress to more severe cognitive decline and dementia. The DSM-5 now uses the term mild neurocognitive
     disorder (MiND), which requires the presence of one or more measurable cognitive disabilities for diagnosis (Ellison,
     2021).

     Diagnosing Mild Neurocognitive Disorders

     A mild neurocognitive disorder (MiND) causes a gradual decline in a person's cognition, beyond that of normal
     aging, negatively impacting daily living, but the individual is still able to function independently (Mount Sinai, 2023).
     There is no single test that a provider can do to diagnose MCI. Instead, it takes a combination of information
     provided by the individual and standardized mental status testing (Mayo Clinic, 2023). Providers may also do a
     neurological exam to test reflexes, eye movements, and walking/balance to assess the neurological deficits. Labs
     can determine if the individual has a physical problem related to deficiencies in vitamin B12 or thyroid hormones
     (Mayo Clinic, 2023). An MRI can check for strokes, bleeding, or a brain tumor. To be diagnosed, the symptoms must
     be connected to a medical condition, not another mental health problem (Psychology Today, 2019).

             LINK TO LEARNING

     A multidisciplinary advisory group of health professionals involved in dementia care have published a summary of
     pragmatic approaches for nurses to help address modifiable risk factors for early Alzheimer disease and mild
     cognitive impairment in their clients (https://openstax.org/r/77Alzheimrisks) in an article in the British Journal of
     Nursing.

     Diagnosis for MiND, according to the DSM-5, includes the presence of one or more cognitive difficulties in the areas
     of complex attention, memory, executive function, expression and understanding of language in written and spoken
     forms, visuospatial cognition, or social cognition (Ellison, 2021). In most cases, people who do not know the
     individual would not notice these changes.

             PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

     Living with HIV and Neurocognitive Impairments

     There are approximately thirty-eight million people who have HIV, and 55 percent of those people live in southern
     and eastern Africa (Tareke et al., 2022). Sixty-eight percent of people with HIV have a neurocognitive impairment
     related to the infection and the medications used to treat it. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND)
     decreases quality of life and, along with the stigma of living with HIV, these individuals also face stigma related to
     having a neurological illness. Lack of social support in individuals with HIV can cause a 31 percent higher chance of
     developing anxiety and depression as compared with the general population. Further, people who feel that they
     have poor social support are less likely to have good outcomes or follow their treatment protocol. A
     recommendation based on the study by Tareke et al. was screening all individuals who get treatment at
     antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinics (Tareke et al., 2022).

Causes of Mild Neurocognitive Disorders
There are both nonreversible and reversible causes of neurocognitive disorders. Nonreversible causes will be
discussed in 14.3 Dementia. Reversible causes include hypoxia, low oxygen level in the brain; hypercapnia, high
carbon dioxide levels in the body; infections; reactions to medications; poisoning; thyroid problems; vitamin
deficiencies, such as low B1, B6, or B12; subdural hematoma; and tumors (Baptist Health, 2023; Mount Sinai,
2023). As with any other mental health consideration, providers should rule out medical causes first.

Risk factors for developing a neurocognitive disorder include being over sixty-five years of age, smoking, excessive
alcohol, Down syndrome, a family history, cardiovascular disease, depression, diabetes, or sleep apnea (Baptist
Health, 2023). The primary risk factor is age. Women are more likely to be diagnosed with a neurocognitive disorder,
but this could be because they tend to live longer than men (Psychology Today, 2019).

Symptoms of Mild Neurocognitive Disorders
All neurocognitive disorders, whether mild or major, share the following symptoms, with differences in their severity
depending upon the person's diagnosis: difficulty planning and making decisions, difficulty focusing and
remembering the names of objects or people, difficulty performing daily tasks, and speaking or acting in ways that
are not socially correct (Psychology Today, 2019). Individuals may take longer to perform some of the activities of
daily living, including grocery shopping, finding their keys, being able to drive or use a telephone, managing their
medications, and handling their finances (National Institute on Aging and National Institutes of Health, 2024).

The decline usually occurs gradually over time. In cases of mild neurocognitive disorders, only close family and
friends may notice the differences in an individual, where strangers do not see a decline.

Nursing Treatment of Mild Neurocognitive Disorders

There is no cure for true mild cognitive disorders, but there are treatments that can help decrease symptoms. A
provider may prescribe an antidepressant or a medication specifically for memory loss (Psychology Today, 2019).
Psychotherapy can be very helpful for dealing with the stress of cognitive decline. This therapy can include family
members so that they have a better understanding of the disease and the amount of support needed by the
individual. There are certain things that an individual can do to reduce the risk of their cognitive decline becoming
more severe. Things like getting regular exercise; eating healthy food; limiting alcohol, smoking, and sugar intake;
having good sleep hygiene; and staying connected to social supports all work together toward better overall health
(Psychology Today, 2019).

  CLINICAL JUDGMENT MEASUREMENT MODEL

  Treatment and Help for MiND: Take Action

  After assessing the client and gathering data, the nurse prepares a care plan that is written in easy-to-
  understand language. This care plan should include the specific symptoms that the client is experiencing, how
  the team proposes to manage those symptoms, information about any comorbid medical conditions, and
  caregiver support needs. The nurse then discusses the care plan with the client and their family and gives them
  a copy. Referrals to consult specialists must be made. While there is no cure for MiND, some daily interventions
  can be helpful, such as maintaining a routine, providing memory aids like calendars and clocks, eating and
  drinking well, and getting enough sleep.

  (Alzheimer's Association, 2023a)

Planning Nursing Care for a Client with Mild Neurocognitive Disorders
Nurses need to be supportive of the person who is noticing a decline in their cognitive abilities. Person-centered
care involves treating the client with empathy, respect, and looking at situations from their point of view, including
their history, cultural preferences, and basic likes and dislikes. It entails assisting them to enjoy their relationships
with others, despite a decline in some of their cognitive abilities (Alzheimer's Society, 2023b). One important step in
the nursing assessment process is to ask the person to describe their own perceptions of problems they are
encountering. It may be helpful to have the family involved while gathering the health history, because they may
have a better grasp of the cognitive decline they have witnessed in their loved one (Lin et al., 2012). Because early
detection is beneficial in managing MiND, nurses should routinely educate older clients and their families about the
426  14 · Neurocognitive Disorders

     signs and symptoms of mild neurocognitive disorders (Lin et al., 2012).

     Nurses can make a difference by incorporating interventions that address modifiable risk factors (MRFs). MRFs are
     separated into four areas that evidence has shown may delay cognitive decline (Hope, 2020). These areas are
     medical, nutrition, psychosocial, and lifestyle. Examples of interventions in these areas are listed in (Table 14.1).

     Category      Examples

     Medical       · Checking blood pressure routinely to ensure that blood pressure remains within a healthy
                      range. This could include the purchase of an at-home electronic blood pressure cuff for an
                      individual who already has some cardiovascular concerns.

                   · Checking that cholesterol and blood glucose levels are within normal
                      ranges--hypercholesterolemia and diabetes are known to increase the risk for dementia.

     Nutrition     · Teaching individuals about the importance of eating a nutritious diet to maintain a healthy
                      weight/BMI.

     Psychosocial  · Encouraging the individual to remain socially active.
                   · Encouraging the individual to pursue treatment for depression and anxiety.
                   · Encouraging the individual to do daily activities that will work the brain--crossword

                      puzzles, playing cards, and learning something new.

     Lifestyle     · Advising the reduction/cessation of smoking or drinking alcohol.
                   · Encouraging the individual to remain physically active.

     TABLE 14.1 Interventions That May Delay Cognitive Decline (Hope, 2020)

     There are several challenges nurses may face caring for a person with MiND. First, an individual may have noticed
     some decline but not be fully aware of how far their deficits extend. Second, a nurse may see an individual who they
     suspect has a cognitive decline but has not yet been diagnosed. In this case, the nurse could perform a screening
     assessment such as the Mini-Cog (see 14.3 Dementia). Third, the nurse needs to be sure to include the individual's
     beliefs and cultural values in the conversations they have about the disease process (Lin et al., 2012) because there
     are different belief systems about the signs and symptoms as well as the illness itself. Additionally, some people
     think of cognitive declines as a normal part of aging and do not consider that these declines may be due to
     something else.

             LIFE-STAGE CONTEXT

     The Use of Standardized Screening Tools

     The use of standardized screening tools to test for cognitive impairment and dementia provides information about
     the client's strengths and weaknesses. The psychologist must choose the tool that uses normative data that is the
     most appropriate for their client's age, culture, gender, language, and educational background. Brief mental status
     exams are frequently used to determine if a client is experiencing cognitive decline or dementia. Health-care
     providers must be aware that this tool is more sensitive to dementia than to MCI. There has been an increase in the
     number of screening tests available for clients in the older age ranges and for particular demographics, such as
     particular cultures. Providers must continue to educate themselves on the screening tools available for particular
     population groups (American Psychological Association, 2021).

     Supporting Caregivers
     Cognitive impairment is stressful for the individual and their family members. Talking about the responsibilities that
     often fall on family caregivers when cognitive impairment worsens may be the first step to take in preparing the
     family for the road ahead. A family meeting can help the family members learn more about MiND and what they can

14.2 · Delirium                                                                                                          427

do to support their loved one. Encouraging the family to think about how they might divide or design tasks allows
each person to have a sense of autonomy and connection to one another. Even family members who live far away
can be involved in such things as checking in regularly (via phone, e-mail, texting, or FaceTime) with the individual
and the primary caregiver, taking over things that can be handled online, such as bill paying or doing research to
locate in-home services should that need arise (National Institute on Aging, 2023).

Encourage family members to be honest about how much they feel they can realistically do and to share any
concerns they may have about how these added responsibilities might affect their own jobs, immediate family, or
personal wellness. Pay particular attention to what is referred to as the "sandwich generation" caregivers. These are
the family members who are caring for their parents while also caring for their children (National Institute on Aging,
2023). These caregivers account for one in four people who are caring for an aging parent. They are at an increased
risk for additional stress and fatigue due to caring for both their parents and their children.

Offering resources, such as support groups that are available in the community, will help family members connect
with other people caring for older parents. Respite care services are another helpful resource for family caregivers if
the individual's cognitive impairment has progressed beyond basic assistance. One such resource is the ARCH
National Respite Locator Service (https://openstax.org/r/77respitecare) which has a searchable function for finding
care.

    · Explain the role of the nurse in providing care for a client with delirium

Diagnosing Delirium

Psychosis caused by medical issues is often referred to as delirium, which is a mental state in which the client
becomes temporarily confused, disoriented, and not able to think or remember clearly. It usually starts suddenly
and can indicate the onset of a life-threatening medical condition. Delirium resolves upon successful treatment of
the underlying condition. Each year, more than seven million Americans experience delirium (American Delirium
Society, 2023).

Nurses must closely monitor the cognitive function of all clients and promptly report any changes in mental status to
the health-care provider. The provider will take a medical history, perform a physical and neurological examination,
perform mental status testing, and may order diagnostic tests based on the client's medical history. After
determining the cause of delirium, treatment targets the cause and attempts to reverse its effects.

Incidence and Causes of Delirium
Hospitalized older adults are at increased risk for developing delirium, especially if they have been previously
diagnosed with dementia. One-third of clients aged seventy years or older exhibits delirium during their
hospitalization. Delirium is the most common surgical complication for older adults, occurring in 15 to 25 percent of
clients after major elective surgery and up to 50 percent of clients experiencing hip-fracture repair or cardiac
surgery (Marcantonio, 2017). There are many common causes of delirium, including the following (MedlinePlus,
2021; American Delirium Society, 2023):

    · dehydration and electrolyte imbalances
    · dementias and other neurocognitive disorders
    · hospitalization, especially intensive care
    · intoxication or withdrawal from alcohol or drugs
428  14 · Neurocognitive Disorders

         · kidney or liver failure
         · medications, such as sedatives, opioids, anesthesia, antihistamines, anticholinergics, antidepressants,

             antipsychotics, or anticonvulsants
         · metabolic disorders, such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
         · serious infections, such as urinary tract infections, pneumonia, and influenza
         · severe pain
         · sleep deprivation

     In older adults, one of the most common causes of delirium is a urinary tract infection (UTI), so it is important to get
     a urine sample as soon as acute confusion is noted. Older adults may not have pain as a symptom of a UTI, like a
     younger person would, but acute confusion, incontinence, and shivering are telltale signs. After diagnosing a UTI,
     antibiotics generally resolve the confusion.

             CLINICAL SAFETY AND PROCEDURES (QSEN)

     QSEN Competency: Client-Centered Care of a Client Experiencing Delirium

     During the care of an older client who has delirium, it is important for the nurse to:

         · Assess levels of physical and emotional comfort, which may require observing body language rather than
             relying on a spoken answer.

         · Initiate effective treatments to relieve pain and suffering in light of client values, preferences, and expressed
             needs. Again, this could be based on how the client is expressing their needs (grimacing, guarding, changing
             body positions, or even input from family members).

         · Remove barriers to having families and other designated surrogates present with the client, based on the
             client preferences. The nurse may need to educate the family members on behavior seen in delirium and how
             they can best help their loved one while visiting or caring for the individual.

     (QSEN Institute, n.d.)

     Symptoms of Delirium
     The symptoms of delirium usually start suddenly, over a few hours or a few days, and they often come and go. The
     most common symptoms are as follows (MedlinePlus, 2021):

         · changes in alertness (usually more alert in the morning, less at night)
         · changing levels of consciousness
         · confusion
         · disorganized thinking or talking in a way that doesn't make sense
         · disrupted sleep patterns or sleepiness
         · emotional changes: anger, agitation, depression, irritability, or overexcitement
         · hallucinations and delusions
         · incontinence
         · memory problems, especially with short-term memory
         · trouble concentrating

     Nursing Treatment of Delirium

     The general treatment of delirium is to manage the causes and the symptoms. This might entail, for instance,
     discontinuing medications or treating infection or imbalances (electrolytes) in the body. There are supportive care
     measures provided to prevent any complications from occurring. These measures include proper diet and nutrition,
     treating pain, assisting with movement, taking care of incontinence issues, keeping the same caregivers as much as
     possible, and involving family members (Mayo Clinic, 2022). Involving family members to assist with familiarity,
     comfort, prevention of falls, and assistance with safety and monitoring of the client can be very helpful. Additionally,
     reminders, such as whiteboards with visual cues, dates and times, and names of staff members is beneficial.
     Promoting sleep hygiene is an important role of the nurse, and good sleep can help the client recover more
     expediently.

A nurse who recognizes the confusion and frustration experienced by the individual with delirium will begin to form
a plan of care that will increase the individual's comfort and sense of calm. There are some easy things nurses can
do to assist the client in getting reoriented and to decrease their stress levels. Nurses can often manage the
symptoms of delirium with the following nursing interventions (MedlinePlus, 2021):

    · making sure the room is quiet and well lit
    · having clocks and calendars within view
    · inviting family members to spend time in the room
    · ensuring clients are wearing hearing aids and glasses
    · allowing for undisrupted sleep when possible
    · getting clients up and out of bed when possible
    · controlling pain with pain relievers (unless the pain medication is causing the psychosis)
    · administering prescribed medications to distressed clients at risk to themselves or to others, such as

        haloperidol (note that sedation can worsen delirium symptoms)
    · avoiding the use of restraints

The confusion that a client feels can be very scary to them, so providing a supportive environment is especially
important during the acute stages of delirium.

        PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Delirium and Alcohol Withdrawal

The most severe condition caused by withdrawal from alcohol is delirium tremens (DTs). This can be life-threatening
and requires medical attention (Cleveland Clinic, 2023). The heavier a person drinks, the higher their risk to develop
the DTs if they suddenly stop drinking. Symptoms usually occur one to three days after the last drink and include
tremors (in the hands is most common), confusion, agitation, hallucinations, disorientation, diaphoresis, seizures,
hyperthermia, headaches, nausea and vomiting, and tachycardia (Cleveland Clinic, 2023). Many people feel
ashamed to ask for help and may not be truthful with their health-care provider about the actual amount of alcohol
they regularly consume. It is the job of the nurse and the entire health-care team to care for clients going through
alcohol withdrawal without any judgments and with client safety as the focus.

14.3 Dementia

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Define various forms of dementia
    · Describe the approaches to treatment and nursing care planning for a client with dementia

Dementia is an umbrella term that covers a host of neurocognitive disorders. The symptoms of these disorders show
up as a gradual decline in a person's cognitive functioning. There are over fifty-five million people in the world living
with dementia (American Psychiatric Association, 2023). The most common form of dementia is Alzheimer disease,
accounting for 60 to 80 percent of cases.

Definition and Forms of Dementia

The term dementia is an older one that describes neurodegenerative brain disorders that cause changes in a
person's cognition (American Psychiatric Association, 2023). When a person has dementia, they lose the ability to
think, take care of themselves, remember things, and sometimes control their emotions. The DSM-5 no longer uses
the term dementia, because it has been primarily associated with older adults and Alzheimer disease, and now uses
the term major neurocognitive disorder (major NCD) to reflect the group of disorders that can affect younger and
older individuals' cognition with a gradual decline in at least one of the following domains of cognition: executive
function, complex attention, language, learning, memory, perceptual-motor, or social cognition (Emmady et al.,
2022). This text uses the terms dementia and major neurocognitive disorder interchangeably. Clinical
manifestations of major NCD include forgetfulness, impaired social skills, and impaired decision-making and
thinking abilities that interfere with daily living. Major NCD is gradual, progressive, and irreversible (Alzheimer's
430  14 · Neurocognitive Disorders

     Association, 2023b). Nonetheless, appropriate assessment and nursing care improve the safety and quality of life
     for those affected by dementia. There are seven stages of major neurocognitive disorder based upon symptoms and
     ranging from mild to very severe cognitive decline (Table 14.2).

     Stage            Description

     TABLE 14.2 Reisberg's Stages of Neurocognitive Disorders

     The Cognitive Domains Used in Diagnosing Major NCD in the DSM-5
     There are six main cognitive domains used in the DSM-5 to measure cognitive decline. Complex attention is capacity
     to remain focused while doing multiple things at one time. Executive function includes the high-level abilities
     individuals need in order to control cognition, such as sequencing, planning, and organizing tasks. Learning and
     memory are the abilities to understand and store information and later retrieve it. Language is the way that people
     communicate, whether that be through speech, writing, or reading. Perceptual-motor control allows individuals to
     control their body movements so that they can interact with the environment. Social cognition helps people process,
     remember, and apply information in social situations. All six of these cognitive domains are used to assess for major
     NCD and subsequently diagnose them (Sheikh, 2022). However, for diagnosis, there must be evidence of decline to
     the level of substantial impairment in at least two cognitive domains, one of which must be memory.

     Subtypes of Major NCD
     Major NCD has many subtypes, each with its own DSM-5 diagnostic criteria (American Psychiatric Association,
     2022). The DSM-5 recognizes the following subtypes: Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal degeneration, Lewy body
     dementia, vascular disease, traumatic brain injury, substance use, HIV infection, Prion disease (Creutzfeldt-Jakob
     disease), Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, another medical condition, multiple etiologies, and unknown
     etiology.

     The most common of these disorders is Alzheimer disease, which affects the brain by causing atrophy in the cortex

(Figure 14.2), deposits of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the neurons, and degeneration of the
neurons (Emmady et al., 2022). The presence of the amyloid plaques is found on autopsy. The DSM-5 criteria for
Alzheimer disease includes evidence of genetic mutation from family history or testing of all of the following: clear
evidence of decline in memory and learning and at least one other cognitive domain; progressive, gradual decline in
cognition, without extended plateaus; and no evidence of other causes of symptoms. Risk factors for Alzheimer
disease include age, cardiovascular diseases, history of stroke, history of traumatic brain injury, and Down
syndrome. Genetic testing for markers is now available to test for amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1
(PSEN1), and presenilin 3 (PSEN2). The genetic test for PSEN1 is widely available.

The disorder called frontotemporal degeneration involves personality and behavior changes; it affects nerve cells
in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. This is the most common dementia in younger people and usually
begins between ages forty and sixty-five years (John Hopkins Medicine, 2023). Symptoms include impaired
judgment; lack of empathy; behavior changes; emotional withdrawal; difficulty with language, speaking, and writing
skills; and agitation. There is no known cause. There are no treatments to slow the progression; clients can benefit
from some symptom management using antidepressants, sleeping pills, and antipsychotic medications.

Comedian Robin Williams developed a major NCD called Lewy body dementia, which ultimately caused him to take
his own life. Since his death, the family has aimed to raise awareness for this progressive form of dementia. This
disease accounts for 5 percent of dementia cases. Both Lewy body dementia and Parkinson disease involve Lewy
bodies, insoluble deposits of alpha-synuclei protein that damage the brain (Emmady et al., 2022). In her article
"The Terrorist Inside my Husband's Brain" (2016), Susan Williams describes her husband's history of depression
and the new symptoms he began to experience: insomnia, heartburn, a poor sense of smell, constipation, and
urinary difficulty. He was diagnosed with Parkinson disease. At that point, he had a hand tremor, shuffling gait,
masklike expression, and weakened voice. It wasn't until after his autopsy that it was determined he actually had
Lewy body dementia that had done massive amounts of damage to his brain. Lewy body dementia can be difficult to
diagnose until after death when the autopsy confirms the presence of Lewy bodies in the brain. This disease is often
first diagnosed as Parkinson disease because of the many shared symptoms (John Hopkins Medicine, 2024).

Injuries to the brain from ischemia, such as a stroke, that block blood flow to the brain and lead to permanent
neuron death can cause vascular dementias. Illnesses, such as diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, can be
432  14 · Neurocognitive Disorders

     risk factors because they can be precursors to having a stroke (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC],
     2023). Moreover, untreated HIV infection can lead to the development of specific neurocognitive disorders caused
     by toxic inflammation (encephalopathy) in the brain.

     Commonly mistaken for "madcow" disease, Prion disease (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) is a very rare form of
     dementia, affecting only one to two people per million worldwide in any year. This disease progresses rapidly and
     leads to death within one year. This disease is considered a transmissible form of spongiform encephalopathy
     (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021). This disease is believed to develop spontaneously when normal
     prion proteins become abnormal prion proteins. In 85 percent of people who develop this disease, there is no
     understandable pattern of transmission. There is a familial component with a dominant inheritance pattern in 5 to
     15 percent of clients who develop this disease (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022). Symptoms of
     this disease include rapidly progressing dementia, and at least two of the following symptoms: myoclonus (muscle
     jerks), visual or cerebellar signs, pyramidal/extrapyramidal signs, and Akinetic mutism (person is in a wakeful state
     of profound indifference to goal-directed behavior and emotions) (CDC, 2022).

     Another cause of dementia, Huntington disease is a genetic mutation that causes the building blocks of DNA to
     repeat more times than they normally do. The disease attacks the neurons in the brain, causing them to die.
     Symptoms include uncontrollable movements (chorea) that can cause a person to fall easily. The person develops
     difficulty with speech, swallowing, eating, and cognition (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,
     2023). While each of these subtypes of neurocognitive disorder affects brain cognition, they all have varying
     symptoms and diagnostic criteria under the DSM-5.

     Dementia and Alzheimer Disease
     Many people still refer to a person who begins to have memory problems as having Alzheimer disease. Alzheimer
     disease is one type of major NCD diagnosed after a complete physical exam and neurological tests. In a client with
     Alzheimer disease, PET scan images will reveal buildup of amyloid plaques and tau proteins (Alzheimers.gov, n.d.).
     There is medication available to treat some of the symptoms of Alzheimer disease, and to slow the progression
     (Table 14.3), but there is no cure (Alzheimer's Association, 2023c). Figure 14.2 shows the spread of Alzheimer
     disease through the brain.

     Understanding the Symptoms
     Often, providers confuse major NCD and delirium, leading to misdiagnosis. If an older person suddenly becomes
     confused, it is very likely the result of another medical cause, such as infection, fecal impaction, or dehydration, not
     dementia. According to UHealth Collective (2018), there are thousands of people misdiagnosed with dementia each
     year. It is important to remember that the onset of dementia has a slower progression while delirium has rapid
     symptom development. Because the different subtypes of major NCD can share symptoms, it can also be difficult to
     get an exact diagnosis. A primary care doctor may refer a client to see a neurologist in order to get the correct
     diagnosis (Alzheimers.gov, n.d.). (Table 14.4) compares dementia to delirium to aid in differential diagnosis.

Planning Treatment for a Client with Major NCD

It is important that a team approach be taken to care for a person with major neurocognitive disorder. Emmady et al.
(2022) recommend that the physician coordinate the plan of care with the pharmacist, social workers, nurses, and
family members. The primary health-care provider does the initial assessment and may refer the client to a
neurologist to confirm a diagnosis. There are screening tests performed to establish a benchmark and then repeated
at follow-up visits to record further decline. One such test is the Mini-Cog, which includes the clock test. This simple
test assesses the client's memory recall, brain function, and spatial abilities by asking them to recall three words
and then draw the face of a clock, placing the numbers around the face of the clock and the hands at a specific time
(Alzheimer's Association, 2023b).

        LINK TO LEARNING

This short article about administering the clock test (https://openstax.org/r/77clocktest) provides its history and
some basic instructions.

The provider also coordinates medication with the pharmacist. Social workers assist the client and their families to
ensure that the living environment is safe and support is available to caregivers. Family members should be
educated about the disease process and given information about community support. Nurses provide care in the
436  14 · Neurocognitive Disorders

     inpatient, outpatient, and community settings that is designed to provide the best possible outcomes for the client.

     Planning Nursing Care for a Client with Major NCD
     Because people are living longer, there are more and more individuals who need nurses who are trained to take care
     of people with illnesses like major neurocognitive disorder. According to the most recent report of Administration for
     Community Living (2021), 16 percent of the U.S. population, or 54.1 million people were over the age of sixty-five in
     2019. Nurses should become educated about the symptoms, treatment, interventions, and coordination of services
     in the care of this population of clients (Deshaies, 2023). Nurses create a plan of care that helps develop a daily
     routine to assist and support clients with their daily self-care activities. Many clients with dementia believe they are
     living in their younger years, going to work, or caring for their families. Offering activities, such as folding towels,
     caring for a baby doll or stuffed animal, or giving them a job to do, such as wiping down tables, encourages the client
     to participate in their surroundings in a way that is comforting to them.

     An assessment of the environment is important to keep the client safe. If the client lives at home, look for throw
     rugs that could be tripping hazards, check if the bathroom is equipped with grab bars, and determine if there is
     adequate lighting or stairs to navigate. Nurses should also take care to communicate with these clients by asking
     simple questions in a calm manner. The nurse recognizes when the client is becoming anxious, angry, or more
     confused. Nurses may also play a role in managing medications. They can encourage families and friends to spend
     time with the client. Nurses work with an interdisciplinary team to share their expertise and interactions as a way of
     keeping safety and autonomy goals in sight for the client.

     If an older adult requires more care than family members are able to provide at home, nurses provide valuable
     information about available care options and make referrals to social workers and case managers. There are a wide
     variety of community-based resources to enhance care for older adults. Local aging and disability resource centers
     (ADRCs) can help facilitate referrals based on specific needs of the older adult. Examples of other resources include
     adult day centers, home health agencies that provide personal care and nursing assistance, community-based
     residential facilities (CBRFs), and residential care apartment complexes (RCACs). If an older adult requires twenty-
     four-hour nursing care, placement in a nursing home (also referred to as a skilled nursing facility) may be required.

             REAL RN STORIES

     Nurse: Lenore, MSN, RN, PMH-BC
     Years in Practice: Nineteen
     Clinical Setting: Inpatient Behavioral Health Unit
     Geographic Location: Texas

     As a nurse who has worked with many older adult clients grappling with Alzheimer disease, one specific older client
     stands out. He was in his eighties and had been admitted to the inpatient behavioral health unit to give his family
     some respite while they tried to figure out the appropriate placement for him after hospitalization. In comparison
     with other older adult clients I have seen, this client did not display any of the anger or aggression sometimes
     revealed as clients would sundown in the early evening hours. Instead, this client got up each morning and dressed
     in a pair of work slacks, a long-sleeved colored shirt, and sat at a table in the community day area. After he had his
     breakfast, he would say he was ready for work. He had had a long career as an accountant/businessman, and each
     day he thought he needed to get to work. I would provide him with a legal pad, a pencil, and a phone book. He would
     spend the next few hours "working," writing numbers on that notepad. I would stop by his chair several times during
     the morning to ask if he needed anything.

     One thing we are taught in nursing school is that we should reorient our clients. In the case of a person with
     Alzheimer disease, there is an exception to that rule. If reorienting is going to cause the person stress, it is better to
     just go along with their beliefs as to where they are and in what time period. I am sure if I had tried to tell this client
     that he was in the hospital and he was now in his eighties, it would have caused more frustration than clarity in his
     mind. Instead, I went along with where he was in that moment. It gave him a purpose, satisfaction that he was
     doing a good job, and peace.

Summary

14.1 Mild Neurocognitive Disorders

While mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild neurocognitive disorder (MiND) are very similar, diagnosis for MiND
includes the presence of one or more cognitive difficulties in the areas of complex attention, memory, executive
function, expression and understanding of language in written and spoken forms, visuospatial cognition, and social
cognition (Ellison, 2021). There is no single test to diagnose this disorder. Instead, it takes a combination of
information provided by the individual and standardized mental status testing (Mayo Clinic, 2023). All
neurocognitive disorders, whether mild or major, share the following symptoms, with differences in their severity
depending upon the person's diagnosis: difficulty planning and making decisions, difficulty focusing, cannot
remember the names of objects or people, difficulty performing daily tasks, and speaking or acting in ways that are
not socially correct (Psychology Today, 2019). There is no cure for MiND, but there are treatments that can help
decrease symptoms.

14.2 Delirium

Each year, more than seven million Americans experience delirium (American Delirium Society, 2023). Delirium is a
mental state in which the client becomes temporarily confused, disoriented, and not able to think or remember
clearly. Although delirium is a medical emergency that can result in death, it is treatable if detected and treated.
Delirium will resolve once the underlying medical cause is treated. Nurses can put in place a number of
interventions to help manage the symptoms of delirium.

14.3 Dementia

Major neurocognitive disorders are a group of disorders that can affect younger and older individuals' cognition with
a gradual decline in at least one of the following domains of cognition: executive function, complex attention,
language, learning, memory, perceptual-motor, or social cognition. There are seven stages of major neurocognitive
disorder (dementia) used to determine how severe the cognitive decline. Neurocognitive disorder has many
subtypes, each with its own DSM-5 diagnostic criteria (American Psychiatric Association, 2022). The DSM-5
recognizes the following subtypes: Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal degeneration, Lewy body dementia, vascular
disease, traumatic brain injury, substance use, HIV infection, Prion disease (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease), Parkinson
disease, and Huntington disease. Alzheimer disease is the most common of these disorders.

What Should the Nurse Do?

Tahira, a sixty-eight-year-old female, arrives at the clinic with memory lapses and challenges in daily tasks. She
forgets names and misplaces items, causing increased frustration. Her daughter notes a gradual decline in cognitive
abilities over the past year. Medical history includes well-controlled hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Compliant
with treatment, Tahira monitors blood pressure and glucose levels at home, maintaining an active lifestyle. No
significant psychiatric history is reported. During the assessment, the nurse observes mild confusion and a struggle
with recall. Culturally sensitive care is emphasized. Vital signs show stable blood pressure (120/80 mmHg), heart
rate (78 bpm), respiratory rate (16 breaths/min), and normal temperature (98.6°F). While physiological parameters
are within limits, a comprehensive evaluation is needed to address cognitive concerns.

    1. Considering Tahira's case, what challenges might health-care professionals face in diagnosing mild
        neurocognitive disorders, and how can cultural factors influence the diagnostic process?

    2. As a nurse caring for Tahira, what nursing interventions could you implement to support her and her family in
        managing the cognitive decline associated with mild neurocognitive disorders?

Carlos, a seventy-eight-year-old male, is brought to the emergency department by his daughter due to sudden
changes in behavior and cognition. Carlos's daughter reports that over the past forty-eight hours, he has become
increasingly disoriented, agitated, and has exhibited fluctuations in attention. She notes that he has had difficulty
recognizing family members, and his speech has become more incoherent. Carlos has a history of hypertension and
type 2 diabetes, both well-managed with medication. He has no known psychiatric history. During the initial
assessment, the nurse observes Carlos's vital signs, noting a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, a heart rate of 110
beats per minute, and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. His temperature is elevated at 101.2°F (38.4°C).

    3. What key features in Carlos's case help distinguish delirium from dementia, and how might the sudden onset
        of symptoms influence the diagnostic process?

    4. What specific nursing interventions can be implemented to support Carlos's overall well-being?
    5. Given Carlos's medical history, which common causes of delirium might be relevant in his case, and how

        could these causes be further assessed or addressed in the emergency department?

CHAPTER OUTLINE
15.1 Schizophrenia
15.2 Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders
15.3 Delusional Disorder
INTRODUCTION Schizophrenia spectrum disorders and other psychotic disorders all share the same common
symptom, a loss of contact with reality that results in impaired functioning. While some of these disorders last from
days to months with a total return to functioning, others within this spectrum of disorders cause lifelong disability,
stigma, and significant cost. Early references to conditions containing the symptoms of schizophrenia appear in
classical literature and the Bible. Eugen Bleuler, a Swiss psychiatrist, was the first to use the term schizophrenia in
1908. Until the 1950s, brain surgery, electric shock, sedative drugs, and sometimes life confinement were the only
choices for the management of schizophrenia. With the invention of antipsychotics and the trend toward
deinstitutionalizing those with mental health disorders, significant changes occurred for those diagnosed as being
on the schizophrenia spectrum and having other psychotic disorders in the second half of the twentieth century.
Nursing care is at the forefront of optimal care outcomes for those diagnosed with these disorders. Understanding
the disturbance, symptoms, treatments, and care algorithms is essential in concordant nursing care.

     15.1 Schizophrenia

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define schizophrenia and its prevalence, course, and causes
         · Understand the symptoms associated with schizophrenia
         · Explain the stages of schizophrenia
         · Outline approaches used to treat schizophrenia
         · Plan nursing care for a client living with schizophrenia

     The severe mental illness and disturbance involving a collection of cognitive, affective, and behavioral symptoms
     that negatively affect social, educational, and/or occupational functioning is called schizophrenia. The course of the
     disorder varies. Some individuals endure episodes of the disease with asymptomatic breaks between them. Other
     people have continuous symptoms of the disorder with no remission. There are several theories of how this
     disturbance emerges, but there is no single etiology and no cure, only treatment for symptoms, including
     medications, therapies, and psychoeducation. The nurse's role is to assess clients for critical signs of the disorder,
     evaluate the impact of these symptoms on their functioning, plan and implement care during treatment, review the
     efficacy of drug and psychosocial interventions, and check for adverse events with medications.

     UNFOLDING CASE STUDY

     Schizophrenia: Part 1

     The nurse is assessing a twenty-year-old male who reports to the emergency department with his mother and
     best friend.

     PMH      Client is a second-year college student studying engineering. He is a bright young person
              attending college on a scholarship. He has no documented health issues outside of typical colds
              and ear infections as a child and a bout of influenza last year.
              Family history: Father has a history of bipolar disorder and substance use and has been out of
              their lives for fifteen years. Mother does not know his current whereabouts.
              Social history: Client has been active in sports and has played basketball through high school and
              up until last semester when he quit the team unexpectedly. Grades have been above average, and
              mother reports he has "never been in trouble." Mother reports the client has experimented with
              marijuana in the past, but she is not aware of any substance use at this time.
              The client has no current medications and no known allergies.

     Nursing  1930: Triage Assessment
     Notes    Client presents with confusion and delirium, pacing and muttering to himself. When questioned,
              he became agitated and suspicious of the staff's intent to help. Client declined to change into a
              gown and did not want vitals taken. Eventually he did comply, after talking with him and reassuring
              him he is safe. His Mother and friends report changes in personality over the course of the past
              several weeks with today becoming an acute emergency situation. The client was found taping
              tinfoil to his bedroom windows and made comments that there was a helicopter flying overhead
              and that the FBI was watching him. Client self-reports hearing voices in his head telling him to
              block the windows and hide. The client does not report any homicidal or suicidal ideation. Client
              unable to void to provide urine specimen.

Defining Prevalence, Course, and Causes of Schizophrenia

It is posited that schizophrenia is created from a diverse genetic, environmental, and neurobiological etiology that
manifests in specific neuronal changes in childhood that result in a cluster of positive, negative, and cognitive
symptoms. The disturbance is seen globally and in all ethnic groups, and it usually emerges in early adulthood.

Prevalence of Schizophrenia
Schizophrenia affects nearly twenty-four million people or one in 222 adults (World Health Organization, 2022).
Schizophrenia is found in every culture and population across the globe. Although it is not as common as other
mental health disorders, the burden of the disease is high. Costs associated with schizophrenia in the United States
exceed $150 billion annually (Kadakia et al., 2022). Aside from health-care costs like frequent hospital admissions,
there are expenses related to lost work productivity of the person with the disorder and their caregivers and
446  15 · Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder and Other Psychotic Disorders

     expenditures for legal problems encountered by those with symptoms. Individuals with schizophrenia have a higher
     risk of suicide, greater involvement with the legal system and incarceration, and increased incidence of
     homelessness. Schizophrenia is associated with significant functional limitations, distress, and familial and social
     impairment. The lifespan of those burdened with the disturbance is fifteen years shorter than average due to
     common comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic disturbance, other mental health disorders,
     substance misuse, suicide, and infection (Hjorthøj et al., 2017).

     The Course of Illness
     The age of onset for schizophrenia varies with the average first episode at 23.7 years of age. Youth-onset
     schizophrenia's average age of onset is 13 years, and late-onset schizophrenia appears on average at 60.7 years of
     age. Earlier onset is associated with a poorer prognosis (Immonen et al., 2017). Subtle signs of the illness, such as
     language, motor, and cognitive abnormalities, may be present during childhood. Children who later develop
     schizophrenia demonstrate some social disturbances such as social withdrawal. Children who experience subtle
     prepsychotic symptoms are at higher risk for developing psychotic disorders later in life. These children may present
     with neuromotor delays, speech or language impairments, and lower IQ or declining IQ scores (Liu et al., 2015).

     The course of the illness is highly variable. Some clients will have a single acute episode and then achieve complete
     remission; some may have several acute episodes with remissions in between them, while others may have
     continuous psychosis. Long term, however, most clients achieve remission and recovery after the initial illness, can
     go several years between psychotic episodes, and can find meaningful employment.

     Potential Causes of Schizophrenia
     The cause of schizophrenia is unknown. There are no biomarkers to assist in the diagnosis. Laboratory exams and
     radiographic studies do not confirm the diagnosis. There are some genetic and environmental factors that do,
     however, appear to increase individual risk for developing schizophrenia.

     Heritability appears to have a significant influence on the development of schizophrenia. The risk of schizophrenia in
     the general population is 1 percent. Those with siblings diagnosed with schizophrenia have a 10 percent risk of
     developing the disease. Monozygotic twins will have a concordance rate of 40 to 50 percent rate of disease
     expression while dizygotic twins have a 15 percent rate (Imamura et al., 2020).

     There is also evidence that in utero stressors may alter neurodevelopment (changes in glutamate receptors) and
     predispose a client to developing schizophrenia. These stressors include exposure to viruses, starvation, and
     complications during pregnancy. Other risk factors during early development include paternal age over fifty and
     under twenty, winter birth (in the Northern Hemisphere), and birth in urban areas. Risk factors during childhood and
     adolescence include being raised in an urban environment, migration, cannabis use, stressful life events, and
     trauma. Other factors that raise the risk of developing the disturbance include epilepsy or Huntington disease, head
     injury, tumors, cerebrovascular accidents, myxedema, Wilson disease, being from a lower socioeconomic class,
     having inadequate nutrition, and the absence of prenatal care.

     There are three general neurobiological theories for the causes of schizophrenia. The first theory is that there is
     hyperactivity of dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain. The mesolimbic pathway connects the ventral
     tegmental area and the nucleus accumbens in the limbic system. It is here that the brain manages the reward
     system and desires. An overload of dopamine in this system increases the potential for aggression and psychotic
     symptoms.

     The second hypothesis involves the neurotransmitter glutamate. Glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter in
     the brain and is responsible for transmitting most of the sensory information in the body. The theory holds that due
     to genetic influences, changes in utero, or during critical neurodevelopmental stages, a hypofunction occurs in the
     N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors on glutamatergic neurons. This hypofunction results in two downstream
     effects: (1) too much dopamine in the mesolimbic dopamine pathways causing signs of psychosis, and (2)
     hypofunction in the mesocortical dopamine pathway in the prefrontal cortex causing the cognitive and negative
     symptoms of schizophrenia (Steullet et al., 2016). The final theory involves the neurotransmitter serotonin and its
     receptors. Hyperfunction, or too much activity at these receptors, causes the same hyperactivity in the mesolimbic
     dopamine pathway, leading to symptoms of psychosis.

     There are four major dopamine pathways in the brain. These are important to know because the medications used

to treat psychosis impact all four of them and potentially cause side effects:

    · Mesolimbic pathway: This pathway connects the ventral tegmental area in the midbrain to the ventral striatum
        of the basal ganglia in the forebrain. This pathway is responsible for memory, emotions, arousal, and pleasure.
        Increases in dopamine cause psychosis and aggression.

    · Mesocortical pathway: This pathway connects the prefrontal cortex to the ventral tegmentum. It promotes
        higher-order functions, such as cognition, planning, organization, motivation, learning, and social behaviors.
        Decreased dopamine in this pathway can cause adverse symptoms, such as affective flattening, apathy,
        anhedonia, and lack of motivation.

    · Nigrostriatal pathway: This pathway connects the substantia nigra and the basal ganglia. It is involved with
        bodily movement. Decreases in dopamine or neuronal degeneration in this pathway are associated with
        Parkinson disease and extrapyramidal symptoms, such as tardive dyskinesia.

    · Tuberoinfundibular: This pathway connects the hypothalamus with the pituitary gland and manages
        metabolism, temperature control, thirst, digestion, and other endocrine actions. Decreases in dopamine in
        this pathway can cause amenorrhea or galactorrhea.

Symptoms of Schizophrenia

According to the DSM-5, to be diagnosed with schizophrenia, a client must experience at least two of the following
symptoms for most of the time during a one-month period: (1) the presence of delusions, (2) hallucinations, (3)
disorganized speech, (4) disorganized or catatonic behavior, (5) or negative symptoms. One of the two symptoms
must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. Signs of these symptoms must be present continuously
for at least six months, and they cannot result from a medical disorder, another mental health disorder, or a
substance. In addition, those with schizophrenia often experience cognitive deficits, such as memory problems,
attentional shortfalls, and issues with problem-solving.

Defining Psychosis
As defined, psychosis is a severe mental condition where a person loses the ability to recognize reality or has lost
contact with external reality, causing a loss of function and disorganization of personality. Schizophrenia is one type
of psychotic disorder, though psychosis can be caused by medical illnesses, such as brain tumor and
hyperthyroidism; substance misuse; or disorders, such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorders, delusional
disorder, mania, severe depression, and personality disorders. The symptoms of psychosis include one or more of
the following: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking or speech, disorganized behavior, and negative
symptoms.

Positive and Negative Symptoms of Schizophrenia
Active symptoms of schizophrenia include both positive symptoms and negative symptoms. Positive symptoms are
symptoms that are "added" to a person who is nonpsychotic. These include any changes to behaviors or thought
content, consisting of excessive, distorted thoughts and perceptions and the presence of symptoms, including
hallucinations and delusions. Negative symptoms are symptoms that involve the "subtraction" or lessening of
normal functions being "taken away" or are in deficit, such as behaviors that the individual is no longer
demonstrating, including cognitive decline, apathy, anhedonia, and so forth.

Positive Symptoms of Schizophrenia
Positive symptoms of schizophrenia include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts, speech, and
behavior. These are symptoms the disease has "added" to the person. This section will cover some of the most
common positive symptoms of schizophrenia.

A delusion is a fixed false belief that cannot be changed in the mind of those who hold them despite evidence to the
contrary. Delusions can exist as a symptom of schizophrenia or as a symptom of a separate disorder called
delusional disorder, which is discussed in detail in 15.3 Delusional Disorder. There are a number of different types of
delusions experienced by clients who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia.

    · Paranoid delusions, also known as persecutory delusions, are beliefs that the person who holds them is being
        watched, harmed, or stalked.

    · Referential delusions are beliefs that ordinary events have a message or hidden meaning specifically for them.
    · Grandiose delusions or delusions of grandeur are those where the individual believes they have unique gifts,
448  15 · Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder and Other Psychotic Disorders

             are essential, or are influential.
         · Somatic delusions are those that involve bodily functions or health. The individual believes that something is

             wrong with them despite evidence to the contrary.
         · Religious delusions involve faith-based themes. These beliefs are outside normative cultural beliefs and

             usually involve the individual believing they are a supreme being or the devil.
         · Erotomatic delusions feature unfounded assumptions that others are in love with them.
         · Nihilistic delusions are those where the person believes that they have no existence, that life has no meaning,

             or that something catastrophic will happen. These delusions are commonly found in those diagnosed with
             severe depression and paranoid schizophrenia.

     Delusions can be classified further as bizarre or non-bizarre; a bizarre delusion involves fixed false beliefs with
     content that is not reasonably possible in this world. They are strange, eccentric, and unrealistic. An example of a
     bizarre delusion is when an individual believes that an alien has implanted a chip in the person's head, and that their
     parents are speaking to them through the chip. A non-bizarre delusion is a fixed false belief containing content that
     is plausible but inconsistent with evidence. An example of a non-bizarre delusion is one where the individual
     believes that a provider has removed their hymen during a medical procedure (a pap smear) and is insistent that the
     provider put it back. Sometimes it is difficult to discern a non-bizarre delusion from reality, especially if the client
     has experienced significant trauma, torture, political upheaval, or unrest.

     Another common symptom of schizophrenia, a hallucination is the perception of sensory experiences without
     natural external stimuli. Types of hallucinations include auditory, visual, tactile, gustatory, and olfactory. An auditory
     hallucination is the altered perception of hearing in the absence of external stimuli. These hallucinations can be
     single or multiple voices or murmuring. They can include noise, music, or other sounds. A subset, command auditory
     hallucinations direct the individual to do things, like commit violence toward self or others. The person experiencing
     the symptom may or may not heed the command. A visual hallucination is a false sensory experience that is seen.
     They can be people, things, or flashes of light, sometimes in the periphery. A tactile hallucination is a false sensory
     perception involving the sense of touch; something is on the skin, crawling, biting, or touching.

     Having a gustatory hallucination involves a false perception involving taste. It is usually strange or unpleasant
     flavors, such as something metallic. An olfactory hallucination, or phantosmia, is a false sensory experience
     involving the sense of smell.

     These are more commonly caused by head injuries, aging, seizures, and tumors and often involve detecting scents
     not in the person's immediate environment.

     Many people afflicted with schizophrenia exhibit signs of disorganized thoughts, speech, and behavior. Table 15.1
     provides information on these language and behavioral abnormalities and examples.

TABLE 15.1 Language and Behaviors in Schizophrenia (Hitczenko et al., 2021)

Negative Symptoms of Schizophrenia
The negative symptoms of schizophrenia "take away" from normative emotional expression. Negative symptoms
often involve a decrease or absence of motivation, interest, and expression. Two specific and common negative
symptoms include diminished or inappropriate affect and anhedonia. A diminished affect occurs when there is a
decrease in the emotional expression of the client. It can range from restricted to flat, a complete lack of emotional
450  15 · Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder and Other Psychotic Disorders

     expression. Inappropriate affects are emotional expressions incongruous with a current situation, such as crying
     during a comedy or laughing during a sad event, and anhedonia, an inability to feel pleasure. Other negative
     symptoms include poverty of speech (alogia), general apathy, lack of interest in self-care or physical energy, and
     lack of concentration.

     Cognitive Symptoms of Schizophrenia
     Some clients experience cognitive symptoms, deficits in their ability to think or reason. These symptoms can
     include deficits in working memory, such as the ability to do mental math; decision-making capabilities, such as the
     ability to make choices; organization, such as making mental arrangements or coordinating activities; problem-
     solving, such as identifying causes, solutions, and implementing processes; and, finally, the overall ability to process
     information.

     Moreover, some clients may not understand that they are ill or psychotic. When a client is unaware that they are ill
     because of the illness itself, it is called anosognosia. It creates a situation where they often do not engage in
     treatment, leading to nonadherence to medications. Nonadherence to medication results in adverse outcomes, such
     as symptom relapse, repetitive hospitalizations, and interactions with the legal system (involuntary commitments or
     incarceration). Clients who are experiencing paranoia may become aggressive or assaultive, but those with the
     disease are more likely to be victims than aggressors. Table 15.2 summarizes the symptoms of schizophrenia.

        PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Implicit Bias and Psychosis

Implicit bias includes humans' automatic and often unintentional beliefs based on experiences, thoughts, and other
previously learned behaviors. These biases are learned associations or pairings that can occur with human or social
qualities, ethnicities, or gender; they can influence health outcomes. In mental health, provider implicit bias
influences client interactions, treatment decisions, and health outcomes. Some providers have perceived Black and
Latinx clients as less adherent, noncooperative, and as having risky behaviors. As a result, these clients are more
likely to receive a diagnosis of a severe mental illness, such as schizophrenia than their White counterparts. At the
same time, they are less likely than White clients to receive the most effective treatments (Kopera et al., 2015).

Management of implicit bias in nursing starts with education on implicit bias and self-assessment. The National
Institutes of Health offers a free implicit bias course specific to health-care (https://openstax.org/r/77ImplicitBias)
professionals. Additionally, individuals can anonymously assess self-implicit associations through Project Implicit, a
partnership with Harvard University. Through this nonprofit organization, the individual can select an implicit
association test (https://openstax.org/r/77ImplicitAssoc) through the study portal to facilitate self-awareness.

Additional strategies to mitigate bias in the health-care workplace include:

    · identifying and transforming strategies to eliminate norms that perpetuate bias
    · establishing monitoring systems in client outcomes
    · implementing clinical procedures that protect clinicians and nurses from the high cognitive load that can

        perpetuate implicit bias

Stages of Schizophrenia

There are three phases of schizophrenia: prodromal, acute, and recovery. The prodromal phase is when nonspecific
symptoms first appear. Active psychotic symptoms characterize the acute phase. The recovery phase is when the
individual begins to notice symptoms diminishing.

Prodromal Phase
The first phase is the prodromal phase, which occurs before the first signs of psychosis appear. During the
prodromal phase, there is a gradual onset of nonspecific behaviors, such as sleep disturbances, suspiciousness,
decreased attention to activities of daily living, disconnection with peers and family members, depressed mood,
irritability, and problems focusing or understanding. The prodromal phase can last for a few weeks to several years.
Of those diagnosed with schizophrenia, almost 75 percent have expressed prodromal symptoms.

Acute Phase
The second phase is the acute phase, which features active psychotic symptoms. During this phase, clients often
encounter the medical and mental health system of care for the first time. During this phase, the disease is most
visible and clients exhibit both the positive and negative symptoms of psychosis.

     a. protect the friend
     b. remind the client that they are not permitted to assault others
     c. determine whether the client has sustained an injury
     d. ensure that the client will not harm other people

     4. Based on the change in the condition of the client, which of the following actions would be
         Recommended, Not Recommended, or Irrelevant for this client at this time?

     Close observation

     Administer insulin

     Bandage head of client

     Let the mother sit with client

     Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)

     Recovery Phase
     The next stage of the progression is called the recovery or residual phase. During this phase, there is a quieting of
     the symptoms, a diminishing of the active symptoms or "clearing," and more clarity of thought. In this phase,
     additional mood symptoms can emerge, such as depression, as the client considers the impact of the disease on the
     trajectory of their life. Although the residual phase is mainly devoid of active, psychotic symptoms, clients in this
     phase often do report blunted affect, conceptual disorganization, and social withdrawal. The progression or
     continuation in this stage depends on treatment, medication adherence, and determinants of health, such as
     housing, transportation, education, income, access to food, language, health literacy skills, and social support.

     The phases may not be entirely linear. Remember that clients can lapse into another active phase of psychosis at
     any time; most clients with schizophrenia relapse multiple times during their lifetime. Risk factors of relapse include
     nonadherence to medications, substance misuse, another mental health diagnosis, short treatment duration,
     disparities in mental health treatment, and preexisting childhood adversity (Saria et al., 2014).

             REAL RN STORIES

     Nurse: Maria, staff nurse
     Years in Practice: Three
     Clinical Setting: Inpatient adult unit
     Geographic Location: Urban

     A nurse assessed a twenty-one-year-old male who was a musician in a professional marching band. His friends and
     bandmates noticed he was "not himself" and had not been that way for some time. About seven months ago, he
     changed from being outgoing and garrulous to being withdrawn and noncommunicative. He stayed in his room most
     of the day in his bed, refusing to come out for practice or for social time with his best friends. He began to be more
     and more paranoid. When his friends came to his room, he would crack open the door and peer out at them from the
     opening. He would not let them in the room and stopped taking their phone calls. He was not taking care of himself,

going for days without showering. Finally, his employer contacted his parents due to concerns about his behavior; he
had not attended work or practice in weeks.

When his parents arrived at his apartment, he refused to let them in. He told them they were "imposters" and that
"aliens had implanted chips in his head and told him that his parents were not real." On hearing this, his parents
contacted the police, and the client was brought to the hospital for evaluation and treatment. The psychiatric nurse
provider completed an evaluation. The client refused inpatient hospitalization. A petition for commitment was
submitted and completed by an outside provider, which resulted in the client being involuntarily committed to the
facility for psychotic behavior. After admission to the psychiatric unit, the client refused to leave his room. Instead,
he would stare at the nursing staff through the crack in the door.

He told them the "aliens were reporting to him that no one was real." These "aliens" were also telling the client that
he "should not trust anyone" and that he "should escape now!" These hallucinations prompted the client to make
several escape attempts from the unit.

During one of the elopements, the client attempted to jump out of a second-story window after listening to the alien
voices telling him "to jump to escape the imposters." The client refused nursing and medical intervention multiple
times. Finally, staff administered injectable antipsychotic medications. As the client became responsive to the
medications and the psychotic symptoms began to clear, he became more communicative with the nursing staff and
his family. The voices in his head seemed "duller" and less "clear," and he became less paranoid of those around
him. As the client continued his recovery, he noted that he had no memory of the events that led up to and during
the first days of his hospitalization.

Treatment of Schizophrenia

Treatment options for schizophrenia require ongoing assessment and management of active symptoms and how
they manifest and impair daily functioning. Collaboration with the family and/or primary caregivers and mental
health providers is essential in developing the treatment platform. Families can be affected by stigma, stress, grief,
anxiety, and isolation as they navigate the trajectory of the disturbance with their loved ones. Recommendations for
family support groups and family therapy are paired with improved outcomes in those with schizophrenia. Finally,
the inclusion of community-based resources helps clients to optimize treatment outcomes. Treatment for those
with schizophrenia should be client-centered and include a combination of medication and psychosocial
interventions.

Client-Centered Care Approaches
When a client presents for care with a possible diagnosis of schizophrenia, it is essential to take a client-centered
care approach. Client-centered care considers client preferences, health literacy, treatment barriers, cultural
beliefs, and lifestyle when helping clients to make decisions about their health. Determine realistic outcomes and
psychosocial interventions that align with the client's availability of resources and support systems. Clients
diagnosed with schizophrenia have optimal outcomes when they have psychopharmaceutical intervention in
conjunction with nonpharmacological options. Part of determining the best treatment options is to complete a full
assessment inclusive of medical and social history, medication history, family history, and support systems. Safety is
paramount; risk for suicide and violence should be part of every assessment.

Medications
Medications used to treat schizophrenia belong to a class called antipsychotic medications. These medications
generally block dopamine to reduce the positive symptoms of psychosis. Antipsychotics were developed as a
preanesthetic medication in the 1950s, but with further research, the first medication, chlorpromazine, treated
mania effectively, ultimately leading to the first generation of antipsychotic medications.

First-Generation Antipsychotics
After the invention of chlorpromazine, a dopamine and serotonin receptor antagonist, in the 1950s, the first-
generation antipsychotics, or neuroleptics, were introduced into mainstream psychiatry. These medications
included haloperidol, trifluoperazine, thioridazine, and fluphenazine, and their primary function was to block
dopamine (D2) receptors. They also have some actions at histamine, cholinergic, and alpha-adrenergic receptors.
The high-potency medications (haloperidol, trifluoperazine, and fluphenazine) have a high risk for extrapyramidal
454  15 · Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder and Other Psychotic Disorders

     side effects. The low potency medications (chlorpromazine and thioridazine) have significant anticholinergic
     properties, are sedating, and can cause weight gain, but do not cause as many extrapyramidal side effects. Overall,
     any of these first-generation antipsychotics can cause extrapyramidal symptoms, sedation, anticholinergic
     symptoms, prolactin elevation, QT prolongation and potential for sudden death, lowering of the seizure threshold,
     orthostatic hypotension, sexual dysfunction, and metabolic disturbance. They have significant drug/drug
     interactions. Due to the sedating nature of some of these medications, assessment for fall risk is essential,
     especially in vulnerable populations.

     Second-Generation Antipsychotics
     Second-generation antipsychotics entered psychiatric practice in the 1970s with the invention of clozapine. These
     drugs function by antagonizing dopamine and serotonin (2A) receptors. This atypical antipsychotic medication class
     has fewer extrapyramidal symptoms due to their dual actions on dopamine and serotonin receptors. Second-
     generation antipsychotics include aripiprazole, asenapine, brexpiprazole, cariprazine, clozapine, iloperidone,
     lumateperone, lurasidone, olanzapine, paliperidone, pimavanserin, quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone. Like
     their first-generation family members, second-generation antipsychotics also have potential interactions with other
     medications. Table 15.3 summarizes antipsychotic medications.

TABLE 15.3 Antipsychotic Medications (Doyle, 2015)

Medication recommendations depend upon different variables, such as the presence of positive or negative
symptoms, medication efficacy, side effect management, and nonadherence. The first-line choice for managing
positive symptoms is second-generation antipsychotics, except for clozapine due to its risk for neutropenia. The
second line choice is clozapine and first-generation antipsychotics. In acute cases, choices for managing positive
symptoms include first- and second-generation antipsychotics and benzodiazepines. For the treatment of mainly
negative symptoms, second-generation antipsychotics are the first choice, with antidepressants, modafinil, and
clozapine as secondary choices. First-line choices for clients concerned about weight gain include ziprasidone,
lurasidone, and aripiprazole. To enhance sedation, the best choices include quetiapine, clozapine, asenapine, and
olanzapine. First-line choices for clients concerned about sedation include ziprasidone, lurasidone, and aripiprazole.
Finally, for clients who struggle with nonadherence, choose depot forms of both first- and second-generation
antipsychotics (National Library of Medicine, 2016). Depots are long-acting injectable forms of antipsychotic
medications. They promote medication adherence because the drug is injected every two to six months. Table 15.4

TABLE 15.4 Nursing Interventions for Antipsychotic Side Effects (Young et al., 2014)

The blockade of dopamine in the nigrostriatal pathway has the potential to cause movement disorders and side
effects called extrapyramidal side effects (Table 15.5). These can be movement side effects, such as dystonia,
pseudoparkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia, and akathisia, or critical side effects, such as neuroleptic malignant
disturbance, a medical emergency.

     CLINICAL JUDGMENT MEASUREMENT MODEL

     Side Effects: AIMS

     A twenty-three-year-old client has been admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit after spending two days
     waiting on a bed in the emergency department. The client had been experiencing auditory and visual
     hallucinations and delusions that the government has been watching them. The client was irritable and
     aggressive while in the emergency department. They were given several doses of haloperidol 5 mg with 25 mg
     of Benadryl by mouth during their time in the emergency department. Upon arrival to the inpatient unit, the
     client is calm but still experiencing hallucinations. The client was given an additional dose of haloperidol 5 mg
     with another 25 mg of Benadryl. During their one month on inpatient, the client was transferred to risperidone,
     and is now taking 3 mg by mouth at bedtime. One evening, after the nighttime dose of their medication, the
     client approached the nurse complaining that their mouth felt like it was "twitching." Consider these skills in the
     assessment of this client using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) (see Appendix B Abnormal
     Involuntary Movement Scale).

     1. Recognize cues: The RN uses assessment skills to evaluate potential side effects of antipsychotic
     medications, such as extrapyramidal side effects like tardive dyskinesia. Using the AIMS assessment tool, the
     entire examination can be completed in ten minutes by the nurse. There are twelve items on the scale that are
     assessed in various areas of the body.

     The first step in completing the AIMS exam is to monitor the client discreetly while at rest. Then ask if they are
     wearing dentures or mouth fixtures. If so, do they or their teeth hurt the client? Then ask the client to sit with
     their hands on their knees and feet flat on the floor. Observe for movement. Then ask the client to put their
     hands between their knees unsupported. Observe again for movement. Then ask if there is any unusual
     movement in their body. If the answer is yes, ask if the movement is bothersome or interferes with any daily
     activities. Then have the client open their mouth and stick their tongue out twice. Observe any tongue
     movements. Then ask the client to tap their fingers to their thumbs rapidly. Have them do this on both hands.
     Then ask the client to stand. Observe the client in profile and look for any abnormal movements. Then have
     them extend their hands out with palms down. Observe for movement. Then have the client walk back and forth.
     Have them do this twice, observing for abnormal movement. After this is done, complete the AIMS form.

  2. Analyze cues: Analyze any cues to abnormal movements in the body. Are there any mouth or facial
  movements, any in the hands or legs? Is the client aware of these movements, and if so, are they bothersome to
  the client? If it is bothersome to the client, how bothersome? This is also a good time to assess for any other
  extrapyramidal symptoms, such as parkinsonism, dystonia, and akathisias.

  3. Prioritize hypotheses: If there are signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia, identify possible medications
  that could be contributing to the adverse events. While antipsychotics are the most likely culprits, other
  medications have been known to cause the symptoms: antidepressants, antiemetics, and stimulants.

  4. Generate solutions: The intended outcome is reduction in adverse events related to the medication.

  5. Act: Notify provider of assessment details, take vital signs, administer medications as needed, monitor client
  response per agency policy, and evaluate the effects of the medications by reassessing the client one-hour
  postadministration.

  6. Evaluate outcomes: Evaluate the client's response to the medications provided. Assess for worsening of
  symptoms, worsening of side effects, and functional impairment.

Psychosocial Treatments
Psychopharmaceutical treatments are the cornerstone for managing clients with schizophrenia. But the long-term
success for clients also depends on the psychosocial and rehabilitative treatment options available in medical,
nursing, and community settings. Treatment options include social skills training, cognitive remediation, cognitive
behavioral therapy, family therapy, support groups, peer-to-peer counseling, occupational therapy, school and work
assistance programs, and care management. Communication and collaboration between care providers, avoiding
gaps in service delivery, and managing transitions of care are all critical in managing psychosocial treatments for
clients.

Social Skills Training
Clients diagnosed with schizophrenia frequently experience symptoms causing them to struggle socially, often
resulting in stigma and isolation. Social skills training improves social competence by providing skills, such as basic
conversation, medication management, and community reintegration. Social skills interventions have been
influential in reducing mental health symptoms, decreasing repeated hospitalizations, and improving social
outcomes.

Cognitive Remediation
Cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia can result in deficits in processing, attention span, and memory. Cognitive
training or remediation focuses on repetitive exercises designed to reorganize information, aid in learning, and
provide behavioral prompts to assist in memory.

Family Education Groups
These groups focus on two interventions to assist clients, family members, and loved ones of those with
schizophrenia. The first treatment approach emphasizes coping skills related to stress from living with the illness.
The second approach highlights education on the diagnosis, symptoms, interventions, medications, side effects, and
adverse events. Those engaging in family groups and interventions have seen positive outcomes, such as decreased
relapse rates, fewer hospitalizations, and greater adherence to medications.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
Up to half of all clients with schizophrenia experience hallucinations and delusions. Using CBT to treat some of the
positive symptoms of psychosis helps clients to challenge what they are experiencing and restructure what is
happening to them. The cognitive model assumes that life events and experiences mold and shape core beliefs. It
follows then that these beliefs influence everyday automatic thoughts. Automatic thoughts, like delusions and
hallucinations, influence emotions, behaviors, and physiological responses. Therefore, the goal for CBT with respect
to hallucinations and delusions is to facilitate a scenario with the client where they can challenge what they are
experiencing:

"Is this a symptom, or is this actually happening to me?"

             REAL RN STORIES

     Nurse: Pam, advanced practice psychiatric nurse practitioner
     Years in Practice: Ten
     Clinical Setting: Outpatient treatment facility
     Geographic Location: Southeast United States

     I was an advanced practice psychiatric nurse practitioner with ten years of experience and certified in CBT. I was
     doing a psychotherapy session with a client in the recovery stage of schizophrenia. The client was experiencing
     delusions that "people were looking at her and talking about her all the time." This occurred daily as she went about
     managing her tasks in the community.

     During the session, the client mentioned that she was walking to her therapy session and noticed a person who
     walked by her. She had a thought that he was "talking on the phone about her." I asked the client if we could use this
     for their therapy session today, and the client said we could. I asked to identify what evidence, if any, that the
     person was talking about her. The client could not name any. I then asked to identify evidence that the person was
     not talking about her. The client then came up with several facts or scenarios as to why he was not talking about her.

     I then asked her: What is more likely to be true?

       A. The thoughts that you are having are symptoms of your illness.
       B. The person was talking about you.

     The client could use the evidence to identify that the thoughts were part of her symptoms. She was then able to use
     this method daily to challenge her delusions when walking in public.

     Nursing Care for a Client Suffering from Schizophrenia

     Nurses should develop a plan of care that is in accord with the client, their family, and other caretakers and that is
     relevant and culturally appropriate. It should involve evidence-based medical and psychosocial interventions that
     will assist the client in meeting their treatment goals in the least restrictive environment.

     Nursing Assessment
     Nursing interventions for those with schizophrenia begin with an assessment. For those experiencing psychosis,
     crowded, noisy, bright rooms can be very distracting during an interaction. Ensure that the assessment is done in a
     quiet room, with soft lighting, without interruptions. Allow access to the door for egress for both the nurse and the
     client, even if safety is not a concern.

     Ensure the safety of self and client. If the client is acting aggressively, use a soft, soothing voice, move slowly, and
     approach with hands in front and palms open (Table 15.6). Ask one question at a time, and allow the client time to
     answer questions. Observe their behavior. Are they looking at the interviewer or like they are responding to internal
     stimuli (hallucinations)? If they look like they are hallucinating, ask them if they see or hear things other than the
     interviewer's voice. Have them describe what they see or hear. If the hallucinations are command in nature, ask
     about the content and keep them from acting on those commands. Assess for suicidal or homicidal content. Ask the
     client about delusions. Do not challenge their beliefs, but explore the nature of any expressed delusion. Assess any
     risk to self or others that may accompany the delusional thoughts.

Nursing Clinical Judgment
The goal for the client with schizophrenia is to maintain stability through adherence to medications, continued
interaction with health-care providers, mitigation of adverse reactions and side effects, optimal nutritional status,
and social and occupational functioning. The nursing clinical judgment measurement model assists the nurse in
formulating clinical decisions based on critical thinking through client presentations to achieve optimal client
outcomes. To prioritize clinical judgment, consider differing treatment and outcome goals through acute and
maintenance phases of schizophrenia.

Treatment and Outcome Goals
The client and the health-care team should identify realistic short- and long-term treatment goals. These can
include taking medication as directed; mitigating side effects and adverse events associated with drugs; reducing
positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms; improving self-care deficits; improving social/occupational/educational
functioning; and engaging in therapeutic modalities. Each stage of schizophrenia will have different outcome goals
that require attention.

Outcomes Identification for the Acute Phase
Priority goals for clients in the acute phase of the illness include decreasing psychotic symptoms and maintaining
the client's and others' safety. Utilize internal safety protocols to maintain a safe environment for both the client and
staff. Use the least restrictive measures when managing aggression in violent and paranoid clients, and continuously
assess and document carefully after any hands-on interventions. Other treatment goals in the acute phase include
medication adherence, minimizing side effects and adverse effects of medications, establishing trust, and
transitioning to lower levels of care in the community.

Outcomes for Stabilization and Maintenance Phase
During the stabilization and maintenance phases, preservation of stability and reestablishment into the community
are optimal goals for outcomes. This is done through connecting the client with community resources, pharmacy
assistance programs, crisis intervention and assertive community treatment teams (ACT), social workers, case
managers, faith-based organizations, and the Schizophrenia and Psychosis Action (https://openstax.org/r/
77SchizPsyAssoc) Alliance, an organization for support, advocacy, and research. Best nursing outcomes are specific,
measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). Other outcomes include mitigating side effects,
ensuring medication adherence, coping with diagnosis/symptoms, and managing stigma.

Implementation of Nursing Care
After assessment and setting treatment measures to meet goals, it is time to implement nursing care.
Implementation strategies during the acute phase include:
464  15 · Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder and Other Psychotic Disorders

         · ensuring the least restrictive care environment and its safety, management of the safety of the client and
             others

         · mitigating risks if present
         · completing safety checks in the milieu and per unit safety protocols
         · monitoring for changes to mental status, medication adherence, side effects, the effectiveness of medication

             management; and client data, such as vital signs, intake and output, and height and weight

     Implementation during the stabilization and maintenance phase includes:

         · safe transfers of care
         · communication with other health-care providers
         · transfer of health records according to HIPAA requirements
         · coordination with other community care providers
         · facilitating the use of cognitive interventions with clients to help challenge residual hallucinations
         · establishing therapeutic communication and trust with clients experiencing delusions and then helping the

             client to focus on reality-based themes
         · working with family, friends, and other supportive caregivers to develop a relapse prevention plan
         · working with the client to identify warning signs of psychosis, stressors, side effects, or behaviors that lead to

             medication nonadherence, and things to do and people to call when concerned about relapse or safety

     Implementation of treatment during this phase also includes family education about resources, medication, side
     effects, health, diet, and exercise. There are a number of issues pertaining to the recovery of the client that have to
     be shared with the client and the family. The information for the client relates to their personal recovery and ability
     to remain healthy. The information shared with the family is in the form of explaining the condition to them and
     giving advice on how to support the client and maintain their role within the family (Table 15.7).

     TABLE 15.7 Client and Family Education (Habibi et al., 2015)

     One notable type of philosophy for care of those diagnosed with schizophrenia is a therapeutic milieu, which is a
     holistic, safe, and structured environment that helps facilitate emotional well-being and recovery. The idea behind
     milieu therapy is that the environment affects how one feels or thinks. The optimal milieu therapy for an individual
     experiencing psychotic symptoms is a quiet, safe, and nonthreatening one. The milieu will help reduce aggression
     and violence in those with schizophrenia. Specific components of milieu therapy to support the client with psychosis
     include:

     · Structure: Ensure predictable times, places, appointments, and schedules. Ensure that the client is in the
        same room, receives meals and medications in the same place, and has uninterrupted morning and evening
        routines.

     · Containment: The client is maintained on specific safety protocols and levels according to their current level of
        risk. This limits access to things considered a risk to self-harm or harm to others. Communicate these
        limitations clearly and consistently to everyone on the treatment team, including the client and family

        members.
    · Safety: The milieu must be safe for clients and staff. Ensure that it is emotionally safe by projecting empathy

        and consistency with staff.
    · Flexibility: A healthy milieu is adaptable and supportive, not rigid or controlling.
    · Socialization: The milieu provides an opportunity to apply social skills and to have others reciprocate.

A highly functioning milieu will help accelerate recovery from the psychotic process, establish trust, and develop
social skills and communication with others. In addition, it will help to build a sense of safety and security and
provide a supportive environment for the client to build new psychosocial skills. The nurse's role is to manage the
milieu, set and enforce healthy boundaries, establish routines, and provide a supportive environment.

        CLINICAL SAFETY AND PROCEDURES (QSEN)

Safety During and After the Restraint

Definition: Minimizes risk of harm to clients and providers through both system effectiveness and individual
performance (QSEN Institute, n.d.).

A psychiatric RN was involved in a behavioral restraint with a male client who attacked a staff member with the leg
of a chair. The client was diagnosed with a psychotic disorder; the etiology had yet to be determined. The least
restrictive interventions were not successful, including the option to take oral medications. Orders were given for
restraint by the provider. A five-person team gathered, and the client was placed in four-point restraints in the room
designated for that purpose. The client was given an injection of olanzapine 10 mg in the right buttock. The restraint
room has a video camera, but the RN sat one to one with the client as per protocol. The RN documented information
about what led up to the restraint, including all least restrictive efforts employed. As soon as the client was placed
into restraints, vital signs were assessed along with neurovascular status on all four extremities. After seven
minutes, the client became calm. One arm was released without incident. Vital signs and neurovascular status were
assessed every fifteen minutes and they were allowed to use the restroom if needed. The client was monitored for
pressure ulcers and signs and symptoms of rhabdomyolysis (muscle cramps, aches, or dark urine). Once the client
was released from the restraints, vital signs were repeated, and a mental status evaluation was done. Assessments
were documented on the standardized form used by the facility as per protocol. The client was continuously
monitored for the remainder of the day. The staff completed a debrief that included evaluation of the situation,
performance, and adherence to training requirements.

Evaluation of Nursing Care
Evaluating the effectiveness of treatment and the progression toward recovery is integral in client-centered care.
This involves gathering information from all stages of care, and all sources of care and communicating the
information with all care providers and team members, including the client, their family, and other care providers.
Nurses should evaluate the following after implementing treatment for clients with schizophrenia:

    · reduction of harm to clients and staff during restraints
    · integration of safety practices that reduce harm to clients (medication reconciliation, five rights, falls

        prevention)
    · assessment for risk of violence and suicide using evidenced-based tools
    · assessment and monitoring of side effects and adverse events of psychotropic medications
    · identification of client preferences, health literacy, and other client-centered outcomes in client records
    · promotion and documentation of "warm handoffs" and communication between providers, systems, and

        clients during care transitions; warm handoffs are communications (over the phone or in person) between
        providers when a care transfer occurs
    · involvement of case management services, social work, and other community transition services to ensure
        recovery-oriented practices (Mayo Clinic, 2020)

     15.2 Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Recall the different types of schizophrenia spectrum disorders
         · Outline evidence-based approaches to treating and caring for a client with a schizophrenia spectrum

             disorder

     Schizophrenia is a disturbance that includes positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms in those who have
     expressed them for over six months. Several other disorders, though resembling schizophrenia symptomatically, do
     not quite meet this criterion. This section reviews these disorders, how they differ from schizophrenia, and their
     management.

     Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders

     Psychotic disorders include brief psychotic disorder, substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder, psychotic
     disorder due to a medical condition, schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and catatonia.
     Schizophrenia spectrum disorders are other psychotic disorders that share similar symptoms with schizophrenia:
     delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking or speech, disorganized behavior, and negative symptoms. The three
     schizophrenia disorders are schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and schizophrenia.

     Schizotypal personality disorder is considered on the spectrum for schizophrenia spectrum disorders, but it is a
     personality disorder. Those with schizotypal personality disorder have shared genetic and neuropsychiatric
     commonalities with schizophrenia; a small number of those diagnosed with the disorder do go on to develop
     schizophrenia. More information on schizotypal personality disorder can be found in Personality Disorders.
     Schizophrenia is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that providers rule out medical, substances, and all other causes
     for psychotic behaviors before diagnosing schizophrenia. This next section will discuss the diagnostic criteria and
     treatments for schizophrenia spectrum disorders (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2022).

     Brief Psychotic Disorder
     Brief psychotic disorder is the presence of psychotic symptoms for one day and less than one month. Symptoms
     include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, or disorganized behavior. At least one of the symptoms must
     be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech to qualify for the disorder. These symptoms cannot be caused
     by any other mental health disorder or by a substance. In some cases, there can be a clearly defined precipitating
     stressor for psychotic symptoms, such as a peripartum onset; in other cases, there is not. The brief psychotic
     disorder accounts for 2 to 7 percent of psychotic presentations globally. It can be present across the lifespan but
     usually occurs in late teens or early adulthood. Despite the symptoms lasting less than a month, almost half of those
     diagnosed with brief psychotic disorder experience another psychotic episode (APA, 2022).

     Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder
     A substance or medication-induced psychotic disorder is the presence of hallucinations or delusions soon after use,
     intoxication, withdrawal, or exposure to a substance or medication. These symptoms cannot occur during a delirium
     (a transient state of altered consciousness due to a medical condition or substance) and the substance must be
     capable of producing the psychotic effect. Substances known to cause these effects include alcohol, cannabis,
     phencyclidine, hallucinogens, inhalants, sedatives, hypnotics, anxiolytics, stimulants, cocaine, toxins, insecticides,
     and fuel or paint. Medications known to cause these effects include anesthetics, anticholinergics, cardiovascular
     drugs, antiparkinsonian medications, and muscle relaxants. The symptoms can present differently depending on the
     substance, medication, or toxin. The symptoms may abate immediately or persist, even to the point of a later
     diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder.

     Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition
     Psychotic disorder due to a medical condition is more prevalent in older age groups due to comorbid medical
     conditions that are more common later in life. Causative conditions affiliated with this disturbance include
     neurological (head injury, neoplasms, cerebrovascular accidents, epilepsy), hypo and hyper thyroid, hypoxia,
     hypercarbia, hypoglycemia, hepatic insufficiency, renal insufficiency, infection, and fluid or electrolyte imbalances.
     The diagnostic criteria are the presence of hallucinations or delusions as the direct consequence of a medical
     condition. The symptoms cannot be due to a mental health disorder or substance. The course of the symptoms

     Access for free at openstax.org
15.2 · Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders                                                                                        467

depends on the course of the medical illness or disease. Once the client has managed the underlying condition, the
psychotic symptoms will resolve.

Schizophreniform Disorder
Consider the timeline of symptoms that falls between brief psychotic disorder and schizophrenia; this is
schizophreniform disorder. The diagnostic criterion for this disorder is the presence of delusions, hallucinations,
disorganized speech, disorganized behavior, and negative symptoms for at least one month but less than six
months. At least one of the symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The symptoms
cannot be attributed to a substance or a medical condition. The course of the illness is dependent on whether the
client continues to experience symptoms or they remit. If the symptoms continue, the diagnosis may evolve to a
diagnosis of schizophrenia.

Schizoaffective Disorder
Schizoaffective disorder is the presence of a mood disorder, either a major depressive disorder, a manic episode or
bipolar disorder, in conjunction with the symptoms for schizophrenia. The client must have six months of symptoms
to meet the diagnosis of schizophrenia. They then either have a major depressive episode or a manic episode during
that same six months. A depressive episode means a sad mood, decreased energy/motivation, guilt, decreased/
increased appetite, insomnia/hypersomnia, anhedonia, and/or suicidal thoughts for at least two weeks. A manic
episode is characterized by the presence of an elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, pressured speech/
talkative, flight of ideas, distractibility, increase in goal-directed activity, and increase in risky behaviors for at least
one week. During the remission of the mood episode, the client must continue to experience psychotic symptoms
(delusions or hallucinations) for at least two weeks, and a substance, another mental health condition, or a medical
condition cannot bring on the symptoms. Males and females equally express the bipolar subtype, while females are
twice as likely to express the depressive subtype.

        REAL RN STORIES

Nurse: George W., RN
Years in Practice: Ten
Clinical Setting: Crisis Intervention Unit
Geographic Location: Mississippi

I was a psychiatric nurse working for about ten years as a nurse generalist. A client was admitted to the inpatient
unit for psychotic behavior and aggression. The client was a 310-pound male champion weightlifter. He abused
weight loss supplements for six months to boost his performance. These supplements included ephedra, yohimbe,
and phentermine. Mostly calm throughout the day, the client would randomly and unexpectedly go into confused
rages and throw another client against the wall, accusing them of "getting into my head and talking about me!" After
these episodes, the client would pace, take off his clothes, and mumble to himself. The client took haloperidol for
these outbursts, and his routine medication was a second-generation antipsychotic. Despite these two medications,
the client was unable to settle or sleep. It was not until the addition of chlorpromazine that the client could sleep at
night and the violent outbursts subsided.

One day, as I was standing behind the desk, the client approached me. This was right after the client had assaulted
another client on the unit. The client was calm and smiling. He looked at me and asked me if he could hug me. I told
him that it would not be a good idea. He insisted that he come and hug me. I again said to him that it was not a good
idea. I could see out of the corner of my eyes, the male staff getting nervous about the potential for another assault,
this time on a female staff member. The client said, "I am going to come hug you." I decided to make myself very
calm and took a nonthreatening stance as he moved his massive frame around the desk to me. He hugged me and
then left. There was a collective sigh of relief as he moved away, and we did not have to engage in a potentially
dangerous client redirection.

Catatonia
Catatonia is a disturbance caused by neurotransmitter signal disruptions manifesting as motor, affective, and
cognitive symptoms. It can happen in the context of another mental health disorder, such as schizophrenia
468  15 · Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder and Other Psychotic Disorders

     spectrum disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, or a medical condition. It stems from neurodevelopmental, mental
     health, and medical disorders. Twelve types of behaviors are part of the diagnostic criteria for catatonia, and they
     are divided into three subtypes (Healthline, 2024b):

         · retarded, which entails mutism, inhibited movement, posturing, rigidity, negativism, and staring
         · malignant, characterized by fever, autonomic instability, delirium, and rigidity
         · excited, which looks like excessive motor activity, stereotypy, impulsivity, and combativeness

     Malignant catatonia can be life-threatening and usually warrants admission to the intensive care unit for treatment
     and monitoring. The diagnostic criteria include the presence of three of the clinical symptoms of catatonia (Table
     15.8). These symptoms resolve with the management of the underlying psychiatric or medical condition. Most
     evidence-based treatment recommends using either benzodiazepines or ECT to manage catatonia. It is important to
     know the symptoms of catatonia because the nurse needs to be able to recognize them, although they might not be
     seen very often or could be mistaken for the symptoms of another condition. Table 15.8 outlines the full range of
     symptoms that might be experienced by a client with catatonia.

     Symptom                          Description

     Stupor                           No motor activity, not relating to the environment

     Catalepsy                        Passive induction of a posture held against gravity

     Waxy flexibility Positioning by examiner held by client

     Mutism                           Little or no verbal response

     Negativism                       Opposition to or no response to instructions or external stimulus

     Mannerism                        Acting out mannerisms in an odd way

     Posturing                        Spontaneous and active maintenance of posture against gravity

     Stereotypy                       Repetitive, frequent, non-goal directed movements

     Agitation                        Excited or irritable

     Grimacing                        Of the facial features

     Echolalia                        Mimicking other's speech

     Echopraxia                       Mimicking other's movements

     TABLE 15.8 Symptoms of Catatonia

     Evidenced-Based Approaches to Treatment for Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders

     The approaches to treatment of those with schizophrenia spectrum disorders are similar to those of schizophrenia.
     Medication includes the use of first- and second-generation antipsychotics. Adding mood stabilizers and
     antidepressants to paliperidone (the only second-generation antipsychotic FDA-approved for schizoaffective
     disorder) sometimes helps minimize the symptoms of depression and mania seen in schizoaffective disorder. For
     conditions resulting from substance use, medications, or medical disturbances, psychotic symptoms resolve when
     the underlying causes have been treated. Treatment for catatonia entails first stopping any offending agent and
     treating the underlying disorder, be it bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder, or psychotic depression. First-line
     treatments for catatonia include benzodiazepines or electroconvulsive therapy depending upon the type of
     catatonia and severity of presentation. Nursing care involves monitoring clients with malignant catatonia for

hyperthermia, hypertension, and lethal arrhythmias. Avoid dopaminergic-blocking drugs in those with catatonia,
including antipsychotic medications. They are contraindicated in clients with malignant catatonia.

Psychosocial approaches to managing spectrum disorders are also similar to those that are effective for clients with
schizophrenia. These treatments include psychosocial therapy, family therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and
social skills training for those with longer-standing disturbances. Successful outcomes rely upon medication
adherence, successful transition from higher levels of care to community care models, and integration into social,
educational, and occupational functioning.

Nursing treatments for those with catatonia must first consider symptoms, vital signs, fluid intake and output,
cardiopulmonary status, and nutrition. For clients with limited movement, managing skin integrity is critical to
decreasing the incidence of pressure ulcers. This includes passive range of motion exercises to decrease the
potential for muscle contractures.

Clients with excited catatonia and excessive motor activity require the least restrictive interventions to mitigate risk
of injury. Interventions that reduce environmental stimuli may be the most effective management strategies for
aggressive behaviors.

15.3 Delusional Disorder

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Define and understand the diagnosis of delusional disorder
    · Outline the common types of delusions experienced in delusional disorder
    · Recall the treatment approaches used in delusional disorder

Although there are some similarities, delusional disorder differs from schizophrenia because diagnosis only requires
the presence of delusions and none of the other earmarks of psychosis. Those with delusional disorder may not be
impaired like those with other psychoses. This section will focus on delusional disorder, the different types,
treatments, and complications.

Defining and Diagnosing Delusional Disorder

Delusions are fixed false beliefs based on inaccurate judgment of an external reality. Delusional disorder is
characterized by clients having one or more non-bizarre delusions that have lasted for one month or more. These
clients do not appear functionally impaired other than by the ramifications of the delusion(s). Those with delusional
disorders often present with other mental health disorders, most commonly depression and anxiety. The delusions
cannot result from a medical or known substance or medication. In other words, delusional symptoms caused by
medical illnesses or diseases do not constitute delusional disorders.

Diagnosing delusional disorder can be complex. These clients usually function well when focused on something
other than the delusion. When focused on the delusion, however, they will spend significant and sometimes
inordinate amounts of time attempting to accrue evidence or align others with their beliefs. Individuals suffering
from this disorder may contact health-care professionals, attorneys, private detectives, the police, and even the
court system to confirm their beliefs. They do not have insight into their delusion. Attempts to dissuade them from
their delusion will likely result in a negative response by the client, including hostility and aggression. The best way
to determine the presence of the disorder is to assess the validity of their claim. Rule out any medical cause and
differentiate the delusional disorder from another mental health disorder. For instance, suppose a client claims to
have bugs in their urine (delusional parasitosis). The diagnostic assessment entails obtaining copies of the client's
medical records, collecting collateral information from family members, physical examination and labs, ascertaining
if the client has taken any other medications or substances, and communicating with the providers they have seen
over the past several years (Healthline, 2024a).

Prevalence, Risk, Causes, and Course of Delusional Disorder
The risk of delusional disorder is small, 0.05 to 0.1 percent in population-based studies. Risk factors include family
members with schizotypal personality disorder and schizophrenia (Jadhav et al., 2014). The age of onset is between
thirty-five and forty-five years but can range between eighteen and eighty years. The cause of delusional disorders is
unknown. There is evidence that dysfunction in dopamine neurotransmitter functioning may play a role, along with
470  15 · Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder and Other Psychotic Disorders

     medial/frontal and anterior cingulate cortex brain abnormalities. The disorder can emerge suddenly or gradually. For
     example, an acute onset might happen as a part of a stressful event. The course of the illness is relatively stable and
     chronic. When considering this diagnosis, consider normative cultural beliefs; Western cultures may misdiagnose
     some traditional and faith-based beliefs as delusional behavior.

             CULTURAL CONTEXT

     Kufungisisia

     Stress is expressed differently from the lens of varying cultural frames. To ensure that these concepts of distress are
     conceptualized from these perspectives, it is essential to frame these experiences as the client experiences them. A
     Shona concept is kunfungisisa or "thinking too much," and can be a precursor to anxiety, depression, and somatic
     complaints ("My heart hurts"). This is prominent in the Shurugi district in Zimbabwe. It is a perseverative process
     focusing on bodily symptoms, including aches, lack of appetite, and sleeplessness. The symptoms can also include
     anxiety, depression, panic, anger, hallucinations, suicidal thoughts, and substance misuse. Recognition of the
     concept is imperative. It is a sign of stress and anxiety, not a somatic delusion. Nursing interventions focus on the
     recognition of the cultural concept of distress and the implementation of culturally appropriate care, such as faith-
     based spiritual and community support and potential medication management for anxiety and or depression.

     (Patel et al., 1995)

     Those who suffer from delusional disorder have good outcomes when treated. If not treated, several adverse
     outcomes can result from behaviors related to the delusions.

     Social Isolation
     Paranoia can make someone feel alone; other people do not understand or may feel threatened by the person with
     the delusions. Interactions with other individuals may cause their delusions or moods to worsen. They may become
     irritable, threatening, or volatile. In such cases, social isolation might result from others staying away or the
     individuals protecting themselves from others. Social isolation might serve to maintain or further aggravate the
     delusions.

     Depression and Self-Harm
     Social isolation and mistrust can lead to mood symptoms, such as depression, creating a cycle. The symptoms of
     depression--no energy, no motivation, anhedonia, guilt, sad mood, irritability, problems sleeping, and suicidal
     thoughts--can worsen this social isolation by increasing the need to stay at home. Additionally, those suffering from
     certain delusions can engage in self-harming behaviors. For instance, a client with delusional parasitosis or a belief
     that their body is infested may scratch themselves repeatedly to rid themselves of the infestation. Assessment of
     those with those beliefs for self-harming behaviors is essential in ensuring their health and well-being.

     Legal
     The intersectionality between mental health and the legal system is involved when commitment is a concern
     (danger to self, others, or gravely disabled), when there is a question regarding the capacity to participate in their
     defense during criminal cases, and if there was diminished capacity when committing a crime. In general, those
     suffering from mental illness are overrepresented in the criminal justice system. Substance Abuse and Mental
     Health Services Administration (SAMHSA, 2022) estimates 18 percent of the general population have a mental
     illness, though 37 to 44 percent of incarcerated individuals have a mental illness.

     Those suffering from erotomaniac, jealous, and persecutory delusions, for instance, can become involved in the
     legal system if they stalk their object of desire, cross boundaries, or attempt to harm others. The nursing role in
     forensic settings is to provide safety and security for the client while providing nonjudgmental care and maintaining
     appropriate boundaries (Dhaliwal & Hirst, 2016).

     Common Types of Delusions

     Delusional disorder usually involves non-bizarre delusions but can have bizarre content. The types of delusions and
     subtypes include erotomaniac, grandiose, jealous, persecutory, and somatic.

15.3 · Delusional Disorder                                                                                                471

Erotomaniac
Erotomaniac delusions involve thoughts of an idealized love between the client and another individual. They usually
involve a celebrity or someone who they have never met before. The person affected by the delusion might attempt
to connect with or communicate with the celebrity. The belief usually starts with an initial encounter and develops
over time as the feelings grow, and the delusion becomes set. These beliefs might lead to stalking or assaultive
behaviors, resulting in involvement with the legal system. Celebrities with delusional stalkers include Rihanna,
Madonna, Selena Gomez, and Taylor Swift. The stalking behaviors resulted in arrests, probations, home relocations
by the celebrities, and restraining orders. The individuals affected by these delusions are often vulnerable, isolated,
sexually repressed, and have poor social skills (Seeman, 2016).

Grandiose
Grandiose delusions involve the idea that the individual has done something great or is someone extraordinary.
These beliefs might include that they have great wealth, they have power or influence, they are a world-renowned
scientist or novelist, or they are greatly admired. This differs from the grandiosity of mania because the mood
symptoms affiliated with mania are not present with the delusion. Clients with delusional disorder, grandiose type,
are rare and may present as a comorbidity with a psychotic or mood process (Healthline, 2024a).

Jealous
Jealous delusions are when the individual believes their partner or spouse is cheating on them or will cheat despite
evidence to the contrary. Delusionary beliefs of the jealous type can lead to dangerous behaviors, including harm to
the partner.

Persecutory
Persecutory or paranoid delusions involve the central theme that people are out to get them. They are the most
prevalent of the delusional disorder subtypes. Those suffering from persecutory delusions believe they are being
watched, harassed, or obstructed. Anxiety and worry have a significant role in the mechanism of these types of
delusions (Startup et al., 2016) and can be a target for psychological intervention. These individuals may also
present themselves as irritable or aggressive, guarded, suspicious, or isolative. These individuals may believe that
others are trying to hurt them, poison them, spy on them, or acting against them. They often socially isolate, live
away from others, and do not interact with others. Additionally, they may involve the legal system to get justice for
the wrongs they believe have been done to them.

Somatic
Somatic or "of the body" delusions involve health, bodily symptoms, or undiagnosed disease. Onset is either acute
or gradual, unremitting; these clients usually do not receive mental health care. When they do, they typically present
first in infectious disease, medical, or dental clinics and are referred to mental health as a consultant. Delusional
parasitosis is a type of somatic delusion where the individual believes they are infected with insects or parasites, for
instance. Those with delusional parasitosis often present with comorbid psychiatric illnesses, such as depression,
substance misuse, and anxiety. The clients will usually claim that they have extensive knowledge of their infestation
and that their family members have been exposed or affected; they may bring a sample of their infestation and may
experience formication, a hallucination that bugs are crawling on the skin (Campbell et al., 2019).

        REAL RN STORIES

Nurse: Pam, advanced practice psychiatric nurse
Years in Practice: Twelve
Clinical Setting: Outpatient mental health facility
Geographic Location: Community, rural

I was an advanced practice psychiatric nurse and received a referral from an infectious disease clinic. The client
arrived with a cup of urine in their hands. The client stated, "I have a leishmaniasis infection. Look at my urine." The
client had traveled to Australia and came home with symptoms of urinary frequency and burning. They had a friend
who traveled to Central America and came home to find that they had the infection; the friend received significant
treatment afterward. The client was convinced that they now had the same infection. After receiving word from the
472  15 · Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder and Other Psychotic Disorders

     infectious disease clinic that leishmaniasis is not endemic to Australia and that the client had a simple urinary tract
     infection remedied by antibiotics, the client was not convinced. They went to another infectious disease clinic and
     were told the same thing. The client has been to several providers and clinics, insisting they suffered from the
     infection. The client was now being evaluated by me today as a referral from the last infectious disease clinic.

     I first spent time developing trust and therapeutic alliance with the client. I did not challenge the delusions and
     encouraged the client to engage in medication therapy after a few sessions. The client was initiated on a second-
     generation antipsychotic and a serotonin reuptake inhibitor for their comorbid anxiety disorder (OCD). After eight
     weeks on the medication, the client reported to me that they no longer needed "to see someone for their
     leishmaniasis. I am cured."

     Treatment of Delusional Disorder

     The initial step to treating delusional disorder is establishing therapeutic rapport and trust. These clients need to
     feel validated and engaged in their treatment through empathy and understanding. It is crucial to align treatment
     decisions with the client, including their support system, to facilitate adherence to treatment. Medical and
     psychosocial interventions follow the establishment of the trusting therapeutic relationship.

     Medications
     Clients with delusional disorder often do not have insight into their illness. It is not easy to come to agreement on
     first-line treatments when the client disagrees that they have a psychotic disorder. The first step is to give the client
     space and time to consider the diagnosis; sit with it, take time to understand it, and allow themselves to become
     comfortable with it. Educating the client when they are calm and open to information is the best approach to
     medication adherence and optimal outcomes. Overall, second-generation antipsychotics are the first choice in
     medications used to treat delusional disorders. Risperidone (Risperdal) is the medication most frequently cited in
     case studies with olanzapine (Zyprexa) and quetiapine (Seroquel) as second and third choices. Other medications
     used in delusional disorders are SSRIs and SNRIs in combination with second-generation antipsychotics. This
     combination assists with depression and anxiety, often seen in those with delusional disorder. For those clients who
     struggle with nonadherence to medication, long-acting injectables (LAI) have also been useful (Jalali Roudsari et al.,
     2015).

     Psychosocial Approaches to Treatment
     If the client is not willing or does not have the insight into their illness to take medications, adjunctive
     psychotherapy is the other option. The best outcomes for individuals with delusional disorder have been with
     cognitive behavioral therapy aimed at identifying the evidence, challenging the delusions, and targeting comorbid
     anxiety and depression. A clinical example of cognitive therapy for delusional disorder is the Thinking Well
     Intervention. This therapy involves having the client slow down their thinking, look for more evidence, generate
     alternative explanations and thoughts rather than delusions, find other ways to think about more logical and less
     distressing things, and then consider how their thinking affects their mood. This type of intervention has been
     effective in generating positive outcomes for distress in those with paranoid delusions (Waller et al., 2015).
     Supportive psychotherapy helps clients work through their experiences with the disorder, provides a framework for
     coping skills, and eases emotional distress.

Summary

15.1 Schizophrenia

Schizophrenia is a disorder usually beginning when a person is in their late teens or early twenties. The etiology of
the condition is unknown, although there are a range of theoretical perspectives, and it is thought to involve
neurotransmitter signal disruption. The client can pass through acute, stabilization, and maintenance phases when
experiencing the disorder. There is no one characteristic for schizophrenia, but clients can experience symptoms
such as delusions, hallucinations (usually auditory), incoherence, catatonic or hyperactive behavior, and flat effect.
Symptoms are categorized as being positive and negative. Treatment is often dependent on medications that can
have serious side effects, with psychosocial techniques also being used to help the client return to their role in
society.

15.2 Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders

Schizophrenia spectrum disorders include schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, brief psychotic
disorder, medication and substance-induced psychotic disorder, catatonia, and psychotic disorder due to another
medical condition. The key to understanding the differences between these disorders is the timing and duration of
symptoms and precipitating events. Treatment for most of them include removing offending agents, treating the
underlying condition, and managing psychosis with second-generation antipsychotic medications, therapy, and
psychosocial techniques.

15.3 Delusional Disorder

Delusional disorders differ from other psychotic disorders because the clients may not appear to be functionally
impaired. Types of delusions include jealous, somatic, grandiose, erotomaniac, and persecutory. Treatments for
delusional disorders remain relatively unaltered from treatments for clients with schizophrenia. Clients are offered
medication management in conjunction with psychosocial therapy, family therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and
consultation and collaboration with general health providers and legal professionals in some cases. Successful
outcomes depend on medication adherence, decreased behaviors involving the legal system, and continued
communication with other health-care and team members.

CHAPTER OUTLINE
16.1 Depressive Disorders
16.2 The Spectrum of Mood Disorders
16.3 Self-Harm and Suicide
16.4 Bipolar Disorders

INTRODUCTION Health-care professionals will come in contact with clients who have been diagnosed with a
variety of mental health conditions, including mood disorders. Normal mood variations are transient and can be
linked to specific events or circumstances, such as feeling elated after receiving good news or feeling sad after a
disappointment. These feelings usually do not impair daily functioning and are generally short-lived (American
Psychiatric Association, 2022). A mood disorder, on the other hand, involves disturbances in a person's emotional
state that are intense, long-lasting, and not necessarily tied to any specific event or situation. These disturbances
can significantly impair a person's ability to function socially, occupationally, or academically (American Psychiatric
Association, 2022).
In recent years, there has been increasing recognition and discussion of a spectrum approach to understanding
mood disorders. This perspective suggests that mood disorders exist on a continuum. According to this perspective,
mood disorders are not discrete, isolated conditions but feature a range of overlapping symptoms, severity, and
functional impairments (Paris, 2014). This model suggests that clients may not neatly fit into the traditional
categories as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. For example, some individuals
may experience symptoms that do not meet the full criteria for a depressive disorder but still suffer significant
480  16 · Mood Disorders and Suicide

     distress or impairment in daily functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 2022).

     Nursing care is crucial in treating and managing mood disorders. Nurses play a vital role in monitoring clients'
     responses to treatment, managing side effects, providing client and family education, and offering emotional
     support. It is essential to remember that these disorders are typically chronic, requiring ongoing care and
     management.

     16.1 Depressive Disorders

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe the spectrum and presentations of mood disorders
         · Explain the approaches for treating mood disorders

     Mood disorders comprise a category of mental health conditions with significant disturbances in mood, emotions,
     and overall affect. These disorders profoundly affect an individual's emotional well-being and functioning. In
     addition, mood disorders often significantly influence relationships, work or academic performance, and overall
     quality of life. Accurate diagnosis and classification of these disorders according to established guidelines are
     crucial for effective treatment planning and improving the well-being of individuals affected by these conditions
     (American Psychiatric Association, 2022).

     The Spectrum of Mood Disorders

     As defined by the DSM-5, the most common mood disorders include depression, bipolar disorder, and dysthymia.
     Mood disorders are characterized by disturbances in mood that are intense, persistent, and interfere significantly
     with an individual's daily life. These disorders can have severe repercussions on one's physical health, interpersonal
     relationships, and overall quality of life (Sekhon & Gupta, 2020).

     The DSM-5 defines depression as feelings of sadness and/or loss of interest in activities once considered enjoyable
     (Torres, 2020). By contrast, bipolar disorder is a recurrent illness that involves changes in mood and energy that
     may be severe and involves both depression and mania, or hypomania (Howland & El Sehamy, 2021). Previously
     known as dysthymia, persistent depressive disorder is a milder, but longer lasting form of depression (John
     Hopkins Medicine, 2019). Additionally, mania is a condition in which a person's mood is abnormally elevated and is
     accompanied by high energy or activity.

Mood disorders have traditionally been viewed in categorical terms. This means that an individual either meets the
specific criteria for a diagnosis or they do not. Recent research, however, indicates a shift toward understanding
these disorders on a spectrum or continuum (Mason et al., 2016) (Figure 16.2). This shift in perspective allows for a
more nuanced understanding of mood disorders, acknowledging the diversity and complexity of symptom
presentations.

FIGURE 16.2 Mood disorders are now considered to exist on a spectrum, rather than being in discrete categories. (attribution: Copyright

A more inclusive and flexible approach to understanding, diagnosing, and treating these conditions, the spectrum
model of mood disorders acknowledges the variability in symptom presentations and offers a framework for
individualized care. By moving away from rigid categorical definitions, it allows for a broader understanding of the
diverse experiences of those with mood disorders (McIntyre et al., 2018). For example, the spectrum model
accommodates those with atypical or mixed features. An individual might exhibit symptoms of both depression and
mania but not meet the full criteria for bipolar disorder. In a categorical model, this could lead to challenges in
diagnosis and treatment. Yet by understanding these symptoms as existing on a continuum, health-care
professionals can offer tailored interventions that address the specific needs of the individual (Zimmerman et al.,
2015).

Varying moods are a natural and expected part of the human experience. Everyone, at different points in their life,
will experience fluctuations in their mood, feeling elated at times and downcast at others. These mood variations
can be influenced by a myriad of factors, ranging from environmental stimuli, interpersonal relationships, stress,
physiological changes, or hormonal fluctuations (Karl et al., 2018). It is when these mood variations begin to
interfere with an individual's daily functioning that they may be indicative of a mood disorder. The distinction
between normal mood variations and clinically significant mood disturbances is primarily based on their duration,
intensity, and impact on daily functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 2022). For instance, feeling sad or
down after a negative life event, like the loss of a job or the end of a relationship, is expected. If this sadness
persists for weeks, impairs one's ability to perform daily tasks, affects relationships, or leads to thoughts of self-
harm or suicide, it may be indicative of major depressive disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 2022).

        LIFE-STAGE CONTEXT

Age Considerations in Clients Diagnosed with Mood Disorders

Age plays a significant role in the presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of mood disorders. Age-related
considerations are pivotal in the accurate diagnosis and effective treatment of mood disorders. Recognizing the
varied presentations across age groups, understanding the unique challenges posed by each age group, and
tailoring interventions accordingly can lead to optimal client outcomes (American Psychiatric Association, 2022).
Table 16.1 compares mood disorders among age groups.

     TABLE 16.1 Mood Disorders by Age Group

     Mood disorders encompass a wide range of conditions that can affect an individual's mood regulation. To provide a
     nuanced understanding of these disorders, the DSM-5 introduces specifiers. Specifiers are descriptors that can be
     added to the core diagnosis to offer more specific information about the presentation of the disorder (American
     Psychiatric Association, 2022).

     For major depressive disorder (MDD), some of the key specifiers include:

         · With Anxious Distress: Describes individuals who exhibit two or more symptoms of anxiety (e.g., feeling on
             edge, experiencing restlessness)

         · With Mixed Features: Signifies the presence of at least three manic symptoms, though not enough for a full-
             blown manic or hypomanic episode

         · With Melancholic Features: Characterized by profound anhedonia or lack of reactivity to positive stimuli, along
             with other symptoms, such as early morning awakening or significant weight loss

         · With Atypical Features: Includes mood reactivity (i.e., mood brightens in response to positive events) and two
             or more additional symptoms, such as increased appetite or hypersomnia (American Psychiatric Association,
             2022)

     For bipolar disorders, specifiers can be used to detail the nature of the current or most recent episode (manic,
     hypomanic, or depressed). Some specifiers for bipolar disorders include:

         · With Rapid Cycling: Indicates the occurrence of at least four mood episodes (depressive, manic, or
             hypomanic) within a twelve-month period

         · With Mixed Features: Can be applied to manic, hypomanic, or depressive episodes if there are symptoms from
             the opposing mood polarity present

         · With Anxious Distress: As with MDD, denotes the presence of two or more symptoms of anxiety (American
             Psychiatric Association, 2022)

     The DSM-5 includes other specifiers applicable to both MDD and bipolar disorders, such as "With Psychotic
     Features," which suggests the presence of delusions or hallucinations, and "With Catatonia," which describes a
     range of psychomotor symptoms like mutism or posturing (American Psychiatric Association, 2022).

     Approaches to Treating Mood Disorders

     Mood disorders are serious mental health conditions with potentially debilitating effects. A comprehensive
     understanding of these conditions and their management strategies is paramount for health-care professionals to
     provide effective client care. It is equally essential to foster an empathetic and nonjudgmental approach when

working with these clients, promoting their mental health and overall well-being (Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], 2022).

Treating mood disorders involves a combination of medication, psychotherapy, and lifestyle changes.
Pharmacological treatment is currently considered an essential component in managing mood disorders. Health
providers may prescribe antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotic medications depending on the
specific diagnosis and symptom severity. These medications can help balance brain chemistry, reduce the severity
of symptoms, and improve quality of life.

Cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy (IPT), and other forms of psychotherapy are often used to help
individuals understand and manage their symptoms. These therapies can provide strategies for managing stress,
improving relationships, and promoting healthier thinking patterns.

Electroconvulsive therapy is a medical procedure that involves the passage of a controlled electric current through
the brain, inducing a brief seizure while the client is anesthetized (Salik & Marwaha, 2020). Historically, ECT has
been the subject of controversy due to its portrayal in popular media and concerns about adverse effects (Cabrera et
al., 2021). In recent years, however, it has gained recognition as an effective and safe intervention for specific
psychiatric disorders, particularly when other treatments have failed. Mood disorders, such as MDD and bipolar
disorder, can be debilitating. In some instances, clients do not respond adequately to traditional treatments like
pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy. For these individuals, ECT can be a valuable alternative (American Psychiatric
Nurses Association, 2021).

Lifestyle changes, such as regular physical exercise, a healthy diet, adequate sleep, and avoiding alcohol and illicit
substances, also help in treating mood disorders. These changes can enhance the effectiveness of therapy and
medication and improve overall health and well-being (Hollon et al., 2014).

Overview of Medications Used to Treat Mood Disorders
Medication is a critical component in treating mood disorders, managing symptoms, and restoring balance in brain
chemistry. Antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotic medications (see Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder
and Other Psychotic Disorders) commonly treat these disorders.

Antidepressants, such as SSRIs and SNRIs, frequently treat major depressive disorder and dysthymia.
Antidepressants function by modulating the concentrations of neurotransmitters. These neurotransmitters,
including serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, play crucial roles in regulating mood, energy, sleep, and
appetite (Moraczewski & Aedma, 2020).

Mood stabilizers, including lithium and certain anticonvulsants, are the cornerstone of treatment for bipolar
disorder. These medications help to regulate mood swings and prevent episodes of mania and depression.
Antipsychotic medications are indicated where psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations or delusions, are
present; such episodes can occur in severe depressive episodes or during manic episodes in bipolar disorder
(Yatham et al., 2018).

Overview of Psychosocial Approaches to Treat Mood Disorders
Psychosocial interventions are essential in treating mood disorders, providing individuals with strategies to manage
their symptoms, improve their functioning, and enhance their quality of life. CBT, IPT, and family-focused therapy
(FFT) are among the most researched and commonly used psychosocial treatments (Chatterton et al., 2017).

CBT helps individuals identify and modify maladaptive thought patterns and behaviors that may contribute to their
mood disorder. It also teaches coping strategies to manage stress and prevent future depressive episodes. IPT, on
the other hand, focuses on improving interpersonal relationships and social functioning, which mood disorders often
affect negatively. It helps individuals navigate relationship difficulties, role transitions, and unresolved grief that may
contribute to their depressive symptoms (Rajhans et al., 2020).

FFT and DBT are commonly used in the treatment of bipolar disorder. FFT includes psychoeducation about the
disorder, communication enhancement training, and problem-solving skills training. FFT aims to improve the family
environment because a supportive family environment can often help manage bipolar disorder symptoms and
prevent relapse (Guarnotta, 2023). DBT is a talk therapy focused on helping an individual deal with intense
emotions. It revolves around how thoughts affect the emotions and eventual behavior of the individual (Cleveland
486  16 · Mood Disorders and Suicide

     Clinic, 2022). In addition to these structured therapies, psychosocial interventions may include self-help strategies
     and peer support, which can enhance the effectiveness of other treatments and improve the overall prognosis.

     Overview of Lifestyle Changes That Help Treat Mood Disorders
     While lifestyle changes alone may not replace the need for traditional treatments, they can significantly complement
     them and lead to enhanced mood stability and improved overall well-being in individuals with mood disorders (Ee et
     al., 2020). Engaging in regular physical activity has been linked to reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety.
     Exercise promotes the release of endorphins, which are natural mood elevators, and helps in regulating
     neurotransmitters like serotonin and norepinephrine that play a role in mood regulation (American Psychological
     Association, 2020). Likewise, consuming a well-balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein,
     and omega-3 fatty acids can positively influence mood. For instance, omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish like salmon,
     have anti-inflammatory properties and are associated with a reduced risk of depression (Gómez-Pinilla, 2008).
     Maintaining a consistent sleep schedule and ensuring adequate rest is crucial for mood stability. Sleep disturbances,
     such as insomnia or oversleeping, can exacerbate symptoms of mood disorders. It is recommended to establish a
     regular bedtime routine, avoid electronics before sleep, and create a sleep-conducive environment (Saghir et al.,
     2018). Alcohol and certain drugs can interact with medications and can lead to mood swings or worsen depressive
     or manic symptoms. It is best to avoid these substances (World Health Organization, 2023).

     16.2 The Spectrum of Mood Disorders

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Outline the diagnosis, types, incidence, and possible causes of depression
         · Describe the clinical symptoms of depression
         · Recall the approaches used in the treatment of depression

     Mental health conditions characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, loss of interest in activities, and difficulties
     in carrying out daily activities are called depressive disorders. These conditions can significantly impair a person's
     quality of life, social relationships, and physical health, and they often require medical intervention for management
     and recovery. Treatments typically include psychotherapy, medications, or a combination of both. The exact cause of
     depressive disorders is unknown but is thought to involve a combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and
     psychological factors. Despite their serious nature, with appropriate treatment, individuals with depressive
     disorders can lead fulfilling lives (American Psychiatric Association, 2022).

     Diagnosis, Types, Incidence, and Cause

     Depression, clinically referred to as major depressive disorder, is a common and serious medical illness that
     negatively affects how a person feels, thinks, and acts. It is characterized by persistent feelings of sadness and a
     lack of interest or pleasure in activities. It can lead to various emotional and physical problems and decrease a
     person's ability to function at work and at home.

     The exact causes of depression are not fully understood, but current research suggests that it is caused by genetic,
     biological, environmental, and psychological factors. Depression can run in families, suggesting a genetic link.
     Changes in the brain's neurotransmitter levels, particularly serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, also play a
     role. Environmental factors, such as early childhood trauma, stress, or exposure to certain medications or drugs can
     trigger the onset of the disease. Additionally, certain personality traits, such as low self-esteem or being overly
     dependent, can make an individual more susceptible to depression (American Psychiatric Association, 2022).

     DSM-5 Definition of Depression
     Major depressive disorder (MDD) is not just a bout of the blues; it is a mood disorder that affects one's quality of life.
     Individuals with MDD may experience significant changes in appetite or weight, sleep disturbances (either insomnia
     or hypersomnia), fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, difficulty concentrating or making decisions,
     and recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation. Physical symptoms, such as aches or pains without a clear
     physical cause, can also be present. These symptoms can lead to significant impairments in daily functioning and
     quality of life, making early identification and intervention crucial (American Psychiatric Association, 2022).

     For a diagnosis of depression, at least five of these symptoms must be present most of the day, nearly every day for

at least two weeks, and they must cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning. It is important to note that these symptoms can be related to a number of medical
conditions or can be caused by certain substances, so it is always important to rule out other causes before
confirming a diagnosis (American Psychiatric Association, 2022).

Types of Depression
Depression exists as a variety of related disorders. The DSM-5 identifies several types of depressive disorders. MDD
is what most people think of when they hear "depression." MDD is characterized by one or more major depressive
episodes, during which an individual experiences a depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure in activities,
along with other symptoms, such as changes in weight or sleep, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, and
thoughts of death or suicide (American Psychiatric Association, 2022).

Persistent depressive disorder (PDD), formerly known as dysthymia, is a chronic form of depression. Unlike MDD
where individuals might experience severe depressive episodes, PDD is characterized by a steady, low-grade
depressive mood that lasts for at least two years. While the symptoms might not be as intense as those of MDD, they
can still pose a significant challenge in daily functioning and well-being of the affected individual (American
Psychiatric Association 2022).

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a type of depression that occurs the week before the onset of
menstruation, and is marked by mood swings, irritability, and anxiety, among other symptoms. Perinatal depression
is a mood disorder that can affect women during pregnancy and after childbirth. The term perinatal encompasses
both the prenatal (occurring during pregnancy) and postpartum (occurring after childbirth) periods. It involves a
significant depressive episode with symptoms, such as feelings of sadness, issues bonding with the baby, appetite
and sleep pattern alterations, and thoughts of self-harm or harming the baby (National Institute of Mental Health
[NIMH], 2021).

Depressive disorder due to another medical condition is distinguished from MDD by the direct causative relationship
between a separate medical condition and the onset of depressive symptoms. Rather than being a primary mental
health disorder, the depression in these cases arises as a physiological consequence of a different medical condition
or its treatment. Such conditions might include neurological disorders (e.g., Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, or
traumatic brain injuries), endocrine disorders (e.g., hypothyroidism), or autoimmune diseases, among others. The
clinical presentation can include symptoms similar to MDD, such as persistent sadness, loss of interest in activities,
fatigue, and feelings of worthlessness (American Psychiatric Association, 2022).

Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a specific type of depression that corresponds with the seasons. This disorder is
seen more frequently during the fall and winter months when there is less sunlight. People with SAD may
experience symptoms, such as low mood, lack of energy, increased sleep, and weight gain, which subside during the
spring and summer.

Other specified depressive disorder and unspecified depressive disorder are categories of depression used when
depressive symptoms cause significant distress or impairment but do not meet the full criteria for any of the specific
disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 2022). Other types of depression may be related to specific
circumstances or events. For example, adjustment disorder with depressed mood occurs in response to a stressful
life event, such as the loss of a loved one or a major life change. Substance/medication-induced depressive disorder
is characterized by depressive symptoms arising from the use or withdrawal of certain substances or medications
(American Psychiatric Association, 2022). Depression encompasses a range of distinct conditions, each with unique
features and characteristics. The DSM-5 outlines several types of depression based on specific diagnostic criteria
(Table 16.2).

     Incidence of Depression
     According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of 2023, almost 280 million people of all ages suffer from
     depression worldwide (World Health Organization, 2023). This pervasive condition is more prevalent in women than
     men, with studies indicating that approximately one in three women will experience a major depressive episode in
     their lifetime compared to one in five men (American Psychiatric Association, 2022). In the United States, the
     incidence of depression is particularly striking. According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), in 2020,
     approximately twenty-one million adults in the United States, or roughly 8.4 percent of the adult population, had at
     least one major depressive episode in the past year (NIMH, 2020a).

     Despite the high incidence of depression, many people suffering from the condition do not receive appropriate
     treatment. For example, the WHO reports that less than 75 percent of those affected receive adequate treatment
     (World Health Organization, 2023). This lack of treatment may be due to various barriers, including the stigma
     associated with mental health disorders, a lack of available resources, and insufficient training of health-care
     professionals in mental health.

     The COVID-19 pandemic brought about unprecedented challenges to the global population, and its effects on
     mental health have been profound. Children and teenagers, a demographic historically resilient to many stressors,
     have been noticeably affected. They faced disruptions in their daily routines, including school closures, limited
     social interactions, and changes in familial dynamics due to economic hardships or health concerns. Studies have
     indicated an increase in symptoms of anxiety and depression among this group. For instance, Loades et al. (2020)
     found that young people who were already at risk of anxiety were particularly vulnerable to the effects of social
     isolation, leading to heightened symptoms. Furthermore, there have been concerns about the long-term effects on
     academic progress, social skills, and emotional development (Loades et al., 2020).

Possible Causes of Depression
Depression is a complex condition arising from various interrelated genetic, biological, environmental, and
psychological factors. Genetic factors play a significant role in the development of depression. Research indicates
that individuals with a family history of depression have a higher likelihood of experiencing the condition
themselves, suggesting a hereditary component.

Alterations in brain structure and function, along with imbalances in neurotransmitters, such as serotonin,
norepinephrine, and dopamine, are known to be associated with depression. The neuroendocrine system has also
been implicated in depression; chronic stress can lead to dysregulation in the system, leading to increased
production of cortisol, which has been linked to depression.
490  16 · Mood Disorders and Suicide

     Environmental factors, including exposure to trauma, abuse, neglect, or stressful life events, can also trigger the
     onset of depression. Such circumstances can lead to an emotional response that overwhelms an individual's
     capacity to cope, leading to depression.

     Lastly, psychological factors, such as personality traits, are significant contributors. For example, individuals with a
     tendency toward negative thinking or low self-esteem are more susceptible to depression (American Psychiatric
     Association, 2022).

     Symptoms of Depression

     Depression is characterized by a collection of symptoms that affect an individual's mood, physical health, and
     cognitive functioning. According to the DSM-5, the primary symptoms of major depressive disorder include a
     persistent feeling of sadness or a lack of interest or pleasure in almost all activities. These core symptoms must be
     present most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks for a diagnosis (American Psychiatric Association,
     2022). For diagnosis, the person has to experience five or more symptoms outlined in the DSM-5 during a two-week
     period. These include:

         · depressed mood for most days
         · decreased interest in pleasure in all or most activities
         · significant weight gain or loss
         · insomnia or hypersomnia
         · psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day
         · fatigue or loss of energy
         · feelings of worthlessness
         · diminished ability to concentrate
         · recurrent thoughts of death or recurrent suicidal ideation (MDCalc, 2024)

     Depression often manifests through emotional, cognitive, and physical symptoms. Therefore, individuals
     experiencing depression typically report persistent feelings of sadness, emptiness, or hopelessness and may display
     anhedonia, which is a marked disinterest or lack of pleasure in activities they once enjoyed. Additionally, significant
     changes in weight or appetite (either increase or decrease), sleep disturbances (including insomnia or
     hypersomnia), anergia, which is a pervasive sense of fatigue or loss of energy, and feelings of worthlessness or
     disproportionate guilt are common. Cognitive impairments, such as difficulties with concentration, decision-making,
     and recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation, may also be present. In some cases, individuals might endure
     somatic complaints without clear medical origins, further highlighting the comprehensive impact of depression on
     one's well-being (American Psychiatric Association, 2022).

     The severity and frequency of these symptoms can vary widely among individuals. Some clients experience most or
     all of these symptoms, while others only experience a few. Additionally, the manifestation of these symptoms can be
     influenced by the individual's cultural context and may present differently across different cultures (American
     Psychiatric Association, 2022). Culture plays a pivotal role in shaping how depression is experienced, expressed,
     and understood in different populations. Cultures differ in their norms and values regarding emotional expression,
     coping mechanisms, familial roles, and perceptions of mental health (Mental Health First Aid, 2019). For instance, in
     some cultures, depression might not be articulated in terms of sadness but rather in terms of physical symptoms or
     spiritual afflictions. Additionally, certain cultures may value stoicism or suppress emotional displays, which can
     influence the presentation and diagnosis of depressive symptoms. In other cultural settings, mental health
     challenges might be stigmatized, deterring individuals from seeking appropriate help or disclosing their feelings.
     Consequently, understanding the cultural nuances and putting the client's symptoms in the context of their own
     culture are paramount for clinicians to ensure accurate diagnosis, culturally sensitive interventions, and effective
     therapeutic outcomes (Salchi, 2022). Furthermore, in older adults, depression may present with somatic
     complaints, such as fatigue, sleep disturbances, or unexplained physical ailments, rather than the classic mood
     disturbances seen in younger populations.

  CLINICAL JUDGMENT MEASUREMENT MODEL

  Recognizing and Analyzing Cues: CJMM Clients with Depression

  The National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) Clinical Judgment Measurement Model (CJMM) offers
  a structured approach to developing clinical judgment in nursing students, encompassing five layered aspects:
  recognizing cues, analyzing cues, prioritizing hypotheses, generating solutions, and taking action, followed by
  evaluating outcomes (National Council of State Boards of Nursing, 2019). When applied to a client experiencing
  depression, this model can serve as a useful guide for nursing students.

  In the "recognizing cues" phase, nursing students should be alert to both overt and subtle signs of depression,
  including mood changes, social withdrawal, or shifts in daily routines. Physical symptoms, such as fatigue or
  changes in appetite, can also be indicative of an underlying depressive disorder (World Health Organization,
  2023).

  The "analyzing cues" phase involves assessing the significance of these cues. Students should consider whether
  the observed signs are isolated or persistent, as well as their severity and impact on the client's well-being. At
  this stage, it is important to differentiate symptoms of depression from those of other possible conditions, like
  anxiety disorders or medical illnesses (American Psychiatric Association, 2022).

Treatment of Depression

Depression is a multifaceted condition that requires a comprehensive, multimodal treatment approach. According to
the American Psychiatric Association (2022), first-line treatment options for major depressive disorder generally
include pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, or a combination of the two.

Pharmacotherapy, primarily involving antidepressant medications, is an essential component of treatment.
Psychotherapy, including CBT and IPT, has been shown to be effective in treating depression (Cuijpers et al., 2014).
Lifestyle modifications, including regular exercise, a balanced diet, adequate sleep, and social support, also help to
manage depression and improve overall well-being. For clients with severe or treatment-resistant depression,
additional interventions, such as ECT, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), or ketamine infusion may be
indicated (Pradhan et al., 2015).

ECT is a procedure where controlled electric currents are passed through the brain, intentionally triggering a brief
seizure, which is thought to cause a rapid increase in neurotransmitters, alleviating depressive symptoms (Mayo
Clinic, 2018). TMS, on the other hand, uses magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells in the brain in the motor cortex
and improve symptoms of depression. It is a noninvasive procedure that targets specific areas of the brain
associated with mood (NIMH, 2016). Lastly, ketamine infusion, a dissociative anesthetic, has shown rapid
antidepressant effects, even in clients suffering from treatment-resistant depression. The mechanism behind its
antidepressant effect is believed to be related to its ability to restore synaptic connections in the brain (Sanacora et
al., 2017). While these treatments can be effective, they come with specific risks and considerations, requiring
careful assessment and monitoring by health-care professionals (NIMH, 2016).

Medications
Pharmacotherapy is a critical component in managing major depressive disorder, often used as first-line treatment
or in combination with psychotherapy. SSRIs and SNRIs are both classes of antidepressant medications found to be
effective in the treatment of depression (Cipriani et al., 2018). SSRIs work by selectively inhibiting the reuptake of
serotonin, a neurotransmitter associated with mood, sleep, and appetite (Chu & Wadhwa, 2021). Commonly
prescribed SSRIs include fluoxetine, paroxetine, and citalopram. SNRIs, on the other hand, inhibit the reuptake of
both serotonin and norepinephrine, another neurotransmitter linked to mood and alertness. Examples of SNRIs
include venlafaxine, duloxetine, and desvenlafaxine (Fanelli et al., 2021). SSRIs and SNRIs are frequently used due
to their effectiveness and tolerable side effects (Cipriani et al., 2018). The decision to use an SSRI over an SNRI, or
vice versa, depends on the client's specific symptoms, the side effect profile that is acceptable to the client, and any
other comorbid conditions. For instance, SNRIs might be preferred for clients with chronic pain conditions because
of the role of norepinephrine in pain modulation (Robinson et al., 2022). Additionally, for clients who do not respond
adequately to SSRIs, switching to an SNRI might be beneficial (Tundo et al., 2015).
492  16 · Mood Disorders and Suicide

     These medications typically take several weeks to reach their full effect, and individual responses may vary.
     Combining an SSRI with another serotonergic agent can cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition called
     serotonin syndrome, characterized by agitation, fever, rapid heartbeat, muscle stiffness, and hallucinations (Scotton
     et al., 2019). Serotonin syndrome is a medical emergency.

     For clients who do not respond to or cannot tolerate SSRIs or SNRIs, other options include atypical antidepressants,
     like bupropion or mirtazapine, and older classes of medications, such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and
     monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). One of the major concerns with TCAs is their potential for toxicity in
     overdose. Even a small overdose can be fatal due to cardiac toxicity and central nervous system depression
     (Moraczewski & Aedma, 2020). MAOIs are one of the oldest classes of antidepressant medications, initially
     introduced in the 1950s for the treatment of depression. While effective, they are generally used as a last resort due
     to their more significant side effect profiles and potential for severe drug and food interactions (Cleare et al., 2015).
     Hypertensive crisis can occur when foods high in tyramine (e.g., aged cheeses, cured meats, fermented foods) are
     consumed while taking an MAOI. This results from the inhibition of intestinal and liver MAO-A, which normally
     metabolizes dietary tyramine. Accumulated tyramine can then induce excessive norepinephrine release, leading to a
     sharp rise in blood pressure (Gillman, 2018).

     Antipsychotics may be utilized as an adjunctive treatment in cases of treatment-resistant depression (Rybakowski,
     2023). The choice of medication depends on the individual's specific symptoms, the side effect profile of the
     medication, the presence of any other psychiatric or medical conditions, and the individual's response to medication
     (Stroup & Gray, 2018). More recently, ketamine and esketamine have shown promise for treatment-resistant
     depression, although this treatment requires more research (Popova et al., 2019). These medications affect the
     primary excitatory pathway within the CNS that is responsible for cognition, memory, learning, emotion, and mood
     (Halaris & Cook, 2023). Table 16.3 lists the common medications used to treat depression.

        PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Psychosocial Factors Affecting Depression

It is essential to remember that psychosocial factors play a significant role in the onset, course, and recovery from
depression. These factors include the individual's social environment (such as relationships with family, friends, and
coworkers), their psychological resources (such as coping skills and resilience), and the cultural context within
which they live.

Depression often impacts and is impacted by these psychosocial factors. For example, a person with depression
may withdraw from their social network, leading to feelings of isolation that can exacerbate their depressive
symptoms. Additionally, ongoing stressors, such as financial difficulty or relationship problems, can contribute to
the development and persistence of depression. Understanding and addressing these psychosocial factors is crucial
to the treatment of depression (Remes et al., 2021).

Psychotherapeutic Approaches to Treating Depression
There are several psychotherapeutic approaches that are effective in treating depression, such as CBT and IPT
(American Psychological Association, 2019). CBT works by helping individuals identify and change negative thought
patterns and behaviors that may contribute to their depression. At the same time, IPT focuses on improving
interpersonal relationships and social functioning, both of which are often impaired in individuals with depression.
In addition, research has shown that mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) can help prevent relapse in
individuals with recurrent depression by teaching them mindfulness skills to disengage from habitual depressive
494  16 · Mood Disorders and Suicide

     thoughts (White, 2015). Group therapy, family therapy, and other supportive therapies can also be beneficial,
     particularly in cases where social support and relationship issues play a role in the onset or maintenance of
     depression (American Psychological Association, 2019).

             CLINICAL SAFETY AND PROCEDURES (QSEN)

     Client-Centered Care for Clients with Depression

     Quality and Safety Education for Nurses (QSEN) underscores the importance of applying the six competencies in
     delivering client-centered care, particularly when treating conditions such as depression. Client-centered care
     demands that health professionals acknowledge clients as individuals with unique needs and respect their values
     and choices about their care (QSEN Institute, 2020).

     Provide client-centered care for depression in a respectful, nonjudgmental, empathic manner to ensure dignity,
     decrease the stigma associated with depression, and promote better health outcomes. This care involves actively
     involving clients in their care plans and decision-making processes. The nurse should conduct a thorough
     assessment, considering the client's emotional, mental, and physical health, lifestyle, social factors, and personal
     beliefs about health and treatment. Then, the care team should establish a personalized care plan that reflects the
     client's preferences and respects their autonomy. This care plan might include a variety of interventions like
     psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, self-management strategies, and complementary therapies, if suitable (American
     Psychological Association, 2019).

     Communication is also a vital part of client-centered care. Nurses should provide clear, jargon-free explanations
     about the nature of depression, available treatments, possible side effects, and the expected course of recovery.
     Encourage clients to voice their concerns, ask questions, and express their views about their disorder and course of
     treatment. Moreover, recognize that families and caregivers are crucial members of the care team. They should be
     involved in care decisions and given proper education and support to understand and cope with the client's
     condition.

     Planning Nursing Care for a Client with Depression
     A comprehensive care plan for a client with depression begins with a holistic assessment of the client, including
     physical, emotional, and mental health, along with psychosocial factors, such as support systems and lifestyle
     factors. It is important to assess the client's risk of self-harm or suicide and take appropriate safety precautions.

     The management of a depressed client with self-harm potential presents significant safety challenges that must be
     carefully addressed. A depressed client may exhibit various forms of self-harm behaviors, such as cutting, burning,
     or ingesting harmful substances, often as a maladaptive coping strategy for emotional pain or distress (SAMHSA,
     2023b). In these cases, a comprehensive safety plan is essential and should include thorough risk assessment,
     close monitoring, and environmental modifications. This may involve removing items that could be used for self-
     harm, such as sharp objects, from the client's vicinity (SAMHSA, 2020a). Medications prescribed should be carefully
     selected, ideally opting for those with a lower risk of lethality in case of overdose (Carpenter et al., 2021). Clients
     should be closely monitored for the warning signs of self-harm or increasing emotional distress (SAMHSA, 2020a).

     Establish specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely (SMART) goals in collaboration with the client. For
     example, these goals could involve managing symptoms, enhancing coping strategies, improving function in daily
     activities, or engaging in social interactions (Smith, 2018). Tailor interventions to the individual's needs and
     preferences. These might include facilitating therapeutic communication, promoting self-care activities, assisting
     with symptom management, advocating for treatment adherence, educating about depression and its management,
     and coordinating care with other health-care professionals. Evaluate the care plan regularly to monitor the client's
     progress and adjust the plan as necessary. The ultimate goal is to support the client in managing depression,
     improving their quality of life, and preventing relapse.

        CLINICAL SAFETY AND PROCEDURES (QSEN)

Applying Client-Centered Care to a Client with Depression

Client: John, a thirty-five-year-old male

Presenting issue: John has been feeling persistently sad, tired, and disinterested in activities that he usually enjoys
for the past two months. In addition, he reports significant difficulty sleeping and a loss of appetite, which resulted
in a ten-pound weight loss over the last month. John was admitted to an inpatient psychiatric unit after expressing
feelings of worthlessness and reports that he has had recurrent thoughts of suicide, though he denies any specific
plan or intent.

Past medical history: No significant past medical history.

Family and social history: John is single and lives alone. His father committed suicide at forty-two when John was a
teenager. John has a stable job but admits that he has been missing work because he "just can't get out of bed." He
has no significant history of substance use.

Diagnosis, risk factors, nursing interventions, evaluation: John's symptoms align with the criteria for MDD as defined
by DSM-5. Persistent sadness, loss of interest or pleasure, significant weight loss, insomnia, fatigue, feelings of
worthlessness, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide are indicative of this condition (American Psychiatric
Association, 2022).

John's risk factors include a family history of depression and suicide (his father), living alone (potential social
isolation), and possibly work-related stress.

Nursing interventions for John may include regular safety assessments given his suicidal ideation; facilitating
therapeutic communication to provide emotional support and encouragement; promoting self-care activities, such
as regular physical activity, a healthy diet, and adequate sleep; educating John about depression and its
management; supporting medication adherence, if prescribed; and coordinating care with other health-care
professionals, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist (Cleare et al., 2015).

The overarching goal of John's treatment is to alleviate his depressive symptoms, reduce suicidal ideation, and
equip him with coping skills for his reintegration into the community. Evaluating the success of John's care in an
inpatient psychiatric unit necessitates a multifaceted approach and may include the following measures:

    · Clinical assessment: Repeated use of standardized clinical scales like the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
        (HDRS). A significant reduction in scores could indicate treatment efficacy (Rush et al., 2021).

    · Behavioral indicators: Observe for behavioral changes, such as increased engagement in activities, improved
        sleep, better appetite, and increased social interaction, which can be positive signs of treatment efficacy (Rost
        et al., 2023).

    · Medication review: Ensure that John's medication regimen has been effective in treating his symptoms
        without causing intolerable side effects. Adjustments in medication may demonstrate attentive care, but may
        also suggest that they have not yet found the optimal treatment (Informed Health, 2020).

16.3 Self-Harm and Suicide

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Describe how self-harm can be related to mental illness
    · Outline the challenges in dealing with attempted suicide in clients with a mental health problem
    · Plan nursing care for a client who is contemplating suicide
    · Define nonsuicidal self-injury and the approaches used to care for clients who may self-injure

Depression and suicide are deeply intertwined and represent significant public health challenges. Depression is a
leading cause of disability worldwide, affecting more than 280 million people, and is a major risk factor for suicide
(World Health Organization, 2023). Suicide is not a normal response to stress, but is most commonly driven by a
mental disorder, such as depression or a substance use problem (American Psychiatric Association, 2022; NIMH,
496  16 · Mood Disorders and Suicide

     2020b).

     The term suicidal ideation refers to thoughts, fantasies, or preoccupations with suicide. It can range from fleeting
     thoughts of ending one's life to detailed plans, with specific details on the timing or execution. Suicidal ideation is
     often considered a symptom or manifestation of an underlying psychiatric condition, such as depression, though it
     can also occur in the absence of a diagnosable mental health condition. The severity can vary significantly from
     person to person and it can exist on a spectrum that ranges from passive thoughts about being dead to active
     thoughts about how to carry out the detailed plan for suicide (Harmer et al., 2023). It is crucial for health-care
     providers, including nurses, to conduct a thorough risk assessment when suicidal ideation is present.

     A lethality assessment refers to the structured evaluation of the risk factors associated with a person's potential for
     engaging in a life-threatening behavior, such as suicide. This assessment aims to gauge the immediacy and severity
     of the risk to help determine the appropriate level of intervention or treatment required. Several factors are typically
     examined during a lethality assessment, including the presence of a detailed plan, the availability of means, the
     availability to carry out the plan (e.g., weapons or drugs), previous suicide attempts or violent behavior, current
     mental state, and other situational factors, such as social support and recent life events (Minnesota Department of
     Health, 2019).

     Health-care providers, including nurses, often use standardized instruments like the Columbia-Suicide Severity
     Rating Scale (C-SSRS), the SAD PERSONS Scale, or other clinical interview protocols to guide the lethality
     assessment. Such assessments are vital in determining the immediate next steps, such as hospitalization, close
     monitoring, or outpatient treatment, as they help to identify individuals who are at higher risk and therefore require
     more intensive interventions (Andreotti et al., 2020).

Self-Harm and Mental Illness

Often referred to as self-injury or self-mutilation, self-harm is a behavior that involves deliberately causing harm to
one's own body as a way to cope with emotional distress or regain a sense of control (Klonsky et al., 2014). Self-
harm does not necessarily indicate a desire to end one's life; instead, it often serves as a maladaptive coping
mechanism for overwhelming feelings or situations (Elena-Rodica et al., 2023). It is, however, a significant risk
factor for suicide, particularly when associated with mental disorders (Harris et al., 2019). Many mental health
conditions can be associated with self-harm, including, but not limited to, borderline personality disorder,
depression, anxiety disorders, and eating disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 2022). In many instances,
individuals who self-harm may be attempting to manage intolerable emotional pain or regulate their emotions,
express self-directed anger, distract themselves from emotional distress, or communicate their emotional state to
others (Elena-Rodica et al., 2023).

Identifying signs and symptoms of self-harm is vital for health-care providers because it enables timely intervention
and treatment planning. Physical signs often include visible cuts, burns, or bruises, frequently observed on wrists,
arms, thighs, or other less noticeable body parts (Elena-Rodica et al., 2023). Behavioral indicators may include
social isolation, wearing long sleeves or pants even in warm weather to conceal injuries, and the unexplained
possession of sharp objects like knives or razors (Clarke et al., 2019). Emotional symptoms can involve increased
emotional instability, impulsivity, and verbal expressions of hopelessness or overwhelming stress (Klonsky et al.,
2014). Further, nurses may notice evasiveness or dishonesty when questioned about the source of injuries, along
with frequent episodes of "minor accidents" that could serve as a facade for self-harm activities (Klonsky et al.,
2014). Multiple visits to health-care facilities for the treatment of ambiguous physical injuries may also serve as a
red flag (Plener et al., 2015). Early recognition of these signs is crucial for initiating comprehensive care, which may
include risk assessments, psychotherapy, and medication management for underlying mental health conditions
(Klonsky et al., 2014).

Suicide and Mental Health Problems

Suicide is a significant public health issue often linked to mental health problems. According to the WHO, more than
700,000 people die by suicide every year worldwide. Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death among individuals
between the ages of fifteen and twenty-nine (World Health Organization, 2021). In the United States alone, in 2022,
nearly 50,000 people died by suicide, close to four times as many males as females (Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention [CDC], 2023).

A substantial proportion of individuals who die by suicide have a diagnosed mental disorder. Mental health
conditions, such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders, significantly increase the risk
of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (NIMH, 2020b). Substance use disorders are also strongly associated with an
increased risk of suicide, as are certain personality disorders, particularly borderline personality disorder (American
Psychiatric Association, 2022).

Several factors can heighten the risk of suicide among people with mental health problems, including feelings of
hopelessness, social isolation, poor adherence to treatment, high levels of impulsivity and aggression, and previous
suicide attempts (American Psychiatric Association, 2022). Comprehensive mental health services, including
assessment, diagnosis, and treatment, are essential to suicide prevention. Interventions often involve
psychotherapy, medication management, and strengthening social support. Additionally, immediate crisis
intervention is vital for individuals expressing suicidal thoughts or demonstrating suicidal behaviors. The National
498  16 · Mood Disorders and Suicide

     Suicide Prevention Lifeline is available at 1-800-273-TALK and the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline is available at 988
     (NIMH, 2020b).

             PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

     The Link between Depression and Suicide

     Depression is a major risk factor for suicide. The feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, and a persistent sense of
     overwhelming despair that often accompany depression can lead individuals to perceive suicide as the only viable
     option to escape their pain (American Psychiatric Association, 2022).

     Several psychosocial factors can increase the risk of suicide among people with depression. These include social
     isolation, relationship problems, significant life stressors, previous suicide attempts, and inadequate social support
     (NIMH, 2020b). Therefore, the nurse needs to assess these factors when treating individuals with depression.

     Recognizing signs of suicidal ideation in individuals with depression is crucial. These signs include talking about
     wanting to die, expressing feelings of unbearable pain or being a burden to others, and demonstrating changes in
     behavior, such as withdrawal, increased substance use, giving away personal items, discontinuing activities they
     previously enjoyed, or exhibiting risky behaviors (NIMH, 2020b).

     Pharmacological therapy for depression is helpful but does pose a risk for the client especially early in treatment.
     One danger associated with medications is the potential increase in motivation to attempt suicide. This is especially
     true during the initial stages of treatment when the medication begins to alleviate depressive symptoms. At this
     time, clients may experience an increase in energy and motivation before their suicidal ideation decreases,
     potentially leading to higher risk of suicide attempts (Baldessarini et al., 2017). Please note that there is a black box
     warning on all antidepressants about increased suicidal ideation, especially in adolescents and young adults.

     Another significant concern is the potential for medication hoarding or storing up medications for the purpose of a
     suicide attempt by overdose (Hawton et al., 2010). In some cases, individuals may pretend to take their medication
     but instead keep it to accumulate a lethal dose. This highlights the importance of direct observation during
     medication administration in high-risk populations (Baldessarini et al., 2017).

     Additional interventions for preventing suicide among individuals with depression include CBT and DBT, both aimed
     at enhancing coping and problem-solving skills, improving emotion regulation, and building resilience (American
     Psychiatric Association, 2022). ECT is considered an effective and fast-acting intervention for severe depressive
     disorders and may be especially relevant for clients exhibiting acute suicidal ideation or behavior. The primary
     advantage of ECT in treating suicidality associated with depression is its rapid onset of action. Unlike
     pharmacotherapy, which can take weeks to show effects, ECT often produces a significant reduction in depressive
     symptoms and suicidality within a week or even after a single session. This can be critical in cases where immediate
     risk reduction is essential (Rönnqvist et al., 2021).

     Methods Used in Suicide
     Understanding the various methods of suicide is a critical aspect of suicide prevention and risk assessment in
     health-care settings. The most common methods of suicide vary by region and gender but generally include
     hanging, self-poisoning (including drug overdose), and firearms (Stone et al., 2018). In the United States, firearms
     are the most commonly used method of suicide, particularly among men (CDC, 2020). Hanging is the most
     frequently used method worldwide, especially in countries where firearms are less accessible. Self-poisoning, which
     includes overdose of medications or ingestion of toxic substances, is more common among women (Stone et al.,
     2018).

     Health-care providers, including nurses, must be aware of these methods when assessing suicide risk. Access to
     lethal means can increase the risk of a suicide attempt being fatal, so a crucial part of a safety plan may involve
     working with clients and families to limit access to these means (Sidwell et al., 2023). Safety, empathy, and
     providing resources for help should always be the primary focus of such conversations (NIMH, 2020b).

     Conversations about suicide with clients are a delicate yet essential task that health-care providers must navigate
     skillfully. Open and empathetic dialogue can serve as a powerful tool for risk assessment and therapeutic

intervention. Conducting conversations with a nonjudgmental approach, employing open-ended questions, and
actively listening to the client's narrative are all techniques that may allow the client to feel comfortable enough to
share sensitive information (Slade & Sergent, 2020). Providers should aim to uncover the depth of the individual's
suicidal ideation, including the existence of a plan, a means, and a timeline, as these factors significantly correlate
with imminent risk (Weber et al., 2017). Clients should not only be asked about their thoughts of dying but also
about their reasons for living; exploring the ambivalence between the wish to die and the wish to live can be a
crucial element in a safety plan (Minnesota Department of Health, 2019). Failure to assess or inadequate
assessment of suicide risk can have severe consequences, including possible legal repercussions for the health-care
provider (Pinals, 2019).

        CULTURAL CONTEXT

Cultural Perspectives on Suicide

Cultural norms and beliefs significantly influence attitudes toward mental health and suicide. Different cultures may
interpret suicide differently, with some viewing it as a sin, a crime, a symptom of mental illness, or even an
honorable act (Clay, 2018). For instance, in some cultures, suicide has historically been viewed as an honorable way
to atone for failure or to preserve the dignity of one's family. On the other hand, in some cultures, suicide is typically
perceived as a tragic outcome of untreated mental illness (Steele et al., 2018). In indigenous communities, high
rates of suicide are often understood in the context of historical trauma and ongoing systemic inequities (Connors,
2021). Therefore, understanding the cultural nuances is crucial for health-care providers in implementing effective
prevention strategies and delivering sensitive care.

Many cultures and religions have strong stigmas and taboos surrounding suicide, which can prevent individuals from
seeking help when experiencing suicidal thoughts. This stigma can be exacerbated by a lack of understanding or
misconceptions about mental health (National Alliance on Mental Illness, n.d.). Religion can have a protective or
risk-enhancing role, depending on its teachings and the individual's relationship with their faith. In the Catholic
religion, the act of suicide is considered a sin, adding another layer of stigma and complicating prevention efforts
(Adamiak & Dohnalik, 2023). In some Islamic cultures, suicide is considered a sin and is highly stigmatized, making
it difficult for individuals to seek assistance due to fear of social ostracization. Similarly, in some African and
Caribbean communities, mental health issues may be attributed to spiritual or moral shortcomings, limiting the use
of formal mental health-care services (Gearing & Alonzo, 2018). In some Chinese cultures, the concept of
maintaining social standing can deter people from talking openly about mental health challenges (Yin et al., 2020).
Understanding these dynamics can help health-care providers tailor their approaches to suicide prevention
(Ariapooran et al., 2018).

Providing culturally competent care is essential in addressing suicide risk. This care includes understanding cultural
influences on suicide, reducing stigma, and providing culturally appropriate treatment and intervention strategies
(American Psychological Association, 2017). CBT can be adapted to incorporate cultural elements and rituals
important to the individual, such as incorporating prayer for clients from highly religious backgrounds (de Abreu
Costa & Moreira-Almeida, 2022). Engaging with religious and community leaders can help to diminish stigma and
encourage more people to seek help (Minot, 2023).

Suicide Risks in Care Settings
Suicide risk within health-care settings is a critical issue that requires immediate attention from health-care
professionals. The risk is not confined to psychiatric units but extends to emergency departments, medical-surgical
floors, and even outpatient settings (King et al., 2017). Identifying and managing suicide risk involves
comprehensive screening, vigilant observation, and strategic intervention. The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating
Scale (C-SSRS) is commonly used to assess the immediate risk of suicide among clients (Bjureberg et al., 2022).
Assessment tools are not foolproof, however, and require accompanying clinical judgment and ongoing assessment.

Environmental safety measures are also crucial. Monitoring protocols, like one-on-one observation or frequent
safety checks, can further mitigate risk (Quinlivan et al., 2016).

Effective communication among health-care team members is essential to maintain a high level of vigilance.
500  16 · Mood Disorders and Suicide

     Handoffs between staff should include detailed information about the client's mental state, triggers, and coping
     mechanisms. Staff should also be trained in crisis intervention techniques to address acute episodes of suicidal
     ideation (SAMHSA, 2020a). The transition periods during admission and after discharge are times of elevated risk
     and require comprehensive risk assessment, safety planning, effective handoff communication, and follow-up
     procedures (Chammas et al., 2022).

     All health-care providers must be trained adequately to recognize the signs of suicidal ideation, conduct risk
     assessments, provide immediate crisis intervention, and refer clients to appropriate mental health services.
     Collaboration and communication among health-care providers, clients, and their families is also crucial.
     Furthermore, integrating suicide prevention strategies into the wider health-care system, such as incorporating
     regular suicide risk screenings into routine care, implementing safety planning, and providing post-discharge follow-
     up, can help reduce suicide risk (American Psychological Association, 2019). Nurses should be skilled at identifying
     suicide risk factors. The SAD PERSONS Scale is a widely used clinical tool designed to assess suicide risk. The
     acronym stands for Sex, Age, Depression, Previous attempt, Ethanol use, Rational thinking loss, Social supports
     lacking, Organized plan, No spouse, and Sickness. Each factor is assigned a score, usually either 0 or 1, and the total
     score is used to estimate the risk level for suicide. The SAD PERSONS Scale offers the advantages of being quick and
     straightforward, making it a useful tool for busy health-care settings, such as emergency departments (Katz et al.,
     2017). After a suicide in a hospital, postvention strategies, including debriefing and support for affected staff and
     clients, are essential to promote healing and prevent further suicides (Andriessen et al., 2017).

             LINK TO LEARNING

     The Zero Suicide Institute's mission is to decrease the incidence of suicide in clients under the care of a health-care
     provider. Their website provides information (https://openstax.org/r/77ZeroSuicide) for implementation in clinics
     and practices.

     Preventing Suicide in Care Settings
     Preventing suicides in health-care settings requires a multifaceted approach encompassing self-awareness, risk
     assessment, environmental safety, staff training, and continuous client monitoring. Regular screening for suicide
     risk, as part of routine care, is essential, especially for clients with known mental health disorders, a history of
     suicidal behavior, or other risk factors (Chammas et al., 2022).

     Self-awareness plays a critical role in suicide prevention within health-care settings. Being cognizant of one's own
     biases, emotions, and knowledge gaps can directly influence the care provided to at-risk clients and may even
     impact outcomes. Health-care providers may hold conscious or unconscious biases related to suicide and mental
     health that could affect their judgment or interaction with clients. Being self-aware enables health-care
     professionals to recognize these biases and work toward mitigating their effects (Knaak et al., 2017). Providers must
     be aware of their emotional reactions when dealing with suicidal clients. Emotional responses like fear, discomfort,
     or frustration can impair clinical judgment and interfere with effective communication (Weber et al., 2017).
     Maintaining appropriate professional boundaries is crucial. Emotional involvement may cloud clinical judgment,
     whereas detachment may result in lack of empathy. Self-awareness assists in balancing empathy with
     professionalism (Banerjee et al., 2020). Providers should also recognize the emotional toll that managing high-risk
     clients can take and engage in appropriate self-care strategies, including debriefing sessions and consultations with
     peers or mental health professionals (SAMHSA, 2021).

     Environmental safety measures can prevent suicides. These measures can include limiting access to means of
     suicide, such as certain medications or medical equipment that could be used for self-harm, and designing inpatient
     units with reduced opportunities for hanging or jumping (Chammas et al., 2022). Staff training is another key aspect
     of prevention. Staff should be trained to recognize signs of suicidal ideations, such as verbal or written expressions
     of suicidal thoughts, behavioral cues like withdrawal or agitation, and emotional indicators like severe anxiety or
     hopelessness (Zalsman et al., 2016).

     Continuous client monitoring is a key component of effective suicide risk management within health-care settings.
     The level of monitoring should be aligned with the individual client's risk level to ensure that adequate safety

measures are in place. Those identified as high risk often require continuous one-to-one observation to ensure their
immediate safety. This could include constant visual observation, sometimes even during personal activities like
showering, to minimize any opportunity for self-harm. Those at moderate or lower risk may not require constant
monitoring but should be subject to regular and frequent checks. The frequency of these checks should be based on
a structured risk assessment and modified as the client's condition changes (Shekelle et al., 2019).

Health-care providers must be vigilant for changes in behavior, affect, or verbal statements that may signify an
increased risk of suicide. New or heightened expressions of hopelessness, agitation, or withdrawal should trigger an
immediate reassessment of the level of monitoring required (Quinlivan et al., 2016). Thorough documentation of all
observations and any changes in behavior is crucial for both ongoing care and legal considerations. Documentation
should be detailed, contemporaneous, and communicated clearly during handoffs between staff members (Harmer
et al., 2023). Suicide risk may change over time. Frequent reassessments help reduce risk, especially after any
significant event like a familial crisis, change in medical condition, or adjustment in medication (National Action
Alliance for Suicide Prevention, 2019).

Physician-Assisted Suicide
Physician-assisted suicide is a contentious issue that has implications for nursing practice. A physician provides a
terminally ill client with the means, such as a prescription for lethal medication, to end their own life (Emanuel et al.,
2016). The laws governing this action are different in each state. Nurses may find themselves in situations where
they must navigate the ethical and legal challenges associated with this practice. The American Nurses Association
(ANA) states that nurses should not participate in assisted suicide, even in jurisdictions where it is legal, because it
is inconsistent with the ethical principles and standards of the nursing profession (ANA Center for Ethics and Human
Rights, 2019). This statement does not mean that nurses should abandon clients who are considering or have
chosen this path, however. Nurses are still obligated to provide compassionate, nonjudgmental care and respect the
client's autonomy while maintaining a focus on alleviating suffering (ANA Center for Ethics and Human Rights,
2019).

Planning Nursing Care for a Suicidal Client

Planning nursing care for suicidal clients necessitates a meticulous, comprehensive, and systematic approach. The
immediate priority involves ensuring the client's safety. The nurse should initiate suicide precautions. One suicide
precaution includes maintaining a safe environment by removing items that could be used for self-harm or suicide,
such as sharp objects, cords, and certain medications (Pinals, 2019). Regular and meticulous client monitoring is
also a crucial aspect of suicide precautions, with clients being checked at frequent, unpredictable intervals to
prevent any potential suicide attempts (Bowers et al., 2015). Ensuring that clients are not left alone and have
someone to talk to can help alleviate feelings of isolation, which often accompany suicidal ideation.

Communication with suicidal clients also plays a critical role in nursing care planning (Falcone & Timmons-Mitchell,
2018). Develop a therapeutic relationship that encourages the client to express their feelings and thoughts openly.
It is often a relief for clients to talk openly about their thoughts, and this also decreases isolation. This connection
allows for a better understanding of the client's emotional state and suicidal ideation, which can guide the
implementation of appropriate nursing interventions. The nurse should never be reluctant to ask the client if they
are contemplating suicide or self-harm because asking a client if they are suicidal will not put the thought into their
head. If the client answers that they are, then the nurse has to ask which method of harm the client is contemplating
so the nurse can carry out a risk assessment of the client and initiate protective precautions as necessary.

Providing crisis information to a suicidal client in a health-care setting is a critical and sensitive task. It is crucial to
ensure that the information is accurate, easily understandable, and actionable. Make sure to provide numbers for
emergency services and crisis hotlines, such as the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988 (988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline,
2022). It is important to assist the client in developing a personalized safety plan that includes identifying warning
signs, coping strategies, and emergency contacts. Educating family members or close friends about the signs of
suicide and how to offer support is essential in reducing suicide risk. In addition, integrating family members into
the care plan helps create a supportive environment for the client during their recovery. Managing suicidal clients
takes a multidisciplinary team approach. A team consisting of psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and
nursing staff can provide holistic care that addresses a client's physical and mental health needs (Moscardini et al.,
2020).

     Years in Practice: Eleven
     Clinical Setting: Intensive care unit in a large city hospital
     Geographic Location: Ohio

     Alex's colleagues admire her for her technical skills, kindness, and empathetic nature. She has always been
     someone who could smile through the most challenging shifts. Yet, underneath this professional façade, Alex was
     silently fighting a battle, one of despair, loneliness, and mental health deterioration.

     Alex had been an RN for over a decade. She was passionate about her job, but the stress, long hours, and
     emotionally taxing situations gradually took a toll on her mental health. Like many health-care professionals, Alex
     perceived her struggles as a sign of personal weakness. Unfortunately, the professional culture--where showing
     vulnerability looks weak--reinforced her perspective. Two years into her ICU tenure, Alex started experiencing
     symptoms of depression and anxiety. She felt an overwhelming sense of sadness, struggled to sleep, and lost
     interest in things she previously enjoyed. She started making minor mistakes at work, felt perpetually tired, and had
     trouble concentrating.

     One night, after a particularly grueling shift where she witnessed the death of a young client, Alex felt an
     overwhelming sense of hopelessness. She found herself contemplating suicide, a sign that her mental health had
     deteriorated. She felt alone and did not know where to turn. Despite the despair, a small part of Alex recognized that
     she needed help. She bravely confided in a close colleague about her thoughts of suicide. The colleague
     immediately connected her with mental health resources, including the hospital's employee assistance program.

     Alex sought professional help from a psychologist specializing in health-care worker mental health, and she was
     diagnosed with severe depression and burnout. She was advised to take a leave of absence from work to focus on
     her recovery. The psychologist recommended a multipronged treatment approach that included CBT to help change
     negative thinking patterns, mindfulness practices to reduce stress, and an appropriate course of medication. The
     psychologist also suggested group therapy sessions where Alex could connect with other health-care professionals
     dealing with similar issues.

     The road to recovery was long for Alex, but she persevered. Her treatment helped her to regain her emotional
     footing, manage her depression, and create a toolbox to cope with the inherent stresses of her job. Finally, after
     several months, Alex could return to work, this time with a renewed spirit and an in-depth understanding of her
     mental health needs. She also became an advocate for mental health awareness within her hospital, helping to
     initiate changes in the system to recognize and address mental health concerns among staff.

     Nonsuicidal Self-Injury

     Self-harm, more formally referred to as nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), is a behavior involving deliberate self-
     inflicted harm that is not intended to result in death. NSSI usually presents as skin cutting, burning, or severe
     scratching, and is often associated with a desire to cope with distressing emotions or to communicate emotional
     pain to others (Grandclerc et al., 2016).

     The complex nature of NSSI necessitates a multifaceted approach to management and prevention. For example,
     interventions may focus on teaching alternative coping strategies and emotional regulation skills and facilitating
     supportive interpersonal relationships (Timberlake et al., 2019). NSSI is a serious concern due to its association
     with an increased risk of future suicide attempts. Therefore, health-care providers must be attentive and proactive
     in recognizing and addressing this behavior (Grandclerc et al., 2016).

     Types of Self-Harm
     Self-harm refers to a variety of behaviors that individuals engage in with the intent of deliberately causing harm to
     themselves. These behaviors can be categorized into several types based on the method of self-injury (National
     Alliance on Mental Illness, 2020b). Cutting or scratching the skin is the most common form of self-harm. This form
     of self-harm typically involves using sharp objects like knives, razors, or even the individual's fingernails to inflict

superficial to moderate injuries, primarily on the arms, legs, and torso (Mayo Clinic, 2023). Another type of self-
harm is burning, which involves applying heat or friction to the skin to cause damage. For example, individuals may
use lighters, matches, hot metals, or even heated objects like a hair straightener or an iron (Cipriano et al., 2017).
Other forms of self-harm include self-hitting, such as punching oneself or banging one's head against a wall; self-
poisoning or overdosing, which involves ingesting toxic substances or taking an excessive dose of medication; and
interference with wound healing, where individuals deliberately prevent their wounds from healing normally
(National Alliance on Mental Illness, 2020b).

While these types of self-harm may not be intended to result in suicide, they are often associated with severe
emotional distress and mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and borderline personality disorder
(Victor & Klonsky, 2014). These behaviors are a cry for help and indicate deep emotional pain. Individuals who self-
harm often struggle with intense feelings of sadness, self-loathing, emptiness, or frustration, and they may have
difficulty regulating, expressing, or understanding their feelings. Hence, health-care providers must recognize and
address these behaviors promptly. Recovery is possible with professional help, and it often involves treating any
underlying mental health conditions, improving emotional regulation skills, and developing healthier coping
mechanisms (Mayo Clinic, 2023).

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has provided a list of examples of self-harm
(https://openstax.org/r/77selfharmexmpl) that may be used by a mental health client.

Addressing Nonsuicidal Self-Injury in Care Settings
Clients admitted for other health issues may engage in NSSI while in the health-care facility. Staff should be trained
to identify signs of NSSI and assess the level of risk, including the likelihood of escalation (Cipriano et al., 2017).
Once identified, immediate steps should be taken to ensure the client's safety. This may include removing objects
that could be used for self-injury and considering relocation to a more closely monitored setting (Witt et al., 2021).
Open, nonjudgmental communication is essential for building trust. Clients should feel understood rather than
stigmatized (Witt et al., 2021). The nursing staff should continuously monitor the client's mental and emotional
state because changes may require adjustments to the treatment plan. Managing NSSI in health-care settings
involves a multidimensional approach that considers immediate safety concerns, long-term treatment options, and
the emotional well-being of both clients and health-care providers (Zhang et al., 2023).

Relationship between NSSI and Suicide Attempts
Understanding the relationship between NSSI and suicide attempts is important for effective prevention and
intervention strategies. To be clear, MSSI refers to deliberate self-harm without suicidal intent, such as cutting or
burning oneself, and is primarily used as a coping mechanism for emotional distress or to feel a sense of control
(Zhang et al., 2023). In contrast, suicide attempts involve self-harming behaviors undertaken with the intent to end
one's life (World Health Organization, 2021). NSSI can be distinguished from suicide attempts by differences in
intent, lethality, and frequency. NSSI is often repetitive and episodic, with no intention to die, whereas suicide
attempts are usually less frequent but with higher lethality and intent to die (Zhang et al., 2023).

Still, individuals engaging in NSSI are at a higher risk of later suicide attempts, making NSSI a significant predictor of
suicidal behavior (Chesin et al., 2017). Both NSSI and suicidal behaviors are indicators of severe emotional distress
and mental health issues. Therefore, the presence of either behavior warrants immediate attention from health-care
providers, who should employ a comprehensive approach to address the underlying issues contributing to these
behaviors (Zhang et al., 2023).

  CLINICAL JUDGMENT MEASUREMENT MODEL

  Importance of Clinical Judgment in NSSI

  Accurate clinical judgment is crucial in identifying and managing NSSI. It guides recognizing and analyzing cues
  during initial evaluation and diagnosis and shapes the treatment approach and ongoing monitoring. Conversely,
504  16 · Mood Disorders and Suicide

       failure to exercise sound clinical judgment can result in a lack of recognition of NSSI, an incomplete
       understanding of the client's situation, ineffective treatment strategies, and potentially serious health
       consequences. Properly assessing the severity and frequency of NSSI behaviors enables clinicians to make
       informed decisions about immediate interventions and long-term treatment plans. It is imperative for the
       health-care provider to ask the client direct questions related to self-harm potential. Therefore, improving
       clinical judgment in this area is vital for ensuring the best possible outcomes for individuals who self-harm
       ("Self-Harm: Assessment, Management and Preventing Recurrence," 2022).

     16.4 Bipolar Disorders

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define bipolar disorder
         · Describe the symptoms of bipolar disorder
         · Outline the approaches used to treat bipolar disorder

     Bipolar disorder is a chronic mental health condition characterized by fluctuating periods of intense mood states,
     often categorized as manic, hypomanic, and depressive episodes (American Psychiatric Association, 2022). During a
     manic episode, an individual may exhibit heightened energy, delusions (often of grandeur), decreased need for
     sleep, racing thoughts, rapid speech, and impulsive or reckless behavior. Hypomanic episodes are similar but less
     severe and disruptive. Conversely, depressive episodes involve symptoms, such as feelings of intense sadness,
     hopelessness, lack of energy, difficulty concentrating, and changes in sleep and appetite. These mood shifts can
     occur over weeks to months and are often interspersed with periods of relatively normal mood (American
     Psychiatric Association, 2022).

     Bipolar disorder treatment involves medication management alongside psychotherapy. Health-care providers
     should be aware that these individuals may also be at risk for co-occurring conditions, including substance use
     disorders, anxiety disorders, and suicidal ideation (American Psychiatric Association, 2022). Health-care
     professionals must develop skills for working with individuals with bipolar disorder, including communication
     strategies, empathy, and a comprehensive understanding of this condition and its treatment options.

     Definition of Bipolar Disorder

     Defined, bipolar disorder is a serious mental health condition characterized by extreme mood swings, including
     emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). When a person becomes depressed, they may feel
     sad or hopeless and lose interest or pleasure in most activities. When their mood shifts to mania or hypomania, they
     may feel euphoric, full of energy, or unusually irritable. These mood swings can affect sleep, energy, social and
     occupational activity, judgment, behavior, and the ability to think clearly. Episodes of mood swings may occur rarely
     or multiple times a year. While most people experience some emotional symptoms between episodes, some may
     not experience any (American Psychiatric Association, 2022).

     Mania Versus Hypomania
     Mania and hypomania are both mood states associated with bipolar disorder characterized by elevated or irritable
     mood, increased energy, and other specific symptoms, but they differ in their severity and impact on functioning.
     Mania is a severe form of elevated mood most of the time for seven days that may result in psychosis or necessitate
     hospitalization. Individuals experiencing mania often exhibit poor judgment, impulsivity, excessive spending,
     gambling, hypersexuality, and may engage in risky behaviors leading to inadvertent self-harm. On the other hand,
     hypomania is a milder form that typically does not impair social or occupational functioning to the extent that mania
     does and does not progress to psychosis (Jain & Mitra, 2023). While clients experiencing hypomania may show
     increased productivity or creativity, they are at risk for progressing to a manic episode or experiencing depressive
     episodes. For health-care professionals, recognizing the symptoms of mania and hypomania is crucial for timely
     intervention and treatment, which usually involves pharmacotherapy with mood stabilizers, such as lithium and
     antipsychotic medications, and may include psychotherapy (Jain & Mitra, 2023).

     Causes of Bipolar Disorder
     The exact causes of bipolar disorder are not understood fully, but it appears to be a complex interplay of genetic,

     Access for free at openstax.org
16.4 · Bipolar Disorders                                                                                                 505

neurochemical, and environmental factors. Research reveals that bipolar disorder tends to run in families, which
indicates a genetic predisposition to the disorder. Neurochemically, there may be imbalances in certain
neurotransmitters in the brain that contribute to the mood instability seen in bipolar disorder. Environmental factors,
such as high stress levels, traumatic events, or major life changes can also play a significant role in the onset of
bipolar disorder (McIntyre et al., 2022). Note, however, that not everyone with these risk factors develops the
disorder, and many people without these risk factors do develop bipolar disorder, which points to the complex
nature of its causes.

Types of Bipolar Disorder
There are several types of bipolar disorder, each differentiated by the severity and pattern of mood fluctuations.
Bipolar I disorder is characterized by manic episodes that last for at least seven days or by manic symptoms so
severe that hospitalization is required, and usually includes depressive episodes as well (American Psychiatric
Association, 2022). By contrast, bipolar II disorder involves a pattern of depressive and hypomanic episodes but not
the full-blown manic episodes observed in bipolar I disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 2022). Cyclothymic
disorder, or cyclothymia, is a milder form of bipolar disorder that involves periods of hypomanic symptoms and
periods of depressive symptoms lasting for at least two years (one year in children and adolescents) (American
Psychiatric Association, 2022). There is also bipolar disorder "other specified" and "unspecified," which include
bipolar-like symptoms but do not meet the specific criteria for the other types (American Psychiatric Association,
2022).

        CULTURAL CONTEXT

Cultural Differences Relating to Elation

Elation is a universal human emotion characterized by a sense of joy, exhilaration, and high spirits. How this emotion
is experienced, expressed, and interpreted differs greatly when accounting for cultural and age-related factors.
Understanding these differences is key to fostering effective cross-cultural and intergenerational communication
(Lim, 2016).

Many individuals of East Asian cultures, such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean people, experience and express
elation in a subdued, controlled manner. These cultures tend to be collectivist and therefore value harmony,
adjusting, and conformity. Demonstrating excessive emotion, even positive emotions like elation, can be seen as a
disruption of harmony or a lack of self-control. This tends to be true across all age groups (Ip et al., 2021).

In contrast, many Western cultures (such as American and some European) tend to express elation and other
emotions more openly. People in these cultures prefer emotions they can express more exuberantly than those
emotions that are generally not expressed as enthusiastically (Lim, 2016). There is generally less stigma around
showing strong emotions; such expressions are often associated with individualism and influencing others (Lim,
2016). Other cultures may express elation in other ways. In general, a culture's expression and feeling of elation
varies according to what they value, such as communal activities or celebration.

Younger generations, who are generally more connected globally through technology and social media, may share
and express their elation differently than older generations. For example, this could be through posts, pictures, or
videos on social media platforms. On the other hand, older generations might prefer to express elation more
personally or directly, such as sharing their joy with close friends or family members in person.

Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder

Bipolar disorder is typified by extreme shifts in mood, energy, and activity levels that interfere with day-to-day
functioning. Symptoms vary across the manic and depressive phases. Manic episodes can be characterized by:
feeling overly happy, energized, and restless; rapid pressured speech; impulsive behavior; experiencing delusions
and a decreased need for sleep. During depressive episodes, symptoms may include feeling intensely sad or
hopeless; loss of energy; difficulty concentrating; changes in eating, sleeping, or other habitual behaviors; and in
severe cases, suicidal thoughts or attempts. Mixed episodes, characterized by symptoms of both mania and
depression, can also occur (NIMH, 2023). It is important to note that these symptoms can be severe and differ from
the normal ups and downs most people experience.
506  16 · Mood Disorders and Suicide

     A state of extreme happiness or exhilaration called elation can present as a symptom in certain mood disorders,
     such as bipolar disorder and cyclothymic disorder. A prolonged period of elation, as described previously, is
     considered mania. The types of elation in these contexts can be categorized as hypomanic elation and manic
     elation. Hypomanic elation is a characteristic symptom of hypomania, a mood state one step down from full-blown
     mania. Individuals experiencing hypomanic elation may feel extremely energetic, talkative, and overly confident.
     Despite these intense feelings, hypomanic individuals can typically carry on with their daily activities, though they
     may engage in risky or impulsive behaviors due to the elevated mood.

     On the other hand, manic elation is a symptom of a manic episode, as seen in bipolar I disorder. This form of elation
     is more severe and disruptive than hypomanic elation. Individuals experiencing manic elation may feel invincible or
     omnipotent and often engage in reckless activities without considering the consequences. This intense level of
     elation can impair one's ability to function normally and may necessitate hospitalization to ensure the safety of the
     individual and others (American Psychiatric Association, 2022).

     Treatment of Bipolar Disorder

     The treatment of bipolar disorder generally includes a combination of medication and psychotherapy to manage and
     mitigate symptoms (Mayo Clinic, 2022). Mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and atypical antipsychotics often play a
     role in treatment (NIMH, 2023). Psychotherapy, including CBT, family-focused therapy, and interpersonal and social
     rhythm therapy (IPSRT), can also be an essential part of treatment (Mayo Clinic, 2021). In some cases, ECT or other
     brain stimulation therapies may work when other treatments are ineffective or if the person's symptoms are severe
     (NIMH, 2023). Importantly, treatment plans should be tailored to the individual because what works best may differ
     from person to person.

     Medications
     Medication is a crucial part of treatment for bipolar disorder, aiming to stabilize moods and help control symptoms
     (NIMH, 2023). Mood stabilizers, such as lithium and valproate, are often the first line of treatment, particularly for
     managing manic episodes. Antidepressants can manage depressive episodes, though they are typically prescribed
     alongside a mood stabilizer like lithium to prevent the onset of a manic episode. Antipsychotic medications, such as
     olanzapine or quetiapine olanzapine, may work if other drugs fail to control the symptoms of mania or depression
     (Mayo Clinic, 2022). In some instances, benzodiazepines, a type of antianxiety medication, may temporarily relieve
     acute symptoms, such as restlessness or insomnia (NIMH, 2023). It is important to note that medication needs can
     change over time, so it is vital to monitor medications continually (Mayo Clinic, 2022).

     Lithium, a mood stabilizer commonly used to treat bipolar disorder, comes with a number of safety concerns:

         · Therapeutic range: Lithium has a narrow therapeutic range, meaning the difference between a therapeutic
             dose and a toxic dose is small. The therapeutic range for lithium is very narrow, typically 0.8 and 1.2 mEq/L for
             acute goals and 0.8 and 1.0 mEq/L for maintenance goals, with the toxicity levels beginning at 2.0 mEq/L.
             Regular monitoring of blood levels is required to ensure safety (Chokhawala et al., 2024).

         · Kidney damage: Long-term use of lithium can lead to kidney damage or even chronic kidney disease. Regular
             monitoring of kidney function is essential.

         · Thyroid issues: Lithium can interfere with the function of the thyroid gland, causing hypothyroidism, requiring
             regular thyroid function tests.

         · Side effects: Common side effects of lithium can be disruptive and include thirst, frequent urination, weight
             gain, memory problems, hand tremors, and gastrointestinal problems.

         · Drug interactions: Lithium can interact with other drugs, such as diuretics, NSAIDs, and certain
             antihypertensive medications, leading to increased lithium levels and potential toxicity.

         · Overdose risk: Overdosing on lithium can be life-threatening. Signs of lithium overdose can include diarrhea,
             vomiting, drowsiness, muscle weakness, and tremor. If not treated promptly, overdose can lead to seizures,
             coma, or even death.

     While lithium is a very effective medication, its use requires careful monitoring due to its inverse relationship with
     sodium, to ensure client safety. There is a need for dietary education. It is also important that clients understand the
     effects of dehydration with lithium knowing that increased sodium will deplete lithium, causing increased sodium
     presentation. It is essential to understand the signs and symptoms of lithium toxicity; early recognition and
     intervention can be lifesaving. Early signs of lithium toxicity include the following:

     Access for free at openstax.org
16.4 · Bipolar Disorders                                                                                               507

    · Gastrointestinal symptoms: Nausea, metallic taste in mouth, vomiting, and diarrhea are among the early signs.
    · Fine hand tremors: An increase in the tremors that many clients experience when initially starting lithium.
    · Generalized weakness: Clients may complain of feeling weak or fatigued.
    · Thirst and polyuria: Increased thirst and frequent urination can be indicative of beginning toxicity.

Signs of moderate lithium toxicity include the following:

    · Coarse tremors: The tremors may become more severe and noticeable.
    · Confusion: The client may start to become mentally disoriented.
    · Muscle hyperirritability: Symptoms like twitching or hypertonia.
    · Unsteady gait: Trouble with balance and coordination.

Signs of severe toxicity include the following:

    · Seizures: Uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain
    · Coma: Loss of consciousness
    · Oliguria or Anuria: Reduced or absent urine output, potentially leading to kidney failure
    · Arrhythmias: Irregularities in heart rate and rhythm

Nursing interventions for suspected lithium toxicity include immediate notification of health-care providers,
cessation of lithium administration, and close monitoring of vital signs and lithium blood levels. Depending on the
severity of the symptoms, hemodialysis may be required (Hedya et al., 2022).

Nurses should review all of the medications being taken by each client on lithium to ensure no contraindications and
provide client education on taking lithium and the side effects and safety concerns. Adherence to the medication
may be a concern, particularly with the occurrence of side effects, such as weight gain, and because clients who are
entering a manic phase may deny the presence of the disorder and need for medication.

Psychotherapeutic Approaches to Dealing with Bipolar Disorder
Psychotherapeutic interventions are important in managing bipolar disorder alongside medication. CBT can help
individuals understand the patterns of their thoughts and behaviors and develop strategies to manage symptoms
and prevent relapses (Özdel et al., 2021). Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT) aims to stabilize daily
rhythms, such as sleep, wake, and mealtimes, which can be particularly beneficial for individuals with bipolar
disorder; disruptions in these areas can precipitate manic or depressive episodes (Mayo Clinic, 2021). Family-
focused therapy involves family members and concentrates on enhancing family communication, problem-solving,
and coping skills, which can be crucial for managing the disorder (Miklowitz & Chung, 2016). Psychoeducation,
which involves teaching individuals with bipolar disorder and their families about the disorder, is another key
psychosocial intervention. It helps improve treatment compliance and decreases the likelihood of relapses
(Miklowitz & Chung, 2016). Each of these approaches can be tailored to the individual's unique needs and
circumstances to optimize the management of the disorder.

Planning Nursing Care for a Client with Bipolar Disorder
Planning nursing care for a client with bipolar disorder requires an individualized, holistic approach that considers
the person's unique symptoms, triggers, and needs (Hernández-Gómez et al., 2021). The first step is typically a
comprehensive assessment of the client's physical and mental health and their personal and social situation to
identify specific areas of need. Next, developing a care plan should include elements of psychoeducation, helping
the client understand their condition, treatment options, and strategies for self-management. Nursing care also
involves monitoring the client's mood, behavior, and response to medication and communicating this information to
the health-care team.

In acute phases, the focus may be on maintaining safety, providing support, managing symptoms, and stabilizing
mood. In the maintenance phase, nursing care should emphasize recovery and the prevention of future episodes,
which can include lifestyle counseling, promoting medication adherence, encouraging participation in therapy, and
coordinating care with other health-care providers (Hernández-Gómez et al., 2021). Throughout this process, it is
essential to involve the client in decision-making, support their autonomy, and respect their dignity.

Interacting with clients who have a bipolar disorder can be both rewarding and challenging. These individuals often
go through phases of manic and depressive episodes, and knowing how to effectively communicate during these
508  16 · Mood Disorders and Suicide

     different stages is crucial (SAMHSA, 2016). During manic phases, the client may exhibit elevated mood, increased
     activity, hostility, and grandiose thoughts. It is essential for the nurse to maintain a calm demeanor, provide concise
     and clear directions, and avoid challenging the client's grandiosity to prevent escalation. In contrast, during
     depressive phases, the client may be withdrawn, exhibit low energy, and may even have suicidal thoughts. It is vital
     to employ empathetic and active listening, and to consult the mental health team for additional evaluation and
     treatment, if necessary (SAMHSA, 2020b). Understanding the specific needs and symptoms of clients' bipolar
     disorder can lead to more effective nursing care and better outcomes (Novick & Swartz, 2019).

             REAL RN STORIES

     Nurse: Joan, RN
     Years in Practice: Four
     Clinical Setting: Crisis intervention unit in a regional hospital
     Geographic Location: Oregon

     Joan is looking after Sarah who is a thirty-five-year-old client diagnosed with bipolar disorder. She was in a manic
     phase upon admission, extremely talkative and agitated. Her medical chart indicated a history of medication
     noncompliance, which often exacerbated her symptoms. The challenge was to keep her safe while her medication
     was adjusted. She was so full of energy and grandiose plans that she wanted to leave the hospital immediately to
     "change the world." By using a calm, clear, and firm approach, health-care providers managed to convince her to
     stay for observation. During the manic phase, clients like Sarah often feel invincible, which can lead to risky
     behaviors. It is crucial for health-care providers to ensure a safe environment and encourage medication
     compliance to stabilize their mood (SAMHSA, 2023a).

     A week later, Sarah began displaying depressive behaviors. She became withdrawn and started expressing feelings
     of worthlessness. She also began to discuss suicidal thoughts. The nurse's role transitioned from setting firm
     boundaries to providing emotional support and vigilant monitoring for suicidal ideation (Twivy et al., 2023).

     With medication adjustments and a multidisciplinary approach involving psychiatrists, social workers, and mental
     health nurses, Sarah began to stabilize. With proper care she was able to transition from extreme behaviors to a
     more balanced state. This transition emphasizes the importance of holistic care and teamwork in managing complex
     conditions like bipolar disorder (Skjærpe et al., 2022).

Summary

16.1 Depressive Disorders

The etiology of mood disorders involves genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. These
disorders are often now looked at as a spectrum of symptoms rather than as discrete categories of symptoms.
Diagnosis is based on detailed clinical evaluation and symptomatology, guided by criteria from diagnostic manuals,
such as the DSM-5. Managing mood disorders typically involves a combination of pharmacological and
psychotherapeutic interventions. Antidepressants and mood stabilizers are considered the gold standards of
medication treatment, while cognitive behavioral, interpersonal, dialectical, and family-focused therapies are
common forms of psychotherapy. Early detection and appropriate management are critical to improving outcomes
and enhancing the quality of life for individuals with mood disorders (Sekhon & Gupta, 2020).

16.2 The Spectrum of Mood Disorders

Depressive disorders, a category of mood disorders, are characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, loss of
interest or pleasure in activities, and various physical and cognitive symptoms that cause significant distress or
impairment in daily life. Major depressive disorder, the most severe form, and dysthymia, a chronic but milder form,
are the primary types. These disorders result from a complex interplay of genetic, biological, environmental, and
psychosocial factors. Accurate diagnosis is crucial and involves a thorough clinical evaluation, often using diagnostic
criteria from the DSM-5.

Management typically involves a combination of pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions. Nurses play
a pivotal role in managing care for individuals with depressive disorders. They protect the safety of the client,
monitor clients' responses to treatment, manage medication side effects, provide client and family education, and
offer emotional support.

16.3 Self-Harm and Suicide

Understanding and effectively managing suicide and NSSI is critical for nursing professionals. Early identification of
signs is pivotal, and this is where clinical judgment comes into play. Recognize that suicide and NSSI are distinct
phenomena, requiring different intervention approaches. For suicide, risk assessment tools like the SAD PERSONS
scale can be valuable, but should be supplemented with clinical insights. Clients at high risk for suicide may require
continuous monitoring and potentially immediate intervention. In the case of NSSI, the role of the family, ethical
dilemmas, resource allocation, and cultural considerations all require nuanced clinical judgment. Health-care
providers must synthesize clinical data and contextual factors to make informed decisions regarding risk
assessment, intervention strategies, and long-term care plans for both conditions. By integrating evidence-based
practice with individual client needs, nurses can contribute significantly to improving client outcomes (National
Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, 2018).

16.4 Bipolar Disorders

Bipolar disorders are chronic mental health conditions characterized by severe mood swings that include episodes
of depression and mania. Bipolar disorders are categorized into bipolar I, bipolar II, and cyclothymic disorder, each
varying in the intensity and frequency of these mood episodes. Symptoms of these disorders fluctuate based on the
phase of the disorder: manic episodes may involve high energy, euphoria, and hyperactivity, while depressive
episodes may result in feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and lethargy.

The treatment approach for bipolar disorder typically comprises a combination of medication and psychotherapy.
Common medications include mood stabilizers, such as lithium, antidepressants, and atypical antipsychotics. In
addition, CBT, family-focused therapy, interpersonal and social rhythm therapy, and psychoeducation have proven
effective in managing the disorder and preventing relapses.

17.5 Dissociative Identity Disorder
INTRODUCTION Stress is commonly understood as a physical, mental, or emotional strain or tension that results
from challenges or adverse situations. It can emerge from external pressures, such as work demands or
interpersonal conflicts, and internal pressures, such as personal expectations or chronic health conditions. While
short-term stress can be beneficial for alertness, motivation, and performance, chronic stress, when left
unmanaged, can negatively affect physical and psychological well-being (American Psychological Association,
2020).
Anxiety, OCD, and trauma-stressor disorders are a group of mental health conditions prevalent in society and can
significantly affect individuals' lives. These disorders can cause distress, dysfunction, and disability in individuals,
making it important for nurses to understand their underlying causes, symptoms, and treatment options. The causes
of anxiety, OCD, and trauma-stressor disorders are complex and multifactorial, involving genetic, environmental,
and biological factors. Effective treatments for these disorders include medication, psychotherapy, and lifestyle
changes.

     17.1 Stress and Anxiety

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define stress and explain how the body reacts to stress
         · Describe coping strategies for stress
         · Discuss the prevalence and impact of anxiety
         · Outline approaches for managing and treating anxiety

     Stress is a normal part of life. Everyone experiences it in one form or another, though individual reactions to stress
     can vary depending on a person's personality, coping skills, and support systems. Some individuals may be able to
     handle stress effectively, while others may struggle to cope with stress and experience negative outcomes. Stress
     and anxiety, while closely related, are distinct concepts in psychological research and practice. The body's response
     to external pressures or threats, often resulting in physiological and emotional reactions is called stress. It can be
     either short-lived (acute) or long-term (chronic) (American Psychological Association, 2022). On the other hand,
     anxiety is a heightened state of arousal and worry that may not always have a clear external cause. It can manifest
     as general apprehension about the future or, in more severe cases, as clinically recognized anxiety disorders. While
     everyone experiences stress and anxiety to some degree, excessive or chronic experiences of these states can
     affect overall health and well-being (American Psychological Association, 2022) (Figure 17.2).

     Definition of Stress

     Many factors, including work, relationships, finances, and health problems, can cause stress. Stress is the brain's
     initial response to a demand or challenge. When confronted with a situation requiring attention or action, the brain's
     hypothalamus initiates a series of chemical releases, activating the sympathetic nervous and adrenal-cortical
     systems. This activation releases stress hormones, particularly cortisol and adrenaline, which prepare the body for
     the "fight-or-flight" response. The fight-or-flight response allows individuals to respond rapidly to environmental
     threats. While this acute stress response can be adaptive in the short term, helping individuals react swiftly to
     imminent threats, chronic activation due to repeated or sustained stressors can negatively affect physical and
     mental health (Chu et al., 2022). This response can result in physical symptoms, such as increased heart rate, blood
     pressure, and breathing rate. In addition to physical symptoms, stress can cause emotional and behavioral
     reactions, such as anxiety, depression, irritability, and changes in eating and sleeping patterns.

One approach to measuring stress uses Life Change Units (https://openstax.org/r/77lifechgunit) which involve
calculating level of stress. Note that the same event may affect adults differently than it affects youths.

Reactions to stress vary from person to person and can be influenced by factors, such as genetics, personality,
coping skills, support systems, and past experiences. Identifying and understanding individual reactions is crucial
for developing effective stress management strategies (Fink, 2016). Generally, stress reactions can be classified into
three main categories: physiological, emotional, and behavioral. These responses are the body's way of adapting to
a perceived threat or challenge (Figure 17.3).

   FIGURE 17.3 Stress can have numerous effects on the body. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

Physiological Reactions to Stress
Physiological reactions are the body's physical responses to stress. These reactions are primarily driven by the
activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the release of stress hormones, such as cortisol and adrenaline.
Some common physiological stress reactions include increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, rapid breathing,
tensed muscles, sweating, digestive issues (nausea, diarrhea, or constipation), weakened immune system, and
insomnia or sleep disturbances (Figure 17.4).

     FIGURE 17.4 The fight-or-flight response is a physiological reaction that can cause a number of physical effects. (attribution: Copyright

     The fight-or-flight response, also known as the acute stress response, is a physiological reaction that occurs when
     an individual perceives a threat or a challenging situation. This response is an evolutionary adaptation that helps
     prepare the body to either confront the threat (fight) or escape it (flight). When the response is triggered, several
     physiological changes occur in the body:

         · The heart pumps faster to increase blood flow and oxygen supply to the muscles and vital organs.
         · Arteries constrict, raising blood pressure to deliver more oxygen and nutrients to the muscles.
         · Breathing becomes faster and shallower to take in more oxygen.
         · The liver releases stored glucose and fat to provide the body with additional energy.
         · Pupils dilate to improve vision and awareness of the environment.
         · Blood is redirected from less critical systems (like digestion) to essential muscles and organs (brain, heart,

             and skeletal muscles) to enhance physical performance.
         · Muscles tense up to prepare for action, improving reaction time and strength.
         · Senses become sharper, enhancing the body's ability to detect potential threats and respond accordingly.

     These physiological changes enable the body to respond quickly and effectively to the perceived threat. However,
     the fight-or-flight response is designed for short-term situations, and prolonged activation can negatively affect
     physical and mental health, leading to chronic stress, anxiety, or other stress-related disorders (Fink, 2016).

     Stress affects the body physically in various ways, and its effects can be classified into short-term and long-term
     consequences. Short-term effects of stress include increased heart rate and blood pressure, rapid breathing, tensed
     muscles, pupil dilation, temporary digestive issues, and increased blood glucose levels.

Short-term stress can be beneficial in some situations by enhancing performance and helping individuals cope with
immediate challenges or threats. In contrast, long-term stress--also called chronic or prolonged stress--can have
detrimental effects on physical and mental health (Fink, 2016):

    · Long-term stress can weaken the immune system.
    · It can lead to cardiovascular issues, such as persistently elevated blood pressure and heart rate, which can

        contribute to the development of hypertension, heart disease, and stroke.
    · It increases the risk of developing anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues.
    · If not resolved, it can lead to insomnia or other sleep-related problems, which affect overall health and well-

        being.
    · It can cause changes in appetite, leading to overeating or undereating and, subsequently, weight gain or loss.
    · It can lead to long-term digestive issues, such as irritable bowel syndrome, ulcers, or gastroesophageal reflux

        disease.
    · It can disrupt the menstrual cycle in women, cause erectile dysfunction in men, and reduce fertility in both

        sexes.
    · It can exacerbate conditions like acne, eczema, and psoriasis.

Emotional Reactions to Stress
Stress can also manifest in emotional responses. Different individuals may experience different emotional reactions
to stress. Some common emotional responses include anxiety or worry, irritability or anger, feelings of sadness or
helplessness, mood swings, difficulty concentrating or making decisions, and emotional exhaustion or burnout
(Zhaoyang et al., 2020).

Behavioral Reactions to Stress
Stress can also lead to changes in behavior as individuals try to cope with or adapt to their stressors. Some common
behavioral reactions to stress are changes in eating habits (overeating or undereating), sleep disturbances
(insomnia or oversleeping), substance misuse (alcohol, drugs, or medications), social withdrawal or isolation,
procrastination or avoidance of tasks, aggression or irritability toward others, and decreased work performance or
productivity (Attia et al., 2022).

Coping with Stress

Coping with stress is essential for maintaining physical, mental, and emotional well-being. There are numerous
strategies and techniques that can help individuals manage stress more effectively that nurses need to promote
with clients. Some focus on the source of stress, while others focus on the emotional or physiological response.
Other coping methods involve engaging in a healthy lifestyle with adequate social support and limiting exposure to
known stressors (Greenberg, 2017).

Coping with stress and fostering resilience are critical for navigating life's challenges. An individual's ability to
bounce back from adversity, trauma, or significant stress represents their resilience. It does not mean avoiding
stress or hardship but developing the skills and attributes necessary to adapt and recover. Factors contributing to
resilience include positive relationships, optimism, the ability to make realistic plans and carry them out, and
effective communication. By combining effective coping strategies with resilience-building practices, individuals can
not only navigate challenges, but also thrive in the face of them (American Psychological Association, 2022).

Problem-Focused Strategies
Problem-focused coping strategies--removing oneself from a stressful situation, practicing time
management--involve directly addressing the source of stress by taking action to change, manage, or eliminate the
stressor. Problem-focused coping strategies can be effective in managing stress when the stressor is within one's
control but less effective for stressors that are outside one's control. In such cases, emotion-focused coping
strategies, which involve managing emotional reactions to stress, may be more appropriate (Schoenmakers et al.,
2015).

Emotion-Focused Strategies
Emotion-focused coping strategies aim to help individuals manage and regulate their emotional responses to
stressors. Examples of these strategies include seeking social support, where individuals may confide in trusted
friends or family members to gain understanding or emotional solace. Distraction techniques redirect one's
528  17 · Anxiety, OCD, and Trauma-Stressor Disorders

     attention away from distressing emotions. Meditation and mindfulness practices can help individuals remain
     anchored in the present moment, reducing feelings of stress. These strategies can be especially beneficial when
     stressors are beyond one's control. Different strategies work for different individuals, and a combination of problem-
     focused and emotion-focused methods may be most effective in managing stress (Schoenmakers et al., 2015).

     A wide range of techniques can help reduce the effects of stress on the body and mind and improve one's overall
     well-being. Incorporating one or more of the following techniques into daily life can significantly benefit personal
     and professional well-being (Davis et al., 2019).

         · Deep breathing exercises: Slow, deep breaths can activate the body's relaxation response, counteracting
             stress and promoting calm.

         · Progressive muscle relaxation: This technique involves systematically tensing and relaxing different muscle
             groups to release physical tension and promote relaxation.

         · Visualization or guided imagery: Imagining a peaceful, calming scene or environment can help reduce stress
             and promote relaxation.

         · Mindfulness and meditation: Practicing mindfulness or meditation can help individuals become more aware of
             their emotions, thoughts, and bodily sensations, allowing them to manage stress more effectively.

         · Cognitive restructuring: Reevaluating and reframing negative thoughts or beliefs can help change one's
             perspective and reduce emotional stress.

         · Assertiveness training: Developing assertive communication skills can help individuals express their needs
             and preferences effectively, improving relationships and reducing stress.

         · Time management: Prioritizing tasks, setting realistic goals, and creating schedules can help manage time
             more effectively and reduce stress related to workload or deadlines.

         · Problem-solving: These techniques involve analyzing the stressor and identifying potential solutions, breaking
             the problem into smaller, manageable tasks, and creating an action plan to tackle each task systematically.

         · Exercise: Regular physical activity can help reduce stress, improve mood, and promote overall well-being.
         · Seeking social support: Connecting with friends, family, or support groups can provide emotional support,

             encouragement, and a sense of belonging during stressful times.
         · Techniques, such as mindfulness meditation, yoga (Figure 17.5), tai chi, and qigong, combine physical

             movement with breath work and mental focus to promote relaxation and reduce stress.
         · The traditional Chinese medicine practice of acupuncture involves inserting thin needles into specific points

             on the body to promote balance and reduce stress.
         · Massage therapy can help release physical tension, improve circulation, and promote relaxation.
         · The use of essential oils can help reduce stress and promote relaxation. Lavender, bergamot, and chamomile

             are some examples of essential oils with calming properties.
         · Some dietary supplements, such as omega-3 fatty acids, magnesium, and ashwagandha, may have stress-

             reducing properties.
         · Cognitive behavioral therapy involves changing negative thought patterns and behaviors to reduce stress and

             improve coping skills.
         · In some cases, prescription medications, such as antidepressants, anxiolytics, or beta-blockers, may help

             manage stress.

Additionally, dietary choices play a role in stress management. A balanced diet rich in nutrient-dense foods can
enhance brain function and provide sustained energy, potentially moderating stress-related mood fluctuations
(Hepsomali & Groeger, 2021). Sleep is also foundational to cognitive and emotional functioning and coping with
stress; research indicates that adults who regularly obtain adequate hours of restorative sleep are better equipped
to handle daily stressors and exhibit improved mood regulation (Vandekerckhove & Wang, 2017). With its capacity
to evoke emotions, music has been identified as a powerful therapeutic tool, offering listeners an avenue for
emotional release and relaxation (de Witte et al., 2022). The presence of pets, especially dogs and cats, has been
linked to reduced stress levels due to their ability to provide unconditional love, tactile comfort, and companionship
(Grajfoner et al., 2021). Spiritual involvement, whether through organized religion or personal practices, can offer
individuals a sense of purpose and community, providing a broader perspective on life's challenges and a reservoir
of strength (Yan et al., 2019).

TABLE 17.1 Common Defense Mechanisms (Bailey & Pico, 2020)

Defense mechanisms are not inherently harmful, as they can temporarily help individuals navigate stressful
situations. If an individual overuses or only relies on defense mechanisms, however, it may adversely affect personal
growth and self-awareness (Sekowski, 2022). When addressing the use of defense mechanisms by clients, nurses
should employ active listening and nonjudgmental communication rather than confronting the defense mechanism
directly, which may exacerbate the client's stress or anxiety. Create a safe and trusting environment where clients
feel understood and respected. Open-ended questions encourage clients to explore and express their feelings.
Client education might be helpful when appropriate, but it is essential to approach this with sensitivity, ensuring it
does not invalidate the client's feelings or experiences. Through empathy, patience, and self-awareness, nurses can
support clients in navigating their defense mechanisms to benefit their overall well-being (Bailey & Pico, 2020).

Prevalence and Impact of Anxiety

Anxiety, or feelings of fear, dread, or uneasiness, is a natural and normal emotional response to stress or threat.
When anxiety becomes excessive or persistent, however, it can interfere with daily activities and impact an
individual's quality of life. Anxiety can range from mild to severe and can present differently in each individual. If left
untreated, it can significantly affect an individual's mental and physical health (American Psychiatric Association,
2013).

        PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Stress and Anxiety in Nursing Students

Stress and anxiety in nursing students can arise from academic pressures, clinical experiences, or the impending
responsibility of client care.

Common triggers of stress and anxiety in nursing students include:

    · clinical mistakes or perceived errors
    · fear of harming clients
    · high academic workload
    · balancing personal, work, and academic lives
    · peer and instructor evaluations
532  17 · Anxiety, OCD, and Trauma-Stressor Disorders

     Manifestations of stress and anxiety include:

         · reduced cognitive function and focus
         · impaired clinical decision-making
         · decrease in academic performance
         · physical symptoms, such as insomnia, headaches, or palpitations
         · emotional symptoms, such as feelings of inadequacy and depression

     Coping strategies for stress and anxiety include:

         · peer support and mentorship
         · stress management and relaxation techniques
         · professional counseling services
         · adequate preparation and training for clinical settings
         · feedback and positive reinforcement from instructors

     Anxiety among nursing students is a significant concern that can influence their academic performance, clinical
     experiences, and overall well-being (Comparcini et al., 2022).

     Causes of Anxiety
     Anxiety disorder is a complex mental health condition stemming from, and exacerbated by, various genetic,
     biological, and environmental factors. Scientists believe genetic factors play a role in the development of anxiety:
     Studies have shown that individuals with a family history of anxiety disorders are more likely to develop the
     condition (Bandelow & Michaelis, 2015). Brain development is another crucial factor in the development of anxiety.
     The amygdala, responsible for processing emotional responses, has been shown to be hyperactive in individuals
     with anxiety disorders (Bandelow & Michaelis, 2015). Additionally, the prefrontal cortex, responsible for regulating
     emotional responses, may not function properly in individuals with anxiety.

     Environmental factors, such as parenting style, life events, and social influences, can also contribute to the
     development of anxiety. For example, parental overprotection, criticism, and rejection have been linked to increased
     anxiety in children. Traumatic life events, such as abuse or neglect, can also increase the risk of developing anxiety
     disorders. Social influences, such as peer pressure and exposure to stressful environments, can also contribute to
     the development of anxiety (Bandelow & Michaelis, 2015).

     Anxiety has been examined and interpreted from various theoretical perspectives over the years. The cognitive
     perspective emphasizes the role of maladaptive thoughts and beliefs in the development of anxiety disorders, while
     the behavioral perspective focuses on the role of learning and conditioning. The psychodynamic perspective
     suggests that anxiety arises from unresolved conflicts and repressed impulses. In contrast, the humanistic
     perspective emphasizes the importance of self-actualization and personal growth in preventing and treating anxiety
     disorders. The biological perspective examines the role of neurotransmitters and brain structures in the
     development of anxiety disorders. This perspective emphasizes the interaction between genetic and environmental
     factors, as research has shown that anxiety disorders can be inherited (Barlow & Durand, 2015).

     Incidence of Anxiety
     Anxiety is a prevalent mental health condition affecting millions of individuals worldwide. In the United States alone,
     an estimated 19.1 percent of adults had an anxiety disorder in the past year. The prevalence of any anxiety disorder
     was higher for females (23.4 percent) than for males (14.3 percent) but was similar across age groups. An estimated
     31.1 percent of U.S. adults experience an anxiety disorder at some time in their lives (National Institute of Mental
     Health, 2023).

     Among anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed conditions,
     affecting 6.8 million adults or 3.1 percent of the U.S. population (Anxiety and Depression Association of America,
     2022). Panic disorder and social anxiety disorder (SAD) are also prevalent, with reported twelve-month prevalence
     rates of 2.7 percent and 7.1 percent, respectively (Anxiety and Depression Association of America, 2022). Specific
     phobias affect 19.3 million adults, or 9.1 percent of the U.S. population (Anxiety and Depression Association of
     America, 2022).

Signs and Symptoms of Anxiety
Anxiety is characterized by feelings of fear, apprehension, and unease, often accompanied by physical symptoms,
such as sweating, palpitations, and shortness of breath. According to the American Psychiatric Association (APA),
the signs and symptoms of anxiety can include excessive worry or fear about a specific situation or object,
avoidance of certain situations, panic attacks, restlessness, irritability, muscle tension, and difficulty sleeping. In
addition, individuals with anxiety may experience gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea or diarrhea, and
difficulty concentrating or completing daily tasks (2013). Specific signs and symptoms are listed in Table 17.2.

TABLE 17.2 Signs and Symptoms of Anxiety

Techniques to Measure Anxiety
Because anxiety is a subjective experience, it can be challenging to measure objectively. Several techniques are
available to assess anxiety levels in individuals (Rose & Devine, 2014). One commonly used method is for
individuals to self-report information about their subjective experiences of anxiety, for example, through interviews
534  17 · Anxiety, OCD, and Trauma-Stressor Disorders

     or questionnaires. These measures can include the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Beck Anxiety
     Inventory (BAI), which assess general and specific anxiety symptoms, respectively (Julian, 2011).

     Another technique is to monitor changes in the body's physiological responses to anxiety, such as heart rate, blood
     pressure, and respiration rate. These measures can be obtained using instruments like electrocardiograms (ECGs),
     electroencephalograms (EEGs), and skin conductance response (SCR) devices (Kyriakou et al., 2019).

     Additionally, behavioral measures can provide insight into an individual's level of anxiety. For example, the
     approach-avoidance task is a common measure of anxiety that assesses how individuals respond to threatening or
     anxiety-provoking stimuli (Rose & Devine, 2014).

     There are different levels of anxiety that a person can experience. Some levels can be regularly handled, whereas
     other levels can cause functional impairment.

     Mild
     Mild anxiety is a normal and expected response to stressors and does not typically interfere with daily activities.
     Individuals may experience feelings of nervousness or apprehension, but they can manage their symptoms and
     continue to function normally (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).

     Though often viewed negatively, mild anxiety can have several positive aspects and adaptive functions. Mild anxiety
     can make individuals more alert and ready to face upcoming challenges by sharpening their senses and attention.
     Mild anxiety can sometimes push individuals into an optimal zone of arousal, enhancing performance, especially in
     situations that require focus, like exams or presentations. The slight unease from mild anxiety can act as a
     motivating force, pushing individuals to prepare, study, or practice. Mild anxiety can sometimes act as a signal that
     there is a problem to address, prompting individuals to think creatively and come up with solutions. Experiencing
     and coping with mild anxiety can help individuals develop resilience and better adapt to future stressors.
     Experiencing anxiety can increase one's empathy and understanding toward others who face mental health
     challenges (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).

     Moderate
     Increased feelings of worry or fear characterize moderate anxiety, which may be accompanied by physical signs,
     such as sweating, trembling, or rapid heart rate. Individuals may also experience difficulty concentrating and avoid
     situations that trigger their anxiety (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).

     Severe
     Severe anxiety is an intense level of anxiety in which individuals may experience overwhelming feelings of panic,
     terror, or dread. Physical symptoms, such as chest pain or difficulty breathing, may be severe and require medical
     attention. Individuals with severe anxiety may also have difficulty functioning in daily life and may require
     professional treatment (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).

     Severe anxiety profoundly impacts an individual's behaviors, thought processes, and problem-solving capacities.
     Individuals experiencing severe anxiety may avoid situations or locations associated with anxiety, limiting their daily
     activities (Robinson et al., 2013). They might also exhibit restlessness or procrastination due to anticipatory stress
     or resort to substance misuse as a coping mechanism (FHE Health, 2016). Cognitively, individuals with severe
     anxiety commonly display catastrophic thinking, visualizing the worst possible scenarios (Kishikawa et al., 2022).
     They are prone to rumination, repeatedly reflecting on distressing events without resolution, and might also
     demonstrate perfectionism, viewing any shortcoming as a personal failure (American Psychiatric Association, 2020).

     Panic
     Panic is a specific level of anxiety characterized by sudden and intense feelings of fear or terror, often accompanied
     by physical symptoms, such as chest pain, sweating, trembling, and a rapid heartbeat. Panic attacks can occur
     unexpectedly, or specific situations or stimuli can trigger them. Treatment for panic often involves cognitive
     behavioral therapy or medication, and a proper diagnosis is essential to develop an effective treatment plan
     (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).

        PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Panic in a Nursing Student

Panic involves sudden and intense feelings of fear or terror, often accompanied by physical symptoms. These
episodes can be overwhelming and disruptive.

Physical symptoms can include:

    · Palpitations: rapid heart rate or skipped beats
    · Trembling: shaking or shivering without an apparent cause
    · Shortness of breath: a sensation of being unable to breathe
    · Chest pain: feeling pressure or discomfort in the chest
    · Dizziness: feeling lightheaded or faint
    · Nausea: upset stomach or urge to vomit
    · Chills or hot flashes: sudden temperature changes without environmental reasons

Cognitive and emotional symptoms can include:

    · Fear of losing control: an overwhelming belief that everything is out of their control
    · Fear of dying: intense concern that death is imminent
    · Detachment: feeling disconnected from oneself or the environment, also known as derealization or

        depersonalization

Potential triggers in nursing students can include:

    · Clinical stress: encountering real-life medical scenarios, especially emergencies
    · Academic pressure: anxiety over grades, exams, and performance evaluations
    · Lack of sleep: irregular hours or night shifts can disrupt sleep patterns
    · Caffeine overconsumption: relying heavily on caffeinated drinks to stay awake

Coping strategies can include:

    · Deep breathing: Slowing down and focusing on breathing can help reduce panic symptoms.
    · Grounding techniques: Tactics like the "5-4-3-2-1" sensory method can help reconnect individuals to the

        present moment (Smith, 2018) (Figure 17.6).
    · Seek support: Talking to a trusted friend, mentor, or professional can help process and manage the episode.

Cognitive Distortions and Anxiety
Cognitive distortions are patterns of negative thinking often associated with higher anxiety levels. According to the
cognitive model, anxious individuals tend to interpret ambiguous or uncertain situations negatively, leading to
increased fear and anxiety. One common cognitive distortion related to anxiety is catastrophizing, which involves
536  17 · Anxiety, OCD, and Trauma-Stressor Disorders

     imagining the worst possible outcome of a situation and exaggerating its potential negative consequences. An
     example would be a student making a small mistake on a project. The distortion of catastrophizing might lead the
     student to believe they would fail the course and, as a result, ruin their entire life. Another distortion is all-or-nothing
     thinking, which involves viewing situations as completely good or completely bad without any shades of gray. All-or-
     nothing thinking might lead an individual to see their ability as an artist as either perfect or entirely flawed, based on
     the reception of a single piece. This thinking can lead to anxiety because it creates unrealistic expectations and
     increases the likelihood of disappointment or failure. Other anxiety-related cognitive distortions include
     overgeneralization, jumping to conclusions, and personalization. These distortions can be targeted by cognitive
     behavioral therapy, which aims to help individuals identify and challenge their negative thought patterns to reduce
     anxiety symptoms (Rnic et al., 2016).

     Treating Anxiety

     Anxiety can significantly impair an individual's quality of life. Fortunately, several effective treatments are available
     to help manage and alleviate anxiety symptoms. The choice of treatment depends on the severity of symptoms,
     individual preferences, and other factors. Still, some of the most commonly used treatments for anxiety include
     psychotherapy, self-help strategies, and medications (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).

     Psychotherapy
     Psychotherapy is a widely used treatment approach for anxiety. One of the most effective forms of psychotherapy is
     cognitive behavioral therapy, which helps individuals identify and change negative patterns of thought and behavior
     contributing to their anxiety. CBT is based on the idea that thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected. If
     an individual changes one, the other two can also change. For example, by changing negative thought patterns,
     people can influence their feelings and behaviors (Nakao et al., 2021). Other types of psychotherapy may also be
     effective for managing anxiety symptoms. Some examples of these methods are cognitive restructuring, which
     involves identifying and challenging negative thoughts and replacing them with more balanced and positive ones,
     and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), which is an approach that combines aspects of acceptance and
     mindfulness strategies with commitment and behavior-change strategies. The primary aim is to promote
     psychological flexibility, which is the ability to be open, adaptable, and effective in the presence of difficult emotions
     or thoughts (Schuman-Olivier et al., 2020).

     Excessive and persistent fear, worry, and avoidance behaviors characterize anxiety. One commonly used treatment
     for anxiety is desensitization, an exposure therapy that involves gradually exposing the individual to the feared
     stimulus or situation until they no longer experience anxiety in response to it (Nash, 2022). For example, if someone
     fears needles, they might first be instructed to imagine a needle. Then, the individual might look at a picture of a
     needle. Once the individual can successfully do these things, they might progress to holding a syringe without a
     needle, then on to watching someone receive an injection, then to receiving a mock injection with the needle cap,
     and finally receiving a real injection. Research has shown that desensitization effectively treats anxiety, including
     specific phobias. It allows individuals to confront and overcome their fears in a safe and controlled environment,
     leading to long-term improvements in their mental health and quality of life (Craske et al., 2014).

     Nonpharmacological and Self-Help Approaches
     Relaxation techniques, such as progressive muscle relaxation and deep breathing exercises, can help reduce
     physical symptoms of anxiety and promote feelings of calm and relaxation. Exercise and physical activity have also
     been shown to be effective in reducing anxiety symptoms. Other nonpharmacological approaches that may be
     helpful for anxiety include dietary changes, such as reducing caffeine and alcohol intake, and complementary or
     alternative therapies, such as acupuncture and massage therapy. Overall, nonpharmacological approaches can be
     effective in treating anxiety and may be particularly beneficial for individuals who prefer not to take medication or
     who have had limited success with medication (Bandelow et al., 2015).

     Biofeedback
     A technique, biofeedback (Figure 17.7) involves monitoring and controlling physiological responses to improve
     physical and mental health. The technique can be useful in treating anxiety, as it can help individuals learn how to
     manage their physiological responses to stress and anxiety. Biofeedback can measure various physiological
     responses, including heart rate, blood pressure, muscle tension, and skin conductance. In addition, biofeedback can
     be used with other anxiety disorder treatments, such as CBT. Combining biofeedback and CBT has been shown to

reduce anxiety symptoms and improve overall mental health effectively (Gevirtz, 2013).

stimuli related to anxiety. (credit: "Biofeedback training program for post-traumatic stress symptoms" by Army Medicine/Wikimedia

Hypnosis
Hypnosis is a noninvasive and nonpharmacological approach to treating anxiety that aims to alter an individual's
thoughts, feelings, and behaviors (Hasbi & Effendy, 2019). Hypnotherapy involves inducing a trancelike state in the
client and providing suggestions to modify their thoughts and behaviors. This treatment can help individuals with
anxiety learn how to manage their symptoms and improve their coping strategies (Hasbi & Effendy, 2019).

Pharmacological Treatments
Medication therapy is commonly used to treat anxiety. The most commonly prescribed medications for anxiety are
benzodiazepines, buspirone, and antidepressants, specifically SSRIs and SNRIs (Strawn et al., 2018).

Benzodiazepines
Benzodiazepines work by enhancing the effects of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which
has a calming effect on the brain. Benzodiazepines can quickly relieve acute anxiety symptoms, making them
especially useful for immediate or short-term relief. Chronic use, even over a short period (a few weeks), however,
can lead to physical and psychological dependence. Withdrawal symptoms can be severe and include insomnia,
increased anxiety, tremors, and, in extreme cases, seizures (Rosenbaum, 2020) (Table 17.3).

     TABLE 17.3 Most Commonly Prescribed Benzodiazepines (Dubovsky & Marshall, 2022)

     Buspirone
     Buspirone is a medication commonly used to treat anxiety. It is classified as an anxiolytic, which means that it works
     to reduce feelings of anxiety and tension. Buspirone works by binding to certain receptors in the brain that are
     involved in the regulation of mood and anxiety, specifically the serotonin 5-HT1A receptors. Unlike benzodiazepines,
     buspirone is not associated with the risk of dependence or withdrawal symptoms. It also does not have sedative
     effects, so it can be taken during the day without interfering with everyday activities. Buspirone can take several
     weeks to start working and may cause side effects, such as nausea, dizziness, and headaches. It may also be less
     effective than other medications for some individuals with anxiety disorders (Melaragno, 2021).

     Antidepressants
     Antidepressants are commonly used to treat anxiety, particularly SSRIs and SNRIs (Mayo Clinic, 2019). These
     medications work by increasing the availability of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain, which can help regulate
     mood and reduce anxiety symptoms (Bandelow et al., 2015). Studies have shown that antidepressants can
     effectively treat anxiety, but the response to antidepressants can vary widely among individuals, and it may take
     several weeks or months to reduce anxiety symptoms significantly. Additionally, some individuals may experience

     such as cognitive behavioral therapy, to achieve optimal treatment outcomes (National Institute of Mental Health,

Other Medications
Beta-blockers, such as propranolol, can be used to treat anxiety disorders. These medications target the physical
symptoms of anxiety, such as tachycardia, flushing, and shaking (National Institute of Mental Health, 2023).
Gabapentin, a medication commonly used to treat seizures and nerve pain, has also been studied for its potential
effectiveness in treating anxiety disorders. Although the exact mechanism of action is unclear, gabapentin is thought
to increase the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, which can help reduce feelings of anxiety. Several
small studies have suggested that gabapentin may effectively treat anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety
disorder, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. It requires more research, however, and it has side effects, such
as dizziness, drowsiness, and confusion, and it can also be habit-forming if used for extended periods (Berlin et al.,
2015).

Nursing Care for Clients with Anxiety
Nursing interventions for anxiety should be tailored to the specific needs of the individual, and any treatment plan
should be developed in collaboration with all members of the health-care team (American Nurses Association,
2022). Some of the most common interventions involve assessing the client's level of anxiety, including the severity
and duration of symptoms; creating a quiet and soothing environment, which can help reduce the client's anxiety
and promote relaxation; and encouraging relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises, progressive
muscle relaxation, and guided imagery. There is a need to assist the client in the development of coping strategies,
such as positive self-talk, distraction techniques, and problem-solving skills. It is also important to educate the
client and their family or caregivers about anxiety, its symptoms, and available treatments. People who understand
their condition often feel more in control. Nurses may also administer and manage prescribed medications, such as
benzodiazepines or SSRIs, or refer the client to other health-care professionals, support groups, or community
resources that can provide additional support and assistance.

17.2 Anxiety-Related Disorders

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Describe causes and treatment approaches for generalized anxiety disorder
    · Understand and plan the nursing interventions for a person with a phobia
    · Outline the attributes of, and approaches to care for, a person suffering from a panic attack

Anxiety disorders encompass a wide range of mental health conditions characterized by persistent and excessive
fear or anxiety. These emotions are typically disproportionate to the situation and can interfere with daily activities,
relationships, and overall quality of life. Anxiety disorders are among the most common psychiatric disorders in the
United States (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).

Generalized Anxiety Disorder

Anxiety becomes classified as a disorder when it exceeds expected levels of worry or fear and begins to interfere
with daily functioning. While it is normal to experience anxiety in response to stressful situations or challenges,
anxiety disorders are characterized by persistent, excessive, and often irrational fears disproportionate to the
540  17 · Anxiety, OCD, and Trauma-Stressor Disorders

     triggering event or situation (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Anxiety becomes problematic when it
     persists for extended periods, often six months or more, without a specific or rational cause. Sometimes anxiety is
     so severe that it leads to physical symptoms, such as heart palpitations, sweating, or shaking. Also, if anxiety
     hinders a person's ability to function normally, it will likely be considered a disorder (National Institute of Mental
     Health, 2023). When it is characterized by persistent and excessive worry about everyday events and activities, it is
     considered generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and can develop in children or adults.

     Causes of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
     The exact causes of GAD are not fully understood, but several factors are believed to contribute to the development
     of this disorder (National Institute of Mental Health, 2023). One of the leading causes of GAD is believed to be
     genetics. Studies have shown that individuals with a family history of anxiety disorders are more likely to develop
     GAD. Another potential cause of GAD is environmental factors, such as stress and trauma. Traumatic experiences,
     such as physical or emotional abuse, can lead to GAD in some individuals. Chronic stress due to professional or
     financial challenges can contribute to the development of GAD, and so can a medical diagnosis, particularly one with
     a poor prognosis (National Institute of Mental Health, 2023).

     Additionally, brain chemistry and function may play a role in the development of GAD. People with GAD have been
     found to have imbalances in neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and norepinephrine, that regulate mood and
     anxiety. These imbalances can lead to persistent anxiety and worry (Nuss, 2015).

     Signs and Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
     GAD can manifest in various ways, including physical, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms. Physical symptoms of
     GAD can include muscle tension, headaches, nausea, sweating, trembling, fatigue, and difficulty sleeping. Cognitive
     symptoms of GAD can include persistent and excessive worrying about everyday events, difficulty controlling or
     stopping worrying, overthinking or ruminating, and feeling on edge or restless. Behavioral symptoms of GAD can
     include avoiding situations or activities that might trigger worry or anxiety, seeking reassurance from others, and
     engaging in compulsive or repetitive behaviors to reduce anxiety (National Institute of Mental Health, 2023).

     Symptoms of GAD vary between adults and children. Symptoms associated with GAD in adults include:

         · restlessness
         · feeling on edge or irritable
         · fatigue
         · shortness of breath
         · heart palpitations
         · difficulty concentrating
         · muscle tension
         · sleep problems
         · unexplained pains, such as headaches, muscle aches, and stomachaches

     GAD in children and adolescents may be seen as excessive anxiety and worry about events or activities, such as
     school. The child or adolescent may have difficulty controlling worries. There may also be restlessness, fatigue,
     difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep difficulties (American Academy of Child and
     Adolescent Psychiatry, 2022). Symptoms associated with GAD in children include:

         · excessive worry
         · increased muscle aches
         · impaired concentration
         · fatigue
         · irritability
         · restlessness
         · difficulty sleeping

     Diagnosing Generalized Anxiety Disorder
     An in-depth interview conducted by a mental health professional is crucial to understanding the client's symptoms,
     history, and anxiety's impact on daily life. Questions should focus on the nature of the anxiety, its duration and
     severity, potential triggers, and coping strategies.

Because anxiety may have physical manifestations or be linked to other medical conditions, a physical examination
should rule out underlying medical issues. Continuous observation of symptoms, such as restlessness, fatigue,
difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbances, helps form a diagnosis. A
comprehensive medical and psychiatric history can provide essential insights into the individual's overall health and
potential factors contributing to anxiety. An evaluation of how anxiety affects daily functioning, relationships, and
occupational performance is essential (Cleveland Clinic, 2022).

Treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Psychotherapy is a common treatment for GAD. CBT has been shown to be effective for GAD. CBT helps individuals
identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors contributing to anxiety (Nakao et al., 2021). An
example of a use for CBT in GAD would be when a client constantly worries about failing at work, even though they
are performing well. A therapist might help them identify this as an irrational fear and work on understanding why
this thought pattern occurs. Another client may believe that any mistake will lead to catastrophe. CBT teaches them
to challenge this belief, considering alternative outcomes, and replacing the thought with something more positive
and realistic. Other types of therapy, such as acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and interpersonal therapy
(IPT), may also be helpful. ACT focuses on accepting thoughts and feelings rather than attempting to eliminate or
control them. It emphasizes mindfulness and commitment to personal values. During ACT, clients may learn to
observe their anxiety as a passing experience rather than a constant problem. IPT focuses on interpersonal
relationships and how they impact mental health. A client with GAD may struggle with conflict in their relationship
with a sibling, contributing to their anxiety. IPT helps clients understand and address conflict, improving their
relationships and reducing anxiety (Bright et al., 2019).

Medications, such as antidepressants and benzodiazepines, may also be used to treat GAD. Antidepressants can
help regulate brain chemistry and improve mood. Benzodiazepines can quickly relieve anxiety symptoms but can
also be habit-forming and have other potential side effects. Table 17.5 lists the medications used for GAD.

Alprazolam Benzodiazepine Short-term relief, risk of dependence

Diazepam    Benzodiazepine Used for acute anxiety, not typically long-term

TABLE 17.5 Medication Treatment for GAD (Bandelow, Michaelis, et al., 2017)

Self-help strategies, such as exercise, relaxation techniques, and stress management, can also help manage
symptoms of GAD. Regular exercise can help to reduce anxiety and improve mood. Relaxation techniques, such as
deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation, can help to reduce muscle tension and promote relaxation.
Stress management techniques, such as time management and problem-solving, can help individuals cope better
with stressors (Gautam et al., 2017).

        LINK TO LEARNING

Clients can use the acronym STOP (https://openstax.org/r/77STOPanxiety) to help de-escalate from moments of
anxiety.

Client education and counseling are essential components of the treatment of GAD. Clients with GAD often have
542  17 · Anxiety, OCD, and Trauma-Stressor Disorders

     misconceptions about their symptoms and may benefit from learning more about the nature of anxiety and effective
     coping strategies. Some individuals may dismiss their symptoms of GAD as normal stress or everyday worry, failing
     to recognize that the persistent and excessive anxiety they experience is a treatable medical condition (National
     Institute of Mental Health, 2022a). There may also be an expectation that treatment, whether medication or
     therapy, will provide immediate relief. In truth, treatment for GAD often requires time and consistent effort, and
     progress may be gradual (Mayo Clinic, 2017).

     Educating clients involves informing them about the nature of GAD, including common symptoms, such as persistent
     worry, restlessness, and physical symptoms like fatigue and muscle tension (American Psychiatric Association,
     2013). Clients should be aware that treatment may include a combination of medication and psychotherapy tailored
     to their unique needs and symptoms (Bandelow, Michaelis, et al., 2017). During education sessions, encouraging
     self-help strategies, such as mindfulness practices, stress management, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle can also
     be important. Engaging clients in shared decision-making and facilitating open communication with health-care
     providers can foster a sense of empowerment and active participation in their care, leading to better outcomes
     (Bandelow, Michaelis, et al., 2017). In addition, clients can benefit from learning problem-solving and
     communication skills to improve their relationships and reduce stress in their daily lives. Client education and
     counseling can be delivered in individual or group settings and supplemented with self-help books and online
     resources (Bandelow, Michaelis, et al., 2017).

             PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

     Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Aggravating Factors

     The following psychosocial factors may contribute to the degree, development, and maintenance of GAD:

         · Early life experiences: Traumatic or stressful experiences in childhood or adolescence, such as abuse, neglect,
             or loss, can increase the risk of developing GAD in adulthood.

         · Family and social environment: Family and social factors, including familial stress, cultural background, and
             social support networks, can contribute to the development and maintenance of GAD.

         · Personality traits: Individuals with certain personality traits, such as perfectionism, difficulty with uncertainty,
             and a high need for control, may be more prone to developing GAD.

         · Cognitive and behavioral patterns: Cognitive patterns, including negative thinking and catastrophizing, as well
             as avoidance behaviors, can contribute to the persistence of anxiety symptoms in GAD.

         · Interpersonal relationships: Difficulty with assertiveness, conflict resolution, and social skills can impact the
             individual's ability to manage stress and cope with anxiety symptoms.

         · Work and academic stress: High levels of stress in the workplace or academic setting can trigger or exacerbate
             anxiety symptoms in individuals with GAD.

     Nursing Interventions
     Nurses will encounter clients suffering from GAD in all settings and at all stages of life. Nursing interventions for
     GAD may include assessing and monitoring the client's anxiety level and related physical symptoms, such as
     increased heart rate or muscle tension. Nurses can also encourage clients to express their feelings and concerns,
     provide active listening and support, and teach the client relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, progressive
     muscle relaxation, and mindfulness. Nurses will also assist the client with identifying and challenging negative
     thought patterns and developing coping skills. They can educate the client and their family members on the nature
     of GAD, the importance of self-care, and the benefits of seeking professional help. Collaborating with the client's
     health-care team to develop and implement an individualized treatment plan is part of the nurse's responsibility as
     is administering medications as prescribed and monitoring for potential side effects. Nurses will also refer clients to
     community resources, such as support groups or counseling services (American Nurses Association, 2022).

        CULTURAL CONTEXT

Anxiety and Culture

Culture plays an important role in the manifestation, expression, and treatment of anxiety disorders. Different
cultures may have different ways of describing and experiencing anxiety symptoms, which can impact the
identification and diagnosis of anxiety disorders. For example, some cultures may express anxiety symptoms
primarily through somatic complaints, such as headaches or gastrointestinal problems, rather than through
psychological symptoms. In addition, cultural factors, such as stigma, religious beliefs, and social support can
influence an individual's willingness to seek help for anxiety symptoms and their preference for certain treatments.
Some cultures may prefer traditional healing practices, such as herbal remedies or acupuncture, over Western-style
psychotherapy or medication. Mental health professionals must be aware of these cultural considerations and tailor
their assessment and treatment approach to provide effective care for individuals of different cultures with anxiety
disorders (Tse & Haslam, 2021).

Phobias

A phobia is an excessive and irrational fear of a specific object, situation, or activity that is typically harmless. Unlike
general fear or discomfort, a phobia is characterized by intense anxiety that can lead to avoidance behavior, severely
impacting a person's daily life and functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Phobias are categorized
into different types, such as specific phobias, which focus on particular objects or situations (e.g., spiders, flying);
social phobias; and agoraphobia, the fear of being in places or situations where escape might be difficult (Mayo
Clinic, 2023a).

Causes of Phobia
The development of phobias is thought to be influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and cognitive
factors. One theory proposes that individuals may be genetically predisposed to developing phobias. Certain
phobias (such as a fear of heights or spiders) appear more common across cultures and may have an evolutionary
basis. Environmental factors, such as experiencing a traumatic event or being repeatedly exposed to a phobic
stimulus, can also contribute to the development of phobias. Cognitive factors, such as a tendency to catastrophize
or engage in negative self-talk, can amplify feelings of fear and anxiety in response to phobic stimuli. Additionally,
social learning theory suggests that individuals may learn phobic responses through observation or the influence of
significant others (Choy et al., 2007).

Several risk factors have been identified as potentially contributing to the development of phobias. One risk factor is
a family history of anxiety disorders or phobias, which suggests a genetic predisposition to these conditions. Other
risk factors may include exposure to traumatic events, such as physical or sexual abuse, or a history of childhood
adversity. Social factors, such as being raised in an overprotective or controlling environment, may also increase the
likelihood of developing phobias. In addition, temperament and personality traits, such as neuroticism or behavioral
inhibition, have been associated with an increased risk of anxiety disorders and phobias. Finally, life stressors, such
as job loss or relationship difficulties, may trigger the onset of phobias in susceptible individuals (Bandelow,
Michaelis, et al., 2017).

Signs and Symptoms of Phobias
Phobias can manifest in both physical and psychological ways. Physical symptoms may include increased heart rate,
sweating, trembling, nausea, and hyperventilation. Physical symptoms may sometimes be severe enough to cause a
panic attack. Psychological/behavioral symptoms may include intense fear or anxiety, a sense of impending doom or
danger, and avoidance behavior. Individuals with phobias may go to great lengths to avoid the phobic stimulus,
which can interfere with daily functioning and lead to social isolation. In addition, the fear associated with phobias is
often disproportionate to the actual level of danger posed by the phobic stimulus. Some individuals with phobias
may also experience feelings of guilt, shame, or embarrassment about their symptoms, which can exacerbate their
anxiety (Choy et al., 2007).

Types of Phobias
Phobias can be broadly categorized into specific phobias, social phobias, and agoraphobia. Intense and irrational
544  17 · Anxiety, OCD, and Trauma-Stressor Disorders

     fear of a specific object or situation, such as heights, spiders, or flying, characterizes specific phobias. Social phobia,
     or social anxiety disorder, is characterized by an intense and persistent fear of social or performance situations in
     which others may observe or evaluate the individual. Agoraphobia is characterized by an intense fear of situations or
     places where escape might be difficult, or help might not be available. This fear may lead individuals to avoid
     situations, such as public transportation or crowded places, and make them anxious about being outside of the
     home. While each type of phobia has unique features, they all share a common element of fear or anxiety that
     interferes with daily functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Table 17.6 lists some common phobias.

     Phobia                           Description

     Arachnophobia Fear of spiders

     Acrophobia                       Fear of heights

     Agoraphobia                      Fear of open or crowded spaces or situations where escape might be difficult

     Claustrophobia Fear of enclosed or tight spaces

             LIFE-STAGE CONTEXT

     Phobias in Children, Adolescents, and Older Adults

     Phobias can affect individuals of any age, but age-related concerns may impact the diagnosis and treatment of
     phobias. In older adults, phobias may be more likely to co-occur with other medical or psychiatric conditions,
     complicating treatment. Older adults may also be more likely to have mobility or health problems that make it
     difficult to access treatment. In addition, phobias may be underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed in children and
     adolescents due to their unique developmental needs and concerns. For example, children may express fear or
     anxiety through physical symptoms or have difficulty articulating their fears. Children may be more likely to express
     fear or anxiety through crying, clinging to caregivers, or freezing in place. They may also have difficulty articulating
     their fears and may not fully understand the implications of their phobia. Adolescents may experience symptoms
     similar to those of adults but may have additional concerns about their social identity, such as fear of
     embarrassment or humiliation (Choy et al., 2007). The prevalence and specific types of phobias may vary by age
     group. For example, specific phobias, such as fear of animals or the dark, are more common in children, while social
     phobia becomes more prevalent in adolescence and young adulthood (Davis et al., 2009).

     Treatment Options for Phobias
     Treatment for phobias in children and adolescents may involve play therapy, parent-child interaction therapy, other
     age-appropriate interventions, and cognitive behavioral therapy (Davis et al., 2009). Treatment for phobias in adults
     may involve cognitive behavioral therapy, exposure therapy, or medication, depending on the severity of the
     symptoms and the individual's preferences and needs (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).

     Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
     Treatment for phobias typically involves a combination of psychotherapy and medication. CBT is a commonly used
     approach that involves cognitive restructuring techniques to assist individuals in recognizing and challenging their

irrational thoughts related to the phobia, promoting healthier thinking patterns (Choy et al., 2007).

Exposure Therapy
Exposure therapy is a widely used treatment for phobias, particularly specific phobias. This therapy involves
gradually exposing the individual to the phobic stimulus in a controlled setting to reduce their fear response.
Exposure therapy can be conducted in vivo, in which the individual is exposed to the actual phobic stimulus, or
imaginal, in which the individual is asked to imagine the phobic stimulus. Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET)
uses technology to create controlled and safe virtual environments for exposure, proving useful for specific phobias
like acrophobia or fear of flying (Donnelly et al., 2021). Exposure therapy is thought to work by allowing the
individual to experience the phobic stimulus and develop new, less fearful associations with it. While exposure
therapy can be challenging and uncomfortable for some individuals, it has been shown to be an effective treatment
for phobias, with long-lasting benefits even after treatment has ended (Choy et al., 2007).

Psychopharmacology
Medications, such as SSRIs and benzodiazepines, may also be used to treat phobias alone or in combination with
psychotherapy. Medication is typically not a first-line treatment option, however, and is usually reserved for
individuals with more severe symptoms or who have not responded to psychotherapy alone (Choy et al., 2007).
While medications like benzodiazepines or SSRIs may reduce anxiety symptoms, they often do not address the
underlying cognitive and behavioral patterns contributing to the phobia (Mayo Clinic, 2023a). As a result,
discontinuation of medication might lead to a return of symptoms, whereas the skills learned in CBT can provide
ongoing management (Choy et al., 2007). Additionally, medication may come with potential side effects and risks,
such as dependency on benzodiazepines, which could outweigh the benefits (Baldwin et al., 2014).

Alternative Treatments
In addition to CBT and medications, individuals with phobias may benefit from self-help techniques, such as
mindfulness and relaxation techniques, that teach individuals to manage anxiety through deep breathing and
focusing on the present moment, as well as lifestyle modifications, such as regular exercise and healthy sleep habits
(Choy et al., 2007). Additionally, methods such as eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) are often
employed for trauma-related disorders but have been adapted to treat phobias (De Jongh et al., 2013). The
effectiveness of these alternative approaches varies and might depend on individual factors, including the type and
severity of the phobia, previous treatment experiences, and personal preferences.

Nursing Interventions
Nursing interventions for phobias may involve a combination of client education, counseling, and medication
management. Client education can help individuals with phobias understand the nature of their symptoms and how
they can effectively manage them. In addition, nurses can support clients in medication management, for example,
by monitoring for potential side effects and ensuring adherence to medication regimens. Nurses may also work with
individuals to develop personalized treatment plans, including exposure therapy or other forms of psychotherapy.
Nurses play a crucial role in providing emotional support and helping individuals build self-confidence and self-
efficacy in managing their symptoms (Yamamoto-Mitani et al., 2016).

Panic Disorders

A panic disorder is an anxiety reaction to stress that results in a panic attack. This can be an upsetting experience
for the person having the panic attack and the people they are with. Treatment aims to reduce the number of panic
attacks a person might suffer and focuses on psychological therapies and psychopharmacology (National Institute
of Mental Health, 2023).

Anxiety and Panic
Anxiety and panic are common emotional responses but differ in several important ways. Anxiety is a general feeling
of apprehension or worry, often about future events or uncertain situations. Panic is a sudden and intense feeling of
fear or terror, often accompanied by physical symptoms, such as sweating, heart palpitations, and shortness of
breath. Panic is a sudden and unexpected response to a perceived threat and is often experienced as a feeling of
loss of control. Panic attacks can be triggered by a specific situation or occur spontaneously, leading to avoidance
behaviors or the development of panic disorder (National Institute of Mental Health, 2023). Table 17.7 contrasts
characteristics of anxiety and panic.

                             TABLE 17.7 Anxiety vs. Panic (Catchings, 2019)

     Panic Attack
     A panic attack is a sudden episode of intense fear or discomfort lasting several minutes or longer. During a panic
     attack, an individual may experience physical symptoms, such as sweating, trembling, heart palpitations, shortness
     of breath, and chest pain. They may also experience psychological symptoms, such as a feeling of impending doom
     or a sense of losing control. Panic attacks can be triggered by a specific situation, such as public speaking or flying,
     or can occur spontaneously. They are a hallmark symptom of panic disorder. Panic attack symptoms can resemble
     symptoms of other serious health problems, so it is essential to rule out a medical reason for the physical
     symptoms, such as an allergic reaction, asthma attack, or myocardial infarction (National Institute of Mental Health,
     2016).

     According to Craske and Barlow (2008), there are two types of panic attacks: expected and unexpected. Expected
     panic attacks are triggered by a specific situation or object, such as public speaking or flying. The fear of having a
     panic attack in these situations can lead individuals to avoid them altogether, interfering with daily life. On the other
     hand, unexpected panic attacks occur without a clear trigger or warning. They can happen at any time, including
     during sleep, and can be distressing and disruptive to daily life. While the type of panic attack may differ, the
     symptoms and severity are similar. Panic attacks can be very intense and overwhelming and can lead to feelings of
     fear and loss of control.

     Causes of Panic Disorder
     The underlying causes of panic disorder are complex and multifactorial, often involving a combination of genetic,
     neurobiological, psychological, and environmental factors (Cleveland Clinic, 2023). Research has revealed a familial
     aggregation of panic disorder, suggesting a genetic predisposition (Na et al., 2011). Neurobiological studies have
     found abnormalities in certain brain structures that regulate fear and anxiety, such as the amygdala (Goddard,
     2017). Psychological factors include cognitive processes that may influence the development of panic attacks, such
     as heightened sensitivity to bodily sensations and misinterpretation of these sensations as life-threatening
     (Cleveland Clinic, 2023). Additionally, exposure to stressful life events and chronic stress can contribute to the onset
     of panic disorder. Individuals with panic disorders have been found to have imbalances in neurotransmitters, such
     as serotonin and norepinephrine, which regulate mood and anxiety. These imbalances can lead to sudden and
     intense feelings of fear and panic (National Institute of Mental Health, 2022a).

     Management of Panic Disorder
     Managing panic disorder, and panic attacks specifically, requires tailoring treatment to specific clients and their
     triggers and symptoms. Exposure therapy and medication are common interventions, as are alternative therapies
     like breathing and meditation.

     Exposure Therapy
     Exposure therapy is a common CBT method that focuses on confronting the fears and beliefs associated with panic
     disorder to help individuals engage in activities they have avoided. Exposure therapy is sometimes used along with
     relaxation exercises. In the context of treating panic attacks, exposure therapy might include both interoceptive and
     situational exposures. Interoceptive exposure involves simulating bodily sensations associated with panic, such as

rapid breathing or heart palpitations, to help clients confront and become accustomed to these sensations without
panic. Situational exposure, on the other hand, would involve confronting feared situations or places that might
trigger a panic attack (American Psychological Association, 2017).

Exposure therapy aims to reduce the exaggerated fear response by allowing the individual to experience the feared
stimulus in a safe environment. Through repeated exposures, the individual can learn to tolerate the anxiety,
reevaluate the threat posed by the feared situation, and build confidence in their ability to cope (Knowles & Olatunji,
2019). Research has shown that exposure therapy can be an effective treatment for panic disorder, often leading to
significant reductions in the frequency and severity of panic attacks (Kaplan & Tolin, 2011).

Medication
Medications for panic attacks typically fall into two categories: antidepressants and benzodiazepines.
Antidepressants such as SSRIs and SNRIs are commonly used to treat panic attacks. These medications work by
regulating levels of neurotransmitters in the brain that are associated with mood and anxiety. Antidepressants may
take several weeks to start working and cause side effects, such as nausea, dry mouth, and sexual dysfunction.

Benzodiazepines are another class of medications commonly used to treat panic attacks. These medications work
by enhancing the effects of a neurotransmitter called GABA, which has a calming effect on the brain.
Benzodiazepines work quickly to reduce symptoms of panic but can be habit-forming and may cause drowsiness,
dizziness, and impaired coordination. Medications may be combined with psychotherapy and self-help strategies to
provide the most effective treatment for panic attacks (Mayo Clinic, 2018b).

Nursing Strategies and Interventions
When managing a panic attack, it is crucial for the nurse to remain calm and focused and to encourage the individual
experiencing the panic attack to do the same. Rapid breathing can exacerbate the symptoms of a panic attack, so
encouraging slow, deep breathing can help to reduce symptoms and promote relaxation. The nurse can coach the
individual to breathe in slowly through their nose, hold for a few seconds, and then exhale slowly through their
mouth.

Offering reassurance to the client can be another useful strategy. The nurse should let the individual know they are
not alone and that panic attacks are a common experience. Offering encouragement and support and reminding the
individual that the panic attack will pass will assist in lessening the length and severity of the attack. Grounding
techniques can help the individual to stay present and focused in the moment. The nurse can encourage the
individual to focus on their senses, such as the feeling of their feet on the ground or the sound of their breathing. If
possible, the nurse should move the individual to a quiet, calm environment free from distractions and stimuli that
may exacerbate their symptoms. The nurse may also encourage the individual to engage in self-care practices, such
as exercise, healthy eating, and getting enough rest. These practices can help to reduce the frequency and intensity
of panic attacks over time (Department of Respiratory Medicine, 2022).

Specific nursing interventions for panic attacks may include:

    · Assessing and monitoring the client's history of panic, anxiety level, and related physical symptoms. Perform a
        rapid assessment of vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate. Note any chest pain,
        difficulty breathing, or other symptoms.

    · Encouraging clients to express their feelings and concerns and providing active listening and support.
    · Using therapeutic communication techniques, such as offering reassurance and exploring coping strategies.
    · Teaching the client relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and

        mindfulness.
    · Assisting the client with identifying and challenging negative thought patterns and developing coping skills.
    · Educating the client and their family members on the nature of panic attacks, the importance of self-care, and

        the benefits of seeking professional help.
    · Collaborating with the client's health-care team to develop and implement an individualized treatment plan.
    · Administering medications as prescribed and monitoring for potential side effects.
    · Documenting thoroughly by keeping detailed notes of the client's presentation, the nursing assessment,

        interventions, and the client's response for proper continuity of care.
    · Referring the client to community resources, such as support groups or counseling services (American Nurses

        Association, 2022).
548  17 · Anxiety, OCD, and Trauma-Stressor Disorders

     It is also critical to understand how to assist clients in coping after they have experienced a panic attack.

     Coping after a Panic Attack
     After a panic attack, it is important to encourage the client to practice self-care. Encourage the client to engage in
     relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or guided imagery to help reduce
     stress and anxiety. Mindfulness can help the client stay present in the moment and reduce worry about future panic
     attacks. Encourage the client to focus on their breathing, body sensations, or surroundings to ground themselves in
     the present moment. Exercise can also help to reduce anxiety and promote overall physical and mental well-being.
     Identifying support systems is another important step in coping after a panic attack. Clients should be encouraged
     to reach out to family and friends for support or consider joining a support group for individuals with similar
     disorders. Clients should be encouraged to be kind and compassionate to themselves and avoid self-criticism or
     negative self-talk. Also, clients who stick to a regular routine often report reduced stress and a sense of stability and
     predictability (National Institute of Mental Health, 2023).

     It is important to teach individuals strategies to help prevent future panic attacks. Individuals should first be
     educated about panic attacks, explaining the physiological and psychological components that can help reduce fear
     and stigma. Assisting individuals to identify and challenge irrational thoughts that may contribute to panic and
     replacing them with more balanced perspectives is also a good strategy. Breathing retraining exercises can also
     teach clients to control hyperventilation and other panic-related physical symptoms.

     17.3 Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Outline the causes of obsessive-compulsive disorder
         · Describe the signs and symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder
         · Give examples of treatment approaches for obsessive-compulsive disorder
         · Outline considerations when planning nursing care for a person who has obsessive-compulsive disorder

     One common form of anxiety-related mental disorder wherein a person has recurring thoughts and ideas that make
     them uncomfortable and anxious is called obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). To relieve their anxiety, they
     carry out ritualistic behavior that provides some relief, but the person will usually become anxious again later.
     Obsessive thoughts and ritualistic behavior can restrict the person's lifestyle, causing problems at work or with
     relationships. The person has insight into their problem but often feels powerless to do anything. Treatment involves
     psychological approaches, to help people face their fears, and medication (National Institute of Mental Health,
     2022b).

     Causes of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder

     OCD is characterized by obsessions, recurrent, unwanted thoughts that cause anxiety. In response to these
     obsessions, an individual feels driven to perform repetitive behaviors or mental acts, called compulsions.
     Researchers believe that a complex interplay of genetic, neurobiological, and environmental factors contributes to
     the development of OCD (Pauls, 2008). Specifically, alterations in the brain's serotonin system and abnormalities in
     the brain's circuitry have been implicated in the pathophysiology of the disorder (Saxena & Rauch, 2000).
     Additionally, stressful life events or childhood trauma can exacerbate the onset or severity of OCD symptoms (Pauls,
     2008).

             REAL RN STORIES

     Nurse: Jane, RN
     Years in Practice: Seven
     Clinical Setting: Mental Health Unit, Regional Hospital
     Geographic Location: Louisiana

     Jane, an experienced RN in a mental health unit, was assigned to care for a thirty-five-year-old client named Mark,
     who had been diagnosed with severe OCD. Mark's condition was characterized by an intense fear of contamination

17.3 · Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders                                                                                      549

and a compulsive need to perform cleaning rituals. He would wash his hands almost continuously, causing his skin
to become raw and chapped. The need to clean his hands and surroundings was disrupting his ability to lead a
normal life, severely impacting his interpersonal relationships.

In addition to the standard care plan for OCD, Jane tailored her approach to Mark's specific symptoms. Recognizing
that his fear of contamination was the central issue, she worked with the treatment team to design a care plan that
included exposure therapy. The therapy involved gradually exposing Mark to objects he considered contaminated
while supporting him in resisting the urge to perform his compulsive cleaning rituals.

Jane maintained an empathetic and client-centered approach throughout this process, allowing Mark to express his
feelings and concerns. She made a point of involving him in the decision-making process, setting attainable goals,
and praising his efforts and progress.

The therapeutic relationship between Jane and Mark was essential in creating a safe environment for Mark to
challenge his compulsive behaviors. Jane's understanding of the nature of OCD, combined with her compassionate
and individualized approach, facilitated Mark's progress in therapy. Over time, Mark reduced his compulsive
behaviors and improved his overall quality of life. The success of this case emphasizes the crucial role that nurses
play in the care and recovery of clients with mental health conditions, such as OCD.

Signs and Symptoms of OCD

Manifestations of OCD can vary widely, but common obsessions include fears of germs or other kinds of
contamination; unwanted intrusive thoughts, especially of a sexual or religious nature; thoughts of harm to self or
others; and an obsession with symmetry, order, or routine (National Institute of Mental Health, 2022b). Some of the
most commonly reported compulsions are excessive handwashing, excessive cleaning or organizing, compulsive
counting, and repeatedly checking and rechecking the condition of objects, such as door locks, light switches, or
electrical appliances (National Institute of Mental Health, 2022b). These obsessions and compulsions can cause
significant distress and impairment in an individual's daily functioning, relationships, and overall quality of life
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013).

The OCD cycle (Figure 17.8) is a continuous loop consisting of four stages: obsession, anxiety, compulsion, and
temporary relief. In the first stage, an individual experiences an intrusive and unwanted thought, image, or urge
(obsession) that elicits feelings of distress or anxiety. To alleviate this distress, the individual engages in a repetitive
behavior or mental act (compulsion). The compulsion provides a temporary sense of relief from the anxiety, but the
obsession soon returns, perpetuating the cycle. The repeating nature of the OCD cycle can make it difficult for
individuals to break free from the pattern and can lead to a significant impairment in their daily lives (Foa et al.,
1995).

cycle restarts. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

Treatment of OCD

Various evidence-based treatment options are available for individuals with OCD to reduce symptoms and improve
the overall quality of life. CBT--particularly a specialized form called exposure and response prevention (ERP)--has
550  17 · Anxiety, OCD, and Trauma-Stressor Disorders

     been found to be highly effective in treating OCD (Hezel & Simpson, 2019; National Institute of Mental Health,
     2022b). ERP involves gradually exposing oneself to anxiety-provoking stimuli while simultaneously refraining from
     engaging in compulsions, leading to a reduction of anxiety over time (National Institute of Mental Health, 2022b).
     Pharmacological treatments, particularly SSRIs, have also demonstrated efficacy in alleviating OCD symptoms
     (National Institute of Mental Health, 2022b). Commonly prescribed SSRIs include fluoxetine, sertraline, and
     fluvoxamine (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) (Table 17.8).

                                           2023b)

     Imaginal Exposure
     Another CBT technique commonly used to treat OCD is called imaginal exposure, which involves mentally
     confronting and engaging with a feared situation, traumatic memory, or anxiety-provoking thought in a safe and
     controlled environment. This technique aims to help individuals process their fears, reduce anxiety, and learn
     effective coping strategies. For example, suppose a client with OCD has an intense fear of contamination from germs
     that she believes will cause a deadly illness to her family members. Her compulsions involve excessive washing and
     avoiding physical contact with her children. Direct exposure might be too overwhelming for her at the beginning of
     treatment.

     In an imaginal exposure session, the therapist asks the client to imagine touching a doorknob without washing her
     hands and then hugging her children. They create a vivid description of the scene, involving all sensory details, and
     the therapist guides the client to visualize it repeatedly. The therapist encourages the client to experience anxiety
     and discomfort without engaging in compulsive washing behavior. They repeat the exposure several times during
     and in subsequent sessions until the anxiety associated with the imagined scenario diminishes. This technique
     allows the client to confront and gradually habituate to the fear in a controlled setting, thereby reducing the anxiety
     associated with the feared contamination (Peterson et al., 2019).

     Habit Reversal Training
     A behavioral therapy technique primarily used for treating tic disorders and body-focused repetitive behaviors
     (BFRBs), such as hair pulling (trichotillomania) and skin picking (excoriation disorder), is habit reversal training
     (HRT). Although HRT is not specifically designed for OCD, it can be adapted and used with other therapeutic
     approaches to manage some OCD symptoms, particularly those involving compulsive behaviors (Lee et al., 2019).
     HRT consists of several steps:

         · Awareness training: This step involves helping the individual become more aware of their compulsive
             behavior, the triggers, and the situations in which they are most likely to engage. For example, a client with
             OCD who has a compulsive habit of repeatedly checking the stove to ensure it is off may be assisted to
             recognize the specific circumstances, feelings, and thoughts that trigger the compulsive stove checking.

         · Competing response training: The individual learns a new, healthier behavior to replace the compulsive one.
             This competing response should be incompatible with the compulsive behavior and should be practiced
             whenever the urge to engage in the compulsive behavior arises. Together, the client and therapist develop a
             healthier response to the identified triggers. For instance, they might decide that the client will check the
             stove once, take a photograph with his phone, and then leave the house, using the photograph to reassure
             himself if he feels the urge to check again.

         · Social support: It can be beneficial to enlist the help of friends, family, or a support group to provide
             encouragement and reinforcement for practicing the competing response. A family member or friend may be

17.3 · Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders                                                                        551

        involved to support the client and remind them to use the new coping strategy if they notice them engaging in
        compulsive behavior.
    · Motivation enhancement: Techniques to increase motivation for change, such as identifying the personal
        benefits of stopping the compulsive behavior, can help the individual stay committed to the habit reversal
        process. The therapist helps the client understand the negative impact of the compulsive checking and the
        benefits of the new behavior, reinforcing motivation to change.
    · Generalization: The individual is encouraged to apply the competing response in different situations and
        environments to generalize their new behavior and reduce the likelihood of relapse (Azrin & Nunn, 1973).
        Strategies are discussed to prevent a return to the compulsive behavior, and the client is encouraged to use
        the newly learned techniques if the urge returns.

Traditional treatments for OCD usually involve a combination of medication and psychotherapy, with ERP being the
most effective therapeutic approach. In cases where ERP is not entirely effective or when the compulsive behaviors
are more habit-like, HRT may be an effective adjunctive intervention to help manage compulsive behaviors in OCD
(Lee et al., 2019).

Medication
Medications are often used alongside psychotherapy for OCD. The most common medications for OCD are SSRIs,
which are considered the first-line pharmacological treatment due to their efficacy and tolerability. Some common
SSRIs used for OCD include:

    · fluoxetine (Prozac)
    · sertraline (Zoloft)
    · fluvoxamine (Luvox)
    · paroxetine (Paxil)
    · citalopram (Celexa)
    · escitalopram (Lexapro)

Benzodiazepines, such as diazepam (Valium) and lorazepam (Ativan), are sometimes used for short-term relief of
anxiety associated with OCD. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are an older class of antidepressants that affect
multiple neurotransmitters, including serotonin and norepinephrine. The TCA clomipramine (Anafranil) has been
specifically approved for treating OCD and is often used when SSRIs are ineffective or not tolerated. TCAs do have
more side effects than SSRIs, so they are not considered first-line treatment (International OCD Foundation, 2023).

Gamma Knife
Gamma knife treatment is a noninvasive surgical procedure that uses radiation to destroy targeted brain tissue.
While it is typically used to treat tumors and other abnormalities, it has also been used as a treatment for severe
cases of OCD that have not responded to other forms of treatment. The procedure involves using multiple beams of
gamma radiation to precisely target the area of the brain that is responsible for OCD symptoms. It is thought to
disrupt the abnormal neural circuitry contributing to OCD symptoms. While gamma knife treatment may be effective
for some individuals with severe OCD, it is not a first-line treatment option and is typically reserved for cases that
have not responded to other forms of treatment (International OCD Foundation, 2023).

Deep Brain Stimulation and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
Researchers are studying both deep brain stimulation (DBS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) as
potential treatments for OCD. DBS involves the surgical implantation of electrodes in specific areas of the brain that
are believed to be involved in OCD, followed by electrical stimulation of those areas. Studies have shown that DBS
can effectively reduce OCD symptoms in some clients. DBS is invasive though and there are many risks associated
with brain surgery.

TMS is a noninvasive procedure that uses magnetic fields to stimulate specific brain areas; it is approved for treating
conditions like depression and certain anxiety disorders (Perera et al., 2016). While results in treating OCD have
been mixed, some studies have found TMS effective in reducing symptoms (Rapinesi et al., 2019). TMS has become
more accessible and is available in various settings, including a physician's office. Conducting TMS in a physician's
office allows for more convenient access to treatment for clients. It may also promote collaboration between the
client's existing health-care providers, fostering a more integrated approach to care (Dunner et al., 2014). The
treatment involves multiple sessions, often over four to six weeks. TMS provides an additional option for clients who
552  17 · Anxiety, OCD, and Trauma-Stressor Disorders

     have not responded to traditional therapies (Maslenikov et al., 2017).

     Self-Help for OCD
     Regardless of their treatment, nurses should encourage clients to educate themselves about OCD to understand the
     disorder and how it affects daily life. Keeping a journal to identify situations or thoughts that trigger OCD symptoms
     is a helpful way to deal with the disorder by challenging negative thoughts with positive, realistic thoughts. Clients
     should also get adequate rest, a balanced diet, and adequate physical activity. Setting small goals and recognizing
     that the recovery process may be slow is important for the client to consider to prevent further negative thoughts
     about themselves (Jassi et al., 2020).

     Nursing Interventions for OCD

     Nurses can help monitor medication side effects and provide education about medication use. The nurse can also
     educate the client on relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation to
     help reduce anxiety and stress. Time management strategies can help establish a daily routine that reduces anxiety
     and increases control. The nurse can also assist the client in locating a support group for people with OCD that will
     allow them to connect with others with similar experiences and provide emotional support (El et al., 2023).

     17.4 Trauma-Induced and Stress-Related Disorders

         · Outline the causes, symptoms, and treatment approaches for a person with acute stress disorder
         · Outline the causes, symptoms, and treatment approaches for a person with attachment disorder

     There are a range of disorders that are induced by trauma and stress. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), for
     instance, has gained attention because of veterans of wars who suffer from it. Hoarding has also captured media
     attention. Other disorders remain somewhat less known and private in that they do not attract national attention,
     including body dysmorphic disorder, trichotillomania, excoriation, acute stress disorder, and attachment disorder.

     Body Dysmorphic Disorder

     The mental disorder in which a person is preoccupied with perceived defects or flaws in their appearance is called
     body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). For example, people with BDD may believe they look unattractive, their skin is
     too oily, or their nose is too big or crooked. They often obsess over these perceived flaws and attempt to disguise
     them with clothing or makeup. People with BDD are often highly self-critical and may fear being judged by others.
     BDD can cause significant distress and interfere with daily functioning. It can also lead to social withdrawal,
     occupational difficulties, and suicidal thoughts (Jaroszewski & Wilheim, 2022).

     BDD is thought to be related to low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression. Treatment for BDD typically involves a
     combination of psychotherapy, medications, and lifestyle changes. CBT is the most commonly used type of
     psychotherapy for BDD. It helps people to identify and challenge unhelpful thoughts and behaviors related to their
     appearance. Medications like Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may also reduce anxiety and
     associated depression (Jaroszewski & Wilheim, 2022).

     Causes of Body Dysmorphic Disorder
     BDD is not simply a case of being self-conscious. It is a mental health disorder that can cause significant distress
     and impairment in daily functioning. The causes of BDD are not entirely understood, but the disorder is likely due to
     a combination of biological, psychological, and environmental factors. Brain imaging studies suggest that people
     with BDD may have differences in how their brains process information (Buchanan et al., 2013). Psychological
     factors may also play a role, as people with BDD often fear negative evaluations from others. Environmental factors,
     such as having experienced teasing or bullying, may also influence the onset of BDD (Jaroszewski & Wilheim, 2022).

Onset and Course of BDD
The onset of BDD typically occurs in late adolescence or early adulthood. It is estimated that up to 2.4 percent of
the population may be affected by BDD, with higher rates in higher socioeconomic groups (Jaroszewski & Wilheim,
2022). The course of the disorder can be chronic and often coexists with other mental health conditions, such as
depression and anxiety disorders (Phillips et al., 2005).

Prevalence
BDD is more commonly found in young adults, with a mean age of onset of fifteen to sixteen. In addition, BDD is
more commonly seen in women, although signs and symptoms may be seen more frequently in men as they age
(Jaroszewski & Wilheim, 2022). The exact prevalence of BDD is challenging to estimate due to the shame and
secrecy surrounding this condition. As a result, BDD often goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. Individuals with BDD
may be reluctant to seek help or they present with other symptoms consistent with other mental health conditions,
such as depression, social anxiety, or eating disorders (Enander et al., 2018).

Signs and Symptoms of BDD
Signs and symptoms of BDD include preoccupation with an imagined or exaggerated physical flaw, such as a
blemish, scar, or other perceived defect; engaging in repetitive behaviors, such as checking mirrors multiple times a
day, excessive grooming, or skin picking; avoiding social activities, such as going to the beach, because of
embarrassment over perceived flaws; spending excessive amounts of time comparing oneself to others; wearing
heavy makeup, hats, or clothing to hide perceived flaws; engaging in cosmetic surgery or other medical treatments
in an attempt to fix perceived flaws; seeking reassurance from friends and family about perceived flaws; and
experiencing anxiety, depression, or suicidal thoughts related to perceived flaws (Jaroszewski & Wilheim, 2022).

disorder.

Diagnosing BDD
BDD can be complex and requires a comprehensive assessment by a mental health professional. It is crucial to
assess the client's emotional response to their perceived flaws, the time spent focusing on them, and the impact on
daily functioning. Treatment history, family history, and comorbidity with other disorders, such as anxiety and
depression, should also come up during the diagnostic process (Thanveer & Khunger, 2016).

Treating BDD
There are several treatments for BDD, ranging from psychotherapy to medication. CBT, especially when tailored
specifically to BDD, has been found to be highly effective in reducing symptoms (Veale et al., 2014). Alongside CBT,
SSRIs have proven beneficial for some individuals (Castle et al., 2021). An integrative approach that involves
collaboration between therapists, psychiatrists, and other health-care providers, such as nurses, can result in more
effective care (Harrison et al., 2016).

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
CBT is a talk therapy that helps people identify and change negative thoughts and behaviors. It is often used to treat
BDD, as it can help people learn to challenge distorted thoughts about their appearance and replace them with more
realistic ones. CBT also helps people learn to manage their anxiety, practice healthy self-care, and reframe their
relationship with their bodies (Harrison et al., 2016).

Exposure/Response Prevention
Body dysmorphia exposure and response prevention (BD ERP) is a form of CBT used to treat BDD by exposing the
client to their feared body image so they can learn how to manage their reactions to it. The first step in BD ERP is for
the individual to identify and then confront their fears around their body image. The therapist will then help the
individual gradually face these fears by exposing themselves to the feared body image. Next, the individual will learn
how to manage their anxiety and distress when exposed to the feared body image, such as by using relaxation
554  17 · Anxiety, OCD, and Trauma-Stressor Disorders

     techniques. During treatment, the individual will engage in activities and behaviors that challenge their negative
     beliefs about their appearance. These could include participating in activities they have previously avoided due to
     their body image concerns, such as looking in the mirror, going to the beach, or wearing certain clothing. The
     ultimate goal of BD ERP is for the individual to accept and manage their body image without feeling extreme distress
     or anxiety (Reid et al., 2021).

     Medications
     Medications can help treat BDD, but they are typically used in conjunction with therapy, such as CBT or other forms
     of psychotherapy. Some medications that may be used to treat BDD include SSRIs, which can help alleviate the
     symptoms of depression and anxiety often associated with BDD; they may also help reduce obsessive-compulsive
     symptoms common in BDD (Mayo Clinic, 2021b). SSRIs are not a cure for BDD. They can only help reduce the
     severity of some symptoms.

     Antipsychotic medications can help manage symptoms of delusions or paranoia that may be present in some
     individuals with BDD. They may also help reduce obsessive-compulsive symptoms. There is no antipsychotic
     medication specifically designed to treat body dysmorphia, though certain antipsychotic medications, such as
     olanzapine (Zyprexa), risperidone (Risperdal), quetiapine (Seroquel), clozapine (Clozaril), and aripiprazole (Abilify),
     have been used (Castle et al., 2021).

     Self-Help Resources for BDD
     Self-help strategies can be helpful in the treatment of BDD. Online self-help programs, incorporating
     psychoeducational materials and interactive exercises, can help individuals with mild to moderate symptoms
     (Enander et al., 2014). Additional self-help resources include:

         · Body Dysmorphic Disorder Foundation: Visit the BDD Foundation website (https://openstax.org/r/
             77BDDwebsite) for information, resources, and support.

         · Distraction techniques: Develop strategies to help focus attention away from perceived flaws and on other
             activities, such as exercise, hobbies, or spending time with friends and family.

         · Support groups: Connect with others with body dysmorphia or similar mental health concerns. Support groups
             can provide a safe and nonjudgmental environment to share experiences and learn from others.

         · Healthy coping skills: Find healthy ways to cope with body dysmorphia, such as journaling, yoga, mindfulness,
             art, and music.

     Nursing Interventions
     Nurses can assess the client's perception of their body image, assist the client with associated distress or
     impairment, and help with the condition's impact on their daily lives. Nurses can also educate clients on the nature
     of BDD, its symptoms, and its effect on their mental health, which can alleviate feelings of shame or guilt. Nurses
     may assist the client to develop healthy coping mechanisms to manage negative feelings associated with body
     dysmorphia. Nurses can monitor the client's progress, manage any medications, evaluate the effectiveness of
     interventions, and adjust the treatment plan as needed to help clients achieve their treatment goals and improve
     their overall quality of life (Perkins, 2019).

     The concept of offering self is important for clients dealing with BDD. A nurse offers self by spending time with the
     client and building a relationship to ensure the client becomes comfortable discussing sensitive issues. Therapeutic
     communication with a client with BDD is a critical skill for nurses, as it forms the foundation of effective care for
     individuals struggling with this complex condition. Effective communication requires a nonjudgmental and
     empathetic approach, recognizing that the client's concerns about appearance are intensely real and distressing to
     them. Open-ended questions and reflective listening can facilitate understanding of the client's feelings and
     thoughts without reinforcing the distortions associated with BDD. Encouraging and supporting clients in expressing
     their feelings about their appearance without agreeing with their distorted self-image helps in building trust
     (Perkins, 2019). Nurses can encourage clients to develop a positive body image by focusing on their strengths and
     abilities, engaging in positive self-talk, and engaging in activities that promote self-care and well-being. Nurses may
     also encourage the client's engagement in social support networks, such as family, friends, or support groups. These
     types of engagement can help the individual feel less isolated and provide a safe space to discuss their concerns
     (Perkins, 2019).

Hoarding

The mental health condition characterized by persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, regardless
of their actual value is hoarding disorder. Hoarding behavior can lead to cluttered living spaces that can be
hazardous or unsanitary and can interfere with daily activities, such as cooking, cleaning, and sleeping (American
Psychiatric Association, 2021).

Causes and Incidence of Hoarding Disorder
The incidence of hoarding disorder in the general population is not well established, but it is believed to affect
between 1.5 percent and 6 percent of adults. Hoarding disorder is more common in older adults, with prevalence
rates increasing in those over sixty-five. Women are also more likely than men to develop hoarding disorder
(Postlethwaite et al., 2019). While the exact cause of hoarding disorder is unknown, it is thought to be associated
with various factors, such as genetics, brain structure and function, and life experiences. Individuals with a hoarding
disorder tend to have a history of traumatic or stressful events, such as the loss of a loved one, divorce, or physical
abuse, which may contribute to the onset or exacerbation of hoarding behaviors (Fontenelle et al., 2021). A family
history of hoarding and underlying genetic factors may also play a role in the development of this disorder (Dozier &
Ayers, 2017). Traumatic early life experiences can shape attachment to possessions and difficulty discarding items.
Individuals who grew up in a cluttered home or experienced parental deprivation have been shown to form
unhealthy attachments to items (Kehoe & Egan, 2019). Interpersonal difficulties and social isolation are often both
a cause and consequence of hoarding, leading to a vicious cycle that reinforces the behavior. In addition, individuals
with hoarding disorder may also be more likely to have other psychiatric conditions, such as anxiety, depression, or
obsessive-compulsive disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).

Signs and Symptoms of Hoarding Disorder
Individuals with hoarding disorder experience distress or anxiety at the thought of discarding possessions. They feel
a sense of attachment or emotional significance to the items they hoard. Hoarding behavior can lead to social
isolation, because individuals may be embarrassed or ashamed of their living conditions and avoid inviting others
into their homes (Mayo Clinic, 2018a). Physical symptoms of hoarding disorder may include respiratory problems
and evidence of falls or other injuries. The accumulation of items and neglect of household maintenance can lead to
dust accumulation, mold growth, and poor air quality, all of which can exacerbate or cause respiratory problems.
Difficulty maneuvering through cluttered spaces may lead to falls and other injuries (American Lung Association,
2021). There is also an increased risk of fire or other hazards due to the cluttered living environment (Mayo Clinic,
2018a).

Diagnosing Hoarding Disorder
The diagnosis of hoarding disorder is based on a thorough clinical assessment of the individual's symptoms and
behaviors. Diagnostic criteria for hoarding disorder include persistent difficulty discarding or parting with
possessions, regardless of their actual value, and cluttered living spaces that interfere with daily activities. To be
diagnosed with hoarding disorder, an individual must experience significant distress or impairment due to hoarding
behavior. Diagnosis may also involve ruling out other conditions contributing to the individual's symptoms, such as
obsessive-compulsive disorder or major depressive disorder. Diagnostic assessments for hoarding disorder may
include interviews with the individual and their family members and observation of their living environment. The
diagnosis of hoarding disorder can be complex and may require a multidisciplinary approach involving mental health
providers, primary care physicians, and other specialists as needed (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).

Several assessment scales evaluate the severity of hoarding disorder and track symptom changes over time:

    · Saving Inventory-Revised (SI-R): The SI-R is a self-report measure that assesses the severity of hoarding
        symptoms and related features, such as indecisiveness, clutter, and excessive acquisition.

    · Hoarding Rating Scale (HRS): The HRS is a clinician-administered tool that assesses the severity of hoarding
        symptoms and associated features, such as functional impairment and distress.

    · Clutter Image Rating (CIR): The CIR is a visual rating scale that assesses the severity of clutter in the
        individual's living environment.

    · Home Environment and Living Inventory (HEAL): The HEAL is a comprehensive assessment tool that evaluates
        the individual's living environment and functional ability, including mobility and social support.
556  17 · Anxiety, OCD, and Trauma-Stressor Disorders

     These assessment scales can be used to inform treatment planning and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions
     over time. No single assessment scale is definitive, however, and it is essential to perform a thorough clinical
     assessment that considers the individual's unique circumstances and needs (International OCD Foundation, 2023).

     Treating Hoarding Disorder
     Treatment for hoarding disorder typically involves a combination of medication and psychotherapy, such as cognitive
     behavioral therapy or exposure therapy. In addition, environmental interventions, such as professional organizing or
     cleaning services, may also help address the physical aspects of hoarding behavior (American Psychiatric
     Association, 2013).

     Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
     CBT is a commonly used treatment approach for hoarding disorder. CBT for hoarding disorder typically involves a
     combination of individual and group therapy sessions and aims to address the underlying beliefs and thought
     patterns that contribute to hoarding behavior. In CBT, individuals learn to identify and challenge negative thoughts
     and beliefs about possessions and develop new, more adaptive ways of thinking. CBT may also involve exposure
     therapy, in which individuals are gradually exposed to the anxiety-provoking situations associated with discarding
     possessions. In addition, CBT may incorporate skills training in areas, such as organization, decision-making, and
     time management, to improve the individual's ability to manage their living environment and daily activities. While
     CBT is generally considered an effective treatment for hoarding disorder, it may not be effective for all individuals
     (International OCD Foundation, 2023).

     The Effectiveness of Medication
     Medication treatment for hoarding disorder often accompanies psychotherapy. The Food and Drug Administration
     (FDA) has not approved any specific medication for the treatment of hoarding disorder, but medications commonly
     used to treat other psychiatric conditions may effectively reduce the symptoms of anxiety and depression that are
     often associated with hoarding disorder. These medications may also help to reduce urges to acquire possessions
     and may improve decision-making around discarding possessions. Other off-label medications to treat hoarding
     disorder include atypical antipsychotics and mood stabilizers, although there exists limited evidence for their
     effectiveness (International OCD Foundation, 2023).

     Interventions Involving the Family
     Hoarding disorder can significantly impact the afflicted individual's family and loved ones. Family members may
     experience distress or frustration due to the individual's hoarding behavior and may feel overwhelmed or helpless in
     their efforts to intervene. Thus, family involvement in treatment can be an important component of hoarding
     disorder management. Family may participate in education about the disorder and its impact on the family, training
     in communication and problem-solving skills, and involvement in the individual's treatment planning and decision-
     making. Family members may also play a role in the practical aspects of hoarding disorder treatment, such as
     assisting with decluttering or organizing the individual's living space. It is important to approach family involvement
     in hoarding disorder treatment in a collaborative and nonjudgmental manner and to consider each individual and
     family's unique needs and circumstances (International OCD Foundation, 2023).

     Nursing Interventions
     The nurse's role in assessing and managing hoarding disorder may involve client education, counseling, and referral
     to specialized mental health providers as needed. A nurse must perform a thorough assessment of mental and
     physical health, including evaluating the living environment and its potential impact on physical health, and educate
     the client about the disorder (Millen et al., 2017). Educating clients about the disorder, including symptoms, causes,
     and treatment options, can reduce stigma and promote engagement in treatment. Building trust through empathetic
     and nonjudgmental communication is vital. Nurses can reinforce therapeutic strategies taught in CBT and manage
     medications (Bodryzlova et al., 2019). Nurses can work with clients to create a safe living environment (Rodriguez et
     al., 2016). Linking clients with community resources, support groups, or specialized hoarding interventions can
     further support treatment (Weir, 2020). Nurses must recognize the complexity of the disorder and approach care
     with dignity, empathy, and an understanding of the unique challenges faced by individuals with this disorder.

     Trichotillomania

     The mental health disorder trichotillomania is characterized by a chronic need to pull out one's hair. This disorder

17.4 · Trauma-Induced and Stress-Related Disorders                                                                       557

falls under obsessive-compulsive and related disorders and can lead to distressing physical and emotional
symptoms (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Understanding trichotillomania is essential as clients may
present with noticeable hair loss, skin damage, and related complications, such as infection.

Causes and Risk Factors for Trichotillomania
Trichotillomania occurs in 1.7 percent of the population, equally in males and females (Grant et al., 2020). The
causes of trichotillomania are believed to be genetic, environmental, and psychological factors. Research suggests
that trichotillomania may be associated with abnormalities in brain structure and function, including alterations in
neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate. Trauma, stress, and other life events may also
contribute to the development of trichotillomania. A family history of trichotillomania or other psychiatric conditions
may increase an individual's risk of developing the disorder, suggesting a genetic component to the disorder. Age is
also a potential risk factor for trichotillomania, with onset typically occurring in childhood or adolescence, although
the disorder may also develop in adulthood. Stress and other environmental factors may trigger or exacerbate
symptoms of trichotillomania, although researchers do not yet understand the exact nature of these factors and
their relationship to the disorder. Stressful life events, such as trauma, abuse, or changes in family or work
situations, may contribute to the development or worsening of trichotillomania symptoms (American Psychiatric
Association, 2013).

Symptoms of Trichotillomania
Individuals with trichotillomania may pull hair from any body part, including the scalp, eyelashes, and eyebrows.
Hairpulling may be accompanied by feelings of tension or anxiety before pulling and a sense of relief or pleasure
after pulling. The hairpulling may be intentional or automatic and may occur in response to specific triggers or
situations. In addition to hair loss, individuals with trichotillomania may experience a range of physical symptoms,
including skin damage, infections, and scarring, as well as emotional symptoms, such as distress or embarrassment
about their appearance or behavior. There may be noticeable hair loss or bald patches, or the individual may chew
on the hair they pull out. The disorder can lead to significant distress and social or occupational impairment
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013).

Diagnosis of Trichotillomania
The diagnosis of trichotillomania is based on a thorough clinical assessment that includes a detailed history of the
individual's hairpulling behavior, physical examination, and assessment of any associated symptoms or psychiatric
conditions. To meet the diagnostic criteria for trichotillomania, the hairpulling behavior must result in hair loss and
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The hairpulling
must also not be attributable to another medical condition or substance use and must not be better accounted for
by another mental disorder. In some cases, laboratory tests or imaging studies may rule out other potential causes
of hair loss (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).

        PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

A Social Perspective on Trichotillomania

While genetic and neurological factors may contribute to trichotillomania, psychosocial factors can also play a role
in the development of the disorder. These factors include stress and anxiety, lack of social support, shame and
embarrassment, and family dynamics (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). This disorder often begins in
childhood or adolescence and can be associated with stress, anxiety, and underlying emotional challenges (Franklin
et al., 2011). Socially, individuals with trichotillomania may experience embarrassment or shame due to noticeable
hair loss, leading to withdrawal from social interactions, negative self-image, and potential impact on relationships
with friends and family (Mason, 2018).

Treatment Approaches for Trichotillomania
Trichotillomania is a challenging disorder, and no single "gold standard" treatment works for everyone. Treatment
typically involves a combination of medication and psychotherapy to reduce hairpulling behavior, minimize hair loss,
and improve overall functioning and quality of life. SSRIs and other medications that affect serotonin and dopamine
levels in the brain may work to treat the underlying anxiety and mood symptoms associated with trichotillomania.
Psychotherapy, such as CBT or habit reversal training (HRT), can help individuals learn to recognize and control the
558  17 · Anxiety, OCD, and Trauma-Stressor Disorders

     urge to pull their hair and develop alternative coping strategies to manage their anxiety and stress. In addition,
     support groups and educational resources can help promote coping and self-management strategies. Treatment for
     trichotillomania should be tailored to the individual's unique needs and circumstances and may require ongoing
     monitoring and adjustment over time (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).

     HRT is a specific form of CBT that is often used in the treatment of trichotillomania. HRT involves identifying the
     triggers or situations that lead to hairpulling and developing alternative responses or behaviors to replace the
     hairpulling. For example, an individual is taught to recognize the urge to pull their hair and instead squeeze a stress
     ball or engage in a relaxing activity. HRT also involves increasing awareness of hairpulling behavior, tracking the
     frequency and severity of hairpulling, and addressing any underlying emotional or psychological factors that may
     contribute to the behavior. HRT has been shown to be an effective treatment for trichotillomania and may be used
     alone or in combination with medication and other forms of therapy (Morris et al., 2013).

     Nursing Interventions
     Nursing interventions may involve education about trichotillomania and its impact on the individual's health and
     well-being, as well as strategies for managing hairpulling behavior and promoting self-care. Nurses can also assist
     individuals in developing coping strategies and self-management techniques, such as mindfulness meditation or
     relaxation exercises, to help reduce anxiety and stress. In addition, nurses can work with individuals and their
     families to address any personal issues related to the disorder, such as stigma, social isolation, or relationship
     difficulties (Anderson, 2011).

     Excoriation

     Skin picking disorder, or excoriation, is a psychiatric condition classified under the obsessive-compulsive and
     related disorders category that involves repetitive and compulsive picking at the skin, leading to tissue damage,
     scarring, and sometimes serious medical complications like infections. The behavior is often driven by anxiety,
     stress, or underlying emotional conflicts and can become a chronic problem affecting various body areas (American
     Psychiatric Association, 2013). Clients may present with various physical manifestations, ranging from mild redness
     to severe wounds. A client-centered approach that thoroughly assesses the physical symptoms, underlying
     psychiatric conditions, and the psychosocial context is vital (Anderson & Clarke, 2017) (Figure 17.9).

Causes of Excoriation
The causes of excoriation are not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to genetic, environmental, and
psychological factors. Research suggests that excoriation may be associated with abnormalities in brain structure
and function, including alterations in neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate. Trauma,
stress, and other life events may also contribute to the development of excoriation. In addition, excoriation is often
associated with other psychiatric conditions, such as anxiety, depression, or obsessive-compulsive disorder, and
individuals with a family history of these conditions may be at increased risk of developing excoriation (American
Psychiatric Association, 2013).

Signs, Symptoms, and Incidence of Excoriation
Individuals with excoriation may pick skin from any body part, including the face, arms, legs, and back. Skin picking
may be accompanied by feelings of tension or anxiety before picking and a sense of relief or pleasure after picking.
Skin picking can range from mild to severe and may lead to various physical and psychological symptoms. Physical
symptoms may include skin lesions, scarring, infections, and other skin damage, as well as pain or discomfort.
Psychological symptoms may include shame, guilt, anxiety, or depression and may interfere with social,
occupational, or other areas of functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).

The exact incidence of excoriation disorder is not well-established because it is often underdiagnosed and may be
difficult to distinguish from other skin conditions or disorders. Some studies suggest that the prevalence of
excoriation may be relatively high, particularly among individuals with other psychiatric conditions, such as
obsessive-compulsive disorder or anxiety. For example, one study found that approximately 3.1 percent of adults
aged eighteen to sixty-nine reported symptoms of excoriation in their lifetime. The disorder appears more common
in females than males and often develops in adolescence or young adulthood (Grant & Chamberlain, 2020).

Diagnosis of Excoriation
The diagnosis of excoriation disorder is based on a thorough clinical assessment that includes a detailed history of
560  17 · Anxiety, OCD, and Trauma-Stressor Disorders

     the individual's skin picking behavior, physical examination, and assessment of any associated symptoms or
     psychiatric conditions. To meet diagnostic criteria for excoriation, the skin picking behavior must result in skin
     damage and significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The
     skin picking behavior must also not be attributable to another medical condition or substance use and must not be
     better accounted for by another mental disorder. In some cases, laboratory tests or imaging studies may rule out
     other potential causes of skin damage (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).

     A commonality among those diagnosed with the disorder is the reported presence of stress and anxiety. Some
     individuals with excoriation disorder report that the act of skin picking provides temporary relief from emotional
     discomfort or distress (Kwon et al., 2020). Many individuals with excoriation disorder also struggle with other
     mental health conditions, such as OCD or depression, which can contribute to or exacerbate the skin picking
     behavior (Grant & Chamberlain, 2021).

     Several types of excoriation disorders exist. They are classified based on the location and nature of the skin picking
     behavior.

         · Acne excoriée is an excoriation that involves picking at acne lesions or other blemishes on the face, often
             resulting in scarring and discoloration.

         · Dermatillomania is an excoriation that involves picking at healthy skin or minor imperfections, such as scabs
             or bumps, resulting in skin damage and scarring.

         · Neurotic excoriation refers to a pattern of skin picking that occurs in response to anxiety or stress. An example
             of this would be an individual who, during stressful periods, picks, rubs, or scratches the skin to the point of
             scarring (Wong et al., 2013).

         · Some excoriation is related to an underlying medical condition, such as pruritus or chronic skin conditions
             (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).

     Treatment of Excoriation
     The treatment of excoriation disorders typically involves a combination of medication and psychotherapy, CBT, and
     HRT. Medications that may be used to treat excoriation include SSRIs, commonly used to treat depression and
     anxiety disorders. Psychotherapy approaches may involve addressing underlying psychological or emotional factors
     contributing to skin picking behavior and developing alternative coping strategies and self-management techniques
     to reduce anxiety and promote relaxation. HRT may involve identifying triggers for skin picking, developing
     alternative behaviors or responses to these triggers, and tracking progress and success over time. In addition,
     support groups and educational resources may help promote coping and self-management strategies (American
     Psychiatric Association, 2013).

     Self-care can be an important component of managing excoriation disorders and can help individuals reduce their
     symptoms and improve their overall quality of life. Some self-care strategies that may be helpful include maintaining
     a healthy and balanced diet. A balanced diet can help promote overall physical and mental health, which may
     reduce the frequency and severity of skin picking behavior. Engaging in regular exercise can help reduce stress and
     anxiety, which may be triggers for skin picking behavior. Techniques, such as mindfulness meditation, deep
     breathing exercises, or progressive muscle relaxation, can help individuals reduce stress and promote relaxation.
     Ensuring adequate sleep can help reduce stress and promote overall physical and mental health. Avoiding exposure
     to irritants, such as harsh soaps, chemicals, or allergens, can help reduce skin damage and irritation.

     Nursing Interventions
     Nursing interventions for excoriation disorder are an important component of the multidisciplinary care approach
     often used to manage this condition. Nursing interventions may include educating and supporting individuals with
     the disorder, developing coping strategies to manage triggers and reduce skin picking behavior, monitoring
     medication side effects, and promoting self-care strategies. Encouraging and reinforcing positive behaviors may also
     be an important nursing intervention. In addition, nurses may provide resources, such as support group referrals or
     educational materials, to help individuals with excoriation disorder manage their symptoms and improve their
     quality of life (Lochner et al., 2017).

a terrifying event. The event may have been a threat to the safety or life of the person, or it may have been an event
they witnessed. Although historically the condition may be most associated with soldiers returning from war, PTSD
can occur in people who have experienced things like sexual abuse, rape, domestic abuse, natural disasters, or
terrorist attacks. The person may suffer from chronic physical and emotional symptoms as they relive the trauma,
and treatment usually includes psychotherapy and medications. Nurses are expected to be able to recognize the
symptoms of PTSD and plan appropriate care for a person with PTSD wherever they might be working with them
(Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], 2023).

Historical Perspectives of PTSD
PTSD is a relatively new diagnosis in the field of mental health; the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (DSM-3) formally recognized it in 1980. Health providers have recognized and treated symptoms of PTSD
for centuries under different terms, such as "shell shock" and "combat fatigue." It was not until the Vietnam War
that PTSD gained widespread recognition, as many veterans returning from the war exhibited symptoms of the
disorder (Iribarren et al., 2005). The diagnostic criteria and understanding of PTSD have evolved since then, with a
growing recognition of the impact of traumatic experiences on mental health and well-being (American Psychiatric
Association, 2013).

Causes and Incidence of PTSD
According to the DSM-5, to be diagnosed with PTSD, a person must experience a life-threatening, traumatic event
that evokes fear, helplessness, or shock. In addition, individuals report a persistent feeling of reexperiencing the
event, avoid things associated with the event, and suffer persistent symptoms that indicate emotional arousal or
stress response. These symptoms must last at least one month and cause significant impairment in functioning
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013).

According to the National Center for PTSD (2023), approximately 5 to 6 percent of the U.S. population will
experience PTSD at some point in their lives, with rates higher among certain groups, such as military veterans, first
responders, and survivors of sexual assault or interpersonal violence. Women are more likely than men to develop
PTSD.

Predisposing Factors
Several predisposing factors can increase the likelihood of developing PTSD after exposure to a traumatic event.
Individuals who have experienced trauma earlier in their lives are more likely to develop PTSD after a subsequent
traumatic event; exposure to childhood trauma, such as abuse or neglect, can increase the risk of developing PTSD
later in life. A family history of mental illness, including PTSD, can increase an individual's risk of developing PTSD
after a traumatic event. Certain personality traits, such as neuroticism and anxiety, have been found to be
associated with an increased risk of developing PTSD. People who lack social support or have few resources to cope
with stress are at greater risk of developing PTSD after a traumatic event. The severity and duration of the traumatic
event can also increase the likelihood of developing PTSD (National Center for PTSD, 2023).

Signs and Symptoms of PTSD
The symptoms and severity of PTSD can vary greatly from person to person and may change over time (American
Psychiatric Association, 2013). Signs may emerge months or even years after the traumatic event, highlighting the
importance of early intervention for individuals who have experienced trauma. The hallmark symptoms of PTSD are
intrusive thoughts or memories of the trauma, avoidance of trauma reminders, negative changes in mood or
thinking, and hyperarousal or reactivity (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Intrusive thoughts and memories
can take the form of flashbacks or nightmares, and individuals may avoid situations or activities that remind them of
the trauma. Negative changes in mood or thinking may include feelings of guilt, shame, or anger and difficulty
experiencing positive emotions or maintaining close relationships. Hyperarousal or reactivity may include symptoms
such as hypervigilance, irritability, or difficulty sleeping. Individuals with PTSD may also experience physical
symptoms, such as headaches, chest pain, fatigue, and changes in appetite, weight, and sleep patterns (Peterson et
al., 2019).

Changes in Thinking
PTSD is associated with various cognitive changes and difficulties, including negative changes in mood, beliefs, and
perception of oneself and others. For example, individuals with PTSD may experience guilt, shame, or self-blame
related to the traumatic event and a sense of detachment or estrangement from others (American Psychiatric
562  17 · Anxiety, OCD, and Trauma-Stressor Disorders

     Association, 2013). They may also have negative beliefs or expectations about themselves, others, or the world,
     such as feelings of helplessness or a loss of trust in others. In addition, individuals with PTSD may have difficulty
     experiencing positive emotions or finding pleasure in activities they once enjoyed, which can contribute to a reduced
     quality of life. These changes in thinking and mood can be persistent and contribute to the overall complexity and
     challenges associated with treating PTSD.

     Symptom Intensity and Complex PTSD
     Symptom intensity and complexity are important factors to consider when evaluating the presence and severity of
     PTSD. Individuals with PTSD may experience a range of symptoms, from mild to severe, which can vary in intensity
     over time. In some cases, individuals may experience persistent and debilitating symptoms that interfere with their
     daily functioning and quality of life.

     Complex PTSD, also known as developmental trauma disorder, is a subtype of PTSD that entails prolonged exposure
     to traumatic events, such as childhood abuse, neglect, or ongoing violence. Individuals with complex PTSD may
     experience a greater number and intensity of symptoms, including emotional dysregulation, self-perception and
     relational difficulties, and problems with impulse control (Giourou et al, 2018).

             PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

     A Psychosocial Perspective on PTSD

     Psychosocial factors for PTSD are critical to understanding and treating the condition. The type and severity of the
     traumatic event can impact the development and severity of PTSD symptoms. The duration and frequency of the
     trauma and the individual's age at the time of exposure can also play a role. Social support from friends, family, and
     community members can be a protective factor against PTSD. The lack of social support or negative social reactions,
     such as blame or disbelief, can worsen PTSD symptoms. Preexisting mental health conditions, such as anxiety and
     depression, can increase the risk of developing PTSD after a traumatic event. The ability to cope with stress and
     regulate emotions is significant in PTSD recovery. Individuals who use avoidance as a coping strategy may be at
     greater risk of developing PTSD. Cultural norms, beliefs, and environmental factors, such as living in a high-crime
     area or experiencing discrimination, can contribute to the development of PTSD.

     PTSD and Suicide
     PTSD has been associated with an increased risk of suicide, particularly among individuals who have experienced
     trauma related to combat or sexual assault. In addition, studies have found that individuals with PTSD are more
     likely to report suicidal thoughts or behaviors than those without PTSD. This risk is further increased in individuals
     with comorbid depression or substance use disorders. The increased risk of suicide in individuals with PTSD
     highlights the importance of early identification and treatment of the disorder, as well as the need for suicide
     prevention strategies tailored to this population's specific needs and experiences (Bentley et al., 2016).

     PTSD in Children
     PTSD in children is a serious mental health concern that can significantly impair their functioning, academic
     performance, social relationships, and overall well-being (Scheering & Zeanah, 2001). Children with PTSD often
     experience persistent and distressing memories of the event, avoid reminders, have negative alterations in mood
     and cognition, and experience hyperarousal symptoms, such as irritability or sleep disturbances (American
     Psychiatric Association, 2013).

     Some of the most common traumas reported by children diagnosed with PTSD are sexual or physical abuse and
     violent crimes. Disasters, such as floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, or fires, may also precipitate PTSD. Other events
     reported include school shootings, car crashes, war, the suicide of a friend or family member, or witnessing violence
     firsthand (National Center for PTSD, 2023). Regardless of the cause, early intervention and appropriate treatment,
     such as trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), can help mitigate the impact of PTSD on a child's life
     and foster resilience (Cohen et al., 2017).

     The prevalence of PTSD in children varies depending on age, gender, type of trauma, and socioeconomic
     background. Girls are more likely to develop PTSD than boys, and the risk increases with the severity and frequency
     of the traumatic experience (Cohen et al., 2017). Research suggests that anywhere from 14 to 43 percent of

17.4 · Trauma-Induced and Stress-Related Disorders                                                                    563

children experience at least one traumatic event during childhood, and up to 15 percent of girls and 6 percent of
boys who have experienced trauma develop PTSD (National Center for PTSD, 2023). Rates of PTSD are highest after
traumas involving interpersonal violence, such as rape or child abuse (Kessler et al., 2017).

Treatment of PTSD
PTSD is a complex and challenging disorder, but evidence-based interventions help individuals manage their
symptoms and improve their quality of life. Treatment approaches for PTSD typically include psychotherapy,
medication, or a combination. CBT is a widely used and effective psychotherapy approach for PTSD--particularly
exposure therapy, which involves gradually exposing the individual to the memories and situations associated with
the trauma in a safe and controlled environment. Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is another
psychotherapy approach that has shown promising results in treating PTSD. Medications, such as SSRIs and SNRIs,
are often used to treat symptoms of depression and anxiety that are common in individuals with PTSD. Other
interventions, such as mindfulness-based therapies and complementary and alternative treatments, may also be
helpful for some individuals with PTSD (National Institute of Mental Health, 2022c).

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) is a structured psychotherapy approach designed to address
the needs of individuals with PTSD and related symptoms. TF-CBT is a time-limited intervention that typically
involves twelve to sixteen weekly sessions, and it includes a variety of techniques to help individuals manage their
symptoms and improve their functioning. The therapy involves components, such as psychoeducation, relaxation
techniques, cognitive restructuring, exposure therapy, and family involvement (Cohen & Mannarino, 2015). This type
of therapy might be most beneficial for a veteran experiencing nightmares and flashbacks. Through gradual
exposure, a therapist would assist the veteran in confronting memories and feelings related to the traumatic events
in a safe and controlled environment. This gradual process would assist in reducing the emotional charge associated
with those memories (Ennis et al., 2021).

Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)
Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is a psychotherapy approach that has been shown to be
effective in treating symptoms of PTSD and related conditions. EMDR involves eye movements, hand tapping, or
other bilateral stimulation techniques while the individual focuses on traumatic memories or triggers. The goal of
EMDR is to facilitate the processing of traumatic memories and to reduce the intensity of associated emotional and
physiological responses (Shapiro, 2014). EMDR typically involves a structured series of sessions and may include
elements of CBT or other therapeutic approaches (National Center for PTSD, 2023).

This short video from the Veterans Health Administration explains eye movement desensitization
(https://openstax.org/r/77EMDP) and reprocessing (EMDP) for treatment of PTSD, sometimes used with veterans.

Medications
Medication can effectively treat PTSD, particularly when combined with psychotherapy. SSRIs and SNRIs are the
most commonly used medications for PTSD because they have been shown to be effective in reducing
accompanying symptoms of anxiety and depression (National Institute of Mental Health, 2023). Other medications
that may be used to treat PTSD include tricyclic antidepressants and atypical antipsychotics. Benzodiazepines are
generally not recommended for the treatment of PTSD, as they can be addictive and may interfere with the
processing of traumatic memories (Food and Drug Administration [FDA], 2020).

Alternative Therapies
In addition to traditional treatments, several alternative and self-help therapies may also help with PTSD symptoms.
Some examples include mindfulness-based therapies, yoga and meditation, equine therapy, and art therapy
(National Center for PTSD, 2023). Mindfulness meditation, for instance, involves being present in the moment and
observing one's thoughts and emotions without judgment. This practice can help individuals learn to regulate their
emotions and reduce stress.

Self-help strategies can provide individuals with tools and techniques to manage their symptoms daily. Learning
564  17 · Anxiety, OCD, and Trauma-Stressor Disorders

     about PTSD, its symptoms, and its treatment can help individuals understand their experiences and feel more in
     control of their symptoms. Relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and
     guided imagery, can help individuals reduce anxiety and stress. Regular exercise has been shown to be effective in
     reducing symptoms of PTSD, particularly depression and anxiety. Participating in a support group for individuals
     with PTSD can give them a sense of community and help them feel less isolated. Creative activities, like art or
     writing, can help individuals process their emotions and trauma-related experiences. These self-help strategies can
     be combined with traditional treatments to provide individuals with a holistic approach to managing their symptoms
     (National Center for PTSD, 2023).

     Nursing Interventions for PTSD
     Nurses play a critical role in the care of individuals with PTSD and can provide a range of interventions to support
     their recovery. For example, nurses can use standardized assessment tools to evaluate symptoms of PTSD and
     monitor changes over time. They can also provide individuals with information about PTSD and available treatments
     to help them understand their experiences and feel more in control of their symptoms. Nurses can help individuals
     with PTSD develop self-care strategies to manage their symptoms and can provide a safe and supportive
     environment for clients to express their feelings and process their experiences. Nurses can help individuals access
     appropriate treatments, such as psychotherapy and medication, and make referrals to other health-care providers
     as needed. By working closely with other health-care team members, such as psychiatrists and social workers,
     nurses can ensure coordinated and comprehensive care for individuals with PTSD (American Nurses Association,
     2022).

     CLINICAL JUDGMENT MEASUREMENT MODEL

     Applying the CJMM to a Person with PTSD

     Estelle is a thirty-year-old female who was diagnosed with anxiety and PTSD following an incident when she was
     attacked and robbed in a parking garage three years ago. She lives alone and has asked to be readmitted to the
     psychiatric unit because she states that she is "starting to feel worse" and reports that the symptoms of her
     PTSD are starting to interfere with her work in the bank where she is employed. Her symptoms on admission
     appear to include intrusive thoughts, flashbacks, hypervigilance and avoidance behavior, disturbed sleep
     pattern, and persistent worry. Following the incident, she was prescribed Sertaline (Zoloft) for management of
     her anxiety, which she reports taking as prescribed.

     Using the Clinical Judgment Measurement Model, the nurse can analyze the care planning for Estelle.

             experiences she has gone through. The nurse will continually monitor for the effectiveness of
             medications prescribed for Estelle and be mindful to observe for side effects and report any
             that occur. Estelle will be encouraged to participate in deep breathing and progressive muscle
             relaxation exercises to help her to relax. The interdisciplinary care team may discuss the
             possibility of using exposure therapy with Estelle in an attempt to gradually desensitize her to

By applying the Clinical Judgment Measurement Model, nurses can effectively address the complex needs of
clients with anxiety and PTSD. This care planning put in place for Estelle highlights the importance of clinical
reasoning, therapeutic communication, and collaborative care in nursing practice.

Acute Stress Disorder

After a traumatic event, such as a natural disaster, serious accident, or violent crime, a person can develop the
psychiatric condition called acute stress disorder (ASD). ASD is different from PTSD because it is a short-term
condition. ASD symptoms typically begin within four weeks of the traumatic event and last for a minimum of three
days and a maximum of one month. If symptoms persist beyond one month, the diagnosis may be changed to PTSD
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013).

Causes of Acute Stress Disorder
The causes of ASD are multifactorial and likely involve complex interactions between biological, psychological, and
environmental factors. For example, individuals who experience traumatic events may be at increased risk of
developing ASD if they have a history of prior trauma, a preexisting mental health condition, or a lack of social
support. In addition, neurobiological factors have been implicated in the development of ASD (Bryant & Harvey,
2000).

Diagnosis of ASD
The diagnosis of ASD is based on the presence of a cluster of symptoms--including intrusive thoughts or memories,
avoidance of event reminders, and hyperarousal or hypervigilance--that occur in response to a traumatic event.
According to the DSM-5, an individual may be diagnosed with ASD if they meet the following criteria: (1) exposure to
a traumatic event; (2) presence of nine or more symptoms related to intrusion, negative mood, dissociation,
avoidance, and arousal; (3) symptoms last for a minimum of three days and a maximum of one month; and (4)
566  17 · Anxiety, OCD, and Trauma-Stressor Disorders

     symptoms cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning (American
     Psychiatric Association, 2013).

     Treatment for ASD
     Treatment for ASD typically involves a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. SSRIs and SNRIs are
     effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression associated with ASD. Psychotherapeutic interventions,
     such as CBT and cognitive restructuring, are effective in treating ASD (Bertolini et al., 2020).

     Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
     Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) is a type of psychotherapy that has been shown to be
     effective in treating ASD. TF-CBT is a structured intervention that involves several components, including
     psychoeducation, relaxation techniques, cognitive restructuring, exposure therapy, and trauma narrative
     development. TF-CBT aims to help individuals process the traumatic event, develop coping skills, and reduce
     symptoms of anxiety and depression associated with ASD (Bryant, 2022).

     Cognitive restructuring, a key component of TF-CBT, has been shown particularly effective in treating ASD. Cognitive
     restructuring involves identifying and challenging negative or distorted thoughts and beliefs that may contribute to
     symptoms of anxiety and depression associated with ASD. For example, in cognitive restructuring, individuals learn
     to identify and challenge thoughts such as, "the world is a dangerous place" or "I am responsible for what
     happened," and replace them with more realistic and adaptive thoughts, such as "the world is generally safe" or "I
     am not responsible for what happened." Through this process, individuals can reduce symptoms of anxiety and
     depression and improve their overall functioning. Cognitive restructuring is typically used with other components of
     TF-CBT, such as exposure therapy and relaxation techniques (Bryant, 2022).

     Medications
     Medication treatment for ASD typically involves the use of SSRIs or SNRIs. These medications are commonly used
     to treat symptoms of anxiety and depression associated with ASD. In addition, providers may prescribe
     benzodiazepines over the short term to treat symptoms of anxiety and insomnia. Medications, such as imipramine,
     propranolol, morphine, hydrocortisone, and docosahexaenoic acid, have been administered to clients with ASD to
     help prevent escalation to PTSD (Bryant, 2022).

     Nursing Interventions
     Early intervention and ongoing support from nurses can improve outcomes for individuals with ASD and help
     prevent its evolution to PTSD. Nursing interventions for ASD typically involve providing emotional support and
     promoting coping strategies. Nursing intervention for ASD may include offering education on coping strategies, such
     as breathing techniques, guided imagery, mindfulness and meditation, laughter and humor relaxation techniques,
     deep breathing exercises, and mindfulness meditation (Felsenstein, 2024). Nurses can also provide referrals to
     mental health professionals for further assessment and treatment. In addition, nurses should be aware of the
     potential for comorbid physical health conditions, such as hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, they
     should monitor clients for signs and symptoms of these conditions (Mann & Marwaha, 2023).

     Attachment Disorders

     Also falling under the trauma umbrella are attachment disorders, a group of psychiatric conditions resulting from a
     disruption in the normal attachment process between a child and a caregiver. Children with attachment disorders
     may experience difficulties forming close, nurturing relationships and may exhibit avoidance, detachment, and
     aggression (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Attachment disorders are thought to result from genetics and
     from environmental factors, including a history of neglect, abuse, or multiple placements in foster care (Chaffin et
     al., 2006). In addition, children with attachment disorders are at increased risk for other mental health conditions,
     such as depression and anxiety, and may have difficulties in academic and social settings (Turner et al., 2019).

     Attachment Theory
     Developed by John Bowlby, attachment theory is a psychological model that explains how early interactions
     between infants and their caregivers can shape the development of social and emotional functioning across the
     lifespan. In other words, the theory describes the importance of attachment in regard to personal development.
     Attachment plays a crucial role in an individual's ability to form emotional connections and can greatly influence
     future relationships (Mcleod, 2017). According to the theory, infants develop a secure or insecure attachment style

     Access for free at openstax.org
17.4 · Trauma-Induced and Stress-Related Disorders                                                                       567

based on the responsiveness of their caregivers to their needs (Bowlby, 1969). Securely attached infants develop a
sense of trust and confidence in their caregivers and are more likely to form close, nurturing relationships with
others throughout life. In contrast, insecurely attached infants may develop anxious or avoidant attachment styles,
resulting in difficulties forming close relationships and regulating emotions. Attachment theory has been widely
researched and applied to various psychological and social phenomena, including romantic relationships, parenting,
and mental health (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016). There are four main attachment styles: secure, anxious, avoidant,
and disorganized (Huang, 2020).

Secure Attachment
Secure attachment in adults is characterized by the ability to form close and trusting relationships, regulate
emotions, and communicate effectively with others. Secure attachment is characterized by a child's ability to trust
and rely on their caregivers for comfort and support in times of distress (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
Securely attached children generally grow up to be emotionally available and responsive adults. Adults with secure
attachment styles are comfortable with intimacy and rely on others for support during times of stress or distress. As
a result, they can maintain a healthy balance of independence and dependence in their relationships (Mikulincer &
Shaver, 2016).

Research suggests that individuals with secure attachment styles have better mental health outcomes, including
lower levels of anxiety and depression and higher levels of life satisfaction (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016). In addition,
secure attachment has been associated with positive outcomes in various life domains, including academic
achievement, career success, and social relationships.

Anxious Attachment
Anxious attachment is a type of insecure attachment characterized by a need for closeness and intimacy but with a
persistent fear of rejection or abandonment. Children with anxious attachment styles may cling to their caregivers
and become anxious or distressed when separated from them. While this is normal, expected behavior for children
between approximately nine months and two years, it can be diagnosed as a malady in older children. They may
become easily overwhelmed by stress and have difficulty regulating their emotions (Cassidy & Shaver, 2016).

In adults, anxious attachment can lead to various relationship difficulties, including clinginess, jealousy, and
emotional volatility. In addition, adults with anxious attachment styles may have a negative view of themselves and
be highly critical of their partners. They may also experience intense anxiety and distress when their partners are
unavailable. Research suggests that anxious attachment styles are associated with a range of negative outcomes,
including higher levels of anxiety and depression, poorer social functioning, and difficulties in regulating emotions
(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016).

Avoidant/Dismissive Attachment
Avoidant/dismissive attachment is a type of insecure attachment characterized by a need for independence and
discomfort with intimacy and closeness. Children with avoidant/dismissive attachment styles may seem emotionally
detached or indifferent to their caregivers and may not seek comfort or support during distress (Cassidy & Shaver,
2016). They may also be highly self-sufficient and resist being comforted by others.

In adults, avoidant/dismissive attachment can lead to a preference for emotional distance and independence in
relationships. Adults with avoidant attachment styles may avoid close relationships and feel uncomfortable with
intimacy or emotional expression. They may also need control and resist being vulnerable or dependent on others
(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016).

Research suggests that avoidant/dismissive attachment styles are associated with various negative outcomes,
including difficulties in forming and maintaining close relationships, higher levels of anxiety and depression, and
decreased emotional regulation (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016).

Disorganized Attachment
Disorganized attachment is a type of insecure attachment characterized by inconsistent or unpredictable behavior in
caregivers, leading to confusion and fear in children. Children with disorganized attachment styles may exhibit a
range of behaviors, such as freezing or appearing dazed, showing fear or aggression toward their caregivers, or
engaging in disorganized and confused behavior during interactions (Cassidy & Shaver, 2016).
568  17 · Anxiety, OCD, and Trauma-Stressor Disorders

     Disorganized attachment can manifest in adults as a lack of relationship coherence or organization. Adults with
     disorganized attachment styles may struggle with emotional regulation and have difficulty managing their own
     emotional responses to stress and conflict. They may also experience confusion or fear in their relationships and
     have difficulty making sense of their own behavior or the behavior of others (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016).

     Research suggests that disorganized attachment styles are associated with various negative outcomes, including
     higher levels of anxiety and depression, difficulties in regulating emotions, and challenges in forming and
     maintaining close relationships (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016).

     Diagnosing Attachment Disorders in Children
     Attachment disorders in children can manifest in various ways, including behavioral, emotional, and social
     difficulties. For example, children with attachment disorders may display aggressive or hostile behavior toward
     caregivers, peers, and authority figures. They may also be withdrawn, emotionally detached, or overly compliant. In
     addition, children with attachment disorders may have difficulty forming close relationships with others and struggle
     with social skills, such as sharing, taking turns, and cooperating with others. Emotional regulation may also be a
     challenge, leading to mood swings, tantrums, and difficulties with self-soothing. These difficulties can interfere with
     academic achievement, social development, and well-being (Ellis et al., 2022).

     The DSM-5 includes two diagnoses related to attachment disorders in children: reactive attachment disorder
     (RAD) and disinhibited social engagement disorder (DSED). Both can result from a history of neglect, abuse, or
     multiple placements in foster care and are associated with difficulties in emotional regulation, social skills, and
     overall functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). The criteria for RAD include a consistent pattern of
     emotionally withdrawn or unresponsive behavior toward caregivers, a lack of positive attachments to caregivers,
     and limited social and emotional responsiveness to others (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). In addition,
     children with RAD may exhibit persistent fear, sadness, or irritability and may avoid or resist comfort from
     caregivers. The criteria for DSED include a pattern of indiscriminate, overly trusting behavior toward unfamiliar
     adults and an absence of appropriate wariness of strangers (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Children with
     DSED may approach and interact with strangers in an excessively friendly or familiar manner without regard for their
     own safety.

     Attachment Disorders in Adults
     Attachment disorders can also occur in adults and may result from various factors, such as childhood trauma,
     disrupted family relationships, or the loss of a loved one. Attachment disorders can manifest as difficulties in
     forming and maintaining close relationships, emotional dysregulation, and self-esteem challenges. Adults with
     attachment disorders may struggle with intimacy and trust and engage in maladaptive behaviors, such as emotional
     withdrawal or overly dependent behavior. These individuals often appear disconnected or disengaged from other
     people's feelings and tend to withdraw from connections. They may also have difficulty maintaining social
     relationships, whether romantic or platonic, and may struggle to show and receive affection. In addition, attachment
     disorders have been associated with various mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, and personality
     disorders (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016).

     Treatment of Attachment Disorders
     The treatment for attachment disorders typically involves therapy. Therapeutic interventions may include
     attachment-based interventions, such as parent-child interaction therapy or play therapy, to improve attachment
     and promote positive interactions between caregivers and children (Zeanah et al., 2016). For adults, attachment-
     focused therapies, such as attachment-based psychotherapy or emotion-focused therapy, address underlying
     attachment issues and promote healthier relationship patterns (Brisch, 2014). While medication may target specific
     symptoms associated with attachment disorders, it is not considered a first-line treatment (Kobak et al., 2015).

     Nursing Interventions
     Developing a nursing care plan for clients with attachment disorders involves a comprehensive assessment of the
     client's physical, emotional, and behavioral needs. The care plan should be individualized and based on the client's
     specific symptoms and personal and cultural preferences. It may include therapeutic interventions to promote
     positive interactions between caregivers and children, such as providing a safe and nurturing environment and
     promoting healthy attachment. In addition, the care plan may include medication management, if necessary, and
     education and support for the client and their family (Mayo Clinic, 2022a).

17.5 Dissociative Identity Disorder

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Define dissociative disorder
    · Recall the symptoms and prevalence of dissociative identity disorder
    · Outline approaches to treating dissociative identity disorder

A disruption in consciousness, memory, identity, or perception not caused by substance use or a medical condition
are considered a dissociative disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). The most commonly known
dissociative disorder is dissociative identity disorder. Formerly known as multiple personality disorder, dissociative
identity disorder is characterized by the presence of two or more distinct personality states, with a disconnection in
the individual's sense of self and actions (Moore, 2016). People with dissociative identity disorder experience
frequent dissociative amnesia, which is a gap in memory involving important personal information (Drescher,
2022). This disorder may also encompass a range of dissociative symptoms, such as dissociative fugue, which may
entail unexpected or unplanned travel and amnesia regarding one's identity, and depersonalization/derealization
disorder, marked by feelings of detachment from oneself or their surroundings (American Psychiatric Association,
2013).

Defining Dissociative Disorder

Dissociative disorders are psychiatric conditions characterized by disruptions in consciousness, memory, identity,
emotion, perception, behavior, and sense of self (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). These disturbances may
be sudden or gradual, acute or chronic. Dissociative disorders are thought to arise as a psychological defense
against trauma, enabling the person to compartmentalize memories and experiences that are too much for them to
process (Subramanyam et al., 2020).

Diagnosing Dissociative Disorders
Diagnosing dissociative disorders can be a complex process that requires a comprehensive clinical assessment by
mental health professionals knowledgeable about these conditions. The diagnosis generally involves a detailed
interview to explore the client's symptoms, taking a history of trauma, and performing a mental status examination.
The use of specific diagnostic tools, such as the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) or the Structured Clinical
Interview for Dissociative Disorders (SCID-D), can aid in assessing the severity and nature of dissociative symptoms
(Loewenstein, 2018). The clinician assesses the nature, timing, and duration of dissociative symptoms, such as
memory loss, depersonalization, and personality alterations. In addition to evaluating the client's symptoms,
clinicians gather information from family members, previous medical records, and other sources to form a holistic
understanding of the client's condition. It is important to rule out other medical and psychiatric conditions that may
present with similar symptoms, such as seizure disorders or psychotic disorders, to ensure an accurate diagnosis
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013).

Possible Causes of Dissociative Disorders
Dissociative disorders are often caused by psychological trauma and may result in significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The underlying mechanisms are not fully
understood, but the disorders are believed to be coping strategies that separate distressing or traumatic information
from conscious awareness (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).

Symptoms and Prevalence of Dissociative Identity Disorder

DID is a complex psychiatric condition characterized by the presence of two or more distinct identity states. These
identities recurrently take control of an individual's behavior, consciousness, and memories, leading to significant
distress and functional impairment (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). The prevalence of DID varies across
cultures and populations. In the general population, the prevalence rate is estimated to be around 1.5 percent
internationally (Mitra & Jain, 2021). Research indicates that DID is more common among females, and there may be
a significant correlation between DID and a history of childhood trauma or abuse (Mitra & Jain, 2021).

Symptoms of DID typically include identity confusion, identity alteration, and amnesia. Identity confusion refers to
inner conflict or confusion regarding a person's identity. Identity alteration involves the display of different
570  17 · Anxiety, OCD, and Trauma-Stressor Disorders

     personalities or identities, while amnesia refers to the inability to recall personal information that cannot be
     explained by ordinary forgetfulness.

     Additionally, individuals with DID may experience depersonalization, derealization, self-harm, and suicidal
     tendencies (Drescher, 2022). The symptom of depersonalization refers to an alteration in the perception or
     experience of oneself, where an individual may feel detached or estranged from their thoughts, feelings, body, or
     actions. It often presents as a sensation of observing oneself from an outside perspective or feeling as if one's
     emotions and physical sensations are not truly their own (Simeon, 2024). On the other hand, derealization involves
     a feeling of detachment or estrangement from one's surroundings. People experiencing derealization may perceive
     the external world as unreal, dreamlike, or distorted. Objects, places, and even people may seem unfamiliar or
     changed in some way, leading to a sense of unreality or confusion. Like depersonalization, derealization can be
     deeply unsettling, impairing one's ability to engage with their environment (Simeon, 2024).

     Treatment of Dissociative Identity Disorder

     The treatment for DID is typically long-term and involves various therapeutic approaches tailored to the individual's
     unique needs and symptoms. The primary goal of treatment is to integrate the separate identity states into a
     cohesive and functional whole, thereby improving overall functioning and quality of life (International Society for the
     Study of Trauma and Dissociation [ISSTD], 2011).

     Psychotherapy is considered the mainstay of treatment for DID, emphasizing building trust, fostering a strong
     therapeutic alliance, and providing a safe environment for exploring traumatic memories and identity fragmentation
     (Gentile et al., 2013). Cognitive behavioral techniques challenge distorted thought patterns. Psychodynamic
     interventions help clients understand how past traumas have shaped their current identity structure and help
     promote the integration of various identity states into a cohesive self. Dialectical behavior therapy emphasizes
     mindfulness, emotional regulation, distress tolerance, and interpersonal effectiveness (Hohfeler, 2016).
     Pharmacological interventions, such as antidepressants or anxiolytics, may also be used to manage comorbid
     conditions like depression or anxiety. They are not considered a primary treatment for DID, however, because they
     do not specifically treat the dissociation (Gentile et al., 2013).

     Integrated Functioning
     The process of synthesizing different aspects of a person's identity, experience, and functioning into a cohesive and
     harmonious whole is called integrated functioning. This concept is particularly relevant in DID, where individuals
     experience fragmentation and disconnection among different identity states (Brand et al., 2019). In DID, integration
     involves merging various identity states into a unified sense of self. This process may include recognizing and
     accepting different parts as aspects of a single, complex person rather than as separate and disconnected entities.
     The goal is not to erase or negate the different parts but to acknowledge and harmonize them into a whole
     (Subramanyam et al., 2020). Many individuals with DID have amnesia or disconnection between different identity
     states. Integrating memories involves linking these disconnected memories to create a coherent narrative of one's
     life, including traumatic and nontraumatic experiences (Berntsen & Rubin, 2006). Integration of emotions and
     behaviors focuses on connecting emotions and behaviors across different identity states. It may involve recognizing
     patterns, understanding emotional triggers, and developing adaptive ways to express and manage emotions
     (Fassbinder et al., 2016). The ultimate goal of integration is to facilitate overall functioning in daily life. This
     improvement in functioning includes enhanced relationships, adequate vocational functioning, reduced distress,
     and improved quality of life. Achieving integrated functioning is not necessarily about the absence of symptoms, but
     about the ability to live a fulfilling and balanced life (ISSTD, 2011).

     Individual Psychotherapy
     Individual psychotherapy is considered the primary treatment modality for DID. It is a highly specialized and
     complex process that must be carefully tailored to the unique needs of each individual (Huntjens et al., 2019).
     Individual therapy begins with a comprehensive assessment to understand the client's symptoms, history, needs,
     and goals. The initial phase of therapy often focuses on stabilization, including managing acute symptoms, building
     coping skills, and addressing any immediate safety concerns, such as self-harm or suicidality. Once stable, clients
     may shift to therapy to process traumatic memories and experiences. These therapies can involve techniques like
     trauma-focused CBT, but it must be done carefully, considering the fragmented nature of memory and identity in
     DID. Therapy concludes with a focus on maintaining gains, generalizing skills to everyday life, and preparing for

termination. This phase ensures the individual can function effectively outside the therapeutic relationship
(Huntjens et al., 2019).

Establishing Safety
Establishing safety with DID clients is a crucial aspect of care, especially in nursing, where staff is often the first line
of support and contact for these individuals. Implementing strategies to promote safety can enhance the
therapeutic relationship, foster trust, and contribute to the recovery process. Education about the nature of DID,
including the complex interplay of dissociation, trauma, and identity fragmentation, is crucial. Knowledge about the
disorder can guide appropriate interventions and reduce misconceptions (ISSTD, 2011). A calm, predictable
environment can minimize triggers for dissociation. This might include consistent staffing, clear communication,
gentle handling of personal belongings, and respecting personal space (Purvis et al., 2013). Reassurance, grounding
techniques, and client-centered communication can facilitate reorientation and emotional regulation. Collaborating
with the client to develop individualized safety plans, including coping strategies and emergency contacts, can
empower the client and build trust (Brand et al., 2013). Understanding the client's cultural background and ethical
considerations is crucial for respectful and effective care because this can shape the experience of DID and the
therapeutic relationship. By focusing on these key areas, nurses can play a vital role in establishing safety with DID
clients, creating a foundation for therapeutic intervention and recovery (Kwame & Petrucka, 2021).

Confronting
Confrontation in therapy in the treatment of DID is delicate. It involves addressing behaviors, beliefs, or experiences
that may be problematic or hinder progress. Confrontation does not necessarily mean aggressive or forceful
challenges. It can be a gentle process of pointing out discrepancies or exploring contradictions in a client's thoughts,
feelings, or behaviors. The goal is to help the client gain insight and make positive changes (Rajhans et al., 2020).
Aggressive or poorly timed challenges can exacerbate dissociation, increase resistance, or damage the therapeutic
alliance (ISSTD, 2011). Before any confrontation can occur, develop a solid foundation of trust and safety,
understand the unique experiences of each identity state, build rapport, and create a secure environment to explore
challenging topics (Loewenstein, 2018).

Time the decision to confront specific issues carefully. The therapist must assess the client's readiness and the
therapeutic relationship's stability. Pacing is also crucial, allowing for gradual exploration and avoiding
overwhelming the client (Kwame & Petrucka, 2021). In DID, confronting traumatic memories prematurely or without
adequate preparation can lead to retraumatization. Therapists must be cautious in approaching trauma-related
content, ensuring the client has the necessary coping resources. While confrontation can be a useful therapeutic
tool, it requires caution, empathy, and a clear understanding of the complex dynamics of DID. A client-centered
approach that prioritizes safety, collaboration, and gradual exploration is likely to be more effective and ethical
(Loewenstein, 2018).

Integration and Rehabilitation
Rehabilitation in DID focuses on reintegration into daily life, improving functionality, and achieving life goals.
Building supportive relationships with family, friends, and community is vital. Peer support groups also play a
valuable role. Rehabilitation often involves a multidisciplinary approach, including medical care, psychotherapy,
occupational therapy, and social work. Coordination among these professionals ensures comprehensive care (Saha
et al., 2020). Developing strategies for managing stress and avoiding triggers can prevent the recurrence of
dissociative symptoms and promote ongoing recovery (SAMHSA, 2014).

        CLINICAL SAFETY AND PROCEDURES (QSEN)

QSEN Competencies in Treatment of DID

Applying the QSEN competencies to the treatment of DID helps guide the nurse to prioritize client safety, ethical
considerations, and evidence-based interventions.

    · Client-centered care: Understand the unique experiences of DID clients, including their history, individual
        identity states, and needs. Engage clients in shared decision-making and respect their preferences and values
        (Sherwood & Barnsteiner, 2017).
572  17 · Anxiety, OCD, and Trauma-Stressor Disorders

         · Teamwork and collaboration: Collaborate with an interdisciplinary team, including therapists, psychiatrists,
             social workers, and family members. Maintain open communication and shared goal-setting to support the
             client's integration and rehabilitation (Ndibu Muntu Keba Kebe et al., 2019).

         · Evidence-based practice: Utilize evidence-based interventions like individual psychotherapy, cognitive
             behavioral techniques, and dialectical behavior therapy. Regularly assess outcomes to refine the treatment
             plan (Fassbinder et al., 2016).

         · Quality improvement: Monitor the client's progress throughout treatment, identifying areas for improvement.
             Utilize DID assessment tools and client feedback to ensure ongoing quality of care (Wong et al., 2020).

         · Safety: Establish a safe therapeutic environment that promotes trust and minimizes triggers or
             retraumatization. Implement safety protocols to manage crises and prevent self-harm or harm to others
             (Loewenstein, 2018).

         · Informatics: Leverage electronic health records and other informatics tools to track progress, document
             interventions, and coordinate care across providers. Ensure privacy and confidentiality in handling sensitive
             information related to DID and trauma history (Kariotis et al., 2022).

     QSEN competencies provide a comprehensive framework for safe, effective, and ethical care for DID clients. By
     focusing on client-centered care, teamwork, evidence-based practice, quality improvement, safety, and informatics,
     nurses can contribute to the successful treatment and support of individuals with DID (Sherwood & Barnsteiner,
     2017).

Summary

17.1 Stress and Anxiety

Individuals often experience stress, both emotional and physical, during their lifetime. Chronic stress has been
linked to adverse health outcomes, such as weakened immune systems, slow wound healing, and an increased risk
of chronic diseases (Ford et al., 2023). As such, nursing professionals must recognize signs of stress in their clients
and employ effective stress-reduction techniques. Effective strategies to alleviate client stress include clear
communication, creating a comfortable environment, involving clients in decision-making, and providing
psychological support (Chesak et al., 2019).

Anxiety is a diagnosable mental health condition that comes in various forms and degrees. Anxiety is characterized
by feelings of fear, apprehension, and unease, often accompanied by physical symptoms, such as sweating,
palpitations, and shortness of breath. There are many strategies that a person can employ to help prevent or relieve
anxiety. If these are unsuccessful, the person might be recommended a range of therapeutic or pharmaceutical
approaches to treatment.

17.2 Anxiety-Related Disorders

GAD, phobias, and panic disorder are distinct anxiety disorders, each with unique characteristics and treatment
approaches. GAD is characterized by chronic and excessive worry about daily life, often accompanied by physical
symptoms, such as muscle tension and sleep disturbances (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Phobias are
marked by an intense and irrational fear of specific objects or situations that leads to avoidance behavior; exposure
therapy is a common and effective treatment for phobias (Choy et al., 2007). Panic disorder involves recurrent and
unexpected panic attacks, often accompanied by anticipatory anxiety and avoidance of panic-inducing situations.
While these disorders share some common features, such as the involvement of fear and anxiety, their diagnostic
criteria, underlying mechanisms, and treatment strategies differ, necessitating a tailored approach to care for each
individual (Cleveland Clinic, 2023).

17.3 Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic mental health disorder in which obsessive thoughts lead to
anxiety that individuals attempt to soothe with compulsive rituals. The condition can be very disruptive for the
person, leading to challenges in their ability to work, study, or carry out social relationships. In addition, the
condition may result in physical and emotional difficulties for the person. There are a variety of treatments, among
them, pharmaceuticals, imaginal exposure, exposure and response prevention, and habit reversal training.

17.4 Trauma-Induced and Stress-Related Disorders

This section explored various mental and emotional disorders, providing insight into causes, diagnosis, symptoms,
nursing care, and treatment approaches. BDD, hoarding, trichotillomania, excoriation, PTSD, ASD, and attachment
disorders all have genetic, neurobiological, and environmental influences to various degrees. Most of these
disorders respond to a combination of pharmaceutical and therapeutic interventions, and many also benefit from
alternative and self-help therapies. Planning nursing care necessitates understanding each client's situation,
background, history, and symptoms, and individualizing care to support recovery.

17.5 Dissociative Identity Disorder

Dissociative disorders are mental conditions characterized by a disconnection between thoughts, memories,
feelings, actions, or sense of identity. These disorders often stem from trauma. DID is characterized by the presence
of two or more distinct identity states that control an individual's behavior, consciousness, and memory. Symptoms
include memory gaps, altered perceptions, confusion about personal identity, and the existence of different
personalities. DID is a complex disorder requiring a nuanced and individualized treatment approach, emphasizing
safety, psychotherapeutic intervention, integration, and rehabilitation. Understanding the definition, symptoms, and
treatment strategies is essential for effectively managing and supporting individuals with DID (American Psychiatric
Association, 2013).

CHAPTER OUTLINE
18.1 Identification and Diagnosis
18.2 Cluster Disorders (A, B, C)
18.3 Nursing Care and Treatment Approaches
INTRODUCTION Personality is like the fingerprint of the soul, defining who individuals are and shaping how they
interact with the world. It's what makes people unique, influencing their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Whereas
some people are outgoing and adventurous, others are more reserved and introspective; personalities encompass a
wide range of traits that contribute to individuality.
For some individuals, however, personality traits can become so rigid and deeply ingrained that they interfere with
their ability to navigate life smoothly. This is where personality disorders come into play. Picture it like a
kaleidoscope of maladaptive patterns that influence how someone perceives themselves, relates to others, and
copes with life's challenges. Personality disorders are not just quirks or simple character flaws, they are serious
behavioral health conditions that require understanding, compassion, and specialized treatment.
By understanding the complexity of personality and the unique struggles faced by those with personality disorders,
nurses can promote empathy, reduce stigma, and foster a more compassionate society. It's important to remember
that nobody is defined solely by their disorder, and everyone needs a chance to be seen and understood beyond
their diagnosis. Through education, awareness, and support, nurses can help create a world where individuals with
personality disorders are empowered to embrace their strengths, navigate their challenges, and lead fulfilling lives.

     18.1 Identification and Diagnosis

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Outline the general symptoms of personality disorders and how they develop
         · Describe and identify diagnostic criteria for personality disorders

     Understanding the symptoms and diagnostic process of personality disorders is essential in recognizing and
     addressing these complex mental health conditions. Personality disorders are classified into three clusters: cluster
     A, schizoid personality disorder; cluster B, antisocial personality disorder; and cluster C, avoidant personality
     disorder. This section explores the general symptoms exhibited by individuals with personality disorders, such as
     difficulties in interpersonal relationships, emotional instability, and distorted self-image. Additionally, this section
     will delve into the diagnostic process, which involves a provider comprehensively assessing a person's symptoms,
     taking a personal history, and observing behaviors. By gaining insight into the symptoms and diagnostic criteria of
     personality disorders, nurses can develop a better understanding of these conditions and their impact on
     individuals' lives, promoting early recognition and effective intervention.

     Symptoms and Signs of Personality Disorders

     Personality disorders are characterized by rigid and inflexible traits that are pervasive and persist over time
     (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2022a). These patterns are typically stable and consistent, beginning in
     adolescence or early adulthood and continuing throughout a person's life. While specific symptoms and signs vary
     depending on the type of personality disorder, some common features and patterns often exist. Here are some
     general symptoms and signs that can be associated with personality disorders:

         · Distorted self-perception: Individuals with personality disorders may have an unstable or unclear sense of
             self, fluctuating self-esteem, and a tendency to define themselves through their relationships or external
             validation.

         · Dysfunctional relationships: Difficulty establishing and maintaining healthy relationships is often a hallmark of
             personality disorders. This can manifest as intense, unstable, or conflicted relationships, a fear of
             abandonment, or patterns of idealization and devaluation.

         · Emotional instability: People with personality disorders may experience intense and fluctuating emotions,
             such as anger, anxiety, depression, or chronic feelings of emptiness. Emotional regulation may be challenging,
             leading to impulsive or self-destructive behaviors.

         · Maladaptive coping mechanisms: Individuals with personality disorders may employ maladaptive coping
             strategies, such as substance misuse, self-harm, or engaging in risky behaviors as a means of managing
             distress or avoiding emotional pain.

         · Cognitive and perceptual distortions: Distorted thinking patterns, including black-and-white thinking,
             excessive suspicion, and difficulty with empathy or perspective-taking, are common in personality disorders.

         · Impaired functioning in multiple areas: Personality disorders often interfere with various domains of life, such
             as work, education, relationships, and self-care.

     Clients with personality disorders have symptoms in two or more of the following areas: cognition (ways of
     perceiving and interpreting self, other people, or events), affectivity (the range, intensity, lability, and
     appropriateness of emotional response), interpersonal functioning, and impulse control.

     Defining Personality and When It Becomes a Disorder
     The unique and enduring patterns of thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that characterize individuals and distinguish
     them from others is a person's personality (APA, 2022a). It encompasses a person's consistent ways of perceiving,
     interpreting, and interacting with the world around them. Personality is shaped by a combination of genetic,
     biological, and environmental factors, including upbringing, culture, and life experiences. It is considered relatively
     stable over time, but it can also evolve and change to some extent as individuals grow, learn, and adapt to new
     circumstances.

     The characteristics, whether considered positive or negative, that make up one's personality are considered their
     personality traits. A person is considered to have a personality disorder when they exhibit enduring patterns of
     thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that deviate significantly from cultural norms and these patterns cause

18.1 · Identification and Diagnosis                                                                                         593

significant distress and impairment in functioning (APA, 2022a). These patterns are characterized by rigidity,
inflexibility, and maladaptive behaviors that affect various aspects of an individual's life. The key diagnostic factor is
the impact on functioning and well-being. While everyone has unique personality traits, a personality disorder is
diagnosed when these traits cause significant distress, disrupt daily life, and lead to difficulties in relationships,
work, or other areas of functioning.

Possible Causes of Personality Disorder
Personality disorders are among the least understood mental health conditions (Fariba et al., 2023). Scientists are
still trying to figure out precisely what causes them. So far, they believe the following factors may contribute to the
development of personality disorders:

    · Genetics: Scientists have identified malfunctioning genes that may be a factor in schizotypal, borderline
        personality disorder (BPD), antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), and obsessive-compulsive personality
        disorder (OCPD). They are also researching genetic links to certain emotions, such as aggression, anxiety, and
        fear, which are traits that can play a role in personality disorders (Cleveland Clinic, 2022).

    · Brain changes: Scientists have been able to identify brain differences in certain people with personality
        disorders (Cleveland Clinic, 2022). For example, research on paranoid personality disorder has shown altered
        amygdala functioning. The amygdala is the part of the brain involved in the formation and storage of emotional
        memories, particularly those associated with fear and aggression.

    · Childhood trauma and abuse: Adverse experiences during childhood, such as abuse, neglect, trauma, or
        inconsistent parenting, can contribute to the development of personality disorders. For example, people with
        borderline personality disorder have higher rates of childhood sexual trauma (Cleveland Clinic, 2022).

    · Cultural factors: Cultural factors may also play a role in the development of personality disorders, as
        demonstrated by the varying rates of personality disorders between different countries.

        CULTURAL CONTEXT

Personality Disorders and Cultural Factors

Part of the defining feature of a personality disorder is that the behaviors exhibited must be different from the
cultural norms of the client. Different cultures have different standards for what is considered "normal" behavior
and this must be taken into account during the diagnostic process. Behavior that is considered normal in one culture
can lead to stigma, discrimination, ostracization, and even institutionalization and incarceration in another.

The differences in the prevalence of personality disorders between cultures may be influenced by factors, such as
race, ethnicity, social requirements, and the dimension of individualism-collectivism. These standards will influence
the personality and behaviors of the population and how personality disorders are diagnosed. Asian cultures tend to
be collectivistic, emphasizing cooperation and contribution to the needs of the group above the needs of the
individual, which can lead to lower rates of antisocial personality disorders.

Maladaptive and Undesirable Behavior
Patterns of thoughts, emotions, and actions that are ineffective or counterproductive to normal, everyday life are
considered maladaptive behavior. Individuals with personality disorders typically turn to maladaptive behaviors as
coping mechanisms to help manage distress or avoid emotional pain. For example, individuals with borderline
personality disorder may engage in impulsive and self-destructive behaviors, such as self-harm or substance
misuse, as a way to regulate intense emotions. These coping strategies may provide temporary relief but can lead to
further distress and negative consequences in the long run.

Emotional dysregulation is a common feature of many personality disorders. Individuals may experience intense
and rapidly shifting emotions, such as anger, sadness, fear, or emptiness. Their emotional responses may be
disproportionate to the situation or difficult to control, leading to impulsive and disruptive behaviors. For instance,
individuals with antisocial personality disorder may engage in the financial manipulation or exploitation of others.
They often display a lack of remorse or empathy, which allows them to engage in these behaviors.

People with personality disorders often exhibit distorted and maladaptive patterns of thinking. They may hold rigid
beliefs, engage in black-and-white thinking, or have a skewed perception of themselves and others. These cognitive
594  18 · Personality Disorders

     distortions can contribute to negative self-image, feelings of worthlessness, and impaired decision-making abilities.
     For example, individuals with avoidant personality disorder may have an intense fear of rejection or criticism,
     leading to avoidance of social situations and persistent feelings of inadequacy.

     Personality disorders often involve difficulties in forming and maintaining healthy relationships. Individuals may
     struggle with maintaining boundaries, have intense and unstable relationships, or exhibit manipulative and
     controlling behaviors. For instance, individuals with narcissistic personality disorder often have an exaggerated
     sense of self-importance, lack empathy, and exploit others for personal gain. These interpersonal difficulties can
     lead to conflicts, social isolation, and a cycle of turbulent relationships.

     Maladaptive behaviors are not intentional or chosen by individuals with personality disorders. They arise from deep-
     seated patterns ingrained over time and are often rooted in underlying emotional and psychological struggles.
     Addressing these behaviors requires a comprehensive and individualized approach that combines therapy, support,
     and skill-building techniques to promote healthier coping mechanisms, improved interpersonal relationships, and
     enhanced emotional regulation.

             LINK TO LEARNING

     The Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust has created a short video about diagnosing, treating, and living with a
     personality disorder (https://openstax.org/r/77persondisordr) that features discussions with clients with personality
     disorders and professionals who help in their treatment.

     Diagnosis of Personality Disorders

     Personality disorders can only be diagnosed by highly trained, qualified professionals--generally a psychiatrist, a
     psychiatric nurse practitioner, or a clinical psychologist--following a comprehensive and complex history and
     behavioral assessment of the client. It is important to remember that many clients who are diagnosed with
     personality disorders do not initially present seeking treatment for personality disorder (Fariba et al., 2023). Many
     present with other complaints, such as depression, anxiety, issues with interpersonal relationships, or persistent
     problems at work. It is up to the clinician to perform an accurate diagnosis.

     The process usually begins with an initial assessment, during which the clinician gathers information about the
     individual's symptoms, medical history, and personal background. They may conduct interviews with the individual
     and, if possible, obtain information from family members or friends. They might employ certain tests, such as the
     McLean Screening Instrument for Borderline Personality Disorder (McKay et al., 2022), which is a ten-question yes/
     no survey questioning feelings and relationships. The clinician will observe the client's behavior for characteristics,
     such as appropriate emotional responses during therapy sessions. Other mental diagnoses, such as mood disorders,
     substance misuse, or anxiety, can have symptoms that mimic personality disorders, and providers must rule them
     out.

     Two of the most defining diagnostic characteristics of personality disorders are their persistence or the length of
     time that the symptoms have been present and how significantly they impair the client's life (APA, 2022a). The
     clinician must consider whether the symptoms and patterns of behavior of the personality disorder appeared before
     young adulthood; if they are consistent with the client's long-term functioning; and if they significantly impair the
     client's functioning in various areas of life, such as work, relationships, or self-care. Only after gathering all of this
     relevant information is the clinician able to make an informed decision about the client's diagnosis.

     18.2 Cluster Disorders (A, B, C)

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Outline the key features related to different types of cluster A personality disorders
         · Outline the key features related to different types of cluster B personality disorders
         · Outline the key features related to different types of cluster C personality disorders

     Personality disorders can be grouped into three distinct clusters, each characterized by its own unique features and

18.2 · Cluster Disorders (A, B, C)                                                                                                     595

patterns. These clusters provide a framework for understanding the different types of personality disorders and the
challenges associated with them (Fariba et al., 2023).

Cluster A comprises the "odd and eccentric" personalities (APA, 2022a). People in this cluster often exhibit peculiar
behaviors, unconventional thoughts, and may come across as distant or detached. They may have difficulties
forming and maintaining social relationships and display patterns of suspicion, magical thinking, or idiosyncratic
beliefs.

Cluster B consists of the "dramatic, emotional, and erratic" personalities. Individuals within this cluster tend to
exhibit intense emotions, have unpredictable and turbulent relationships, and display attention-seeking behaviors.
They may struggle with emotional regulation, have a fragile self-image, and exhibit impulsive or manipulative
tendencies.

Cluster C encompasses the "anxious and fearful" personalities. Individuals in this cluster often experience high
levels of anxiety, fear, and a strong desire for security. They may exhibit patterns of avoidance, dependency, or
perfectionism as a way to manage their anxieties and seek reassurance.

Understanding these three clusters helps nurses recognize and categorize the diverse presentations of personality
disorders. While each cluster shares certain characteristics, it is important to remember that individuals within
these clusters can still have unique experiences and variations in symptom severity.

Cluster A

Cluster A personality disorders include paranoid personality disorder, schizoid personality disorder, and schizotypal
personality disorder (APA, 2022a). Cluster A is characterized by eccentric, odd, or peculiar behavior, thinking, and
beliefs. Individuals with these disorders often struggle socially. They can often appear distrustful of and detached
from others (Figure 18.2).

Paranoid
Paranoid personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of distrust and suspicion of others (APA,
2022a). It is diagnosed in individuals with four or more of the following characteristics beginning in early adulthood:
596  18 · Personality Disorders

         · suspects that others are abusing, hurting, or misleading them without any proof
         · is preoccupied with unjustified doubts about the loyalty or trustworthiness of friends or associates
         · is hesitant to share any information with others due to unjustified fear that the information will be used

             against them
         · attributes hidden, often threatening meanings to harmless remarks or events
         · is unforgiving and persistently holds grudges
         · is quick to perceives attacks on their self or character or reputation that are not obvious to others and tends to

             react angrily
         · has persistent, unfounded suspicions regarding the fidelity of their spouse or sexual partner

     People with this condition believe that others will exploit, injure, or deceive them, even when no evidence exists to
     support this belief. They are preoccupied with the idea of loyalty from friends and associates and are often highly
     suspicious, even when these people show supportive behavior.

     Schizoid
     Schizoid personality disorder is characterized by a pattern of detachment from social relationships and a limited
     range of emotional expression (APA, 2022a). It is diagnosed in individuals with four or more of the following
     characteristics beginning in early adulthood:

         · lack of interest in and desire for close relationships, including family relationships
         · tendency to choose solitary occupations or hobbies
         · lack of desire for or enjoyment of sexual experiences
         · seeming enjoyment of few, if any, activities
         · lack of close friends or confidants other than immediate family
         · indifference to praise or criticism from others
         · limited range of emotional expression, appearing detached or having a flattened affect

     Schizotypal
     Schizotypal personality disorder is a mental health condition characterized by odd or eccentric behavior, unusual
     beliefs or magical thinking, social and interpersonal difficulties, and a tendency toward perceptual and cognitive
     distortions (APA, 2022a). It is diagnosed in individuals with five or more of the following characteristics beginning in
     early adulthood:

         · The false belief that coincidental events relate to oneself, called ideas of reference. For example, a person
             shopping in a store sees two strangers laughing and believes that they are laughing at them, when, in reality,
             the other two people do not even notice them.

         · Strange beliefs or magical thinking that influence behavior and are not consistent with cultural norms. The
             idea that one can influence the outcome of specific events by doing something that has no bearing on the
             circumstances is called magical thinking. For example, a person watching a baseball game exhibits magical
             thinking when believing that holding the remote control in a certain position caused their favorite player to hit
             a home run.

         · Unusual perceptual experiences, including bodily illusions. A body illusion refers to a discrepancy between
             the actual physical characteristics of the body and the way it is perceived by an individual. For example, the
             client may report feeling as if their body is not their own.

         · Peculiar thinking and speech.
         · Paranoid ideation, feeling suspicious of others or like people are "out to get" them.
         · Emotional expressions that are flat, inappropriate, or lacking in range, such as a blunted or restricted affect.
         · Behaviors or appearance that is considered eccentric, peculiar, or unusual.
         · Few close relationships outside of immediate family members and a preference for solitary activities.
         · Extreme anxiety and discomfort in social situations.

     Cluster B

     Cluster B personality disorders include antisocial, borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic personality disorders
     (Figure 18.3). Cluster B personality disorders are characterized by dramatic, overly emotional, or unpredictable
     thinking or behavior. These individuals may also have a history of unstable relationships.

Antisocial
The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the
rights of others that begins in childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood (Mayo Foundation for
Medical Education and Research, 2023). In childhood or adolescence, symptoms may appear in the form of
aggression, dishonesty, theft, property destruction, and disregard for rules. Antisocial personality is not diagnosed in
clients before the age of eighteen, however, because their personalities are still developing. A person needs to be
eighteen years or older to be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder, but symptoms usually begin in
adolescence. Typically, adolescents will be diagnosed with conduct disorder then antisocial personality disorder
when they turn eighteen. Antisocial personality disorder is diagnosed in individuals with three or more of the
following characteristics (APA, 2022a):

    · failure to conform to social norms and laws; repeatedly engaging in illegal activities
    · deceitfulness, lying, or using aliases for personal gain or pleasure
    · impulsivity or failure to plan ahead
    · irritability and aggressiveness, often resulting in physical violence and assaults
    · reckless disregard for the safety of self or others
    · consistent irresponsibility, such as neglecting work or financial obligations
    · lack of remorse, indifference, or rationalizing behavior that harms or exploits others

Borderline
The central features of borderline personality disorder are a pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal
relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity that begins by early adulthood and is present in a
variety of contexts. It is diagnosed in individuals with five or more of the following characteristics beginning in early
adulthood (APA, 2022a):

    · desperate attempts to avoid real or imagined abandonment
    · a history of unstable and intense personal relationships that are characterized by splitting, or the alternating

        between extremes of idealization and devaluation of one's partner
    · identity disturbance, characterized by an unstable self-image or sense of self
    · impulsivity in at least two potentially self-damaging areas, such as reckless spending, substance misuse,

        reckless driving, binge eating, or engaging in unprotected sex
    · recurrent suicidal behaviors, gestures, or threats or self-harming behaviors
    · emotional instability due to marked reactivity of mood, such as intense and rapidly shifting emotions that may

        only last a few hours
    · chronic feelings of emptiness or boredom
    · inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger, often resulting in frequent displays of temper,

        physical fights, or verbal aggression
    · transient, stress-related paranoid thoughts or severe dissociative symptoms (dissociative symptoms include
598  18 · Personality Disorders

     the experience of detachment from oneself or reality) during times of extreme stress

     comprehensive site for those seeking information on BPD.

     Histrionic
     The essential features of histrionic personality disorder are a pattern of pervasive and excessive emotionality and
     attention-seeking behavior that begins by early adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts. It is diagnosed in
     individuals with five or more of the following characteristics (APA, 2022a):

         · discomfort in situations where one is not the center of attention, often seeking to be the focus of others
             through exaggerated behaviors and emotions

         · interaction with others that is characterized by inappropriate, seductive, or provocative behavior
         · rapidly shifting and shallow expression of emotion
         · use of physical appearance to draw attention to oneself, often with excessive attention to detail or

             exaggerated sexuality
         · speech that is lacking in detail and lacking in substance
         · theatrical and exaggerated emotional expression, often with rapidly shifting and exaggerated emotions
         · suggestible, easily influenced by others or circumstances, with a tendency to consider relationships to be

             more intimate than they actually are

     Narcissistic
     Narcissistic personality disorder is characterized by an inflated sense of self-importance, a constant need for
     admiration and attention, and a lack of empathy for others. It is diagnosed in individuals beginning in early
     adulthood with five or more of the following characteristics (APA, 2022a):

         · has a feeling of grandiosity--an exaggerated sense of self-importance--with beliefs of being unique, superior,
             and deserving of special treatment

         · dreams of limitless power, brightness, beauty, or the perfect love
         · believes they are exceptional and should only be associated with other special, high-status people
         · has an excessive need for admiration and a constant craving for attention, validation, and praise
         · has a sense of entitlement (i.e., expecting favorable treatment from others and feeling entitled to special

             privileges)
         · partakes in interpersonal exploitation, which entails taking advantage of others for personal gain, often

             without empathy or concern for others' feelings or needs
         · lacks empathy and the ability to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others
         · feels envious of others or believes others are envious of them
         · demonstrates arrogant or haughty behaviors or attitudes

     Cluster C

     Cluster C personality disorders share a common theme of anxious and fearful behaviors (Figure 18.4). They are
     characterized by a chronic pattern of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that are driven by a sense of fear, insecurity,
     and a desire for safety (Cleveland Clinic, 2022).

Avoidant
Avoidant personality disorder (AVPD) is characterized by a pervasive pattern of social inhibition, feelings of
inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to criticism or rejection. It is diagnosed in individuals beginning in early adulthood
with four or more of the following characteristics (APA, 2022a):

    · avoids occupational activities that involve significant interpersonal contact because of fears of criticism,
        disapproval, or rejection

    · is unwilling to get involved with people unless certain of being liked
    · shows restraint within intimate relationships because of the fear of being shamed or ridiculed
    · is preoccupied with being criticized or rejected in social situations
    · is inhibited in new interpersonal situations because of feelings of inadequacy
    · views self as socially inept, personally unappealing, or inferior to others
    · is unusually reluctant to take personal risks or to engage in any new activities because they may prove

        embarrassing

Dependent
Dependent personality disorder (DPD) is characterized by a pervasive and excessive need to be taken care of by
others. To be diagnosed, individuals must demonstrate five or more of the following characteristics beginning in
early adulthood (APA, 2022a):

    · needs excessive amounts of reassurance and advice from others when making everyday decisions
    · requires others to take on most of the major responsibilities for their life
    · has trouble disagreeing with people since they are afraid of losing their support or acceptance
    · has trouble doing things on their own due to a lack of self-confidence
    · has a strong need for support from others to the point of volunteering to do things that are unenjoyable in

        order to get it
    · feels anxious or helpless when alone because of fears of being unable to care for themselves
    · is eager to seek another relationship for approval and support when a close relationship ends
    · has consuming, unrealistic fears of being left to take care of themselves
600  18 · Personality Disorders

     Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder
     Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) is a psychological disorder characterized by a pervasive pattern
     of preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and control. It is diagnosed in individuals with four or more of the
     following characteristics beginning in early adulthood (APA, 2022a):

         · is consumed with specifics, guidelines, timetables, orders, or lists so that the main point of the action is lost
         · demonstrates perfectionism that gets in the way of finishing tasks (i.e., is unable to finish a job because they

             cannot reach their own excessively stringent standards)
         · is overly devoted to work to the detriment of personal hobbies and relationships
         · has an inflexible adherence to morals, ethics, or values, often with an unwillingness to compromise or bend

             the rules
         · is unable to discard or get rid of items, even when they have no practical value, due to a perceived need to

             save them or an intense emotional attachment to them
         · is hesitant to assign duties to others or collaborate with them unless they completely adopt their style of doing

             things
         · is stringent about saving money; tends to hoard money for future catastrophic events
         · shows rigidity and stubbornness

     Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) is an entirely different disorder than obsessive-compulsive
     disorder (OCD). OCPD includes long-term personality traits characterized by extreme perfectionism, rigidity, and
     adherence to rules. A person with OCPD is often proud of these personality traits. Conversely, OCD includes
     uncontrollable, recurring thoughts (obsessions) and/or behaviors (compulsions) that cause the individual significant
     emotional distress. Review 17.3 Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders for more details about obsessive-
     compulsive disorder.

     18.3 Nursing Care and Treatment Approaches

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Comprehend approaches and challenges to treating personality disorders
         · Outline coping mechanisms for clients living with a personality disorder and special considerations for

             children
         · Describe nursing care for a person with a personality disorder

     When it comes to the treatment of personality disorders, a comprehensive approach that combines various
     interventions is essential. This section focuses on general treatment approaches and the important role of nursing
     care in supporting individuals with personality disorders. From therapy to medication, lifestyle modifications to
     psychoeducation, health-care providers use a number of different interventions to address the unique needs of each
     client. Nursing care serves as a cornerstone in this process, encompassing assessment, planning, and
     implementation of individualized care plans. Nurses provide crucial support, guidance, and therapeutic
     interventions to help clients manage their symptoms, improve coping skills, and enhance overall well-being.

     Approaches to Treatment

     Personality disorders are some of the most difficult disorders to treat in psychiatry (Fariba et al., 2023). Clients with
     personality disorders often do not have insight into their condition and are unlikely to seek treatment for a
     personality disorder. They often go undiagnosed unless they seek treatment for another psychiatric or medical
     challenge.

     Individuals with personality disorders struggle to recognize that their difficulties in life are related to their
     personalities. They may truly believe their problems are a result of other people or outside factors. It is very
     common for clients with personality disorders also to have comorbid disorders, including substance misuse, anxiety,
     depression, or eating disorders. Medications may treat underlying co-occurring conditions, such as anxiety or
     depression. Psychotherapy, however, is recommended as the first line of treatment for all different personality
     disorders in order to help correct maladaptive thoughts and behaviors.

18.3 · Nursing Care and Treatment Approaches                                                                               601

Medications Used for Specific Symptoms
There are no medications specifically approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat personality
disorders (Fariba et al., 2023). However, several types of psychiatric medications may help with various personality
disorder symptoms:

    · Antidepressants: Antidepressants, including SSRIs, such as fluoxetine and sertraline, may be useful for those
        with a depressed mood, anger, impulsivity, irritability, or hopelessness.

    · Mood stabilizers: As their name suggests, mood stabilizers, such as valproate or lamotrigine, can help even
        out mood swings or reduce irritability, impulsivity, and aggression. Prescribing these, along with potential
        augmentation with second-generation antipsychotics, can be effective for schizoid and schizotypal types.

    · Antipsychotic medications: Also called neuroleptics, these may be helpful if symptoms include losing touch
        with reality (psychosis) or, in some cases, if there are anxiety or anger problems. Examples include olanzapine
        and quetiapine.

    · Antianxiety medications: These may help with anxiety, agitation, or insomnia. But in some cases, they can
        increase impulsive behavior, so they're not prescribed for certain types of personality disorders. Examples of
        these medications include clonazepam and buspirone.

With respect to medication, nursing care includes educating clients on the medicine, including the purpose,
potential benefits, and possible side effects. Monitor the client's response to medication closely, and assess for any
changes in symptoms, side effects, or adverse reactions. Monitor medication adherence, and communicate any
concerns or observations to the prescribing health-care provider. Document all related information thoroughly.

Psychosocial Therapies
Psychotherapy is the primary form of treatment for personality disorders. Various modalities, such as CBT, DBT, and
psychodynamic therapy, have proven effective. These therapies help individuals identify and change maladaptive
thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors; develop healthier coping strategies; improve social and interpersonal skills; and
enhance self-awareness.

Different personality disorders will have different goals in therapy and will require different tactics. For example, due
to their paranoia and lack of trust, clients with cluster A disorders tend to do much better with individual therapy
than group therapy (Fariba et al., 2023). Those suffering from cluster B disorders, such as borderline personality
disorder, can greatly benefit from group therapy.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
CBT is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on the connections between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors
(American Psychological Association, n.d.-b). It is based on the premise that thoughts influence emotions and
actions, and by changing thoughts, clients can effectively change their behavior and emotional well-being. CBT
recognizes the importance of behavioral change in improving functioning. It helps clients with personality disorders
identify the thoughts behind problematic behaviors and develop alternative, more adaptive behaviors. This may
involve practicing new coping strategies, problem-solving approaches, and social skills in real-life situations.
Through behavioral change, individuals can experience improved interpersonal functioning and increased overall
satisfaction in life. For example, histrionic clients can benefit from CBT focusing on their need for attention.
Likewise, individuals with cluster C personality disorders tend to benefit from CBT to address assertiveness,
independence, and attitude.

Dialectical Behavior Therapy
DBT is a type of cognitive behavioral therapy that was originally created for clients with borderline personality
disorder to help them cope with stress, control emotions, and establish healthy relationships. It is considered the
gold standard for treating borderline personality disorder and is also used for other types of disorders. The client
learns how to be aware of how thoughts, feelings, and behaviors link together. They learn how to use their senses to
be aware of what is happening around them and use strategies, such as mindfulness, distress tolerance,
interpersonal effectiveness, and emotion regulation, to react calmly in a crisis, avoid negative impulsive behavior,
and improve relationships.

Self-Care and Coping Strategies
Engaging in self-help strategies, such as maintaining a healthy lifestyle, practicing stress management techniques,
602  18 · Personality Disorders

     developing healthy relationships, and engaging in activities that promote self-care and personal growth, can be
     beneficial for individuals with personality disorders.

             PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

     Stress Management: Stimulate the Parasympathetic Nervous System

     For clients seeking immediate relief from intense symptoms, such as panic or depersonalization, nurses can teach
     how to stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system. Stimulation of the vagal nerve can result in an immediate,
     direct relief of intense emotions. This can be accomplished by doing the following:

         · Applying ice or ice-cold water to the face.
         · Performing paced-breathing techniques in which the exhalation phase is at least two to four counts longer

             than the inhalation phase. For example, advise the client to inhale while counting to four and then exhale
             while counting to eight.

     Challenges to the Treatment of Personality Disorders
     There are multiple issues with personality disorders that make them among the most difficult of psychiatric
     disorders to treat. Many individuals with a personality disorder lack insight into their condition and do not recognize
     their own emotional dysregulation, so they may exhibit treatment resistance. For example, clients with narcissistic
     personality disorder (NPD) rarely, if ever, come in for treatment and tend to be resistant to all suggestions (APA,
     2022a), although they would benefit from intensive psychotherapy.

     Issues of stigma may also prevent clients with suspected or diagnosed personality disorders from seeking
     treatment. Personality disorders still face stigma and misconceptions in society. Individuals with antisocial
     personality disorder, for instance, may experience stigma due to societal perceptions of them as "criminals" or
     "untrustworthy." This stigma can discourage them from seeking treatment and create barriers to accessing the help
     they need.

     Another challenge is the chronic nature of personality disorders and the deeply ingrained nature of associated
     thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. For example, clients with avoidant personality disorder may require long-term
     therapy to address their fear of social interaction and develop healthier coping mechanisms. Maintaining motivation
     and engagement in treatment over an extended period can be challenging for both the individual and the nurse.

     Many individuals with personality disorders may also struggle with comorbid conditions, such as depression,
     anxiety, or substance use disorders. For example, a nurse working with a client with narcissistic personality disorder
     and alcohol use disorder must address both the grandiosity and entitlement associated with narcissism and the
     underlying issues contributing to substance misuse. Treating both the personality disorder and the other diagnoses
     simultaneously is complex and requires integrated treatment approaches.

     A nurse's attitudes and feelings about clients with personality disorders can significantly affect their ability to plan
     and deliver effective nursing care. Attitudes and biases may arise due to personal experiences, societal stereotypes,
     or the challenging nature of working with individuals who have personality disorders. It is essential for nurses to
     recognize and address these biases to ensure the provision of compassionate and unbiased care. Addressing
     personal biases is an ongoing process that requires commitment and self-awareness. By adopting strategies to
     address their own biases, nurses can create a more inclusive and empathetic care environment for individuals with
     personality disorders, ultimately enhancing the quality of nursing care provided.

             CLINICAL SAFETY AND PROCEDURES (QSEN)

     QSEN Competency: Client-Centered Care

     Strategies for assisting nurses in overcoming biases when working with clients with personality disorder include the
     following:

     Self-reflection: Nurses should engage in regular self-reflection to identify and understand their own biases. This

     Access for free at openstax.org
18.3 · Nursing Care and Treatment Approaches                                                                            603

involves acknowledging personal attitudes and considering how these attitudes may influence interactions with
clients.

Education and training: Education and training on personality disorders will enhance nurses' understanding.
Increased knowledge can help challenge stereotypes and misconceptions, fostering empathy and compassion.

Supervision and support: A supportive work environment will allow nurses to discuss challenges openly. Regular
supervision can provide a platform for addressing biases, sharing experiences, and seeking guidance.

Cultural competence training: Training programs that focus on cultural competence and emphasize the need to
appreciate and respect diverse perspectives, including those associated with mental health conditions, will enhance
nursing care.

Client-centered approach: A tailored, client-centered approach helps shift the focus away from diagnostic labels
and fosters a more holistic view of the client.

Promote empathy: Nurses should empathize with the challenges faced by individuals with personality disorders.
This can be achieved through activities that promote perspective-taking and understanding the impact of the
disorder on the client's life.

Continuous learning: A culture of continuous learning and professional development keeps nurses abreast of current
research and evidence-based practices in mental health care and helps challenge outdated beliefs and practices.

Peer collaboration: Collaboration among nursing staff is critical. Peer discussions and collaboration provide
opportunities for sharing insights, strategies, and coping mechanisms when working with challenging client
populations.

(The Joint Commission, 2023)

Coping with Personality Disorders

Coping with a personality disorder poses unique challenges for individuals in major aspects of their daily lives.
Personal and work relationships will both be a focus of treatment. It is essential for the nurse to approach the
experience with self-awareness and understanding, recognizing that a personality disorder is just one aspect of a
person's identity, while acknowledging the importance of goals centered around personal and work relationships.

Interpersonal Relationships
Clients with personality disorders often struggle with interpersonal relationships due to their patterns of thinking
and behavior (Cleveland Clinic, 2022). Symptoms, such as intense and unstable emotions, difficulty recognizing and
maintaining boundaries, or a tendency toward social isolation, can result in unstable relationships. Coping with a
personality disorder in personal relationships requires cooperation from both the client and their loved ones. It is
crucial for loved ones to develop an understanding of the specific personality disorder and its associated symptoms.
Educating themselves about the challenges the client faces helps them differentiate the person from the disorder,
fostering empathy, and reducing the likelihood of taking behaviors personally (Kasalova et al., 2018). Individuals
with personality disorders often struggle with their own emotional pain. Encouraging empathy and compassion
among loved ones, while educating them to set and respect boundaries, can promote healthier relationship
dynamics. Recognizing the underlying challenges the client faces allows for more understanding and support.

Given that communication can be a significant challenge in relationships affected by personality disorders, clients
should focus on developing effective communication skills. Additionally, recognizing and working on emotional
sensitivity and regulation can help prevent unnecessary conflicts. Setting clear and healthy boundaries is essential
to protect the well-being of both the individual and their loved ones. Open and honest communication regarding
acceptable behavior is vital. Consistency in enforcing these boundaries is key to maintaining healthier relationship
dynamics.

In the Workplace
Self-awareness and self-management are the keys for individuals with a personality disorder who are learning to
cope in the workplace. It is essential for these clients to develop self-awareness regarding their symptoms, triggers,
and coping mechanisms. Understanding one's own strengths and limitations can help in managing symptoms and
604  18 · Personality Disorders

     minimizing their impact on work interactions. Additionally, practicing self-management techniques, such as stress
     reduction strategies and emotion regulation skills, can contribute to a more stable and productive work
     environment.

     Deciding whether or not to disclose a personality disorder in the workplace is a personal choice (Job
     Accommodation Network, 2023). If an individual chooses to disclose, it can be helpful to have open and honest
     communication with a trusted supervisor or human resources department. This can facilitate the implementation of
     workplace accommodations or adjustments that support the individual's needs. For example, a client with a
     personality disorder might benefit from a private, quiet area for grounding or reflection. Establishing clear
     communication channels and expressing any specific requirements or triggers can foster a more understanding and
     supportive work environment.

     Clients with a personality disorder may benefit from seeking other support within the workplace. This can include
     connecting with employee assistance programs, seeking out mentorship or coaching opportunities, or joining
     support groups. Having a support network can provide emotional support, guidance, and practical strategies for
     coping with workplace challenges.

     Identifying and leveraging personal strengths can contribute to success in the workplace. Recognizing areas where
     one excels and capitalizing on those strengths can boost confidence and job performance. Actively seeking
     professional development opportunities can enhance skills and knowledge, leading to increased confidence and job
     satisfaction. Pursuing relevant training, attending workshops, or engaging in ongoing learning can provide
     individuals with the tools to navigate workplace challenges and adapt to changing work environments.

     Maintaining healthy boundaries at work is crucial for individuals with a personality disorder. Setting clear
     expectations regarding workload, personal space, and interpersonal interactions can help manage stress and
     prevent burnout. Communicating boundaries assertively and respectfully can contribute to a more harmonious and
     productive work environment.

     Overall, it is important to manage stress and perform regular self-care and stress management techniques. This can
     include engaging in activities outside of work that promote relaxation, setting boundaries between work and
     personal life, and seeking therapy or counseling to address specific work-related concerns. Taking care of one's
     physical and mental well-being can enhance resilience and coping abilities in the workplace and help the client with
     better stress management.

     Issues in Children
     Managing a personality disorder in children can be a complex and challenging task that requires a multidimensional
     approach. It's important to note that personality disorders are typically not diagnosed in children, as they are
     considered more ingrained, stable patterns of behavior that develop during adolescence or adulthood and last over
     time (APA, 2022a). Antisocial personality disorder is never diagnosed in children under age eighteen. Children may,
     however, exhibit traits or behaviors that resemble those associated with personality disorders. For example, a child
     with conduct disorder may engage in such behaviors as bullying and physically threatening others, behavior that is
     associated with antisocial personality disorder. (See Children and Adolescents for more information on conduct
     disorder.) There are several general guidelines for treating children with such challenging personality traits.

     Early intervention and professional assessment are critical in the treatment of childhood personality issues. If a
     child displays persistent and extreme patterns of behavior that are causing significant distress or impairment, it is
     important to seek professional help. Mental health professionals experienced in working with children can conduct a
     comprehensive assessment to determine the underlying causes and appropriate interventions.

     Developing an individualized treatment plan is key for effectively managing behavioral disorders in children with
     characteristics of personality disorders (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, 2022). The plan may
     include various components, such as therapy, behavior management techniques, and support for the child and their
     family. Collaborate closely with mental health professionals to tailor the treatment approach to the child's specific
     needs. As with adults, psychotherapy can be beneficial in helping children with personality disorder-like traits
     develop healthier coping mechanisms, emotional regulation skills, and improved social interactions. Different
     therapeutic approaches, such as play therapy or family therapy, may also be effective, depending on the child's age,
     symptoms, and individual circumstances.

It's important to communicate and collaborate with teachers and school staff to ensure appropriate support and
accommodations for the child. Sharing information about the child's behaviors, challenges, and treatment plan can
help create a supportive learning environment and facilitate targeted interventions if needed.

Consistency in parenting practices and setting clear boundaries is important for children with personality disorder-
like traits. Providing a nurturing and structured environment with clear rules and expectations can help them
develop a sense of security and stability. Positive reinforcement and constructive discipline techniques are essential
for promoting healthy behaviors and emotional well-being.

It is also important to consider the caregivers when treating a child with personality disorder-like traits. It can be
emotionally demanding for the caregivers; therefore, it is essential for them to prioritize their own well-being and
seek support when needed. Engaging in self-care activities, accessing support groups or counseling for themselves,
and finding assistance can help caregivers maintain their own mental and emotional well-being.

Planning Nursing Care

Planning nursing care for a client with a personality disorder begins with a thorough assessment of the client.
Assessment of the client with a personality disorder includes interviewing the client, observing verbal and nonverbal
behaviors, completing a mental status examination, and performing a psychosocial assessment.

Nursing Diagnoses
After thoroughly assessing clients, nurses create individualized nursing care plans based on the client's response to
their mental health disorder(s). Common nursing diagnoses related to the clusters of personality disorders include
the following:

    · Cluster A: social isolation, disturbed thought process, risk for loneliness
    · Cluster B: risk for suicide, risk for self-directed violence, social isolation, chronic low self-esteem, ineffective

        coping
    · Cluster C: anxiety, risk for loneliness, social isolation

Examples of common nursing diagnoses for clients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder are described in
(Table 18.1).

     TABLE 18.1 Common Nursing Diagnoses for Clients with Borderline Personality Disorder

     Outcomes and Goals
     When working with clients with personality disorders, goals should address the nursing diagnoses with priority on
     safety. One way to do this is through the use of SMART objectives:

     · S = specific
     · M = measurable
     · A = attainable
     · R = realistic
     · T = time specific

     (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration, 2024).

     For example, if the client is hospitalized and receiving acute care, and has a nursing diagnosis of risk for self-
     mutilation, a SMART outcome could be, "The client will refrain from intentional self-inflicted injury during
     hospitalization." For a client receiving long-term outpatient therapy, with a nursing diagnosis of social isolation, a
     SMART outcome could be, "The client will meet a friend for coffee by the end of the month." Examples of other
     SMART outcomes for clients with a personality disorder may include the following: the client will seek help from
     staff when experiencing urges to self-mutilate during hospitalization, the client will identify three triggers to displays
     of violence by the end of the day, and the client will describe two preferred healthy coping strategies by the end of
     the week.

Implementing Interventions
When implementing planned interventions for clients with personality disorders, the nurse must always consider
safety first. Develop a crisis/safety plan with the client that includes components such as these: thoughts or
behaviors that increase the risk of harming self or others; people, events, or situations that trigger those thoughts or
behaviors; and coping strategies and resources.

For example, if a client performs superficial self-injurious behavior, the nurse should act based on agency policy
while remaining neutral and dressing the client's self-inflicted wounds in a matter-of-fact manner. The client may be
asked to write down the sequence of events leading up to the injuries, as well as the consequences, before staff will
discuss the event. This cognitive exercise encourages the client to think independently about their triggers and
behaviors and facilitates discussion about alternative actions.

De-escalation is an important intervention for certain clients with personality disorder. De-escalation is the use of
strategies and communication techniques to calm and reduce agitation or aggression in individuals experiencing
heightened emotional distress or crisis (The Joint Commission, 2019).

  CLINICAL JUDGMENT MEASUREMENT MODEL

  Take Action: Knowing How and When to De-Escalate a Client with Personality Disorder

  Taking action involves implementing appropriate interventions based on nursing knowledge, care priorities, and
  planned goals and outcomes to ensure optimal health in a client. When working with clients with a personality
  disorder, promoting safety for the nurse and the client includes being able to de-escalate when necessary. The
  nurse should implement de-escalation strategies if the client exhibits early signs of increasing levels of anxiety
  or agitation.

  Strategies include the following:

      · speaking in a calm voice
      · avoiding overreacting
      · implementing active listening
      · expressing support and concern
      · avoiding continuous eye contact
      · asking how you can help
      · reducing stimuli
      · moving slowly
      · remaining patient and not rushing them
      · offering options instead of trying to take control
      · avoiding touching the client without permission
      · verbalizing actions before initiating them
      · providing space so the client doesn't feel trapped
      · avoiding arguing and judgmental comments
      · setting limits early and enforcing them consistently across team members
      · addressing manipulative behaviors therapeutically

  If the client continues to escalate, measures must be taken to keep the client and others safe. Review signs of
  crisis and crisis interventions in Court Involvement. If interventions are not effective in de-escalating a client at
  risk to themselves or others, seclusion or restraints may be required. Review using seclusion and restraints in
  Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders and Other Psychotic Disorders.

Other interventions for clients with personality disorders should ultimately focus on strategies to assist with the
regulation of emotions and improving interpersonal relationships (Drescher, 2022). Table 18.2 lists some of these
strategies.

     Self-Reflection by Nurses
     Caring for clients with a personality disorder can be challenging both mentally and emotionally for the nurse
     (Bekelepi & Martin, 2022). When providing nursing care for such clients, it is necessary to self-reflect frequently to

     Access for free at openstax.org
18.3 · Nursing Care and Treatment Approaches                                                                             609

ensure that the nurse-client relationship remains therapeutic and the treatment plan is progressing. Self-reflection
allows nurses to identify and understand their own biases, assumptions, and prejudices that may influence their
interactions with clients. It helps them recognize any negative attitudes or judgments they may hold toward
individuals with personality disorders. By becoming aware of these biases, nurses can work toward providing
nonjudgmental and unbiased care.

When working with clients with personality disorders, transference and countertransference dynamics can arise
(see Psychoanalytical Theories and Therapies). For example, a client with dependent personality disorder may
develop strong feelings of dependency on their nurse, while the nurse may experience countertransference feelings
of overprotectiveness or frustration. Managing these relationships requires nurses to deal with their own complex
emotions while maintaining appropriate boundaries with the client.

Personality disorders often involve deeply ingrained patterns of behavior and emotional difficulties. Self-reflection
helps nurses develop empathy and compassion by encouraging them to put themselves in the client's shoes and
understand the challenges they face. This empathy can lead to more client-centered care and help build a
therapeutic alliance with the client.

        REAL RN STORIES

Personality Disorder

Nurse: Susan, RN
Years in Practice: 14
Clinical Setting: Acute psychiatric unit
Geographic Location: Texas

As a registered nurse working in an acute psychiatric unit, Susan often encountered clients with various mental
health challenges, including personality disorders. One particular client, Rodney, stands out in her memory.

Rodney was a thirty-five-year-old male admitted to the unit due to severe emotional dysregulation and self-harming
behaviors. He had a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and had a history of tumultuous relationships
and impulsive behaviors.

Initially, Susan found it challenging to establish a therapeutic relationship with Rodney. He exhibited intense mood
swings, often oscillating between extreme anger and profound sadness within minutes. He frequently engaged in
attention-seeking behaviors, such as threatening self-harm or attempting to manipulate staff members.

Despite the difficulties, Susan remained committed to providing compassionate care to Rodney. She utilized her
training in de-escalation techniques to manage his outbursts and maintain a safe environment for both Rodney and
the staff. Susan also collaborated closely with the multidisciplinary team, including psychiatrists, psychologists, and
social workers, to develop a comprehensive treatment plan tailored to Rodney's unique needs.

Over time, Susan noticed gradual improvements in Rodney's condition. Through consistent therapy sessions and
medication management, he gained insight into his maladaptive coping mechanisms and learned healthier ways to
regulate his emotions. Susan also worked with Rodney to develop coping skills, such as mindfulness and distress
tolerance techniques, to help him navigate stressful situations more effectively.

Despite setbacks along the way, including instances of self-harm and brief hospital readmissions, Susan witnessed
significant progress in Rodney's recovery journey. With ongoing support from the health-care team and
encouragement from Susan, he began to rebuild his life outside the hospital walls, forming more stable relationships
and pursuing meaningful activities.

Through her experience with Rodney, Susan learned the importance of patience, empathy, and perseverance when
caring for clients with personality disorders. She recognized that while challenging, providing compassionate and
nonjudgmental care could make a profound difference in their lives, helping them achieve greater stability and well-
being.

     Support for Nurses Treating a Client with Personality Disorder
     Clients can work for years to receive adequate treatment for a personality disorder. Navigating the emotional
     intensity, treatment resistance, interpersonal difficulties, and boundary issues can be challenging not just for the
     client but for the nurse as well (Bekelepi & Martin, 2022). It is important for nurses to seek support and resources
     when dealing with clients with personality disorders. Here are some avenues for receiving support:

         · Consult with colleagues: Discuss the challenges and concerns with colleagues, especially those who have
             experienced working with similar client populations. They may provide insights, guidance, or suggestions
             based on their own experiences.

         · Supervision and mentoring: Seek supervision or mentoring from more experienced nurses or nurse leaders.
             They can offer guidance, support, and feedback on challenging situations with clients with personality
             disorders.

         · Professional development and training: Take advantage of professional development opportunities, such as
             workshops, seminars, or online courses, that focus on understanding personality disorders and developing
             effective strategies for working with this population. Enhancing knowledge and skills can increase confidence
             and ability to provide quality care.

         · Consult the mental health team: Reach out to the mental health team within the health-care facility, including
             psychiatrists, nurse practitioners, psychologists, or social workers. They can provide consultation and
             guidance specific to the client's diagnosis and help nurses understand and manage the challenges they
             encounter.

         · Employee assistance programs (EAP): Many health-care organizations have EAPs that offer counseling and
             support services to employees. EAPs can provide confidential assistance for dealing with work-related stress,
             burnout, or difficult client situations. They make connections with mental health professionals who can offer
             guidance and support.

         · Support groups or peer networks: Seek out support groups or peer networks specifically designed for health-
             care professionals who work with clients with personality disorders or challenging mental health conditions.
             These forums provide a space to share experiences, exchange advice, and receive support from others facing
             similar challenges.

         · Personal therapy: Consider seeking personal therapy or counseling to address any emotional or psychological
             impacts of working with challenging client populations. Therapy can provide a confidential space to process
             feelings, develop coping strategies, and gain insights into reactions and boundaries.

     Remember that seeking support is not a sign of weakness but a proactive step toward maintaining a nurse's well-
     being and providing optimal care to clients. Nurses should take care of themselves both professionally and
     personally, and utilize the available resources to navigate the unique challenges associated with clients with
     personality disorders.

Summary

18.1 Identification and Diagnosis

There are multiple types of personality disorders, but they tend to have certain symptoms in common that lead to
diagnosis. A personality disorder may exist when a personality exhibits enduring patterns of thoughts, emotions,
and behaviors that deviate significantly from cultural norms and cause significant distress and impairment in
functioning. While everyone has unique personality traits, a personality disorder is diagnosed when these traits
cause significant distress, disrupt daily life, and lead to difficulties in relationships, work, or other areas of
functioning. A personality disorder is diagnosed through a thorough assessment by a trained professional, such as a
psychiatrist. It requires a history, behavioral observations, and meeting certain criteria specific to each disorder.

18.2 Cluster Disorders (A, B, C)

Cluster A personality disorders include paranoid personality disorder, schizoid personality disorder, and schizotypal
personality disorder. Cluster A is characterized by eccentric, odd, or peculiar behavior, thinking, and beliefs.
Individuals with these disorders often struggle socially. They can often appear distrustful and detached to others.

Cluster B personality disorders include antisocial, borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic personality disorders.
Cluster B personality disorders are characterized by dramatic, overly emotional, or unpredictable thinking or
behavior. They may also have a history of unstable relationships.

Cluster C personality disorders share a common theme of anxious and fearful behaviors. They are characterized by a
chronic pattern of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that are driven by a sense of fear, insecurity, and a desire for
safety. The three personality disorders within cluster C are avoidant personality disorder, dependent personality
disorder, and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD).

18.3 Nursing Care and Treatment Approaches

Treating personality disorders can be a difficult process. Psychotherapy is the top recommended modality for all
personality disorders. Cognitive behavioral therapy can be very helpful, as can dialectical behavioral therapy, which
was developed specifically for borderline personality disorder. There are no medications specifically approved to
treat personality disorders, but they may be prescribed for other related symptoms, such as anxiety or depression.

Clients living with personality disorders often struggle with interpersonal relationships and work challenges.
Increasing self-awareness, learning to set personal boundaries, and regulating emotional responses can help with
these challenges. Educating family members on the nature of these disorders can also help encourage empathy.

Nursing care for clients with personality disorders begins with safety, empathy, and understanding. Nurses must
approach the client with a consideration for the whole person, and not just as a diagnosis. Setting goals and limits
for the client early when creating the treatment plan will help the nurse-client relationship. There are various skills
to help people with personality disorders learn how to cope. Nurses must also remember that self-care is an
important part of caring for these clients in order to minimize stress and ensure that they maintain their ability to
provide the best care possible to clients.

CHAPTER OUTLINE
19.1 Substance Use Disorders
19.2 Alcohol Use Disorder
19.3 Stimulant Use Disorders
19.4 Opioid Use Disorder
19.5 Dealing with Addiction
INTRODUCTION Substance use and misuse disorders affect more than 40.3 million Americans (Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], 2020) although only one in ten people receive treatment for
these disorders (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Surgeon General, 2016). Regardless
of their specialty area, it is imperative that nurses recognize the signs and symptoms of substance use disorders,
have a basic understanding of resources available, and are able to assess for the life-threatening effects of
substance use in the clients under their care. Substance use disorders are often found comorbidly with mental
health or trauma disorders and medical conditions, such as diabetes, hepatitis C, and HIV (U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services, Office of the Surgeon General, 2016).

     19.1 Substance Use Disorders

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define substance use disorder
         · Demonstrate an understanding of substance use disorder
         · Outline the symptoms of substance use disorder
         · Describe the role of the nurse in planning care and approaches to recovery for a client with substance use

             disorder

     Chronic substance use disorders significantly impact individuals, families, communities, and society. Misuse of
     alcohol, drugs, and prescribed medications is estimated to cost the United States more than $400 billion annually in
     health-care expenses, law enforcement, criminal justice costs, lost workplace productivity, and losses from motor
     vehicle crashes (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA] & Office of the Surgeon
     General, 2016). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics
     estimates that 107,622 drug overdose deaths and 52,000 alcohol-induced deaths occurred in the United States in
     2021 (National Center for Health Statistics, 2022).

     UNFOLDING CASE STUDY

     Substance Misuse: Part 1

     The nurse is assessing a thirty-year-old female who has been admitted to the hospital psychiatric unit.

     PMH      Client is a thirty-year-old female who works as a project manager at a construction firm. She
              has a medical-surgical history of lumbar disc herniation repair, GERD, and ovarian cysts. She is
              current on all vaccinations and reports a history of tobacco use but quit last year.
              Family History: Client reports a family history of depression. Maternal grandmother was a
              smoker and died of lung cancer four years ago. Mother has a history of depression. Father does
              not have a mental health diagnosis.
              Social History: Client is married and has one child, age three. She has worked as a project
              manager for the past six years and finds her job to be interesting but stressful at times. She
              struggles to balance motherhood, family, and her work, and this has resulted in her having a
              glass of wine to relax after work. Recently, she has started to refill her glass throughout the
              evening and states that her husband is starting to comment on the amount of wine she is
              drinking. She has difficulty sleeping and she has been prescribed medication to help her to
              sleep, which she also takes throughout the day to help with the anxiety since it is for
              "relaxation."
              Current Medication: Alprazolam 1mg HS and No Known Allergies.

Chart       Client presents with irritability and anxiety, mild tremors, and headache. She reports that her
            last drink was the previous evening at 1900, which promoted an argument with her husband
            leading to her admitting herself to the hospital. She is concerned about her employer finding
            out she is on a psychiatric unit and is worried about losing her job and her child. She reports
            anxiety 10/10 and is visibly fidgeting and tense. Her husband reports that the client has
            increased her drinking over the past several months, and currently consumes at least one
            bottle to a bottle and a half of wine every night. He also reports that she has been taking her
            prescribed benzodiazepine and alprazolam throughout the day rather than just before bedtime
            as it was intended. He states that she has been increasingly more detached from their child and
            unable to participate in family activities at home, including dinner and bedtime routines that
            used to be important to her. The client reports symptoms of insomnia, and anxiety, usually

Defining Substance Use Disorder

A substance is defined as a psychoactive compound with the potential for dependence and detrimental effects,
including substance use disorder. According to Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
(SAMHSA, 2022d), substance use disorders (SUD) happen when the repeated use of alcohol and/or other drugs
significantly impairs a person's health and results in an inability for them to meet major responsibilities at work,
school, or home. People who have an SUD may be dually diagnosed with a mental health disorder (National Institute
of Mental Health, 2023). Conversely, some people with a mental health disorder may use substances as a coping
mechanism and then develop an SUD.

Three regions of the brain play a critical role in the development and persistence of substance use disorders: the
basal ganglia, the extended amygdala, and the prefrontal cortex (SAMHSA & Office of the Surgeon General, 2016).

    · The basal ganglia control the rewarding, pleasurable effects of substance use and are responsible for the
        formation of habitual substance taking. Two subregions of the basal ganglia are particularly important in
        substance use disorders: the nucleus accumbens, involved in motivation and reward; and the dorsal striatum,
620  19 · Substance Use and Misuse

             involved in forming habits and other routine behaviors.
         · The extended amygdala is involved in the stress response and the feelings of unease, anxiety, and irritability

             that typically accompany substance withdrawal.
         · The prefrontal cortex is involved in executive function (e.g., the ability to organize thoughts and activities,

             prioritize tasks, manage time, and make decisions), including exerting control over substance use.

     Changes in the brain from substance misuse persist long after substance use stops and are associated with a high
     incidence of relapse with substance use disorders. More specifically, when a person uses substances, the basal
     ganglia begin to react to those substances by producing pleasant surges of dopamine, a neurotransmitter, sending
     messages to the nerve cells in this reward center of the brain (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
     Office of the Surgeon General, 2016). If the person continues to use substances, the neurotransmitters adapt, and
     the person demonstrates a reduced response to the substance and requires more of the substance to feel an effect;
     this is called tolerance (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Surgeon General, 2016). The
     extended amygdala and the prefrontal cortex play against each other as the person continues to increase the
     amount of substance used. Just as the basal ganglia react in response to the good feeling that results from the burst
     of dopamine, pushing the person to use again, the extended amygdala responds to negative stimuli like stress by
     trying to get away from unpleasant feelings. When a person has a substance use disorder, these two areas no longer
     balance each other. The reward control center begins to take over and the person begins to feel physical or
     emotional upset when they are not using a substance; this is called withdrawal. The only way the person can begin
     to feel better is to use the substance once again. At this point, the person gets stuck in a cycle of a substance use
     disorder where they neglect other parts of their lives, family, work, and pleasurable activities (Figure 19.2).

     DSM-5 Diagnosis: Substance Use Disorder
     Substance use disorders are diagnosed based on cognitive, behavioral, and psychological symptoms. To be
     diagnosed, a person meets with a health-care provider for a comprehensive evaluation to review substances used,
     patterns of use, effects on living, and range of symptom severity. After gathering and reviewing this information, the
     health-care provider will compare it with the DSM-5 criteria, which includes degrees of substance use disorder but
     not addictive disorder. The most severe form of substance use disorder is categorized as addiction, and severe
     substance use disorder can be considered a neurological disorder and a mental illness (Partnership to End
     Addiction, 2023). Generally, according to the DSM-5, substance use disorder (SUD) is an illness caused by repeated
     misuse of substances such as alcohol, caffeine, cannabis, hallucinogens, inhalants, opioids, sedatives, hypnotics,
     anxiolytics, stimulants (amphetamines, cocaine, and others), and tobacco. These substances taken in excess have a
     common effect of directly activating the brain reward system and producing such an intense activation of the reward
     system that individuals may neglect normal life activities.

Addictive Disorders
Addictive disorders that are not substance-related include excessive behaviors that the person cannot control or
stop, even if these behaviors pose risks or harm. The neurological aspects of addiction involving motivation and
reward drive these behaviors, and stimulate the same addiction centers of the brain as addictive substances. The
person's judgment may be impaired regarding consequences of the behaviors.

Behavioral addictions can include gambling, viewing pornography, compulsive sexual activity, internet gaming,
overeating, shopping, overexercising, and overusing mobile phone technologies. Gambling disorder is the only
nonsubstance use disorder with diagnostic criteria listed in the DSM-5. Additional research is being performed to
determine the criteria for diagnosing other nonsubstance-related disorders (National Institute on Drug Abuse
[NIDA] & National Institutes of Health, 2019).

Understanding Substance Use Disorder

Chronic substance use disorders significantly affect individuals, families, communities, and society. According to the
2021 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 46.3 million people in the United States aged twelve or
older (16.5 percent) have a substance use disorder (SAMHSA, 2022c).

Prolonged, repeated misuse of substances can produce changes to the brain that can lead to a substance use
disorder. Substance misuse (the term now used by professionals rather than substance abuse) is defined as the use
of alcohol or drugs in a manner, situation, amount, or frequency that could cause harm to the user or to those
around them (SAMHSA & Office of the Surgeon General, 2016). Misuse can be of low severity and temporary, but it
can increase the risk for serious and costly consequences, such as motor vehicle crashes; overdose death; suicide;
various types of cancer; heart, liver, and pancreatic diseases; HIV; and unintended pregnancies. Substance use
during pregnancy can cause complications for the baby, such as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) or
neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Substance misuse is also associated with intimate partner violence, child
abuse, and neglect (SAMHSA & Office of the Surgeon General, 2016).

Legal and Illegal Substances That Can Be Misused
There are many types of substances that can be misused and not all of them are illegal or classified as medications.
Legally obtained substances include alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine. In the United States, tobacco use disorder is the
second most common substance use disorder, following alcohol (Cleveland Clinic, 2023). Even though electronic
cigarettes or "e-cigarettes" are advertised as being safer than cigarettes, they also contain nicotine, the addictive
ingredient in cigarettes.

Legal substances that are medication and can be misused include inhalants, sedatives, opioids, and stimulants. In
2020, 2.4 million (0.9 percent) of people aged twelve or older in America misused inhalants. Inhalants are various
products easily bought or found in the home, such as spray paints, markers, glue, gasoline, and cleaning fluids.
Unlike other drugs, the percentage of inhalant use was highest among adolescents aged twelve to seventeen (NIDA
& National Institutes of Health, 2020). People who use inhalants breathe in the fumes through their nose or mouth,
usually by sniffing, snorting, bagging, or huffing. Although the high that inhalants produce usually lasts just a few
minutes, people often try to make it last by continuing to inhale again and again over several hours (NIDA & National
Institutes of Health, 2020). Prescription medications can also be misused as inhalants. For example, amyl nitrate is
a prescription medication administered via inhalation to relieve chest pain. It can be misused by individuals to cause
a high. It is referred to as the street drug, "poppers." Inhalant intoxication causes problematic behavioral or
psychological changes, such as belligerence, being assaultive, apathy, and impaired judgment.

Other commonly misused prescription medications include those in the sedative, opioid, and stimulant classes.
Sedatives include both anxiolytic hypnotics for sleep (like Ambien) and anxiolytic benzodiazepines (like Xanax,
Valium, Ativan, and Klonopin). Prescriptions misused in the opioid class (used for pain) include codeine and
622  19 · Substance Use and Misuse

     oxycodone (OxyContin). Frequently misused stimulants include ADHD drugs like amphetamine/dextroamphetamine
     (Adderal) and methylphenidate (Ritalin).

     Chronic use of benzodiazepines causes changes in the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor, resulting in
     decreased GABA activity and the development of tolerance. A person can go through withdrawal after stopping or
     lowering the dose of benzodiazepines. Sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytic intoxication cause behavioral or
     psychological changes similar to alcohol intoxication, such as inappropriate sexual or aggressive behavior, mood
     lability, and impaired judgment. Symptoms of intoxication include slurred speech, lack of coordination, unsteady
     gait, nystagmus, impaired attention and memory, and stupor or coma (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).

     Opioid misuse has been and continues to be a major cause of death in the United States with the number of
     overdose deaths in 2021 being six times the number in 1999 (CDC, 2023). While most people follow their health-
     care provider's directions on how and when to take their medications, others use prescribed medications in
     nonprescription ways: sharing medications with friends or family members, taking medications more frequently or
     in higher doses than what has been prescribed, combining medications with alcohol or other drugs, and taking
     medications in a form other than what is prescribed (snorting or injecting) (Alcohol and Drug Foundation, 2021). In
     an effort to reduce the number of opioid prescription medications being used, most states have monitoring systems
     in place to track how many opioid prescriptions individuals are receiving. With the help of the Drug Enforcement
     Agency (DEA), prescribers can review the registry to see if there is a pattern for abuse (Jahan & Burgess, 2023).

     A person may use stimulants for the psychological and physical effects of euphoria, excitement, appetite
     suppression, and wakefulness. Misuse of stimulants can result in paranoia, hallucinations, and agitation, along with
     elevated body temperature, cardiac dysrhythmias, altered blood pressure, and seizures (Mayo Clinic, 2022).

     Also legal, cold medications containing the cough suppressant dextromethorphan, decongestants, and
     antihistamines are also misused due to the potential for narcotic effects. Heart rate, body temperature, and blood
     pressure may be altered to the point of life-threatening (Connecticut Poison Control Center, 2024).

     Illegal substances used include hallucinogens (PCP and LSD), stimulants (amphetamines, methamphetamine,
     cocaine), nonprescription opioids (heroin), and cannabis, where not legalized. See the table for a more descriptive
     list of both legal and illegal substances Table 19.1.

potential for abuse and potentially cause severe psychological and/or physical dependence, whereas Schedule V
drugs represent the least potential for abuse (U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, 2020; Table 19.2).

Cannabis has been classified as a Schedule 1 drug since the 1970 Controlled Substances Act. However, more than
half of the states in the nation have decriminalized the substance, with some permitting medical usage and others
both medical and recreational usage. As of May 2024, the Drug Enforcement Agency has recommended that
cannabis be reclassified as a Schedule III drug, which would support wider medical usage and scientific research
but not permit recreational usage on a national level. Formal reclassification will require additional steps.

Symptoms of Substance Use Disorder

Substance use disorder can be mild, moderate, or severe, with severe being considered addiction (Cleveland Clinic,
2023). Examples of symptoms seen in someone who is developing a substance use disorder include the following:
using a prescribed substance for longer than intended and in amounts beyond its prescribed directions; being
unable to stop using a substance; problems with relationships, work, and school; and development of a tolerance so
that more of the substance needs to be used to get the same effects. There are over twenty million people in the
United States who have an SUD that involves one substance, and 12 percent of those people have an SUD that
includes using a drug and alcohol (Cleveland Clinic, 2023).

Intoxication
The term intoxication refers to a disturbance in behavior or mental function during or after the consumption of a
substance. Generally, it is understood that saying someone is intoxicated is the same as saying they are drunk or
high. A person using alcohol may experience a feeling of euphoria or excitement, which can become confusion,
stupor, coma, or death (LaHood & Kok, 2023). As the level of intoxication increases so does the severity of the
symptoms. Signs of intoxication may differ slightly depending on the substance being used. A person using heroin
will also have a sense of euphoria along with drowsiness and nodding. A person using cocaine will experience more
energy, but also experience paranoia, fatigue, and decreased appetite. A person using cannabis will experience a
624  19 · Substance Use and Misuse

     state of relaxation, increased appetite, and sensory enhancement, which can progress to impaired perception
     (National Academies Press, 2017).

     Tolerance versus Habituation
     A person develops a tolerance the more they use a substance because the neurotransmitters adapt to the
     substance and no longer produce the same pleasurable feelings that occurred when the person first began to use
     the substance. When this occurs, the person may need to increase the amount used to reach the same "high."

     Very simply, habituation is the process of getting used to doing something--such as using a substance--and then
     not wanting to stop. Habituation is a cycle that is difficult to break. Physical dependence often follows habituation.

     Dependence
     A person has a dependence on a substance when the lack of the substance causes physical symptoms. When a
     person suddenly stops using a substance, if they have developed a dependence, their body goes through
     withdrawal, a group of physical and mental symptoms that can range from mild to life-threatening. Dependence can
     be further broken down into psychological dependence and physical dependence although, according to American
     Addiction Centers (2021), psychological and physical dependence are intertwined.

     Psychological Dependence
     Psychological dependence stands for the emotional developments and changes that accompany substance misuse
     (American Addiction Centers, 2021). When most people think of psychological dependence, they think of cravings,
     the anxiety and/or depression that can occur when a person does not use the substance, denial that there is even a
     substance use problem, obsessing over the substance, and cognitive decline (American Addiction Centers, 2021).
     Substances that are associated with stronger psychological dependence are stimulants, cannabis, inhalants,
     psychotropic medications, and hallucinogens.

     Physical Dependence
     Physical dependence is related to the symptoms that a person experiences with tolerance and withdrawal
     (American Addiction Centers, 2021). Examples of these symptoms include nausea, vomiting, stomach upset,
     hallucinations, tremors, and headaches. Examples of certain substances that have stronger physical dependence
     are alcohol, opioids, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates. A person who is experiencing physical dependence will also
     have psychological symptoms as they go through withdrawal from the substance. Thinking holistically, the mind and
     body are inextricably connected, so it makes sense that these two types of dependence often accompany one
     another.

     Addiction
     Compulsive or uncontrolled use of one or more substances, addiction is a chronic condition that has the potential
     for both relapse and recovery. The addiction process involves a three-stage cycle of symptoms that become more
     severe as a person continues to misuse substances, causing neuroadaptations in brain function that reduce a
     person's ability to control their substance use. Each stage is associated with one of the brain regions previously
     described (i.e., basal ganglia, extended amygdala, and prefrontal cortex). This three-stage model provides a useful
     way to understand the symptoms of addiction, the ways it can be prevented and treated, and the steps for recovery.

       1. Binge/intoxication: The stage at which an individual consumes an intoxicating substance and experiences its
             rewarding or pleasurable effects.

       2. Withdrawal/negative affect: The stage at which an individual experiences a negative state in the absence of
             the substance.

       3. Preoccupation/anticipation: The stage at which one seeks substances again after a period of abstinence
             (SAMHSA & Offices of the Surgeon General, 2016).

             LIFE-STAGE CONTEXT

     The Cycle of Addiction

     Research has shown that a person who first tries drugs in their teens is more apt to develop an SUD than a person
     who first tries drugs as an adult (NIDA, 2022). Conduct problems and delinquent behaviors, such as vandalism and

violence, are usually precursors to the initiation of substance use in teenagers. Substance use is also higher in teens
who have drug-using friends. Important to consider are the psychosocial factors of education, employment,
relationships, and involvement with the legal system. A study by Arria et al. (2020), which evaluated continuous
abstinence over a two-year period, found that teens with long-term SUD treatment program completion had greater
improvements in relationships with significant others and in relapse avoidance. The authors acknowledged the value
of supportive resources after treatment to improve education and employment outcomes.

Overdose
The biological response of the human body when it has ingested lethal or toxic amount of a substance is overdose.
Signs of intoxication and overdose differ for categories of psychoactive substances.

Poison control centers are available 24/7, every day of the year to consult about toxic ingestion of substances and
overdoses; just call 1-800-222-1222. Some hospitals also have toxicologists available for bedside consultation for
overdoses (Rosenbaum & Boyer, 2021).

Approaches to Recovery from Substance Use Disorder

The first step is admitting there is a problem. In addition to medications and behavioral therapies, effective
treatment of SUD includes recovery support services (RSS). Recovery support services provided by substance use
disorder treatment programs and community organizations provide support to individuals receiving treatment for
SUD, as well as ongoing support after treatment. These supportive services are typically delivered by trained case
managers, recovery coaches, and/or peers. Specific RSS include assistance in navigating systems of care, removing
barriers to recovery, staying engaged in the recovery process, and providing a social context for individuals to
engage in community living without substance use. RSS can be effective in promoting healthy lifestyle techniques to
increase resilience skills, reduce the risk of relapse, and help achieve and maintain recovery. Individuals who
participate in RSS typically have better long-term recovery outcomes (SAMHSA & Office of the Surgeon General,
2016).

Recovery goes beyond abstinence and the remission of substance use disorder to include a positive change in the
whole person. There are many paths to recovery. People choose their individual pathway based on their cultural
values, socioeconomic status, psychological and behavioral needs, and the nature of their substance use disorder
(SAMHSA & Office of the Surgeon General, 2016). In a study by Kaskutas et al. (2014) of over 9,000 individuals with
previous substance use disorders, three themes emerged when asked how they defined recovery:

    · Abstinence: 86 percent viewed abstinence as part of their recovery, but the remainder did not think
        abstinence was required. Abstinence was considered "essential," however, by those affiliated with twelve-
        step mutual aid groups.

    · Personal growth: "Being honest with myself" was endorsed as part of recovery by 98 percent of participants.
        Other almost universally endorsed elements included "handling negative feelings without using alcohol or
        drugs" and "being able to enjoy life without alcohol or drugs." Almost all study participants viewed their
        recovery as a process of growth and development, and about two-thirds saw it as having a spiritual dimension.

    · Service to others: Engaging in service to others was another prominent component of how study participants
        defined recovery. This is perhaps because during periods of heavy substance misuse, individuals may damage
        interpersonal relationships, which they later regret doing and attempt to resolve during recovery. Evidence
        exists that providing service to others helps individuals maintain their own recovery (SAMHSA & Office of the
        Surgeon General, 2016).

Overlap Between SUD and Mental Health Disorders Causes Treatment Challenges
In 2020, seventeen million adults (6.7 percent) had both a substance use disorder (SUD) and a mental health illness
626  19 · Substance Use and Misuse

     (SAMHSA, 2021b). The relationship between SUDs and mental disorders is known to be bidirectional, meaning the
     presence of a mental health disorder may contribute to the development or exacerbation of an SUD, or an SUD may
     contribute to the development or exacerbation of a mental health disorder. The combined presence of SUDs and
     mental health disorders results in greater functional impairment; worse treatment outcomes; higher morbidity and
     mortality; increased treatment costs; and higher risk for homelessness, incarceration, and suicide.

     The reasons why substance use disorders and mental health disorders often occur together are not definitive, but
     there are three possible explanations. One reason may be that certain substances may temporarily mask the
     symptoms of mental health disorders (such as anxiety or depression). A second reason may be that certain
     substances trigger a mental health disorder that otherwise would not have developed. For example, research
     suggests that alcohol use increases risk for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by altering the brain's ability to
     recover from traumatic experiences. A third possible reason is that both substance use disorders and mental health
     disorders are caused by overlapping factors, such as particular genes, neurobiology, or exposure to traumatic or
     stressful life experiences (SAMHSA & Office of the Surgeon General, 2016).

     Mental health disorders and substance use disorders have overlapping symptoms, making diagnosis and treatment
     planning challenging. For example, people who use methamphetamine for a long period of time may experience
     paranoia, hallucinations, and delusions that can be mistaken for symptoms of schizophrenia (SAMHSA & Office of
     the Surgeon General, 2016).

     Planning Nursing Care for a Client with Substance Use Disorder
     Initial treatment begins with the health-care provider ordering laboratory testing, such as urine and blood tests. A
     urine drug screen and blood alcohol level can determine what substance the person has been using. Complete
     blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), liver function test (LTF), hepatitis panel, and pancreatic enzymes
     can determine the health of the client (Jahan & Burgess, 2023). Female clients may receive a urine pregnancy test
     (HCG). The CBC will show anemia or infection that may be occurring due to substance use. The BMP will identify any
     comorbidities and electrolyte imbalances. A liver function test (LFT), hepatitis panel, and, possibly a screen for
     human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), will check for any problems with the liver due to alcohol/substance
     consumption or HIV infection due to IV drug use. Lastly, a pancreatic enzyme serum level will show if there is any
     damage to the pancreas. The results of these tests form the basis for the medical part of the treatment plan (Jahan
     & Burgess, 2023).

     The health-care provider may also look at data from the prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) to see if the
     person is obtaining medications from multiple sources (NIDA, 2020a). A PDMP is an electronic database capable of
     tracking prescriptions for controlled substance. This monitoring can alert providers to clients at risk for overdose or
     other concerns about inappropriate medication use (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2022).

     The nurse must assess for past or current history of mental health disorders, because SUD and mental health
     disorders can overlap and affect treatment. The nurse should ask the client what substance they have been using,
     how much/how often, last use, and the form (pills, snorting, injection). The nurse should check with the client about
     any current legal problems, their support systems and living situation, and any cultural or religious needs for care.
     The nurse may administer Clinical Institute Narcotic Assessment (CINA), Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment
     for Alcohol (CIWA), or Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) scales to determine if the client is experiencing any
     withdrawal symptoms. All the information from the initial assessment is combined to form the foundation of the
     nursing plan of care.

     Nurses' Attitudes toward Addiction
     According to Tierney (2017), nurses can hold stigmatizing views toward people with substance use disorders and
     the behaviors caused by substance use. The author continues by saying that nurses sometimes experience feelings
     of anger, anxiety, powerlessness, and frustration when caring for these clients. Nurses report that many of these
     feelings come from not having enough training or education about substance use disorders.

     Nurse as Client with Substance Use Disorder
     Health-care professionals are not immune to developing SUD. SUD is a chronic illness that can affect anyone
     regardless of age, occupation, economic circumstances, ethnic background, or gender. The National Council of State
     Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) created a brochure called A Nurse's Guide to Substance Use Disorder in Nursing. This
     brochure states that many nurses with SUD are unidentified, untreated, and may continue to practice when their

impairment may endanger the lives of their clients. Because of the potential safety hazards to clients, it is a nurse's
legal and ethical responsibility to report a colleague's suspected SUD to their manager or supervisor. It can be hard
to differentiate between the subtle signs of SUD and stress-related behaviors, but three significant signs include
behavioral changes, physical indicators, and drug diversion (NCSBN, 2018). Nurses are in an excellent position to
notice drug diversion, which occurs when medication is redirected from its intended destination for personal use,
sale, or distribution to others. It includes drug theft, use, or tampering (adulteration or substitution). Drug diversion
is a felony that can result in criminal charges.

Behavioral changes include less satisfactory job performance, absences from the unit for extended periods,
frequent trips to the bathroom, arriving late or leaving early, and making an excessive number of mistakes, including
medication errors (NCSBN, 2018). Other evidence includes increasing isolation from colleagues; inappropriate
verbal or emotional responses; and diminished alertness, confusion, or memory lapses. Physical signs include
subtle changes in appearance that may escalate over time. Signs of diversion look like frequent discrepancies in
opioid counts, unusual amounts of opioid wastage, numerous corrections to medication records, frequent reports of
ineffective pain relief from clients, offers to medicate coworkers' clients for pain, and altered verbal or phone
medication orders (NCSBN, 2018).

        LINK TO LEARNING

Watch this short video that discusses the problems and solutions for substance use disorder in nurses
(https://openstax.org/r/77SUDinNurses) from the NCSBN.

All fifty states have boards of nursing (BON) that promulgate, regulate, and enforce their own rules and guidelines.
These BON provide disciplinary action to nurses who practice while impaired (Boehning & Haddad, 2022). The
National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) website provides alternatives to discipline programs in their
"Find a Program" (https://openstax.org/r/77FindAProgram) page in which programs are listed by state (NCSBN,
n.d.). An individual can click on the link, choose their state, and receive a list of available programs in that state.

The earlier a nurse is diagnosed with SUD and receives treatment, the sooner client safety improves, and the better
the chances for the nurse to recover and return to work. In most states, a nurse diagnosed with an SUD enters a
nondisciplinary program designed by the board of nursing for treatment and recovery services. When a colleague
treated for an SUD returns to work, nurses should create a supportive environment that encourages their continued
recovery (NCSBN, 2018).

An example of one such BON program is the Texas Peer Assistance Program for Nurses (TPAPN). This program is
funded by the fees paid for nursing licenses (TPAPN, n.d.). According to the Texas Nurse Practice Act, employers are
required to report nurses who are suspected of being impaired at work. A recovery plan is set up for nurses who
participate in TPAPN. Peer supports meet with participants to provide guidance, support, and mentorship so that
they can eventually return to work.

     19.2 Alcohol Use Disorder

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define and recognize how to diagnose alcohol use disorder
         · Outline approaches to treating alcohol use disorder
         · Plan nursing care for a client with alcohol use disorder
         · Comprehend the risks a client in alcohol withdrawal might have to overcome

     Alcohol is a legal drug that many people misuse. As of 2022, the lifetime statistics for alcohol use are that 221.3
     million people aged twelve or older have used alcohol in their lifetime (SAMHSA, 2023a). Nurses provide care to
     individuals with alcohol use disorders, including performing assessments and offering treatment. Both alcohol and
     substance use have increased since the COVID-19 pandemic. Per the CDC, the number of Americans who reported
     either starting or increasing use of a substance to help them cope with the pandemic was at 13 percent (Chacon et
     al., 2021). Note that in the clinical setting, nurses may see the abbreviation ETOH. This stands for the chemical
     name for ethyl alcohol and is commonly used in documentation for alcohol and alcohol use.

     Diagnosis and Definition of Alcohol Use Disorder

     The DSM-5 recognizes alcohol use disorder (AUD) as a chronic medical condition that is categorized by difficulty
     stopping or controlling alcohol use, and by using alcohol to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms, even when it is
     causing negative social, occupational, or health-related consequences (SAMHSA, 2022c). Most people who have an
     alcohol use disorder will seek care from their primary care provider regarding an alcohol-related medical problem
     instead of for their drinking (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism [NIAAA], 2023a).

     An alcohol use disorder is considered a brain disorder that can be mild, moderate, or severe (National Institute on
     Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 2023c). The misuse of alcohol causes many health concerns, including high blood
     pressure, gastroenteritis and pancreatitis, cirrhosis, cancer, and mental health problems. Violence and crime, fatal
     and nonfatal vehicle accidents, and death--more than 140,000 per year in the United States--are also connected to
     alcohol misuse (SAMHSA, 2022a).

     Symptoms of Alcohol Use Disorder
     The 2021 National Survey on Drug Use and Health reports that 47.5 percent (133.1 million) of Americans aged
     twelve or older use alcohol, 21.5 percent are binge drinkers, and 5.8 percent are heavy alcohol users (SAMHSA,
     2022c). Consumption of eight or more drinks per week for women and fifteen or more drinks per week for men or
     binge drinking on five or more of the previous thirty days is considered heavy drinking. Consuming several standard
     drinks on one occasion in the past thirty days is considered binge drinking; for men, this refers to drinking five or
     more standard alcoholic drinks on one occasion, and for women, this refers to drinking four or more standard drinks
     on one occasion (SAMHSA, 2022c). Based on the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, a standard drink is
     defined as 14 grams (0.6 ounces) of pure alcohol. Examples of a standard drink are one 12-ounce beer, 8 to 9
     ounces of malt liquor, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits (Figure 19.3).

The term alcohol intoxication refers to problematic behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., inappropriate sexual
or aggressive behavior, mood lability, or impaired judgment) that develop during or shortly after alcohol ingestion.
Signs and symptoms of alcohol intoxication are as follows: slurred speech, lack of coordination, unsteady gait,
nystagmus, and impairment in attention or memory (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). The CDC's
recommendations on alcohol intake are limited to one to two drinks per day (Figure 19.4).

     Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Public Domain)

     Symptoms of Alcohol Overdose
     An alcohol overdose, also called alcohol poisoning, occurs when there is so much alcohol in the bloodstream that
     areas of the brain controlling autonomic nervous system functions (e.g., breathing, heart rate, and temperature
     control) begin to shut down. Signs of alcohol overdose include mental confusion, difficulty remaining conscious,
     vomiting, seizures, trouble breathing, slow heart rate, clammy skin, dulled gag reflex, and extremely low body
     temperature. Alcohol intoxication while also taking opioids or sedative-hypnotics (such as benzodiazepines or sleep
     medications) increases the risk of an overdose. Alcohol overdose can cause permanent brain damage or death
     (NIAAA & National Institutes of Health, 2021). Anyone who consumes too much alcohol too quickly is in danger of
     an alcohol overdose. As blood alcohol concentration (BAC) increases, so does the risk of harm. When BAC reaches
     high levels, blackouts (gaps in memory), loss of consciousness (passing out), and death can occur. BAC can continue
     to rise even when a person stops drinking or is unconscious because alcohol in the stomach and intestine continues
     to enter the bloodstream and circulate throughout the body.

     Risk Factors in Developing Alcohol Use Disorder
     Whether an individual ever uses alcohol or another substance and whether that initial use progresses to a substance
     use disorder of any severity depends on several factors, including the following:

         · genetic and biological factors
         · the age of substance use onset
         · psychological factors related to a person's unique history and personality
         · environmental factors, such as the availability of alcohol, family and peer dynamics, financial resources,

             cultural norms, exposure to stress, and access to social support (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
             Administration (SAMHSA) & Office of the Surgeon General, 2016).

     A person who binge drinks or has heavy alcohol use has an increased risk of developing alcohol use disorder (AUD)
     (NIAAA, 2023c). Genetics influence development of AUD by approximately 50 percent, though environmental
     factors are also significant (Deak & Johnson, 2021). Parents' drinking patterns can influence a child later in

developing an alcohol use disorder. Drinking at an early age can increase the risk of developing an AUD. This risk is
increased in females as compared to males. A person with mental illness or trauma history is also at higher risk for
an AUD, as these factors are common comorbidities of AUDs. Continuing research in genetics and ancestry will
further inform the science as to causation of all substance use disorders (Deak & Johnson, 2021).

        CULTURAL CONTEXT

Alcohol Use among the Asian Community

Genetics are a component of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Genetics influence a person's risk of developing AUD.
Some individuals of Asian descent are affected by a gene variant that changes their ability to metabolize alcohol.
When they drink, they have flushing, nausea, and a rapid heartbeat. These side effects cause many to abstain from
drinking alcohol.

(American Addiction Centers, 2023b)

Approaches to Treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder

There are many approaches that can be used to treat alcohol use disorder. Keeping in mind that cravings will remain
after an individual stops drinking, some of the things that the treatment team might offer are medications,
behavioral therapies, and support groups. The care plan is individualized to meet the needs of the client.

Medications
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved three medications for treating alcohol dependence:
naltrexone, acamprosate, and disulfiram. A health-care provider must first assess the client's "motivation for
treatment, potential for relapse, and severity of co-existing conditions" (U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, Office of the Surgeon General, 2016, p. 4-24). Research has shown that most clients who are prescribed
medication to treat their alcohol use disorders do see positive benefits.

Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist that blocks opioid receptors. Just as it counteracts the pleasurable parts of using
opioids, it also blocks the pleasurable parts of drinking. Compliance with taking Naltrexone in the oral form is
necessary to avoid relapse. For clients who have difficulty with adherence, there is an extended-release injectable,
given once a month (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Surgeon General, 2016).

Acamprosate reduces the cravings to drink. Research has shown that this medication works well when used with
behavioral interventions. Acamprosate has been found to be effective for reducing instances of relapse and
maintaining abstinence.

The third medication is Disulfiram. It works by stopping the metabolism of alcohol. When a client uses alcohol and
takes Disulfiram, they feel nauseous, have flushed skin, and experience heart palpitations, sweat, dizziness, and
headaches. Teach clients taking this medication to check labels of products or foods--such as fragrance,
astringents, dyes, paints, cough syrup, vinegar, sauces, or flavorings--that may contain alcohol and could cause a
reaction. This medication should only be used if the person wants to stop drinking, not just reduce their drinking
(U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Surgeon General, 2016).

Behavioral Treatments
Behavioral treatments help the client identify the triggers for their drinking. These treatments take place in a variety
of settings--individual, group, and family. Trained providers teach the client how to change their behaviors through
various methods, such as CBT, motivational enhancement therapy (MET), and family therapy. Each of these
treatments can work individually or in combination with one another to help the client develop the skills they need
to decrease/stop drinking, work on goal-setting, and build a support system.

CBT is a short-term therapy approach that involves twelve to twenty-four weekly sessions. During these sessions,
participants are taught techniques to help recognize the thoughts and emotions that lead to the behaviors they hope
to change and implement better coping skills as a way of reducing/quitting their drinking habits (U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services, Office of the Surgeon General, 2016). DBT is similar to CBT, though the approach is to
accept and manage feelings of distress without engaging in high-risk behaviors (Brice, 2024). MET uses motivational
632  19 · Substance Use and Misuse

     interviewing to assist clients with determining any questions they have about stopping drinking/substance use. This
     therapy has been shown to have good results in combination with CBT in adolescents who use multiple substances
     (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Surgeon General, 2016).

     Family therapy helps the client by engaging the spouse, partner, and other family members to support reduction of
     the substance use and talk about other issues that may be occurring within the family unit. The family works
     together with the guidance of a therapist to learn better communication skills, bolster the individual's recovery, and
     improve family relationships (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Surgeon General, 2016).

     Mutual Support Groups
     Twelve-step groups are one type of mutual aid (support) group. Members reveal their substance use problem and
     value learning from each other's experiences as they focus on personal-change goals. The groups are voluntary
     associations that charge no fees and are member-led.

     Alcoholics Anonymous
     Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is a mutual aid support group that employs a twelve-step approach. It has been in
     existence since 1935 when two men, Bill W. and Dr. Bob S., met after both had been part of a nonalcoholic
     fellowship that shared the importance of living by spiritual values. Together they held the first AA meeting with a
     man they helped at Akron's City Hospital (Alcoholics Anonymous, n.d.). Its philosophy, approach, and format have
     been adopted and adapted by groups focusing on recovery from other substances, such as Narcotic Anonymous,
     Cocaine Anonymous, Marijuana Anonymous, and Crystal Meth Anonymous. AA and derivative programs share two
     major components: social fellowship and a twelve-step program of action formulated based on members'
     experiences of recovery from severe alcohol use disorders. These twelve steps are ordered in a logical progression,
     beginning with accepting that one cannot control one's substance use, followed by abstaining from substances
     permanently, and transforming one's spiritual outlook, character, and relationships with other people (SAMHSA &
     Office of the Surgeon General, 2016).

     Research studying alcohol twelve-step mutual aid groups has shown that participation in the groups promotes an
     individual's recovery by strengthening recovery-supportive social networks; increasing members' abilities to cope
     with risky social contexts and negative emotions; augmenting motivation to recover; reducing depression, craving,
     and impulsivity; and enhancing psychological and spiritual well-being (SAMHSA & Office of the Surgeon General,
     2016).

     Al-Anon and Alateen
     Friends and family members often suffer when a loved one has a substance use disorder. This can include worrying
     about their loved one or experiencing verbal or physical abuse, among other issues. Mutual aid groups provide
     emotional support to concerned significant others to help them systematically and strategically cope with the
     problems related to their loved one (SAHMSA & Office of the Surgeon General, 2016).

     Al-Anon is a mutual aid group for family members dealing with substance misuse by a loved one. Like AA, Al-Anon is
     based on a twelve-step philosophy and provides support whether or not members' loved ones seek help or achieve
     remission or recovery. More than 80 percent of Al-Anon members are women. The principal goal of Al-Anon is to
     foster emotional stability and "loving detachment" from the loved one rather than coaching members to "get their
     loved one into treatment or recovery." Al-Anon includes Alateen, which focuses on the specific needs of adolescents
     affected by a parent's or other family member's substance use. Research studies regarding the effectiveness of Al-
     Anon show that participating family members experience reduced depression, anger, and relationship unhappiness
     at rates comparable to those of individuals receiving psychological therapies (SAMHSA & Office of the Surgeon
     General, 2016).

     Screening/Assessment Tools for Withdrawal from Alcohol Use
     Initial assessment of a client being seen for possible AUD should begin with an examination for withdrawal
     symptoms. There are scales to determine the amount of alcohol consumed by the client. The first is the Alcohol Use
     Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C). This test has three simple questions that are scored using a Likert scale.
     The higher the score, the more likely that the person will have negative health consequences due to their drinking
     habits (NIAAA, 2022). The second assessment tool is called CAGE (https://openstax.org/r/77CAGE), which stands
     for "Cut down, Annoyed, Guilty, Eye-opener." It consists of four questions with yes/no answers. A score of two or

19.2 · Alcohol Use Disorder                                                                                              633

more yes answers is considered significant (Ewing, 1984).

The Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol Scale (CIWA-Ar) is the most widely used scale to
determine the need for medically supervised withdrawal management. It is used in a variety of settings, including
outpatient, emergency, psychiatric, and general medical-surgical units when there is a clinical concern regarding a
client's alcohol withdrawal. The CIWA-Ar scale is typically utilized in association with a protocol containing
medications to guide symptom-triggered treatment. Clients with an alcohol use disorder who have a CIWA-Ar score
of less than 10 do not typically require medical management (Pace, 2022). There are ten questions on the CIWA-Ar
related to nausea/vomiting, tremor, paroxysmal sweats, anxiety, agitation, tactile disturbances, auditory
disturbances, visual disturbances, headache, and level of orientation.

  CLINICAL JUDGMENT MEASUREMENT MODEL

  Recognizing Cues: Using the CIWA-Ar for Alcohol Withdrawal

  The CIWA-Ar assesses the withdrawal symptoms of a client with alcohol use disorder. The nurse has the client
  sit in a chair with their feet flat on the floor, then takes and records vital signs. The nurse proceeds to go down
  the form's checklist choosing answers on a Likert scale based on the scale's directions to either observe
  symptoms or ask the client a question about certain symptoms. The CIWA-Ar is a vital tool for gathering
  assessment data for the care of a person with alcohol use disorder.

  (MDCalc, n.d.)

Treatment for Withdrawal from Alcohol Use
Benzodiazepines treat the psychomotor agitation many clients experience during alcohol withdrawal and prevent
progression from minor symptoms to severe symptoms of seizures, hallucinations, or delirium tremens. Diazepam
(Valium), lorazepam (Ativan), and chlordiazepoxide (Librium) are the drugs used most frequently to treat or prevent
alcohol withdrawal symptoms (Hoffman, 2022). Anticonvulsants may be used concurrently or instead of
benzodiazepines. Anticonvulsants decrease the probability of withdrawal seizures.

Delirium tremens (DT), a rapid-onset, fluctuating disturbance of attention and cognition, can include hallucinations
and autonomic hyperactivity, with fever, tachycardia, hypertension, and diaphoresis. DTs typically begin between
forty-eight and ninety-six hours after the client's last drink, reinforcing the necessity for accurate assessment data.

Chronic alcohol use depletes thiamine and magnesium. Clients receiving alcohol withdrawal treatment typically
receive intravenous thiamine, along with dextrose, to prevent Wernicke's encephalopathy. Wernicke's
encephalopathy is an acute, life-threatening neurological condition characterized by nystagmus, ataxia, and
confusion caused by thiamine (B1) deficiency associated with alcohol use disorder. If untreated, Wernicke's
encephalopathy can progress to Korsakoff's syndrome, a chronic, irreversible memory disorder resulting from
thiamine deficiency (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2023). Other electrolyte deficiencies
may require treatment during alcohol withdrawal.

     Planning Nursing Care for a Client with Alcohol Use Disorder

     Considering that only one in six people ever talks to their health-care professional about their drinking, nurses need
     to know how to start the conversation; after all, this important step can reduce drinking by 25 percent (CDC, 2020).
     Nurses and other health-care professionals must collaborate to help these clients.

     Every facility should have a policy to ask all clients, including pregnant clients, about their drinking. Talking with the
     client about their drinking by asking for their thoughts on the good and bad of drinking is the first step toward
     beginning screening and counseling. Determine if the client is interested in making changes to their
     drinking--cutting back or quitting--or planning to continue their current drinking. Then begin to work with the client
     on a treatment plan (CDC, 2020). This type of screening and counseling can happen anywhere that health-care

professionals are seeing clients. Screening will identify potential concerns while providing the opportunity to begin
talking about the treatment resources available. It is important for health-care professionals to know that the
federal Affordable Care Act (2010) mandates that insurance policies cover this service and to share this information
with clients. The treatment plan must be individualized and person-centered, keeping in mind age, race, religion/
spirituality, culture, sexual orientation, trauma history, any co-occurring physical or mental health problems,
language, and health literacy (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Surgeon General, 2016).
The development of an individualized treatment plan increases client engagement and retention.

Nurses can educate clients about the dangers of drinking excessive amounts of alcohol and advise all women not to
drink alcohol if they are pregnant. Treatment options are based on the severity of the client's drinking (U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Surgeon General, 2016). If the client's alcohol use is mild,
then counseling services of one to two visits per week may be appropriate. A client with a more severe alcohol use
disorder may require inpatient treatment. The nurse caring for a client in an inpatient setting would use evidence-
based practice to determine the client's motivation for change, triggers, help the client to increase their belief in
themselves, and educate on changing thinking patterns (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of
the Surgeon General, 2016).

The CDC (2017) produced this one-minute public service announcement (https://openstax.org/r/77AlcoholPSA) to
share the importance of screening and counseling clients on alcohol use.

Overcoming Risks of Developing AUD

Many factors influence the development of substance use disorders, including growth and development,
environment, social, genetics, and co-occurring mental health disorders. Genetics play a 60 percent role in a person
developing an AUD, and a child who sees their parents drinking may also be influenced to begin drinking. Mental
health and trauma histories can have an effect on the likelihood that an individual will develop an AUD (NIAAA,
2023a).

Other conditions called protective factors shield people from developing a substance use disorder or addiction.
Protective factors are things like cultural or religious beliefs, having supportive friends and family, and having
healthy coping mechanisms. The relative influence of these factors varies across individuals and the lifespan.

Educating the public about the significance of AUD by providing programs in schools, community centers, and media
public service announcements decreases the risks of people developing AUDs. Nurses have the potential to effect
positive change through their educational endeavors.

19.3 Stimulant Use Disorders

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Identify stimulants that can be misused
    · Describe the symptoms of stimulant use disorder
    · Outline the role of the nurse in treating stimulant use disorder

Amphetamine-type substances, cocaine, and crack are stimulants; they cause the release of dopamine in the brain
and are highly addictive because the flood of dopamine in the brain's reward circuit strongly reinforces drug-taking
behaviors. With continued drug use, the reward circuit adapts and becomes less sensitive to the drug. As a result,
people take stronger and more frequent doses in an attempt to feel the same high and to obtain relief from
withdrawal symptoms. Because the high from stimulants starts and fades quickly, people often take repeated doses
in a form of binging, often giving up food and sleep while continuing to take the drug every few hours for several
days. Both the use and withdrawal from amphetamines can cause psychosis with symptoms of hallucinations and
paranoia (NIDA & National Institutes of Health, 2019).
636  19 · Substance Use and Misuse

     Stimulants That Can Be Misused

     Legal stimulants are most commonly prescribed to address attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and
     include the medications Ritalin and Adderall, among others (NIDA, 2020a). These medications enhance cognition
     and focus in clients with ADHD. When used by a person who does not have ADHD, these substances can become
     addictive and cause a dangerous rise in body temperature, irregular heartbeat, anger, psychosis, and paranoia. It is
     estimated that 1.5 million people, aged twelve or older, misused prescription stimulants in 2021 (NIDA, 2020a).
     Also frequently misused, and often more easily accessible, are over-the-counter cold/allergy medications containing
     pseudoephedrine, a stimulant.

     Illegal stimulants, on the other hand, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, are highly addictive substances that
     cause a sense of euphoria and increased energy. When used in combination with alcohol, the person has a higher
     risk of cardiac toxicity.

             LIFE-STAGE CONTEXT

     Nonmedical Prescription Stimulant (NMPS) Use among College Students

     Increased academic performance is the number one reason for college students obtaining and misusing
     prescription stimulants, such as Adderall and Ritalin. Fairman et al. (2020) report that 45.7 percent of 219 students
     responding used a NMPS without their own prescription and without a diagnosis for attention-deficit disorder. Most
     users wanted to improve concentration for studying and thereby improve academics. Students who have lower
     grade point averages are more likely to use NMPS. Rates of use in the United States are higher than in any other part
     of the world. Health concerns for this practice include adverse reactions, risk for dependence, and polydrug use
     (using more than one drug at a time).

     (Fairman et al., 2020)

     Amphetamines
     Amphetamines are prescription stimulant drugs and many are classified as Schedule II controlled substances due
     to the potential for misuse. Amphetamines were first used in the 1930s in an inhaler called Benzedrine (Department
     of Justice/Drug Enforcement Administration, 2022) after which prescriptions for the pill form of amphetamines
     became available to treat narcolepsy and ADHD. Today, these drugs have a high rate of misuse and have street
     names, such as crank, speed, and ice. Ice is the crystallized form of methamphetamine that is used for smoking. The
     effect is like cocaine but is slower and lasts longer in the body. Side effects include insomnia, loss of appetite,
     increased heart rate and blood pressure, and feeling exhausted (Department of Justice/Drug Enforcement
     Administration, 2022).

     Methamphetamines
     Methamphetamines are illegal stimulant drugs with no recognized medical use. Methamphetamines are unregulated
     and addictive and are classified as Schedule II drugs. Approximately two million Americans use methamphetamine
     in any given year, according to SAMHSA (2023b). The National Institute on Drug Abuse data reveals that overdose
     death rates involving methamphetamine quadrupled from 2011 to 2017 (NIDA & National Institutes of Health,
     2019). Methamphetamine comes in many forms and can be ingested by smoking, swallowing a pill, snorting, or
     injecting a powder that has been dissolved in water or alcohol. Methamphetamine can be easily made in small,
     clandestine laboratories with relatively inexpensive over-the-counter ingredients, such as pseudoephedrine, a
     common ingredient in cold medications. To curb this illegal production, federal law requires pharmacies take steps
     to limit sales and obtain photo identification from purchasers. Methamphetamine production also involves a number
     of other very dangerous chemicals. Toxic effects from these chemicals can remain in the environment long after the
     lab has been shut down, causing a wide range of health problems for people living in the area. These chemicals can
     also result in deadly lab explosions and house fires (NIDA & National Institutes of Health, 2019).

     Long-term use of methamphetamine has many negative consequences, including extreme weight loss, severe
     dental problems, intense itching leading to skin sores from scratching, involuntary movements (dyskinesia), anxiety,
     memory loss, and violent behavior (NIDA & National Institutes of Health, 2019).

Cocaine
Cocaine is another powerfully addictive stimulant drug. The drug is made from the leaves of the coca plant native to
South America. Estimates indicate that 4.8 million people aged twelve or older used cocaine in 2021 (SAMHSA,
2022c). Those who have used the drug may snort cocaine powder through the nose, rub it into their gums, or
dissolve the powder and inject it into the bloodstream. Cocaine processed to make a rock crystal is called "crack."
People heat the crystal (making crackling sounds) to produce vapors that they inhale into their lungs (American
Psychiatric Association, 2013; Boyer & Hernon, 2019). In the short-term, cocaine use can result in increased blood
pressure, restlessness, and irritability. In the long-term, severe medical complications of cocaine use include heart
attacks and seizures (NIDA & National Institutes of Health, 2019).

MDMA
A synthetic, psychoactive drug, MDMA, is more commonly known by the names Molly or Ecstasy (NIDA, 2020b). It is
like amphetamine and the hallucinogen mescaline in that it makes its users feel like they have more energy,
pleasure, and a distorted sense of time (NIDA, 2020b). MDMA affects three chemicals in the brain--dopamine,
norepinephrine, and serotonin--by increasing their activity. People using MDMA commonly take it in pill or capsule
form or by snorting it. The pleasurable effects usually last three to six hours. Because this drug lowers inhibitions,
people may engage in risky behaviors, such as unsafe sex, thus increasing their chances of contracting a sexually
transmitted infection or becoming pregnant. Other side effects are chills, nausea, teeth clenching, and extremely
high body temperature that can cause kidney, liver, or heart failure, and ultimately lead to death (NIDA, 2020b).

        REAL RN STORIES

Nurse: Shannan
Years in Practice: Sixteen
Clinical Setting: ER
Geographic Location: Unknown

In From Impaired to Inspired: One Nurse's Story of Addiction and Recovery (2018), Shannan F. shares her story of
recovery. She and her husband met when she was eighteen, married when she was twenty-two, and had their first
baby at twenty-seven. As an ER nurse married to a firefighter, she had what looked like a great marriage. They had
three boys together. Yet Shannan's husband began to have affairs. In 2010, he asked for a divorce. Shannan began
drinking socially over the next couple of years. As the pressures of being a single parent rose, Shannan was soon
drinking every night after her boys went to bed. In 2014, Shannan was given a prescription of Norco (a combination
of hydrocodone and acetaminophen) for a kidney stone. This drug, combined with the alcohol she was still drinking,
was a dangerous combination. After the prescription ran out, she began buying Norco from a drug dealer and
eventually stole Dilaudid from the Pyxis at work to support what had become a habit. On Easter of 2015, Shannan
blacked out and can only remember her boys trying to wake her up. Two days later, she called her state's board of
nursing (BON) and was put into a diversion program; her nursing license was suspended.

Shannan's story doesn't end there. She was eventually charged with twenty-eight felony charges for diverting drugs.
She had no money for a lawyer, but had a good public defender who got the charges reduced. She was put on ninety
days of house arrest and her sons went to live with their dad. During that period, she grew spiritually. She got her
sons back after the ninety days were over. She also had to face BON disciplinary proceedings at the end of her
diversion program. She made the decision to give up her nursing license. She currently works as a life coach to
nurses and first responders to help them in their recovery journeys.

Symptoms of Stimulant Use Disorder

Stimulant intoxication causes problematic behavioral or psychological changes, such as euphoria or blunted affect;
changes in sociability; hypervigilance; interpersonal sensitivity; anxiety, tension, or anger; and impaired judgment.
Other symptoms of stimulant intoxication include tachycardia, hypertension, pupillary dilation, elevated or
decreased blood pressure, perspiration or chills, nausea or vomiting, weight loss, psychomotor agitation or
retardation, muscular weakness, respiratory depression, chest pain or cardiac dysrhythmias, confusion, seizures,
638  19 · Substance Use and Misuse

     coma, psychosis/hallucinations, dyskinesia (involuntary, erratic, writhing movements of the face, arms, legs, or
     trunk) and dystonia (involuntary muscle contractions that result in slow repetitive movements) (American
     Psychiatric Association, 2013; Boyer & Hernon, 2019).

     Approaches to Treating Stimulant Use Disorder

     Treatment begins with detoxing from the stimulant, which is when the client stops taking the stimulant and allows
     all traces to leave their body. During withdrawal, the client may experience muscle tension, headaches, stomach
     cramps, increased appetite, insomnia, depression, and slower thinking (Cleveland Clinic, 2019). These withdrawal
     symptoms can begin within a few hours of the most recent use and last for up to seven days. The next part of
     treatment is for the client to participate in therapy, which can be in group format, individual counseling, or attend a
     twelve-step program. The support offered through these treatment options can increase the chances of the client
     maintaining sobriety.

     Planning Nursing Care for a Client in Stimulant Withdrawal/Detoxification
     The nurse initially assesses the client for withdrawal symptoms. Nurses commonly use the Clinical Institute
     Narcotic Assessment (CINA) or Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) to determine the level of discomfort the
     client is experiencing. The higher the score, the higher the level of symptoms that need to be managed by
     medication administration. Although there is no medication specifically for treating stimulant withdrawal, there are
     medications that can be used to treat individual symptoms (Cleveland Clinic, 2019). As the client's symptoms
     decrease, the nurse should invite the client to attend group sessions to learn more about positive coping methods.
     Discharge planning can include obtaining a bed in a residential recovery facility or the use of outpatient sobriety
     programs, such as Narcotic Anonymous, Cocaine Anonymous, or looking at a list of treatment options located on the
     SAMHSA website.

     Collaborative Care for Clients in Stimulant Use Recovery
     It is important for health-care systems to work together to assess and provide treatment to individuals who are
     experiencing all substance use disorders. There have been improvements to access to care brought about by the
     Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 and the Affordable Care
     Act, which work together to require that substance use disorder treatment be covered by insurance (U.S.
     Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Surgeon General, 2016). Implementing screening of all
     clients at each appointment is one of the first steps of early intervention. If a provider identifies a substance use
     disorder, they can initiate treatment within the primary care office or refer to more intense treatment for detox and
     recovery. Nurses, and other health-care professionals who complete client screenings, should receive training.
     According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Surgeon General (2016), each dollar
     that is spent on treatment saves four dollars in related health-care costs.

     Collaborative care achieves the best results in client recovery. It is important that all the members of the
     interprofessional team work together to recognize possible substance use disorders in their clients, determining the
     best treatment options for each individual and recognizing signs of relapse (Jahan & Burgess, 2023).

     19.4 Opioid Use Disorder

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define opioid use disorder
         · Outline methods used to treat opioid use disorder

     From 1999 to 2021, over 600,000 people died in the United States from an overdose involving prescription or illicit
     opioids (CDC, 2023). This rise in opioid overdose deaths happened in three distinct waves. The first wave of
     overdose deaths began with the increased prescription rate and misuse of opioids in the 1990s. The second wave
     began in 2010 with rapid increases in overdose deaths involving heroin. The third wave began in 2013 with
     significant increases in overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids, particularly illicitly manufactured fentanyl (CDC,
     2023).

     Defining Opioid Use Disorder

     Even though health-care providers prescribe opioids legally to address pain, the use of these medications can lead

to opioid use disorder (John Hopkins Medicine, 2023b). Among the 2021 U.S. population, 8.7 million people
misused prescription pain relievers, and 1.1 million people used illegal opioids such as heroin (SAMHSA, 2022c).
Misuse of a prescription pain reliever is described as either using a prescription medication that is prescribed to
another person or overuse (either in quantity or number of doses) of a medication prescribed to the user (SAMHSA,
2022c).

Opioids are substances that act on opioid receptors in the central nervous system. Opioid receptors in the brain are
part of the body's internal system to regulate pain. A receptor is like a lock that the opioid (similar to a key) fits into
(Medline Plus, 2017). Medically, they are used for anesthesia and relief of moderate to severe pain. When misused,
opioids cause a person to feel relaxed and euphoric, meaning they experience an intense feeling of happiness.
Opioid prescription medications include Schedule II medications, such as morphine, oxycodone, hydrocodone,
fentanyl, and hydromorphone. Heroin, an illegal street drug, is also an opioid, but it is classified as a Schedule I drug
(A.D.A.M. Medical Encyclopedia, 2022). Injected opioid misuse is a risk factor for contracting HIV, hepatitis B,
hepatitis C, and bacterial endocarditis. The CDC reports that people who inject drugs accounted for 9 percent of HIV
diagnoses in the United States in 2016 (SAMHSA, 2022a).

Behaviors Associated with Opioid Use Disorder
People often begin using opioids legitimately for pain that is caused by surgery, traumatic injury, or disease. When
taken as prescribed by the health-care provider, most people do not end up with an opioid use disorder (John
Hopkins, 2023a). Some people who take opioids enjoy a sense of euphoria when taking these drugs, however. For
these people there is a risk of abuse as they try to continue to replicate that euphoric feeling.

Once an opioid use disorder develops, the person may begin to have financial problems due to the expense of
buying the drugs. They may start to steal other people's opioids, belongings, or cash in order to support their habit
(John Hopkins Medicine, 2023a). Along with their interpersonal relationships beginning to deteriorate as they
continue to use, they may also have difficulty staying employed. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse
(2018), only a small percentage of people who have an opioid use disorder will go on to use heroin. Data collected to
examine heroin use suggests that those who go on to start heroin are more often polydrug users to begin with.

Opioid Intoxication
Opioid intoxication causes problematic behavioral or psychological changes, such as initial euphoria followed by
apathy, dysphoria, psychomotor retardation or agitation, and impaired judgment. Some other signs of opioid
intoxication include pupillary constriction (or dilation from severe overdose), drowsiness or coma, slurred speech,
and impairment in attention or memory (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). An initial assessment includes a
physical examination of the skin to look for the presence of needle track marks.

The typical signs of opioid overdose are referred to as the opioid overdose triad and include pinpoint pupils,
respiratory depression, and decreased level of consciousness (Jahan & Burgess, 2023). Naloxone (Narcan) reverses
the effects of an opioid overdose. A single-step nasal spray delivery of naloxone is the easiest and most successful
route of administration for members of the community and first responders. Also available is naloxone
intramuscular injection (Eggleston et al., 2018) (Figure 19.5).

     Misuse?" by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services/www.hhs.gov, Public Domain)

       CLINICAL JUDGMENT MEASUREMENT MODEL

       Take Action: Administering Naloxone

       After recognizing the signs of opioid overdose, there are five steps nurses and other health-care providers
       should take:

          1. Obtain emergency assistance--when in a facility, gather team members, and, if not in a facility, call 911.
          2. Provide rescue breathing, chest compressions, and oxygen as needed and if accessible. Use a barrier

               device when giving breaths to protect yourself from transmissible diseases.
          3. Administer the first dose of naloxone. This medication should be given to anyone suspected of an opioid

               overdose, including pregnant women.
          4. Administer a second dose of naloxone if the person does not respond within two to three minutes of the

               first dose.
          5. Monitor the person's response. Naloxone should work within two to three minutes of being administered,

               but it is short-acting and the person's overdose symptoms can return; thus, the person should be taken to
               the ED if they are not already in a facility with medical care available.

     Health Risks Associated with Illegal Use of Opioids
     According to Jahan and Burgess (2023), opioid use can affect many body systems and cause the following side
     effects:

         · stroke, seizures
         · cardiac failure with chronic use
         · memory loss and overall cognitive deficits
         · psychosis
         · nasal septal perforation
         · respiratory depression
         · muscle breakdown from overuse, leading to rhabdomyolysis

    · hepatitis B and C infections, HIV, sepsis, and gangrene
    · coma and death

Some of the side effects are associated with the form in which a person uses the substance. For instance, snorting
can cause nasal septal perforation. Use of IV forms of the substance can lead to blood-borne infections--Hep B and
C and HIV--if people are sharing needles (Cleveland Clinic, 2022b). The more that a person uses a substance, the
higher their risk for overdose, suicide, or death.

Approaches to Treating Opioid Use Disorder

There are several approaches to treating opioid use disorder. These methods include outpatient counseling,
intensive outpatient treatment, short-term residential treatment, long-term therapeutic communities (sober living),
and medication-assisted treatment (MAT) (Cleveland Clinic, 2022b). The most effective treatment combines the use
of medication with counseling and behavioral therapy.

Three FDA-approved medications for the treatment of opioid use disorder exist: buprenorphine, methadone, and
naltrexone (Cleveland Clinic, 2022b). Buprenorphine is a medication that blocks the euphoria produced by opioids
and reduces withdrawal symptoms and cravings. This medication must be given in the provider's setting in either
oral form or by monthly injection. Methadone is available in specific clinics designated to administer this medication.
It prevents the symptoms of withdrawal and reduces cravings. Naltrexone blocks the euphoria of opioids. It is only
available in provider settings in oral form or monthly injections.

CBT helps clients adjust their thinking and behavior in relation to using opioids. This therapy helps the client to act in
a healthier manner by examining their thoughts and reactions when they were using. Self-help programs, such as
Narcotics Anonymous, also provide behavior modification using the support and guidance of others with lived
experience.

Planning Nursing Care for a Client in Opioid Withdrawal/Detoxification
When caring for a client enduring opioid withdrawal/detoxification, the nurse's initial concerns revolve around
symptom management. Part of the assessment process involves the use of the CINA or COWS to determine the level
of withdrawal symptoms the client is having at set intervals throughout the day. The scoring on this scale assists the
nurse with determining medication administration to help manage symptoms. Withdrawal/detoxification length and
severity depend upon the opioid that the client has been taking and when their last use was prior to coming in for
treatment. The goal is to minimize withdrawal symptoms to the point that the client can begin working on discharge
planning.

Planning Nursing Care for a Client with Opioid Use Disorder
Once detox is complete, the nurse and other health-care professionals will begin to talk to the client about their
expectations for further treatment, motivation to change, and desire to stay sober. These important conversations
help to pave the way for continuing treatment as the client begins to feel better. Nurses spend this time educating
their clients on the seriousness of OUD, the negative effects it has on physical and emotional health, and on
available resources to support them once they leave inpatient treatment.

Collaborative Care for Clients in Opioid Use Recovery
In both the inpatient and community health settings, collaborative care provides the highest efficacy for clients with
OUD. Clinicians work together to plan individualized interventions, treatment plans, and outcomes. For instance, the
physician or psychiatrist may suggest the use of medications to assist with sobriety. The social worker will provide a
list of resources (outpatient services, short-term recovery services, sober living houses) that the client can review.
The nurse provides support and additional education to assist the client in determining the best course of action for
their life circumstances. Together, the team takes a harm reduction approach, which focuses on meeting the client
642  19 · Substance Use and Misuse

     where they are and helping to prevent overdose, reducing transmission of infectious diseases (such as HIV), and
     improving the overall health of the client (SAMHSA, 2022b). Harm reduction supplies and services can be funded by
     grants and can offer naloxone kits, health-care supplies, vitamin supplements, snacks, educational materials, and
     public health referrals and services. Using this approach, the team works with the client to set their own goals
     (SAMHSA, 2022b). The CDC partners with SAMHSA to provide more intensive harm reduction services, such as
     needle exchange programs and care to vulnerable populations through the National Harm Reduction Technical
     Assistance Center (NHRTAC).

     19.5 Dealing with Addiction

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Outline the approaches used to treat addiction
         · Recall the principles used to treat an overdose
         · Review management of a client who is in withdrawal
         · Plan collaborative care for a client who has an addiction

     Substance use disorder treatment is designed to help individuals stop or reduce harmful substance misuse, improve
     their health and social function, and manage their risk for relapse. For example, mild substance use disorders can be
     identified quickly in many medical settings and often respond to brief motivational interventions and/or supportive
     monitoring, referred to as guided self-change. In contrast, severe and chronic substance use disorders often require
     specialty substance use disorder treatment and continued posttreatment support to achieve full remission and
     recovery. To address the spectrum of problems associated with substance use disorders, it is necessary to plan and
     implement a continuum of care based on an individual's needs, including early intervention, treatment, and recovery
     support services (SAMHSA & Office of the Surgeon General, 2016).

             PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

     Culturally Sensitive Prevention Programs for Substance Use among Adolescents of Color

     This systematic review analyzed substance use prevention programs for adolescents of color in the United States.
     The study found that when culturally sensitive assessment addressed factors specific to certain populations and
     communities, effectiveness of the prevention efforts was increased.

     Adolescents of color are overrepresented in adverse consequence and involvement with the legal system and less
     likely to receive substance use treatment than White teens. The study found that culturally sensitive substance use
     prevention programs can address factors that contribute to these disparities.

     Delivered in home and in community, culturally sensitive programs can address positive aspects for adolescent
     psychosocial development such as racial and ethnic identity, problem-solving, and refusal skills. Further, these
     programs aim to strengthen the family dynamic as a protective strategy and educate on substance use.

     (Bo et al., 2023)

     Approaches to Treating Addiction

     The use of substances has a staggering cost of approximately $442 billion in the United States each year in health
     care costs, lost productivity, and criminal justice costs (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the
     Surgeon General, 2016). Research shows that integration of substance use treatment in primary health-care
     settings can greatly improve outcomes. Many people in the United States with a substance use disorder also have a
     mental health disorder, further complicating treatment. Traditionally, health-care providers have separated
     substance use treatment from other health-care practices (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of
     the Surgeon General, 2016). This separation appears counter to the similar goals of treating substance use disorder
     and other chronic health conditions, which are reduce symptoms of the substance use, increase overall health,
     monitor motivation to change, and manage possible relapse.

     The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Surgeon General (2016) suggests that screening

for substance misuse begin in health-care organizations by training health-care teams, including nurses, to
recognize the signs and symptoms of substance misuse. Screening should follow with training and the use of
therapeutic communication skills to engage the client in brief interventions for mild substance use problems or
referral to more intense therapies and use of medications for more severe cases.

        LINK TO LEARNING

SAMHSA has developed a short booklet called "Faces of Change. Do I have a Problem with Alcohol or Drugs?" It
covers the case studies (https://openstax.org/r/77alcdrugprob) of five people who have problems with either drugs
or alcohol.

Steps for Quitting Addiction
As health-care professionals struggle to support their clients who have substance use disorders, Harvard Medical
School (2021) suggests a basic five-step process that can be introduced in any office visit. The first step is the client
setting a quit date. Step two is the client agreeing to change their environment, removing any triggers to the
addiction. This could mean separating oneself from other people who are involved in the object of the addiction, and
removing items from their environment (alcohol, wine glasses). Step three is learning to use distraction as a
technique when feeling the urge to use. This could be as simple as going outside for a walk or calling a friend. Step
four is to review what worked and what did not work in past attempts to quit. The final step is to create a support
network of people who can help to encourage them.

Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT)
Medication-assisted treatment, or MAT, combines the use of medication and behavioral therapy to prevent opioid
overdose and treat substance use disorder (Food and Drug Administration [FDA], 2023). This type of treatment
takes a holistic approach that has been shown to improve outcomes for people using substances, help people get
jobs and work, increase clients staying in treatment, and increase positive outcomes of babies born to women who
were using substances while pregnant (FDA, 2023). Depending upon the substance that the client has used,
medications may either help block the cravings and good feelings produced by the substance or decrease
withdrawal symptoms.

Medications to Combat Drug Use
Medications that have been approved by the FDA for use during MAT include methadone, buprenorphine, and
naltrexone (FDA, 2023). Methadone is taken once a day under the supervision of a nurse at a methadone clinic. It
comes in tablet, liquid, and wafer forms. It works by blocking the effects of the opioid and reducing cravings.
Buprenorphine gives the same euphoric feelings as the opioids without the side effects. It helps to decrease
cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Naltrexone blocks the euphoria associated with opioids. If a person relapses
while taking naltrexone, they will not get "high." One concern is that when a person discontinues naltrexone and
relapses, they will have a lower tolerance to opioids and may overdose if they take the same opioid doses previously
taken.

Using Medications for Detoxification
The amount of time it takes for the body to get rid of the substances (detoxification) differs based on the substance
consumed. Likewise, the medications prescribed to help with detox differ based on the substance consumed.
Nurses closely monitor the use of medication during withdrawal/detoxification, including performing withdrawal
assessment scales. These scales have symptom items that are scored by the observation of the nurse or provider or
through direct questioning of client (Prunty & Prunty, 2016). The data collected on these forms is used to help
determine the medication to manage withdrawal symptoms.

Much of the medication that is used is based on the symptoms that the client is experiencing, such as stomach
upset, runny nose, headache, diarrhea, anxiety, and increased blood pressure. For example, it is common practice to
have orders for acetaminophen (Tylenol) for headache, dyphenhydramine (Benadryl) for runny nose, Maalox for
stomach upset, and Imodium for diarrhea. Clonidine (Catapres) is commonly prescribed to reduce the high blood
pressure seen during some detoxes. Nursing management is indicated with Catapres, as renal impairment and
rapidly dropping blood pressure can result.

     Hospital and Residential Treatment
     Inpatient treatment for substance use disorder at a hospital typically runs overnight to a few weeks. Some programs
     are short-term three- to five-day inpatient hospital programs that assist the client in the initial detox while
     supporting them with medications and milieu therapy. During their stay, a case manager/social worker will assist the
     client with discharge planning that could include admission to a long-term recovery center (SAMHSA, 2014).

     Residential treatment entails a client living at a treatment center for a period of time. This allows the client to live in
     a supportive environment aimed at helping them to stay sober, learn about substance use disorders and healthier
     coping mechanisms, receive therapy to help them stay motivated, and get life skills training (SAMHSA, 2014). This
     time depends upon the facility, insurance coverage, and/or the severity of the person's substance use disorder. This
     type of treatment may cost the client, so it is important to understand which types of insurances the program takes,
     if it has a low-cost or free option, and if there are other program alternatives (SAMHSA, 2023a).

     Community Treatment
     Community treatment takes place through community health centers, mental health facilities, and hospitals. Groups

and educational options are often listed on these facilities' websites or can be obtained by calling them directly.
Community treatment gives individuals the option to be supported while continuing to live and work in their
communities (SAMHSA, 2014).

An intensive outpatient program (IOP) is a treatment option that involves meeting at a facility for both individual and
group therapy, three to five days a week for approximately three hours a day. These types of programs are used to
treat depression, dual diagnosis, substance use, and eating disorders (Blanchfield, 2022). IOPs are considered a
"step down" type of treatment that helps individuals transition from inpatient care back to their normal lives.

Peer Support Services
Peer support services provide an individual with the option to attend groups at times that are flexible and
convenient to them. These groups, such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), Narcotics Anonymous (NA), The National
Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), and cultural, religious, or social networks (SAMHSA, 2023a), include face-to-face
and virtual options. There are also groups such as Nar-Anon, Al-Anon, and NAMI for families of those with substance
use or mental health problems. Veterans can reach out to their local VA to find out more information about self-help
groups specifically available to them.

Many apps are available for those with smartphones. These apps offer 24/7 support that is easy to take anywhere
you want to go. In times of crisis, individuals or family members can call 988 to talk with a trained crisis counselor.

Recognizing and Treating Overdose

Overdoses happen when people misuse their prescription medications, consume illegal drugs, and relapse after
abstinence. Symptoms observed in the person who has taken an overdose depend upon the substance taken
(Hartney, 2023). In opioid overdoses, the symptoms include clammy skin, slowed breathing, pinpoint pupils,
vomiting, and becoming unconscious. Naloxone aids people who have overdosed on opioids. It works by blocking
the effects of opioids and it can reverse the overdose.

In stimulant overdoses, the symptoms include rapid breathing, increased heart rate, convulsions, paranoia, and
even coma. Medication can be used for symptom management once the person is taken to the hospital.
Benzodiazepines are usually the most used medication for cardiovascular symptoms. Nitroglycerin might be used
for the client who complains of chest pain. There is no specific medication for stimulant overdoses comparable to
the use of naloxone for opioid overdoses (SAMHSA, 2021a).

Alcohol overdose is a medical emergency that can result in death. A person who overdoses on alcohol should be
taken to a hospital, monitored closely, and medicated to prevent further physical decline. One potential danger of
alcohol overdose is choking on one's vomit and dying from lack of oxygen because high levels of alcohol intake
hinder the gag reflex, resulting in the inability to protect the airway. Asphyxiation can occur due to an obstructed
airway or from aspiration of gastric contents into the lungs. For this reason, do not leave a person alone who has
passed out due to alcohol misuse. Keep them in a partially upright position or roll them onto one side with an ear
toward the ground to prevent choking if they begin vomiting (NIAAA & National Institutes of Health, 2021).

Critical signs and symptoms of an alcohol overdose include mental confusion or stupor, difficulty remaining
conscious or inability to wake up, vomiting, seizures, slow respiratory rate (fewer than eight breaths per minute),
irregular breathing (ten seconds or more between breaths), slow heart rate, clammy skin, no gag reflex, extremely
low body temperature, and bluish skin color or paleness (NIAAA & National Institutes of Health, 2021). If you
suspect someone has overdosed on alcohol, seek emergency assistance or call 911. While waiting for help to arrive,
be prepared to provide information to the responders, such as the type and amount of alcohol the person drank and
any other drugs they ingested, current medications, allergies to medications, and any existing health conditions
(NIAAA & National Institutes of Health, 2021).

Overdoses of certain medications, such as Tylenol, require medical intervention, including the use of activated
charcoal to leech the medication out of the system. Many people do not realize that Tylenol overdose can result in
permanent liver damage.

Issues in Withdrawal Management

Nurses working in medical-surgical hospital settings or emergency departments commonly provide care for clients
receiving withdrawal treatment for alcohol, opioids, or other substances. Withdrawal symptoms vary among
646  19 · Substance Use and Misuse

     substances, length, and frequency of use. Clients frequently underreport alcohol and substance use, so nurses must
     be aware of signs of withdrawal in clients receiving medical care for other issues and notify the health-care provider
     (Sellers, n.d.). Withdrawal management, also considered detoxification, is highly effective in preventing immediate
     and serious medical consequences associated with discontinuing substance use, although alone it is not an effective
     treatment for any substance use disorder. It is considered stabilization, which is assisting a client through a period
     of acute detoxification and withdrawal so that they are medically stable and substance-free. Stabilization often
     prepares the individual for treatment. During stabilization, the client has become medically stable and is prepared
     for the recovery process and treatment plan. It is considered a first step toward recovery, similar to the acute
     management of a diabetic coma as a first step toward managing the underlying illness of diabetes. Similarly, acute
     stabilization and withdrawal management work best when followed by evidence-based treatments and recovery
     services (SAMHSA & Offices of the Surgeon General, 2016).

     Unfortunately, many individuals who receive withdrawal management do not become engaged in treatment. Studies
     have found that, among individuals with substance use disorders who receive withdrawal management services, up
     to three-quarters of them do not enter treatment (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, &
     Office of the Surgeon General, 2016). The client needs to be ready to make the necessary changes in order to enter
     into recovery long-term. This is often the most difficult step.

     Nurses can use the Motivation to Change Model to assess clients and educate them about the resources available to
     help them stay sober. This model is a therapeutic process wherein the professional supports positive behavior
     change. Support includes identifying the client's existing motivation, empowering the client to choose, recognizing
     that resistance is part of the change process, and matching helping strategies to the client's readiness to change.
     Stages of readiness include precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance of the change.

     One of the most serious consequences when individuals do not continue care after withdrawal management is
     overdose. Because withdrawal management reduces acquired tolerance, those who attempt to reuse their former
     substance in the same amount or frequency may overdose, especially those with opioid use disorders (SAMHSA &
     Offices of the Surgeon General, 2016).

             CLINICAL SAFETY AND PROCEDURES (QSEN)

     QSEN Competency: Teamwork and Collaboration

     One part of working with clients who are withdrawing from substance use is teaching them about relapse
     prevention. During this interaction, the nurse will:

         · treat clients holistically with no judgment toward their substance use
         · discuss the danger of using again at the same amount used prior to withdrawal
         · encourage the client to share their feelings about withdrawal, working with them to devise a plan if craving is

             pushing them toward relapse

     (QSEN Institute, n.d.)

     Alcohol Withdrawal
     The prevalence of alcohol use disorder is estimated to be as high as 40 percent among hospitalized U.S. clients.
     Approximately half of clients with alcohol use disorder experience alcohol withdrawal when they reduce or stop
     drinking, with as many as 20 percent experiencing serious manifestations, such as hallucinations, seizures, and
     delirium tremens (Pace, 2022). Severe alcohol withdrawal is considered a medical emergency that is best managed
     in an intensive care unit.

     Symptoms of early or mild alcohol withdrawal include anxiety, minor agitation, restlessness, insomnia, tremor,
     diaphoresis, palpitations, headache, and alcohol craving. Clients often experience loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting,
     and diarrhea. Their risk for falls often increases when they try to go unassisted to the bathroom with these
     gastrointestinal symptoms. Physical signs include sinus tachycardia, systolic hypertension, hyperactive reflexes, and
     tremor. Without treatment, symptoms of mild alcohol withdrawal generally begin within six to thirty-six hours after
     the last drink and resolve within one to two days (Pace, 2022).

     Access for free at openstax.org
19.5 · Dealing with Addiction                                                                                            647

Some clients develop moderate to severe withdrawal symptoms that can last up to six days. Hallucinations, for
example, mostly occur within twelve to forty-eight hours after the last drink. They are typically visual and commonly
involve seeing insects or animals in the room, although auditory and tactile phenomena may also occur (Pace,
2022). Moreover, alcohol withdrawal-related seizures can occur within six to forty-eight hours after the last drink.
Risk factors for seizures include concurrent withdrawal from benzodiazepines or other sedative-hypnotic drugs
(Pace, 2022). Importantly, delirium tremens (DT) is a rapid-onset, fluctuating disturbance of attention and cognition
that is sometimes associated with hallucinations. In its most severe manifestation, DTs are accompanied by
agitation and signs of extreme autonomic hyperactivity, including fever, severe tachycardia, hypertension, and
drenching sweats. DTs typically begin between forty-eight and ninety-six hours after the client's last drink. Mortality
rates from withdrawal delirium have been historically as high as 20 percent, but with appropriate medical
management, the mortality rate is between 1 and 4 percent. Death is attributed to cardiovascular complications,
hyperthermia, aspiration, and severe fluid and electrolyte disorders (Pace, 2022).

Benzodiazepine Withdrawal
Rapid recognition and treatment of benzodiazepine withdrawal is critical because it can be life-threatening. Signs
and symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal include tremors, anxiety, general malaise, perceptual disturbances,
psychosis, seizures, and autonomic instability. Withdrawal is treated with a long-acting benzodiazepine (such as
diazepam) and titrated to prevent withdrawal symptoms without causing excessive sedation or respiratory
depression. The dose is then tapered gradually over a period of months (SAMHSA, 2022a).

Opioid Withdrawal
Medically supervised opioid withdrawal, also known as detoxification, involves administering medication to reduce
the severity of withdrawal symptoms that occur when an opioid-dependent client stops using opioids. Supervised
withdrawal alone does not generally result in sustained abstinence from opioids, nor does it address reasons the
client became dependent on opioids (Sevarino, 2022). Clients may undergo detoxification for several reasons
(Sevarino, 2022):

    · Initiating the process to "get clean and stay clean" from opioids. Some clients may follow up with inpatient or
        outpatient treatment after completing the detoxification process.

    · Treating withdrawal symptoms when a client dependent on opioids or heroin becomes hospitalized and lacks
        access to the misused substance.

    · Beginning the first step in treating opioid use disorder and transitioning to medication-assisted treatment like
        methadone or suboxone treatment.

    · Establishing an abstinent state without withdrawal symptoms as required for the client's setting or status
        (e.g., incarceration, probation, or a drug-free residential program).

Withdrawal symptoms commonly encountered after prolonged use of opioids include runny nose, watering eyes,
yawning, extremely high body temperature, muscle pain, nausea/vomiting, and anxiety (Cleveland Clinic, 2022a).

Stimulant Withdrawal
As soon as a person stops using a stimulant, the symptoms of withdrawal begin. These include feeling depressed,
having a lack of energy, and feeling lethargic (American Addiction Centers, 2023). While this withdrawal is not
typically life-threatening, the depression can cause suicidal ideation.

There are three phases to this withdrawal (American Addiction Centers, 2023). The first is the emotional feelings of
sadness, anxiety, and intense craving. During the second phase, the person begins to feel physically and mentally
exhausted as well as experience insomnia and depression. The third phase begins about twelve hours after the
initial withdrawal symptoms and the person may notice much stronger symptoms and cravings that can last for
ninety-six hours to several weeks.

Collaborative Care for a Client with an Addiction

The care of an individual with an addiction is collaborative in nature. It includes the client, family members,
treatment team members such as the provider, nurse, social worker, case manager, and addiction/mental health
counselors. Individual treatment plans are developed based on the individual needs and concerns of the client.
648 19 · Summary

Summary

19.1 Substance Use Disorders

Chronic substance use disorders significantly impact individuals, families, communities, and society. Misuse of
alcohol, drugs, and prescribed medications is estimated to cost the United States more than $400 billion in health-
care expenses (SAMHSA & Office of the Surgeon General, 2016), law enforcement and criminal justice costs, lost
workplace productivity, and losses from motor vehicle crashes.

Substance use disorders (SUD) occur when the recurrent use of alcohol and/or drugs causes clinically significant
impairment, including health problems, disability, and failure to meet major responsibilities at work, school, or
home. People who have an SUD may also have a mental health disorder. Three regions of the brain are the key
components in the development and persistence of substance use disorders: the basal ganglia, the extended
amygdala, and the prefrontal cortex. Prolonged, repeated misuse of substances can produce changes to the brain
that can lead to a substance use disorder. Substances that are abused can be both legal and illegal in nature
(Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration & Office of the Surgeon General, 2016).

Nurses also struggle with substance use disorders. Many state boards of nursing have programs designed to assist
nurses with substance use disorders recover so that they can provide safe care to their clients.

19.2 Alcohol Use Disorder

Alcohol use disorder occurs in all ages, cultures, and socioeconomic groups. Risk factors for developing an alcohol
use disorder include the age at which a person starts drinking, genetics, psychological factors, and environmental
factors. There are several FDA-approved medications to help treat alcohol use disorders. In addition to medication,
examples of behavioral treatments include CBT, DBT, motivational enhancement therapy (MET), and family therapy.
Each of these treatments can work individually or in combination to help the client develop the skills they need to
decrease/stop drinking, work on goal setting, and build a support system. Mutual support groups include Alcoholics
Anonymous and Al-Anon. As part of the standard of care, nurses should assess all clients for alcohol use.

19.3 Stimulant Use Disorders

Stimulants include amphetamine-type substances, cocaine, and crack. Stimulants cause the release of dopamine in
the brain and are highly addictive because the flood of dopamine in the brain's reward circuit strongly reinforces
drug-taking behaviors. Legal stimulants are most commonly prescribed to mitigate the symptoms of ADHD and
include the medications Ritalin and Adderall, among others. Over-the-counter cold/allergy medications containing
pseudoephedrine are easily accessible stimulants that are prone to misuse. Illegal stimulants, such as cocaine and
methamphetamine, are highly addictive substances that cause a sense of euphoria and increased energy.

Stimulant intoxication causes problematic behavioral or psychological changes, such as euphoria or blunted affect;
changes in sociability; hypervigilance; interpersonal sensitivity; anxiety, tension, or anger; and impaired judgment. It
is important for health-care systems to work together to assess and provide treatment to individuals who are
experiencing all substance use disorders. Nurses and any health-care professionals who complete client screenings
need extensive training.

19.4 Opioid Use Disorder

Even though many opioids are legally prescribed by physicians to address pain, the use of these medications can
lead to opioid use disorder. Opioid intoxication causes problematic behavioral or psychological changes, such as
initial euphoria followed by apathy, dysphoria, psychomotor retardation or agitation, and impaired judgment. When
misused, opioids cause a person to feel relaxed and euphoric or to overdose. Naloxone reverses the effects of an
opioid overdose. Outpatient counseling, intensive outpatient treatment, short-term residential treatment, long-term
therapeutic communities (sober living), and medication-assisted treatment (MAT) are all recovery methods for OUD.
One main nursing goal with respect to detox is to minimize withdrawal symptoms to the point that the client can
begin working on discharge planning.

Competency-Based Assessments

    1. In a scenario where a client denies having a substance use issue but exhibits signs of withdrawal during
        hospitalization, create a plan for a nurse to approach the situation without compromising trust and
        therapeutic rapport.

    2. As a nurse, you have a role in planning care for a client with substance use disorder. Talk about how a
        collaborative approach involving the client, health-care team, and community resources can contribute to
        successful outcomes.

    3. A client with alcohol use disorder is resistant to pharmacological interventions. Outline alternative
        nonpharmacological approaches a nurse can incorporate into the client's care plan.

    4. As a nurse, you are working with a client who is at risk for delirium tremens during alcohol withdrawal. Outline
        the nursing interventions you would take to prevent and manage delirium tremens.

    5. A client is admitted with symptoms of stimulant intoxication. Do some research to determine how a nurse can
        differentiate between the effects of cocaine and amphetamine intoxication during the assessment.

    6. You are examining a client who expresses difficulty maintaining abstinence from stimulants. Outline the
        strategies you would use to support relapse prevention and promote long-term recovery.

        address the client's pain while minimizing the risk of opioid use disorder.

    8. A client expresses fear and ambivalence about starting medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use
        disorder. Develop a nursing approach to address the client's concerns and promote engagement in MAT.

    9. You are a nursing student who is working with a client who has been admitted to the emergency room with
        symptoms of stimulant intoxication. How can you differentiate between the effects of cocaine and
        amphetamine intoxication during the assessment?

INTRODUCTION Eating disorders are a growing concern in nursing because they affect millions of people. It is
estimated that approximately 5 percent of the United States population experiences eating disorders with the
highest prevalence seen in women ages twelve to thirty-five (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2023a),
though these conditions affect all genders. Eating disorders have high morbidity and mortality rates and are
considered serious mental health illnesses (Davis & Attia, 2019). Clients with eating disorders may seek health-care
services that require nurses to play an essential role. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) lists the following under the category of feeding and eating disorders:
anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge eating disorder (BED), avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder
(ARFID), pica, and rumination (APA, 2023b).

     20.1 Psychological, Social, and Physiological Factors

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Discuss psychological factors associated with eating disorders
         · Discuss social factors associated with eating disorders
         · Relate physiological, hereditary, and environmental factors to the development of eating disorders
         · Determine nursing interventions for identified problems related to eating disorders

     According to the American Psychological Association, an eating disorder is an illness where there is an abnormal
     disturbance in attitudes and behaviors related to food (APA, 2023c).

     Eating disorders can affect people of all ages and backgrounds though they occur more often during the adolescent
     period. Eating disorders are complex and involve many psychological and behavioral factors, though these factors
     may interact differently in different people (National Eating Disorders Association [NEDA], 2023a). Studies are still
     evaluating the effects psychological, social, physiological, genetic, and environmental factors all have on eating
     disorders, but the current evidence demonstrates that all of these factors play a role in the development of these
     disorders (NEDA, 2023a).

     Individuals with eating disorders may have certain rituals and habits related to their disorder. These can include
     things like cutting up food into small pieces, counting pieces of food, hiding food, eating slowly, and taking long
     breaks (Calugi et al., 2019). Assessing clients for rituals and habits is essential during history taking. Tools like the
     Self Report Habit Index can be used to help assess habits and behavior (Verplanken & Orbell, 2003).

             PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

     Statistics around Eating Disorders

     The National Eating Disorders Association has published statistics on eating disorders (https://openstax.org/r/
     77eatngdisorder) across all genders and groups, military, students, and athletes, and addresses comorbidities,
     pregnancy, mental health challenges, and caregiver concerns.

     The Center for Women's Health at Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) (2023) found twice the prevalence
     among females as among males for eating disorders, while noting that Transgender and nonbinary persons also
     show an increase in these conditions. There are reports that eating disorders are increasing globally for all people,
     with an uptick from 3.4 percent to 7.8 percent from 2000 to 2018 (OHSU, 2023).

     Psychological Factors

     Studies reveal that psychological factors, such as having a history of anxiety disorder, can increase an individual's
     chance of developing an eating disorder (NEDA, 2023a). Other psychological factors--displeasure with body image
     and behavioral rigidity, meaning that the person may have habits that are inflexible, compulsive, and resistive to
     change--have also been associated with eating disorders. The National Eating Disorders Association states that
     people with eating disorders are more likely to be dissatisfied with their bodies and report inflexible behaviors in
     childhood (NEDA, 2023a). Personality traits, parenting, and childhood trauma also may contribute psychologically to
     the development of an eating disorder.

     Personality Development
     Personality traits can play a key role in the development and progression of eating disorders. For instance, studies
     have shown that individuals with eating disorders tend to have high levels of perfectionist traits that can cause
     things like obsession with weight, rigidity around eating, and unusually high expectations (Holland et al., 2013). In
     fact, perfectionism has been implicated as one of the strongest risk factors associated with eating disorders (NEDA,
     2023a).

     Family Dynamics and Parenting
     Family dynamics and parenting can influence the development of eating disorders. Studies have shown that family
     dynamics that include conflict, poor communication, and issues with boundaries can impact some disorders

     Access for free at openstax.org
20.1 · Psychological, Social, and Physiological Factors                                                                  661

(Zanella & Lee, 2022). Several studies conducted in children also found a connection with parenting styles and
eating disorders. Authoritarian (very strict) and permissive (less strict) parenting styles have been shown to have a
significant effect on eating patterns leading to behaviors like calorie restriction (Ramsewak et al., 2022). For
example, people who grow up in a very permissive household may find it easier to engage in disordered eating
behaviors if they are not being monitored as much.

Adverse Events of Childhood
Adverse events that occur in childhood have been discovered as a risk factor for eating disorders. Adverse events
include things such as child abuse, neglect, or households where substances are abused (Yoon et al., 2022).
Because adverse childhood events can be common in people with eating disorders, screening for adverse childhood
events should be a standard part of any plan of care. Screening tools like the ten-item Adverse Childhood
Experiences (ACE) Questionnaire can screen for exposure to abuse, neglect, and other household dysfunction that
can influence the development of eating disorders (Kovács-Tóth et al., 2022; Kovács-Tóth et al., 2023).

Social Factors

Social factors can impact the development and progression of eating disorders. Being teased or bullied and/or
having a limited social network have been linked to the development of eating disorders (NEDA, 2023a). For
example, 60 percent of those with eating disorders reported that being teased about weight led to the development
of their eating disorder (NEDA, 2023a). Similarly, lack of social supports, which can lead to isolation and loneliness,
is also associated with the development of eating disorders (NEDA, 2023a).

Peer Influence
Peer and social factors can have an effect on eating disorders. As children grow and develop, peers become more
influential in their lives. Studies have shown that influence from peers can lead to disordered eating patterns such
as excessive dieting, fasting, and binge eating (Keel et al., 2013). There are also several social factors associated
with a higher risk of developing eating disorders. These include things such as weight stigma, bullying, loneliness,
and generational cultural trauma (NEDA, 2023a). Generational cultural trauma starts when one generation endures
a distressing event and then the effects of that trauma pass to the next generation.

Societal pressure to achieve an "ideal body" can also influence behaviors seen with eating disorders, such as
excessive dieting and exercising. Social media and television can increase a person's risk for developing an eating
disorder and can lead to stress and issues with body image (NEDA, 2023a).

Physiological, Hereditary, and Environmental Factors

Eating disorders are complex and involve the interplay of several factors. Physiological, hereditary, and
environmental factors can increase the risk for developing eating disorders (Treasure et al., 2022). Interventions to
promote healthy eating and exercise habits in clients with risk factors associated with eating disorders may be
beneficial as a preventative strategy (Treasure et al., 2022). One good example of a healthy eating initiative is the
U.S. Department of Agriculture's MyPlate, which provides information on balancing each meal with healthy options
from each food group (U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA], 2023).

        LINK TO LEARNING

The USDA offers tips and resources to help people learn how to eat healthy (https://openstax.org/r/77healthyeating)
in its MyPlate campaign. Users can personalize it to create a healthy eating plan.

Biological and Genetic Factors
There are several biological factors that can increase the risk of developing eating disorders. For example, the
hypothalamus regulates appetite in the brain, and contributes to neurotransmitter function, specifically involving
serotonin and norepinephrine. Neurotransmitter dysfunction may contribute to eating disorders (Riva, 2016).
Studies also have found that growth spurts, illness, athletic training, and having type 1 diabetes can lead to the
development of eating disorders (NEDA, 2023a). These conditions/situations often require that clients check their
weight frequently, focus on food labels and content, and report on weight at doctor's visits, which shines a light on
weight and body that increases the frequency of eating disorders.
662  20 · Eating Disorders

     Another risk factor associated with eating disorders is heritability, defined as how much genes influence
     differences in traits. Twin studies have found heritability as high as 58 percent in anorexia nervosa, 57 percent in
     binge eating disorder, and as high as 83 percent in bulimia nervosa (Thornton et al., 2011). Family studies have
     shown an increase in the lifetime risk of developing some eating disorders if there is a first-degree relative with the
     disorder (Thornton et al., 2011). Having a first-degree relative with a mental health condition, such as anxiety,
     depression, or addiction, can also increase an individual's chances of developing an eating disorder (NEDA, 2023a).
     Because genetic factors can influence eating disorders, it is important to obtain a thorough family history during
     nursing assessment.

     Environmental Factors
     Environment can play a role in the development of eating disorders, particularly exposure to media. Studies in
     adolescents have revealed a correlation between an increase in technology use like social media, the internet, TV,
     and video games with an increase in eating disorders (Mora et al., 2022). Other environmental factors, such as
     experiencing stress, have also been shown to influence eating disorders. In twin studies, stress experienced by one
     twin has been proven to be highly influential in that twin developing an eating disorder (Steiger & Booij, 2020).
     There have also been studies conducted on the prenatal environment related to eating disorders. These studies
     found that exposure to things like natural disasters experienced by mothers during the third trimester showed an
     increase of children who later exhibited symptoms for eating disorders due to maternal stress (Steiger & Booij,
     2020). Assessing prenatal history and environmental factors like technology use are essential when caring for
     clients at risk of developing eating disorders.

     Nursing Implications

     Nurses are essential members of the health-care team who will assess clients with eating disorders. Positive
     experiences with nurses have been associated with improved outcomes in clients treated for eating disorders, so it
     is important to build a therapeutic relationship (Zugai et al., 2013). When performing their assessments, nurses
     should be aware of risk factors associated with eating disorders. An example would be inquiring about family history
     of an eating or mental health disorder or screening for adverse childhood events. It is also important for nurses to
     inquire about things like internet and social media usage.

     Nursing Assessment
     Nursing assessments should be holistic and not only focus on caring for physical needs but on the whole person.
     Assessing clients' psychological, emotional, and social needs is essential to the management of eating disorders
     (Corral-Liria et al., 2022). Clients with eating disorders may have experienced trauma or have poor family dynamics
     that may be revealed during a nursing assessment. Clients with eating disorders may also have other underlying
     mental health disorders like depression and anxiety, so it is important to identify any mental health symptoms.
     Nurses should assess psychological factors like perfectionism, body image dissatisfaction, and inflexible behaviors.
     Examples that may be revealed during an assessment include:

         · having unrealistic expectations for themselves
         · reporting high levels of dissatisfaction with their body
         · feeling like there is only one right way to do things

     Nurses should also assess emotional factors and history of anxiety disorders. Common anxiety disorders associated
     with eating disorders are:

         · generalized anxiety disorder
         · social phobia
         · obsessive-compulsive disorder

     Nurses should also be sure to assess social factors that can influence eating disorders, such as bullying, social
     isolation, and history of generational trauma.

     Collaborative Care
     Caring for clients with eating disorders requires a collaborative approach. There are several disciplines that will be
     involved in care, including nurses, dietitians, social workers, and other specialists like psychiatrists. Some clients
     with eating disorders will require medications to manage their mental health comorbidities. Medications used may

20.2 · Anorexia Nervosa                                                                                                 663

include antidepressants, antipsychotics, anti-nausea medications, antianxiety medications, and stimulants
(Himmerich et al., 2021). Some medications like benzodiazepines and lisdexamfetamine are controlled substances
that require special care to ensure safety and prevent misuse. Nurses who administer controlled medications to
clients will need to ensure that they follow agency-specific protocols, which can include keeping the medication in a
locked area.

Nursing Process and Plan of Care
Caring for clients with eating disorders requires nurses to use clinical reasoning to competently work with clients
and involve them in their plan of care. Consider this example of using clinical reasoning when caring for clients with
eating disorders:

    · Recognizing cues: Nurses should be able to recognize cues that may indicate the need for immediate medical
        attention. Nurses can obtain helpful data from multiple sources to help assess clients with eating disorders.
        An example would be getting a history of the clients' disordered eating and collecting height and weight
        measurements that reveal abnormalities. It could also include collecting vital signs that may reveal
        abnormalities, like hypotension, in clients who are severely malnourished.

    · Analyzing cues: If a nurse sees a cue that is concerning, they need to be able to determine what requires
        further evaluation. This process involves connecting cues with possible concerns. For example, they could
        correlate inadequate nutrition with the low body weight obtained during admission. It could also include
        relating findings like inadequate cardiac output as evidenced by low blood pressure that can occur with
        malnourishment.

    · Prioritizing hypotheses: After analyzing cues, the nurse can determine which cues need to be addressed first
        or immediately. For example, if a client is severely malnourished and has a very low blood pressure,
        addressing the low blood pressure would be a priority.

    · Generating solutions: Once the nurse determines the priority, they can begin to plan interventions needed to
        manage the client. Examples of actions that could be taken for a severely malnourished client with a low blood
        pressure are administering fluids that may be ordered for blood pressure or nutritional supplements to
        address the low body weight.

    · Taking action: The nurse can take action by implementing interventions or contacting providers who are
        needed for orders to address the clients' health concerns. For example, if there is no order for fluids or
        medications to address the low blood pressure, the nurse could contact the attending provider.

    · Evaluating outcomes: After implementing interventions or actions, the nurse can determine if the actions
        helped the situation and if they achieved the intended outcome. For example, if the intended outcome of
        giving fluids was to increase the client's blood pressure, the nurse would assess the client's blood pressure
        and document the findings. The nurse collaborates with the client and the health-care team throughout the
        process.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        diagnosed with anorexia nervosa

The self-induced restriction of food, due to fear of weight gain, that results in weight lowering to below the normal
parameters for age and height is called anorexia nervosa (APA, 2023a). The disorder is characterized by extreme
restriction of food intake below the daily requirements causing very low body weight. In adults, this typically
664  20 · Eating Disorders

     presents with a body mass index (BMI), a value that is calculated from an individual's height and weight (Figure
     20.2), under 18.5 (APA, 2023a). In children, this would present as notable deficits in height and weight compared
     with children in their age group with a BMI under the fifth percentile (Costandache et al., 2023). The height and
     weight with the lowest risk for mortality is called ideal body weight. It has been used as a method of risk
     assessment by dietitians and researchers, calculated using height-weight tables (Chichester et al., 2021). Though
     widely used in sports and health statistics, some variances, such as body measurements and musculature, may
     require further exploration, according to Chichester et al. (2021).

     BMI parameters may not apply to athletes, body builders, or people who exercise a lot because a BMI may be higher
     in athletes due to their increased muscle mass. Also, BMI measurements are based on anthropometric
     measurements of White people. Body fat distribution differs by race and ethnicity, such as among Hispanic, Black,
     East Asian, and South Asian populations. Furthermore, the American Medical Association indicates that BMI should
     not be used as a sole determinant of health and risk. Rather, it should be used in conjunction with measurements of
     body adiposity index, relative fat mass, waist circumference, and visceral fat, as well as considerations of body
     composition, genetic factors, metabolic factors, and other measures (American Medical Association, 2023).

     Anorexia is divided into two categories: restricting type anorexia, where weight loss is achieved by dieting, fasting,
     or extreme exercise; or binge eating/purging type anorexia, where binge eating is followed by purging through
     self-induced vomiting or misuse of laxitives, diuretics, or enemas to achieve weight loss. To distinguish the binge
     eating/purging seen with anorexia from bulimia, there must be low body weight where the BMI is <18 (Jain & Yilanli,
     2023).

     Clients with anorexia have an extreme fear of gaining weight and have disruptive issues with their body image that
     may be caused by cognitive distortions, or negatively biased errors in thinking patterns (Rnic et al., 2016). A type of
     distortion seen with eating disorders like anorexia is called thought-shape fusion, where there are altered beliefs
     about food, weight, and shape (Wyssen et al., 2017). For example, people with anorexia may change their estimates
     of how much they weigh or how big they are just because they thought about a particular food.

     Clients with anorexia may present with symptoms affecting several body systems. For example, a common symptom

seen with clients with anorexia is the presence of soft, fine hair that typically covers the face and back of newborns
called lanugo. It can be found on the skin of clients with anorexia and is caused by the body's attempt to conserve
heat during starvation (Mehler & Brown, 2015). Other symptoms associated with anorexia can be found in Table

TABLE 20.1 Symptoms Associated with Anorexia (Mehler & Brown, 2015; Kit Tan et al., 2022)

Risk Factors for Anorexia Nervosa

Anorexia nervosa most commonly affects persons AFAB aged thirteen to twenty-five and has a prevalence of
approximately 0.5 to 1 percent (Sim et al., 2010). The etiology of anorexia nervosa involves the complex interplay of
psychological, environmental, and genetic factors that are often precipitated by stressful life events during
adolescence or early adulthood (APA, 2023b). Having personality traits like perfectionism or being obsessive-
compulsive is associated with the development of anorexia nervosa and can increase the risk for developing the
eating disorder.

        CULTURAL CONTEXT

Anorexia Nervosa in Persons Assigned Male at Birth

Eating disorders are one of the most gendered mental health disorders, so eating disorders in persons assigned
male at birth (AMAB) were not recognized until recently (Gorrell & Murray, 2019). Anorexia nervosa has a lifetime
prevalence in persons AMAB of 0.1 to 0.3 percent in community-based samples, but though anorexia is more
commonly seen in persons assigned female at birth (AFAB) populations, it still affects persons AMAB populations
(Gorrell & Murray, 2019). Physiological differences in persons AMAB can affect the way that they present with
anorexia nervosa. For example, persons AMAB typically have less body fat with higher lean muscle mass, so protein
breakdown can occur more quickly in persons AMAB who have less weight loss, resulting in ketosis (Mehler &
Brown, 2015).

Persons AMAB can also present with findings like small testes, decreased sexual drive, and declines in testosterone
levels that may differ from common findings seen in persons AFAB. It is important to consider these factors when
caring for clients with eating disorders to ensure provision of inclusive care.
666  20 · Eating Disorders

     Genetics and Physiological Factors
     Anorexia nervosa is a complex eating disorder that involves several factors. Genetic factors, such as having a first-
     degree relative with anorexia nervosa and/or having a first-degree relative with a mental health disorder, have been
     found to be risk factors. Twin studies have also shown an increased risk of developing anorexia nervosa (APA,
     2023b). Paolacci et al. (2020) found a strong genetic component for anorexia nervosa due to gene sharing.
     Therefore, monozygotic twins who may share 100 percent of genetic material have a higher likelihood of developing
     anorexia than dizygotic twins.

     Social Factors
     There are several social factors associated with anorexia nervosa. Societal emphasis on being thin can place
     unreasonable standards related to body image that can lead to disordered eating. What is portrayed in the media
     plays an essential role in establishing beauty standards that promote thin bodies. This has been found to be a factor
     in body dissatisfaction that can lead to anorexia (Aparicio-Martinez et al., 2019).

     Negative beliefs about eating disorders can even occur with health-care providers like nurses. Body shaming can be
     detrimental to people with eating disorders, leading to challenges such as poor treatment compliance and low self-
     esteem (Brelet et al., 2021).

     A history of trauma has also been associated with the development of anorexia. The incidence of post-traumatic
     stress disorder in individuals with anorexia is estimated to be between 10 percent and 47 percent, indicating that
     traumatic experiences can be common with anorexia (Sjögren et al., 2023).

     Mental Health Comorbidities
     Clients with anorexia nervosa often have other comorbid mental health conditions. The DSM-5 lists several common
     conditions seen with anorexia nervosa that include bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive
     disorder, alcohol use disorder, and substance use disorder (APA, 2013b). Anxiety and obsessive disorders are also
     risk factors that increase the risk for developing anorexia nervosa in the first place (APA, 2013b).

     Nursing Care Planning

     Nurses can encounter clients with anorexia in various treatment settings, including psychiatric units for stabilization,
     or in the community. Nurse care planning for anorexia should focus on restoring body weight, replacing needed
     nutrition/electrolytes, and treating any underlying mental health issues to help establish a healthy relationship with
     food.

Nurses should be aware that anorexia nervosa can have life-threatening complications and has a high mortality rate.
Estimates show that 10 percent of people with anorexia nervosa die within ten years of its onset (Rikani et al.,
2013). Starvation and suicide are the two leading causes of death in people with anorexia nervosa (National
Institute of Mental Health [NIMH], 2023). Starvation can cause severe electrolyte imbalances in addition to
dehydration, renal dysfunction, and cardiac issues. Suicide is the second leading cause of death in anorexia nervosa
clients, so it is important to screen people with anorexia for suicidal thoughts (NIMH, 2023). Nurses can use tools
like the nineteen-item Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSI) to screen for suicide risk and measure the severity of
their ideations and/or plan (Andreotti et al., 2020). Nurses can also provide clients with crisis information that
includes the 988 and 911 emergency numbers.

Assessments
Early detection of anorexia nervosa is essential and screening tools can be helpful in identifying clients with this
eating disorder. Two common tools are the Sick Control One Fat and Food (SCOFF) questionnaire and the Eating
Disorder Diagnostic Scale (EDDS). The SCOFF is a five-item questionnaire used to screen for eating disorders and
has been proven to be effective in screening for anorexia nervosa (Kutz et al., 2020). It contains questions related to
beliefs about weight and overeating that can be helpful in assessing clients with anorexia. The EDDS is a twenty-
two-item self-report questionnaire that contains specific questions, using criteria from the DSM-5 to assess
symptoms of eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa. It has also been proven to be effective in evaluating
anorexia nervosa clients (Schaefer et al., 2019).

Interventions
Sometimes referred to as weight restoration, refeeding is the starting of oral intake for clients with anorexia. Enteral
or parenteral nutrition are not the first efforts unless the client is seriously ill or cannot tolerate oral intake.
Refeeding is accomplished with slow, measured meals, snacks, and fluids with careful monitoring and ongoing
emotional support. Clients may be physically uncomfortable consuming food during nutritional rehabilitation.
Hospitalization is necessary if medical monitoring is required. Clients who are malnourished are also at risk for
refeeding syndrome where rapid changes in their fluid volume and electrolytes cause complications like cardiac
arrhythmias, delirium, coma, and even death (Sim et al., 2010).

Psychological treatment can be effective in treating clients with anorexia nervosa. Specialist Supportive Clinical
Management (SSCM) and The Maudsley Anorexia Nervosa Treatment for Adults (MANTRA) are commonly used as
modalities (Costandache et al., 2023). SSCM is a treatment approach that involves both clinical management along
with supportive individual psychotherapy. MANTRA is a treatment approach where people with anorexia can be
supported by a therapist and other people with anorexia in a group setting.

Family-based therapies are considered first-line for children and adolescents with anorexia where the family takes
an active role to support the client's recovery (Sim et al., 2010). CBT has also been shown to be an effective
approach that involves exploring cognitive processes that influence behaviors.

Pharmacology
There are no FDA-approved medical treatments for anorexia nervosa. Medications used in anorexia nervosa help to
manage symptoms and other comorbidities. For example, SSRIs, like fluoxetine, can assist clients with anorexia
668  20 · Eating Disorders

     nervosa to manage underlying anxiety or depression. Antipsychotic medications like olanzapine may be used to
     promote weight gain and help manage obsessional thinking (Davis & Attia, 2017). Medications like laxitives can be
     used to manage symptoms of constipation, and potassium supplements can be used in clients with hypokalemia.
     Because clients with anorexia can have decreased bone density due to malnutrition, medications like alendronate
     can improve bone health (Davis & Attia, 2017). There is also promising research on using synthetic cannabinoid
     agonists like dronabinol to manage symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite (Davis & Attia, 2017).

     Client's Self-Help
     The use of online, guided self-help interventions has been studied with anorexia nervosa and has been found to be a
     feasible way to help clients with the disorder (Cardi et al., 2020). There are a variety of online options available, but
     all online tools are not created equally, so it's important to review sites to ensure that they are a good fit for the
     client. Evidence supports that personal guidance from an expert, such as a nurse, can help clients find the best self-
     help resources and increase compliance with interventions (Rohrbach et al., 2022). This may also be a way to reach
     out to those who are suffering with anorexia nervosa but may be reluctant to seek care. The National Eating
     Disorders Association provides information on eating disorders, including treatment options, support opportunities,
     and screening tools to assess risk (NEDA, 2023a).

     Nursing Implications

     Nurses play a vital role in managing clients with anorexia nervosa. Clients who are severely malnourished are at risk
     for fatal complications that the nurse must quickly assess. Nurses in the outpatient setting can help screen and
     assess clients for eating disorders and determine if they need additional evaluation or interventions. The American
     Psychological Association provides an interactive screening/assessment tool for eating disorders that can be used in
     clinical decision making (APA, 2023a). Nurses caring for clients in the treatment setting will closely monitor for
     things like refeeding syndrome, cardiac arrhythmias, and other complications that can occur in clients with anorexia
     nervosa. Suicide risk is also high in clients with anorexia, so nurses must be sure to assess for suicidal ideations.

             LINK TO LEARNING

     The American Psychiatric Association provides clinical practice guidelines, screening tools, and a toolkit
     (https://openstax.org/r/77APAeating) that can be used to assess eating disorders.

     Therapeutic Relationship
     Establishing a therapeutic relationship with clients with anorexia nervosa is essential to help facilitate their recovery
     and provide support. The nurse must establish an alliance with the client to confront the disease process. Lev Ari et
     al. (2024) and Hartley et al. (2022) acknowledged the therapeutic relationship is key to the best outcomes in mental
     health care. Nurses can establish a therapeutic relationship by establishing rapport with the client, being
     nonjudgmental, and ensuring that they are competently implementing interventions to help improve the clients'
     health status and provide client-centered care.

     Nurses' reactions can affect therapeutic relationships with clients who suffer from eating disorders like anorexia. It
     may be difficult and even frustrating for nurses to care for complex clients with anorexia who engage in self-
     starvation that can lead to fatal complications. It is important for nurses to provide nonjudgmental care and to
     adequately assess each client's mental health status. An example of providing nonjudgmental care can be when a
     client with anorexia who appears emaciated talks about the desire to lose more weight. Instead of telling the client
     that they do not need to lose weight, nurses can encourage them to talk about their feelings related to their weight.
     An essential part of recovery from anorexia is receiving support that includes managing comorbid mental health
     conditions like anxiety and depression along with body image issues. It is important for nurses to remember that
     anorexia nervosa involves an abnormal disturbance in attitudes and behaviors related to food so these clients will
     need support to help reorder their thought processes and behaviors to healthy patterns.

     Nurse Mentoring
     Finding support from colleagues through nurse mentorship has been proven to be effective in increasing nurse
     competence in managing clients with complex health conditions (Hookmani et al., 2021). Nurses with experience
     managing clients with eating disorders can offer knowledge and demonstrate skills to other nurses who may have

less experience to help increase their competence. For example, preceptors can provide their clinical experience on
how to manage clients with eating disorders. Nurse educators who teach about eating disorders can mentor nurses
working with these clients and provide current and relevant information.

Milieu Management
The American Nurses Association's essential standards for psychiatric nursing includes the responsibility of nurses
to maintain a therapeutic milieu for clients to help aid in their recovery (Belsiyal et al., 2022). Milieu therapy involves
clients practicing everyday activities like eating, in a structured environment that is facilitated by the nurse.
Providing a safe, structured, healing environment can be beneficial for clients with anorexia who may need to
implement behavioral changes to help restore their health.

Safe Environment
Treatment of eating disorders can require different levels of care ranging from community treatment, day programs,
residential facilities, or hospitalization (Peckmezian & Paxton, 2020). Clients with severe complications from
anorexia nervosa may require hospital care. They may deprive themselves of food and nutrients and engage in
purging that can lead to severe malnutrition and starvation that can be fatal. These clients are also at high risk for
suicide, so it is important to help maintain a safe environment, both in a treatment setting, and, in the community
(NIMH, 2023). Clients should be screened for suicide risk, followed by the implementation of interventions to
ensure safety, such as removing harmful objects that can be used for self-harm, providing one-on-one care for
clients at high risk, and having clients at high risk monitored carefully. Behaviors that need to be watched for in
suicidal clients include self-injurious behaviors, like cutting, reporting suicidal thoughts, and attempting suicide
(Mereu et al., 2022). At discharge, it is important that clients are provided with resources to help them if they have
suicidal thoughts. Transitional and residential treatment options are also available to manage clients who are at risk
for self-harm.

Delegation
Caring for clients with anorexia requires teamwork. Delegation of tasks by nurses is essential to providing quality
care and can help decrease the workload. Tasks like obtaining weight and vital signs can be delegated to assistive
personnel. This can allow more time for the nurse to focus on tasks like medication administration and care
planning. Nurses can also coach assistive personnel on providing nonjudgmental care by showing compassion.

20.3 Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Differentiate between anorexia nervosa and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder
    · Plan nursing care for clients in treatment for avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder

Formery known as feeding disorder of infancy and childhood, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is
a newer eating disorder characterized as a disturbance with eating or feeding where nutritional or energy needs are
continuously not met (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], 2016) and may be
present into adulthood. The DSM-5 provides three ways that clients present with ARFID: sensory sensitivity, low
appetite/interest in foods, or avoidance due to trauma (Thomas et al., 2017). Clients with sensory sensitivity may
avoid certain foods like meats and fruits due to texture while clients with low appetite or interest may restrict food
due to not feeling hungry or interested in the foods. Clients who have experienced trauma with eating may avoid
specific food(s) that caused the problem.

It is important to note that ARFID is more than being a picky eater. It is characterized by restriction of food that can
lead to issues with growth and development along with significant deficiencies that can affect the client's health
(Thomas et al., 2017). ARFID can lead to a complication like a nutritional deficiency where there is a reduction in
essential nutrients needed to maintain adequate bodily functions. Common nutrient deficiencies seen in ARFID
include zinc, potassium, iron, and vitamins C, K, and multiple B vitamins (Bialek-Dratwa et al., 2022). In some cases,
clients with ARFID may require artificial nutrition to meet their nutritional needs. Clients with ARFID can present
with symptoms that include significant weight loss, abdominal pain, and other gastrointestinal issues (NIMH, 2023).
670  20 · Eating Disorders

     Comparison with Anorexia Nervosa

     ARFID and anorexia are eating disorders that have similarities and differences. They both involve restriction of food
     that can lead to unmet nutritional or energy needs of the body and are characterized by low body weight. Both
     ARFID and anorexia can cause vitamin deficiencies that can become severe and require medical intervention. On
     the other hand, anorexia typically affects adolescents and young adults, and while ARFID can occur during these
     times, it is also seen in infancy and early childhood. Anorexia also includes issues with body image. ARFID does not
     involve disturbances with body image and typically involves sensory sensitivity, low appetite/interest in food, and/or
     avoidance due to food-related experiences. In other words, the psychological drivers of the behaviors differ
     between the two eating disorders.

     Psychological Drivers of Behaviors
     Though the etiology of ARFID is unknown, the disrupted eating behaviors seen with ARFID can have psychological
     influences (Brigham et al., 2018). Mental health disorders such as anxiety, autism spectrum disorder, obsessive-
     compulsive disorders, and attention-deficit disorder have been found to increase the risk for behaviors associated
     with ARFID (APA, 2023b). For example, if a client has anxiety and has a bad experience with a food (i.e., a stressful
     event that took place while eating a certain food), they may worry about and avoid eating that particular food again.
     Another example is with individuals with autism spectrum disorders. They may have sensory sensitivity issues and
     strict behaviors related to eating (APA, 2023b). If these behaviors become extreme, they can lead to the disordered
     eating seen in ARFID.

     The avoidance of food seen in ARFID may be due to a history of trauma related to food. Individuals who have had
     negative experiences with food like vomiting or choking may ultimately avoid or restrict food (APA, 2023b). They
     may avoid the food or foods that caused the negative experience and even avoid other foods that are similar
     (Brigham et al., 2018).

     Nursing Care

     Nurses play an important role in caring for clients with ARFID, including obtaining a thorough history from clients
     who present with symptoms of ARFID. Questions related to eating habits, food aversions, and history of traumatic
     experiences related to food should take place along with an assessment of nutritional status. Severe cases of
     malnutrition may include lanugo, also seen with anorexia nervosa. Other symptoms can include bradycardia,
     hypothermia, pallor, orthostatic tachycardia, and hypotension, which require prompt medical attention (Brigham et
     al., 2018). In addition to developing and nurturing the therapeutic relationship, nursing care may include managing
     severe symptoms along with nutritional replacements to reverse vitamin deficiencies.

     Age-Specific Treatment
     Treatment for ARFID varies based on the age of the client being treated and should be age appropriate. Young
     children with nutritional deficiencies are often treated with oral formula supplements, tube feedings, and intensive
     behavior therapies (Thomas et al., 2017). Though there are no FDA-approved medications for ARFID, off-label use
     of medications has shown efficacy in infants and young children with ARFID. Studies in children ages seven months
     to six years old have revealed benefits from medications like cyproheptadine to increase appetite (Brigham et al.,
     2018). Other medications, such as mirtazapine and olanzapine, have also been used to promote weight gain in
     children. Children also benefit from cognitive behavioral therapies and behavioral interventions to help stabilize
     their weight (Thomas et al., 2017).

     Collaborative Care and Partnership with Family
     A collaborative approach works best for clients with ARFID. Nurses will work with other key members of the health-
     care team, including dietitians, therapists, clinicians, and behavioral specialists. The collaborative team will work
     together with the client and/or their family to restore health.

     Partnering with families to treat individuals with ARFID is important because ARFID can disrupt family interactions.
     Partnering with the client's families in care planning and decision making, called family-based care, is a treatment
     approach that can be effective. With ARFID, the parents typically take control of their child's eating and work with a
     therapist to help decrease disrupted eating behaviors and restore healthy weight. Family-based therapies have been
     effective with eating disorders, including ARFID (Bialek-Dratwa et al., 2022).

Behavioral Therapies
Behavioral therapies can be effective in managing ARFID. Food chaining is a behavioral feeding method that aims to
broaden a client's food selections by introducing safe foods that are similar to avoided foods (Bialek-Dratwa et al.,
2022). Young children may also benefit from play therapy to help introduce new foods. Play therapy has been found
to help reduce anxiety and help prepare the child for the food that will be eaten (Bialek-Dratwa et al., 2022). The
Feeling and Body Investigators is another behavioral therapy that is used with ARFID. This modality involves
exposure therapy that focuses on reframing negative body sensations (Bialek-Dratwa et al., 2022).

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
CBT is an effective modality for treating individuals with ARFID. There are various forms of CBT that are used with
ARFID, but most contain elements like consistent eating, exposure to prevent negative responses, relaxation
training, and monitoring food intake (Thomas et al., 2018). An example of a CBT for ARFID is the CBT-AR. It has four
stages that involve psychoeducation about ARFID and its impact on health: regular eating, which involves creating
meal plans with a variety of foods; exposure therapy, which means gradually having individuals try avoided foods
and food situations; coping skills training; and relapse prevention (Thomas et al., 2018).

This webinar discusses cognitive behavioral therapy (https://openstax.org/r/77ARFIDinfo) used for ARFID. It
describes its uses for clients ages ten to older adults and clinical practice information along with ongoing treatment
of ARFID.

Dialectal Behavior Therapy
DBT can be effective in managing eating disorders like ARFID (Reilly et al., 2020). DBT is a psychotherapy modality
that provides skills to help cope with strong emotions and can be modified to focus on disrupted eating behaviors,
food intake, and nutritional skills (Pennell et al., 2019).

Goals of Treatment
The goals of treatment for ARFID are to restore nutritional balance, stabilize weight, and modify disrupted eating
behaviors and thought processes. Restore nutritional balance by monitoring lab values like electrolytes, blood
count, and metabolic function. Abnormalities in essential nutrients values may require nutritional replacement.
Weight stabilization may require nutritional supplements to help restore weight. Modifying disrupted eating
behaviors and thought processes will involve a collaborative effort of nurses working with members of the health-
care team, the client, and their family to establish healthy eating behaviors.

20.4 Bulimia Nervosa

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · List risk factors associated with bulimia nervosa
    · Plan nursing care for clients in treatment for bulimia nervosa
    · Discuss nursing implications for the therapeutic relationship in care of clients diagnosed with bulimia

        nervosa

Recurrent episodes of binge eating that are followed by behaviors to prevent weight gain like purging is called
bulimia nervosa (APA, 2023b). It occurs most often in adolescent females with an estimated prevalence of 0.5
percent to 1.5 percent in the United States (Jain & Yilanli, 2023). Individuals with bulimia shift from calorie
restriction to binge eating where they consume large amounts of food in a short period of time. During binges, there
is a loss of control, and the portions are larger than most people would consume in the same time frame. The
episodes of binging are followed by recurrent weight control measures that can include extreme exercise, fasting,
purging, or abuse of laxatives and diuretics (Jain & Yilanli, 2023). This cycle of out-of-control consumption of large
amounts of food in a short period of time followed by methods to prevent weight gain is also known as a binge-
purge cycle.
672  20 · Eating Disorders

     Risk Factors for and Etiology of Bulimia

     Though bulimia is seen in females and males, it is significantly more common in females. The median age of the
     onset of bulimia is around twelve (Jain & Yilanli, 2023). The etiology of bulimia is unknown, but it is thought to
     include several biological, psychological, environmental, and temperamental factors that can predispose individuals
     to bulimia. Alterations in the brain structure and function have been found to contribute to binging behaviors (Jain &
     Yilanli, 2023).

     Biological Factors
     Biology is thought to play a significant role in the development of bulimia. Puberty and childhood obesity increase
     the risk for bulimia nervosa, and childhood physical and sexual abuse also lead to an increase in incidence (APA,
     2023b). Appetite has been known to be a factor in bulimia. Studies of appetite hormones like ghrelin and leptin in
     bulimic clients have shown dysregulated levels that may contribute to symptoms seen in bulimia (Presseller et al.,
     2021).

     Addiction is also associated with bulimia. Studies have shown biological similarities between people with bulimia
     and people with drug addiction; food and illicit drugs both have the same pleasurable effects on neurons in the brain
     (di Giacomo et al., 2022). The binge eating behaviors seen in bulimia follow a similar pattern to addictive behaviors
     seen in substance misuse. Substance use disorder may be seen with eating disorders with increased associations
     reported in individuals with bulimia (Gregorowski et al., 2013).

             REAL RN STORIES

     Nurse: Andrea P.
     Clinical Setting: Psychiatric unit
     Geographic Location: Saskatchewan, Canada

     Andrea is a psychiatric nurse in Canada who battled with bulimia nervosa for sixteen years. Andrea's bulimia began
     in ninth grade before a trip to Hawaii where she reports that she began starving herself to look better in her bikini.
     After the trip, her disordered eating persisted and was influenced by a friend who she found in a bathroom purging.
     She would wake up obsessing over food and would purge after her binges. As her bulimia worsened, she admitted to
     purging up to ten times a day and hiding her eating behaviors from her spouse. She was consumed with feelings of
     overwhelming guilt after her binges and reports feeling a loss of control over her eating. Her husband discovered
     that she had issues with eating after finding a hidden bag of vomit one day, and he encouraged her to get help. She
     recovered after three admissions to a center for eating disorders, but still has dental complications from her years of
     purging. She has veneers on four of her teeth from tooth decay and now calls herself a nonactive bulimic.

     Social Factors
     There are several social factors associated with bulimia. Temperamental factors like low self-esteem, social anxiety,
     and depressive symptoms can increase the risk for bulimia (APA, 2023b). Individuals with bulimia also tend to
     engage in their binge eating behaviors in isolation, which could lead to social withdrawal (Hadad & Knackstedt,
     2014). The individual with bulimia may experience such strong emotion that they impulsively binge eat to find
     comfort. The loss of control that individuals with bulimia experience during binge eating and purging episodes
     demonstrates issues with impulse control (Howard et al., 2020).

     Mental Health Comorbidities
     Mental health disorders are common in individuals with bulimia. In adolescents, the most frequently seen comorbid
     mental health conditions were mood and anxiety disorders (Hail & Le Grange, 2018). Adolescents with bulimia also
     have the highest levels of suicide attempts (Hail & Le Grange, 2018) of all of the eating disorders. The DSM-5 lists
     depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, borderline personality disorder, and anxiety disorders as mental health
     conditions that have the highest rates of comorbidity with bulimia; these conditions can either precede the bulimia,
     occur simultaneously, or can develop shortly after (APA, 2023b). Substances like stimulants may be used to control
     appetite, and alcohol use is also reported to be higher in individuals with bulimia (APA, 2023b). Individuals with
     bulimia may use laxatives to promote weight loss; in fact, some studies found laxative abuse in as many as 56
     percent of people with eating disorders (Addiction Center, 2023).

TABLE 20.2 Nursing Care Plan for Client with Bulimia

Bulimia Nervosa--Purging Type
Some individuals with bulimia use compensatory measures like purging to prevent weight gain after they binge.
Though self-induced vomiting is the most common method used, purging can also include laxative and diuretic
overuse (APA, 2023b). These individuals are more at risk for fluid and electrolyte imbalances due to dehydration
that can be caused by recurrent purging.

Assessing dental health in clients with bulimia is important because repeated purging can cause complications.
Dental erosions are common with chronic vomiting due to the acidity of vomit (Nitsch et al., 2021). Frequent purging
can also cause trauma to the oral cavity from coming in contact with acidic vomit or from methods used to induce
vomiting like inserting objects in the mouth. It is important for nurses to ask questions related to dental hygiene to
assess oral health.

Bulimia Nervosa--Nonpurging Type
There are several nonpurging behaviors that are seen in bulimia to compensate for binge eating. Enemas, thyroid
hormone, and excessive exercising are a few nonpurging behaviors that individuals with bulimia may use to control
weight gain (APA, 2023b). Individuals who have diabetes mellitus may also manipulate insulin to control weight gain
after binges. The client may typically reduce or withhold insulin in an attempt to decrease the metabolism of the
excessive food consumed during a binge (APA, 2023b). This can lead to diabetes-related ketoacidosis, which can
progress to diabetic coma, and even death from cerebral edema.

Life-Threatening Complications
Bulimia nervosa can lead to life-threatening complications that require immediate nursing intervention. The most
common cause of morbidity and mortality seen with bulimia is a result of complications from electrolyte and
metabolic disturbances (Nitsch et al., 2021). In addition, other common life-threatening complications of bulimia
include:

· Suicide: Suicide risk is high in clients with bulimia, particularly adolescents.
· Esophageal rupture: Esophageal rupture can occur from forceful stomach contraction with repeated vomiting.

   If bleeding is severe, it can lead to death if not promptly treated.
· Cardiac arrhythmia: Hypokalemia from purging and stimulant abuse can cause prolongation of the QT interval,
674  20 · Eating Disorders

             increasing the risk for life-threatening arrhythmias.

     Criteria for Hospitalization
     Most individuals with bulimia are normal weight or overweight, making it difficult to detect compared with anorexia
     and ARFID (Nitsch et al., 2021). Though weight is often not an issue in clients with bulimia, they can have several
     medical complications. Bulimia has significantly increased mortality rates from these medical complications that
     can affect many body systems. The complications occur as a result of repeated purging and laxative abuse that
     cause electrolyte disturbances, metabolic abnormalities, and other physiological complications (Nitsch et al., 2021)
     (Table 20.3).

     Interventions
     There are multiple interventions used to manage bulimia. These interventions include stabilizing nutritional status,

interrupting maladaptive behaviors, assessing and managing complications, managing medication, and
psychotherapy (Nitsch et al., 2021). These interventions involve a collaborative team approach from multiple
disciplines in addition to nurses, depending on the needs of the client. For example, a dietitian will work closely with
all clients with bulimia, but if the client is having a complication like hypokalemia, a cardiology clinician may manage
their cardiac condition. Other examples of nursing interventions that can be used to manage bulimia include:

    · monitoring meals and ensuring that purging behaviors are not performed one hour after meals
    · providing small frequent meals
    · teaching coping skills to help manage emotions related to bulimia
    · identifying the clients' strengths to help increase their self-esteem

Psychotherapy
Cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy are two psychotherapeutic modalities that have
demonstrated efficacy for bulimia (Jain & Yilanli, 2023). Cognitive behavioral therapy is used to help change
maladaptive thinking patterns and behaviors that can help with disrupted eating patterns. Interpersonal therapy
aims to improve interpersonal and social factors that may contribute to the behaviors seen with bulimia.

        CLINICAL SAFETY AND PROCEDURES (QSEN)

Competencies and Interventions for Bulimia

The six QSEN competencies developed for nursing programs are important to consider when working with
individuals with bulimia.

QSEN Competency       Examples of Nursing Interventions

Client-centered care  Assess the client's vital signs and labs to evaluate for physiological complications.
                      Educate the client on healthy eating behaviors.

Teamwork &            Collaborate with other disciplines involved in the client's plan of care, like dietitians and
collaboration         psychiatrists.
                      Delegate appropriate tasks to other personnel. For example, a nurse's assistant can
                      help check vitals.

Evidence-based        Provide evidence-based resources to clients to educate them on bulimia.
practice (EBP)        Attend continuing education nursing activities on bulimia to stay up to date on the
                      latest evidence-based practices.

Quality improvement   Assess processes in place related to caring for clients with bulimia and help to create
                      solutions to improve client care.

Safety                Assess clients with bulimia for suicidal thoughts using screening tools.
                      Implement needed precautions for clients at high risk for suicide, like one-on-one
                      supervision.

Informatics           Use clinical tools to help monitor the clients' vitals and document them in the
                      electronic medical record.

Pharmacology
Pharmacological interventions have been well-studied with bulimia and have proven to be effective in managing
symptoms of individuals with bulimia (Davis & Attia, 2017). The two most common classes of medications used are
antidepressants and antiepileptic medications. Fluoxetine is the most commonly prescribed antidepressant and the
only one approved by the FDA for bulimia nervosa (Davis & Attia, 2017). It has been found to significantly help
676  20 · Eating Disorders

     reduce binging and purging episodes. There are several other antidepressants that are also used for bulimia off-
     label, or they may be used to manage any comorbid depression or anxiety. It is important to note that bupropion, a
     common antidepressant used to manage depression, is specifically contraindicated in treating bulimia due to its
     seizure risks. Antidepressants also carry a warning related to increased suicide risk in adolescents, so it is important
     to monitor clients on antidepressants closely (Davis & Attia, 2017).

     Antiepileptic medications are used in the treatment of bulimia due to their effect on binging and purging (Davis &
     Attia, 2017). Topiramate is a common antiepileptic medication that helps reduce binging and purging episodes. It
     must be used with caution with clients who have low body weight because it can also cause significant weight loss
     (Davis & Attia, 2017).

     Client's Self-Help
     Self-help can be effective in bulimia treatment. There is a known treatment gap in those diagnosed with bulimia and
     those being treated routinely for the disorder (Hartmann et al., 2022). Clients may prefer to access resources on
     their own to help manage their eating disorder. Other factors like stigma, shame, guilt, and poor motivation have
     also been found to be barriers to individuals with bulimia seeking care (Hartmann et al., 2022). Studies have shown
     that web-based self-help interventions can effectively help reduce symptoms seen in bulimia. These interventions
     often incorporate cognitive behavioral therapies in an online format.

     Nursing Implications

     Nurses will encounter clients with bulimia who require intervention. Assessing these clients for disordered eating
     habits and any purging behaviors is important. It is also imperative to screen for suicide. Physical assessment will
     include height, weight, and vital signs along with labs measuring metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities. These
     clients may have other nursing assessments that reveal ineffective coping or chronic low self-esteem that will
     require care planning to achieve treatment goals.

     Therapeutic Relationship
     Individuals with bulimia can have feelings of shame and guilt related to their disorder. They may have issues with
     self-esteem, depression, and impulse control that may cause them to be reluctant to seek care. It is important to
     show compassion for these clients and build a therapeutic relationship to facilitate their recovery.

     Nurses' reactions to clients with bulimia will vary. Disordered eating and purging behaviors may seem very abnormal
     to nurses caring for them. Some clients may report purging several times a day or taking very large quantities of
     laxatives to prevent weight gain. It is important for nurses to show empathy and to be nonjudgmental in their
     interactions with these clients to help facilitate a therapeutic relationship.

     Safe Environment
     Like anorexia, clients with bulimia are also at high risk for suicide. It is essential to provide a safe environment for
     these clients and to screen for suicide risk. For clients at high risk, implement safety interventions to prevent self-
     harm and provide crisis information. Hospitalization can provide opportunities for group work and behavior
     modification therapies in a supportive environment.

accompanied by significant lack of control of eating is called binge eating disorder (BED) (APA, 2013). It is the most
common eating disorder in the United States and affects approximately 1.25 percent of adult persons AFAB, 0.42
percent of adult persons AMAB, and 1.6 percent of all teens (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases [NIDDK], 2021). Individuals who binge tend to eat even when they are full or not hungry and may also feel
shame or guilt after eating. They exhibit control issues where they consume large amounts of food and have the
inability to stop eating. Binge eating recently became categorized as an eating disorder in the DSM-5 after it was
formerly recognized as an eating disorder not otherwise specified (APA, 2013).

Comparison with Bulimia Nervosa and Driving Factors behind BED

Bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder can present in similar fashions. In both disorders, there is a loss of
control that can occur with food during binge eating episodes. There are also repeated episodes of eating large
quantities of food in a short period of time.

Bulimia versus Binge Eating Disorder
The major difference between the two is that there are no repeated purging behaviors that occur in binge eating
disorder. Some people with binge eating disorder may occasionally try strategies to prevent weight gain but not on a
regular basis (NIDDK, 2021). These clients tend to be overweight from excess consumption of calories versus
clients with bulimia who may be normal weight.

Psychological, Emotional, and Social Drivers of Behaviors
Psychological drivers can play an important role in the behaviors seen with binge eating disorders. Alterations in
impulse control are thought to be central to BED, including dysfunctions related to emotion regulation and reward
processing (Giel et al., 2022); stress is a common prompt for binge eating episodes.

Other drivers associated with BED include being teased about weight, issues with weight, and body dissatisfaction
(Giel et al., 2022). For example, individuals from families that are highly critical of a child's weight and/or size are at
increased risk for developing BED (NIDDK, 2021). Adverse childhood experiences have also been associated with
BED.

        PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Social Factors Contributing to Binge Eating Disorder

There are several social factors that have been associated with BED. Though BED is prevalent in all socioeconomic
groups, it affects certain populations more than others. People who have experienced events like violence, trauma,
or poverty are at an increased risk for developing BED (Giel et al., 2022). Factors like race, ethnicity, and sexual
orientation also affect risk for BED. Studies have shown higher prevalence in Black and Latinx populations along with
sexual minorities (Giel et al., 2022). Stigma and stereotypes may play a role in the disparities seen with BED, so it is
important to promote awareness and adequately screen clients for BED.

Risk for Medical Comorbidities
Clients with BED are at risk for medical comorbidities. The most common medical comorbidities seen with BED are
obesity, hypertension, arthritis, high cholesterol, cardiac conditions, diabetes, smoking, sleep issues, and metabolic
syndrome (Giel et al., 2022). The increase in these medical comorbidities also increases morbidity and mortality.
Being obese increases the risk of health-related problems like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers
(NIDDK, 2021).

Nursing Care

Nurses may encounter clients with BED due to medical complications or attempts to lose weight. Studies have
shown that about 50 percent of individuals with BED seek help for their condition and may have barriers related to
stigma and shame (Giel et al., 2022). Another barrier to seeking care can include not being aware that they have an
eating disorder, so awareness of BED is important. Nursing care for these clients should include an accurate
assessment using validated screening tools like the SCOFF questionnaire. Other useful tools are the Eating Attitudes
Test (EAT) and the Questionnaire on Eating and Weight patterns (QEWP-R). EAT is a twenty-six-question test used to
screen for disordered eating and QEWP-R is a five-question tool used to screen for BED based on diagnostic criteria.
678  20 · Eating Disorders

     The physical exam should include vital signs and height and weight measurements. Since clients with binge eating
     disorder can have high BMIs, nurses may need access to scales with large weight capacities. These clients may also
     require blood sugar monitoring in addition to labs due to their risk of diabetes.

     Treatment Interventions
     Nursing interventions will focus on weight loss, treating comorbid conditions, avoiding medical complications, and
     increasing the client's self-esteem. It may be easier to manage eating behaviors and portions in a controlled
     environment like in the hospital setting and the client must be encouraged to transition toward self-care. Education
     and resources to provide discharge support are essential to ensure that clients can continue to make progress. This
     support may include arranging follow-up care and referrals in the community, providing appropriate contacts for
     routine care and for emergencies, reviewing medications, and reviewing healthy lifestyles.

     Children and Adolescents
     Children and adolescents may not be diagnosed with BED but may exhibit issues with control of eating (Giel et al.,
     2022). This makes diagnosing pediatric populations a challenge because they may not meet the full criteria due to
     limitations or restrictions regarding food access. Currently, there are no specific guidelines on managing BED in
     pediatric populations and studies related to treatment are lacking.

     Psychotherapy and Behavioral Modifications
     Psychotherapy is first-line treatment for BED and can include modalities like CBT, IPT, and DBT (Giel et al., 2022).
     CBT helps to restructure maladaptive cognitive processes that lead to overeating, such as low self-esteem. Self-
     help CBT programs that focus on regular eating behaviors, self-control, and problem-solving have also been
     effective in managing BED (Iqbal & Rehman, 2022). IPT can explore interpersonal function and issues with self-
     esteem while DBT can be used to help regulate emotions and improve distress responses (Giel et al., 2022).

     Behavioral therapies that focus on diet therapy and physical activity have been proven to be effective in treating
     BED. Diet therapy is used to promote weight loss and includes calorie restrictions, meal planning, and controlling
     eating behaviors (Amianto et al., 2015). Physical activity is used with caution in clients with medical complications
     but can be a useful adjunct to diet therapy in stable clients. Physical activity can help promote weight loss and
     improve mood and overall health (Amianto et al., 2015).

     Pharmacology
     Lisdexamfetamine is the only FDA-approved medication for BED on the market in the United States. It has been
     shown to help decrease binge eating and decrease body weight by up to 6 percent (Giel et al., 2022).
     Lisdexamfetamine is a controlled medication that should be used with caution due to its potential for abuse.

     Other medications that have been used to treat BED include SSRIs, antiepileptics medications, stimulants, and
     weight loss medications. SSRIs like fluoxetine have been shown to reduce bingeing; it is the most commonly
     prescribed SSRI due to its efficacy with bulimia (Amianto et al., 2015). Antiepileptics like topiramate decrease
     hunger and stimulants like atomoxetine also decrease bingeing and promote weight loss (Amianto et al., 2015).
     Phentermine is another stimulant used for weight loss but must be used with caution because of adverse
     cardiovascular effects that can occur. Medications used for weight loss like orlistat, in combination with a low-
     calorie diet, can be effective in helping with weight loss but are not helpful for reducing binge eating (Amianto et al.,
     2015).

     Surgical Interventions
     Severe obesity in individuals with BED can be treated with bariatric surgery. Severe obesity is defined as clients with
     a BMI of >40 or >35 with comorbid conditions (Amianto et al., 2015). Bariatric surgery is controversial for clients
     with BED because it is usually contraindicated in clients with an eating disorder diagnosis. Clinical data and research
     have shown that it can be effective in BED treatment when it is done in conjunction with psychological interventions
     and follow-up care (Amianto et al., 2015).

     Collaborative Care
     BED is a complex eating disorder that requires collaboration from multiple disciplines during care planning. Nurses
     will play a key role in assessing these clients and implementing interventions from the care plan, such as medication
     management and health education. Assistive personnel will be essential in completing tasks delegated from the
     nurse like taking vital signs, passing food trays, and weighing clients. Clients at high risk for suicide may be

monitored one-on-one by assistive personnel with frequent assessments by the nurse. Psychiatry and psychology
professionals may help manage the disordered thought processes that occur with binge eating. Cardiology or
endocrinology professionals may be part of the team if there are medical complications like diabetes or cardiac
issues. Nutritionists may also help manage diet therapy and meal planning. A collaborative effort may result in more
positive outcomes for the client.

The Therapeutic Relationship and Binge Eating Disorder
Clients with BED often feel a lot of shame and guilt about their condition making a therapeutic relationship an
essential part of their care. In addition to providing compassionate, nonjudgmental care, it is important for nurses to
be patient and flexible. Clients with BED may lack motivation or have physical limitations due to obesity that may
make it difficult to complete tasks. Be flexible with therapeutic efforts and add treatment strategies one at a time to
help with satisfaction and compliance (Amianto et al., 2015).

20.6 Pica

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Discuss the etiology of pica
    · Identify conditions that are associated with pica
    · Summarize the treatment options for pica
    · Describe nursing considerations for clients with pica

The eating disorder in which an individual repeatedly and compulsively consumes nonfood items that lack
nutritional value is called pica (Stiegler, 2005). Items defined as nonfood are those that lack nutritional value.
Common nonfood items consumed by people with pica include paint chips, clay, charcoal, metal, hair, soap, paper,
chalk, metal, or small stones (APA, 2023a). Some individuals with pica have cravings for ice. A craving is an intense
desire for something.

It is important to note that pica does not include culturally or socially accepted practices. It also is important to note
that small children commonly place nonfood items in their mouth and that this is not considered pica. For these
reasons, pica is not diagnosed in the presence of accepted social or cultural practices or in children under the age of
two.

Etiology of Pica

Though the cause of pica is unknown, there are a few suspected etiologies. Studies have shown associations
between pica and factors such as stress, child abuse/neglect, and vitamin/mineral deficiencies (Al Nasser et al.,
2023). Iron deficiency anemia is a common proposed etiology; it is thought that the deficiency may modify enzymes
in the brain and cause cravings for items such as clay, laundry starch, and ice. In the alternative, eating these items
may alter the client's experience of the deficiency (Advani et al., 2014). Evidence to support these etiologies varies,
and more research is needed to explore the cause of pica.

Behavioral Factors Associated with Other Conditions
Behavioral factors have been associated with an increased risk of developing pica. Behavioral factors seen in
individuals with autism and intellectual differences that can contribute to developing pica include sensory seeking
behaviors, automatic reinforcement, and seeking attention from caregivers (Fields et al., 2021). Maladaptive eating
behaviors are also commonly seen in clients with schizophrenia and are also associated with developing pica.
Clients with schizophrenia may ingest nonfood items, including feces (Khosravi, 2021).

Acculturated Behaviors
There are relevant cultural factors associated with pica. In some cultures, consumption of nonfood items are
socially accepted practices or social norms. For example, in parts of India, mud eating is culturally accepted and
cravings for items like ash and dust are said to help predict the gender of an unborn child (Bhatia, 2014). Other
examples are certain tribes in Peru who consume clay for health benefits and some cultures in Africa who eat soil
during pregnancy and postpartum for health and spiritual benefits (Bhatia, 2014). The most common substances
consumed by various cultures are soil and raw starches (Chung et al., 2019). These culturally accepted practices are
not considered pica, so it is important to conduct a cultural assessment when evaluating clients who are suspected
680  20 · Eating Disorders

     to have this disorder.

     Learned/Reinforced Behaviors
     Learned behaviors can play a role in the development of pica. For example, if a child grows up in a home where
     everyone eats ice or nonfood items, they may continue this learned behavior. Pica may also be a learned or
     reinforced behavior done in response to a stressor and used as a way to self-soothe (Liu et al., 2021).

     Conditions Associated with Pica

     Consumption of nonfood items can have sequelae, such as dental damage, toxicity, infection, parasites, or
     gastrointestinal blockage. Thorough medical and nursing assessment should identify client needs and focus the
     care. Problematic conditions may arise before determining that pica is the cause.

     Nutritional Deficiencies
     Pica has been associated with nutritional deficiencies. Deficiencies in minerals such as iron, zinc, and calcium are
     thought to cause cravings for nonfood items (Chung et al., 2019). The problem with consumption of certain nonfood
     items is that they can worsen these nutritional deficiencies. For example, consumption of clay and starch can bind to
     iron in the gastrointestinal tract and worsen iron deficiency anemia (Advani et al., 2014).

     Medical/Pregnancy
     Pica can develop during pregnancy. Though the prevalence is unknown, it estimated in a metanalysis to occur in
     approximately 28 percent of persons during pregnancy and the postpartum period (Liu et al., 2021). Pica is a great
     concern during pregnancy due to the risk that it poses to the fetus. Consumption of nonfood items like clay or paint
     chips can be toxic to the developing fetus. It can also lead to complications such as lead poisoning, which has been
     associated with chronic neurological complications and motor function delays in children (Al Nasser et al., 2023).

     Iron deficiency anemia is associated with pica and is also seen in pregnant persons. Other people at risk for iron
     deficiency anemia include premenopausal menstruating persons, and frequent blood donors (Liu et al., 2021).
     Because these populations have a higher occurrence of iron deficiency anemia, the incidence of pica is also seen
     more in these groups. Individuals with iron deficiency anemia often consume large amounts of ice, known as
     pagophagia. Pagophagia is the most common form of pica in the United States and can lead to complications like
     dental injuries (Liu et al., 2021). It is important to note that pica is only diagnosed in pregnancy if the consumption
     of the nonfood item poses harm or risk. If there are no medical risks associated with the consumption of the
     nonfood item, the client may not require clinical care for this behavior (APA, 2023b).

     Mental Health
     There are several mental health conditions frequently seen with pica. Pica is commonly seen in individuals with
     intellectual disabilities and mental health disorders, such as schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD),
     and trichotillomania (Al Nasser et al., 2023). It can also be seen in individuals with autism and disorders like
     excoriation disorder (APA, 2023b). Pica has also been associated with other eating disorders like ARFID. Individuals
     with ARFID may have sensory sensitivities that can play a role in the development of pica (APA, 2023b).

     Treatment of Pica

     There are no medications to treat pica. Restoration of deficient minerals and nutrients is considered the first-line
     treatment for pica if there are deficiencies (NEDA, 2023b). If replacing minerals and nutrients is not effective, other
     methods like behavioral interventions may be effective. Behavioral interventions have shown promise in clients with
     mental disabilities and include redirection of compulsive eating of nonfood items to other activities (Al Nasser et al.,
     2023). It is also important to prevent continued consumption by removing the nonfood items or restricting access.

     Behavior Modification
     Behavior modification used in treating pica utilizes a technique called differential reinforcement, which is a
     strategy that redirects an unwanted behavior to more favorable activities (Al Nasser et al., 2023). For example, if a
     child consistently consumes clay or playdough during activity time, they can be redirected to choose a healthy snack
     such as baby carrots. Studies conducted on individuals with autism have shown that differential reinforcement is an
     effective strategy and can include rewarding favorable behaviors (NEDA, 2023b).

Emergency Care
Consumption of nonfood items can cause several medical complications that require emergency care.
Complications that can occur include heavy metal toxicity, choking, sepsis, and intestinal blockages or perforation
(Fields et al., 2021). Clients who consume items like paint chips are at risk for poisoning from high levels of toxic
metals like lead (APA, 2023a). Choking can occur from nonfood items becoming lodged in the throat and causing
airway blockages. Sepsis can develop from exposure to toxins in the nonfood items consumed, and intestinal
blockages can occur from the buildup of the nonfood items in the gastrointestinal tract; that can also lead to
perforation. These medical complications can lead to fatalities if they do not receive prompt medical intervention
(Fields et al., 2021).

Nursing Considerations

Nurses are key players in helping manage individuals with pica. These individuals may seek care due to medical
complications from ingesting nonfood items or they may seek care for routine examinations such as well-child or
prenatal visits. These clients require compassionate, person-centered care to address their health needs. Nurses
can help identify vulnerable clients who are at risk, such as pregnant individuals or children who reside in older
homes that may contain lead paint, and educate clients on prevention strategies (Al Nasser et al., 2023).

Teaching
Client and family education regarding pica should focus on prevention and behavior modification. Individuals with
pica need to learn strategies to limit their exposure to the substance or substances that they crave. This can be
facilitated by decreasing access or substituting the nonfood item with a similarly textured item that is more
appropriate (Al Nasser et al., 2023). Parents and caregivers play an essential role in managing pica in children.
Preventative strategies that have been proven effective include making other caregivers aware of the pica behaviors,
keeping a close watch on children, removing access to nonfood items, engaging childproof locks, and finding
alternative activities to divert the child's attention (Fields et al., 2021).

Family Support/Empowerment
Living with individuals with pica can be difficult for families. Because pica is commonly seen in children, parents,
caregivers, and other family members are vital to include in the client's plan of care. Empowering families to take an
active role in the plan of care can help promote positive outcomes in individuals with pica.

20.7 Rumination Disorder

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Discuss etiologies and diagnostic criteria of rumination disorder
    · Summarize treatment for rumination disorder
    · Plan nursing care for clients with rumination disorder

In a gastrointestinal context, rumination is when ingested food is repeatedly regurgitated, rechewed, or spat out
(APA, 2023a). Rumination is derived from the Latin word ruminor, which translates as to chew over again (Sasegbon
et al., 2022). When food that has been ingested is ejected through the esophagus back into the mouth, this is known
as regurgitation. It is important to distinguish regurgitation from vomiting. With vomiting, there is forceful expulsion
of gastric contents from the mouth. With rumination, the action is effortless, and the food remains in the mouth
unless it is spat out by choice (Kusnik & Vaqar, 2023).

The eating disorder in which food is repeatedly regurgitated and rechewed or spat out after being ingested is called
rumination syndrome, or merycism. The rumination typically occurs within fifteen minutes of a meal and is
repeated for up to two hours (Kusnik & Vaqar, 2023). It can lead to medical complications and impairments in
occupational and/or social functioning, so it is important to assess rumination disorder in suspected individuals.

Rumination syndrome is described as having a primary maintenance pathway and secondary mechanisms that
maintain the disorder. In the primary maintenance pathway, the regurgitations are a result of a conditioned
response to oral stimuli (typically food) and cause habitual contraction of the abdominal wall (Taclob et al., 2022).
For example, individuals may regurgitate after eating a certain food. Secondary mechanisms associated with
rumination syndrome include gastrointestinal reflux and other gastrointestinal conditions like gastroparesis that can
682  20 · Eating Disorders

     cause regurgitation from acid reflux (Murray et al., 2019). There is also a form of rumination syndrome where
     belching occurs before regurgitation that is known as supragastric rumination.

     Etiology and Diagnosis of Rumination

     Rumination syndrome can mimic gastrointestinal disorders and is often misdiagnosed (Taclob et al., 2022). Clients
     can present with symptoms of heartburn or abdominal pain that is also seen with gastrointestinal disorders, and
     report "vomiting." (Kusnik & Vaqar, 2023). Obtaining a detailed history is essential to determining if the client has an
     eating disorder. For example, it will be helpful to know if the client is experiencing vomiting versus regurgitation
     where the action is effortless. DSM-5 criteria also requires that the symptoms occur over one month and not be from
     a medical condition, so evaluation and testing may be needed to rule out gastrointestinal causes. Rumination
     syndrome can affect individuals of all ages with an estimated prevalence between 0.8 percent and 10.6 percent
     (Murray et al., 2019). There are also higher incidences of rumination disorder seen in individuals with intellectual
     disorders such as developmental delays (APA, 2023b). The recommended diagnostic tests used to evaluate
     possible rumination syndrome include the following:

         · Gastric emptying studies: These studies measure the time it takes for food to move in the gastrointestinal
             tract and can help rule out conditions like reflux or gastroparesis.

         · Electromyography (EMG): This test measures electrical signals in the abdominal muscles and can help
             determine a rumination diagnosis.

         · High-resolution esophageal manometry (HRIM): This test measures gastric pressure and can be used to
             evaluate for rumination syndrome.

         · Endoscopy: A scope is inserted into the gastrointestinal tract and can be used to visualize any possible
             mechanical obstructions.

         · High-resolution impedance-pH manometry: The study measures pressure and pH and is used to confirm
             rumination syndrome and determine if it is primary or secondary. With primary rumination, there is reflux
             followed by abdominal pressure increase, whereas the opposite is seen in secondary rumination (Kusnik &
             Vaqar, 2023).

     There is limited information regarding the development of rumination disorder (Schweizer et al., 2018).
     Temperament and parenting factors have been associated with rumination syndrome. Individuals with
     temperaments that include high negative emotions such as fear, anger, and sadness are at higher risk for developing
     rumination disorder; a persistent focus on negative emotions is seen with rumination (Schweizer et al., 2018).
     Parenting styles also may have an effect on the development of rumination disorder. The highest levels of
     rumination disorder have been found in clients with overcontrolling parents and those who have negative parenting
     behaviors like hostility (Schweizer et al., 2018). Other developmental factors, such as having developmental delays
     seen with intellectual disorders, have also been associated with rumination disorder. The act of regurgitating is
     thought to be self-soothing or self-stimulating for infants along with individuals with intellectual disabilities, and
     that may factor into the development of rumination syndrome (APA, 2023b).

     Treatment

     Rumination syndrome is a treatable condition and is considered an acquired habit that can be reversed (Kusnik &
     Vaqar, 2023). The most effective treatments for rumination syndrome are behavioral therapies that include
     diaphragmatic breathing and biofeedback (Sasegbon et al., 2022). Diaphragmatic breathing is a technique that
     involves having the client breathe by expanding and contracting their abdomen versus chest breathing (Sasegbon et
     al., 2022). This technique interferes with abdominal contractions that may lead to regurgitation, especially after a
     meal (Sasegbon et al., 2022). Biofeedback is an advanced behavioral therapy that may be used to improve
     diaphragmatic breathing. It involves using electromyography to guide diaphragmatic breathing by helping to
     decrease chest breathing and increase abdominal breathing (Murray et al., 2019). Other behavioral therapies that
     have shown promise include general relaxation and distractions like gum chewing. Cognitive behavioral therapy for
     rumination disorder may also be effective (Kusnik & Vaqar, 2023).

     Medications are not typically used to manage rumination disorders unless they are treating underlying conditions.
     Behavioral therapies are considered first-line, but baclofen is a medication that has been used for clients who do not
     respond to behavioral interventions (Murray et al., 2019). Baclofen is an antispasmodic medication that has been
     found to reduce the frequency of regurgitation in clients with rumination syndrome (Murray et al., 2019). Its

mechanism of action involves stopping the relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter by increasing the pressure
in that area. The counteractivity produced by baclofen has been effective in decreasing episodes of regurgitation
(Kusnik & Vaqar, 2023).

Family Therapy
Families play an essential role in therapy for individuals with rumination disorders. It is important to provide client-
centered care that includes the client's family in their plan of care. Families are typically a part of mealtime and can
help implement behavioral techniques like diaphragmatic breathing after meals. They can also help individuals with
rumination disorder with relaxation skills or can provide distractions that can help discourage regurgitation.

Complications
Rumination syndrome can lead to medical complications that require intervention. There may be a reluctance to eat
due to regurgitation that can increase risk for malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances, and even refeeding syndrome
when restoring nutritional balance (Sasegbon et al., 2022). Other medical complications seen in individuals with
rumination syndrome include:

    · dental erosions (from repeated regurgitation)
    · failure to thrive (from nutritional deficiencies)
    · halitosis (from repeated regurgitation and dental erosion)
    · increased risk for choking and aspiration (from repeated regurgitation)

Severe electrolyte imbalances and refeeding syndrome are serious complications that can be fatal if not treated
promptly. Choking and aspiration can also be lethal complications that require immediate medical intervention.
There are also impairments in social functioning that are seen with rumination syndrome, such as avoiding eating in
social settings or avoiding work (Murray et al., 2019).

Nursing Considerations

Nurses have vital roles in managing clients with rumination disorder. They can help manage medical complications
like dehydration by administering fluids and electrolyte replacements. They can provide education on rumination
disorder and help clients and their families understand the condition. They can also implement behavioral therapies
and collaborate with other professionals involved in the plan of care, such as medical providers and behavioral
therapists.

Education on rumination syndrome should occur with the client and family. They should be educated on symptoms
to look for related to medical complications and when to seek prompt care. Symptoms like notable weight loss and
signs of dehydration could indicate severe nutritional or electrolyte deficiencies that require treatment. Because
dental erosions are a common complication seen with rumination disorder, encourage oral hygiene.

Clients should also be educated on behavioral techniques used to manage rumination syndrome, like diaphragmatic
breathing. Abdominal breathing is different from chest breathing, so it will be helpful to demonstrate this technique
for clients and families when providing education. Recommend that clients start practicing diaphragmatic breathing
for five to ten minutes while lying flat with their knees bent until they become comfortable with the technique. Once
they are comfortable, they can perform this technique while sitting to suppress the urge to regurgitate (Sasegbon et
al., 2022). Education can include providing links to John Hopkins and Mayo Clinic, which offer resources regarding
eating disorders, including rumination disorder.

Summary

20.1 Psychological, Social, and Physiological Factors

Eating disorders are a growing concern in nursing that can affect individuals of all ages and backgrounds. Anorexia
nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, pica, and rumination are
all eating disorders influenced by many psychological, behavioral, genetic, social, and environmental factors. Clients
with eating disorders can have severe complications, and nurses are essential members of the health-care team
when managing these clients. A collaborative approach that will include several disciplines in the plan of care and
medication management is required in assessing and treating eating disorders.

20.2 Anorexia Nervosa

Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by extreme restriction of food intake below the daily
requirements, causing very low body weight that can be fatal. Anorexia is divided into two categories--restricting
type and binge eating/purging type--and can involve cognitive distortions like thought-shape fusion. Clients with
anorexia nervosa often have other comorbid mental health conditions, such as anxiety and depression. Beneficial
interventions include medications, mentoring, self-help, and therapy. Clients with anorexia nervosa are at high risk
for suicide, so nurse care planning should include suicide assessment, providing a safe environment, and
maintenance of the therapeutic relationship.

20.3 Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder

ARFID is an eating disorder characterized as a disturbance with eating or feeding resulting in an individual
continuously not meeting their nutritional or energy needs (SAMHSA, 2016). It can be caused by sensory sensitivity,
low appetite/interest in foods, or avoidance due to trauma, and it can lead to a severe reduction in nutrients. ARFID
differs from anorexia because it is often seen in infancy and early childhood and does not involve issues with body
image. Other mental disorders, such as autism and anxiety, can be psychological drivers for ARFID along with a
history of trauma related to eating. Treatment of ARFID requires a collaborative approach that focuses on restoring
nutritional balance, stabilizing weight, and modifying disrupted eating behaviors. Family-based care is essential to
treatment, along with therapies that focus on behavior modification, cognitive thought processes, and nutritional
skills building.

20.4 Bulimia Nervosa

Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder where there are recurrent episodes of binge eating that are followed by
behaviors to prevent weight gain like extreme exercise, fasting, or purging. It affects females more than males and
there are several biological, psychological, environmental, and temperamental factors associated with it. Bulima is
categorized as purging and nonpurging type and can cause significant medical complications that can require
hospitalization. Severe life-threatening complications can also occur with bulimia, such as suicide, esophageal
rupture, and cardiac arrhythmias. Nurse care planning includes interventions to stabilize nutritional status, interrupt
maladaptive behaviors, and manage complications. Treatment includes behavioral therapy, medications, and client
self-help. It is also important to provide a safe environment for clients with bulimia due to their increased suicide
risk.

20.5 Binge-Eating Disorder

Binge eating disorder (BED) is the most common eating disorder, is characterized by repeated episodes of excessive
eating in short amounts of time, and is accompanied by the inability to control eating. Loss of control over eating can
cause feelings of shame or guilt. BED differs from bulimia in that there are no repeated purging behaviors that occur
in BED and clients with BED tend to be overweight. There are several medical complications associated with BED
that may require nursing care. Treatment of BED requires a collaborative approach that includes medications,
psychotherapy, behavioral therapies, and surgical interventions. The goals of treating BED include weight loss and
changing disordered eating patterns, which a therapeutic relationship with the client can help facilitate.

20.6 Pica

Pica is an eating disorder where people consume nonfood items repeatedly. Medical complications can occur with
pica that require immediate medical intervention. Consumption of nonfood items may not be considered pica if it is

a culturally accepted practice or occurs in children under the age of two. The cause of pica is unknown, but there are
several suspected etiologies and behavioral factors that are associated with pica, such as iron deficiency anemia.
Pica can occur in pregnancy and, if severe, can cause harm to the mother and unborn child. Nutritional deficiencies
and mental health comorbidities are also common in individuals with pica. Treatment includes restoring deficient
minerals and nutrients, behavioral interventions, and prevention strategies. Nurses play an essential role in
managing pica and can empower families to be active in the client's plan of care.

20.7 Rumination Disorder

Rumination syndrome is an eating disorder where food is repeatedly regurgitated and rechewed or spat out after
being ingested. It affects all ages, but the age of onset for infants is typically between three and twelve months. It
can mimic gastrointestinal conditions, so it is important to rule out gastrointestinal causes when assessing for
rumination syndrome. Medical complications can occur with rumination disorders, such as dental erosions, choking,
and nutritional deficiencies. The most effective treatments for rumination syndrome are behavioral therapies such
as diaphragmatic breathing. Other treatment options include medication, cognitive behavioral therapy, and family
therapy. Client education, family support, and empowerment are essential to treating individuals with rumination
disorder.

        pregnant. During her prenatal visit, she informs the nurse that she desires to engage in a cultural practice to
        help her pregnancy that involves eating clay. How can the nurse provide person-centered care when providing
        education for this client?

What Should the Nurse Do?

Mariela is a 19-year-old college student who has recently lost a significant amount of weight and expresses
dissatisfaction with her body image. She reports engaging in restrictive eating behaviors, excessive exercise, and
frequent self-criticism related to her appearance. Mariela appears anxious and avoids making eye contact during the
assessment.

    1. What psychological factors might contribute to Mariela's development of an eating disorder, based on the
        information provided?

    2. How do social factors, such as societal standards of beauty and peer influences, potentially influence
        Mariela's perception of body image and eating behaviors?

    3. Considering physiological, hereditary, and environmental factors, what could be contributing to Mariela's
        presentation of an eating disorder, and how would you rank these hypotheses in terms of likelihood?

    4. What nursing interventions would be appropriate for addressing Mariela's identified problems related to her
        eating disorder symptoms?

KB is a sixteen-year-old who presents to the clinic with her mother with reports of no menses for four months. She
has no past medical history and takes no medications. Her mother mentioned having the same issue at her age
when she was modeling and states that her issue was caused by her extreme dieting habits. Her mother also states
that she feels that KB is underweight and that she has lost twenty pounds since she had her last visit eight months
ago. KB reports that she often skips meals and reports that she is on an extreme diet plan to help her look more like
her favorite YouTube model who is admired for her tiny waistline. During the exam, KB has a BMI of 17.5, a heart
rate of 55 beats/min, and a blood pressure of 90/50. Based on the information you have, answer the following
questions:

    5. What eating disorder do you suspect KB may have and why?
    6. How does her mother's history affect KB's risk?
    7. What would be a priority nursing intervention for KB?

Drake, a 16-year-old, has been admitted to the pediatric unit of a hospital for evaluation and treatment of
disordered eating behaviors. Drake presents with significant weight loss, extreme food avoidance, and nutritional
deficiencies. Upon assessment, it becomes evident that Drake's eating patterns are driven by a fear of adverse
consequences associated with eating, rather than a concern about body weight or shape. The client exhibits distress
or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning due to food intake restrictions.

    8. Based on Drake's presentation, what features differentiate their condition from anorexia nervosa?
    9. What nursing interventions could be included in Drake's care plan to address their avoidant/restrictive food

        intake disorder (ARFID)?

Jamal, a 10-year-old male, has been brought to the pediatric clinic by his parents due to concerns about his eating
habits. Jamal's parents report that he frequently consumes non-nutritive, nonfood items such as paper, clay, and
dirt. Despite their attempts to intervene, Jamal continues to engage in this behavior, and they are worried about
potential health risks. Upon assessment, it becomes evident that Jamal's consumption of nonfood items is not a
culturally sanctioned practice and is not better explained by another psychiatric disorder.

  10. What factors might contribute to the development of pica in Jamal's case?
  11. What conditions or comorbidities should the nurse assess for in Jamal's case, given his presentation with

        pica?
  12. What treatment options would be appropriate for addressing Jamal's pica, and how would you rank these

        options based on his individual needs and circumstances?
  13. What nursing considerations should be prioritized when caring for Jamal and supporting him in managing his

        pica?

Competency-Based Assessments

    1. Perform research from reputable sources on nursing assessment of a client with a potential eating disorder.
        What behavioral cues might indicate a potential eating disorder, and how would you prioritize these cues?

    2. What measurable outcomes could indicate the effectiveness of nursing interventions in the treatment of an
        eating disorder?

    3. Create a plan of care for a teenage client with anorexia nervosa. What interdisciplinary strategies could you
        implement, and how might they contribute to a comprehensive care plan?

    4. As a nurse, how can you establish a therapeutic relationship with a client diagnosed with anorexia nervosa,
        considering the challenges related to trust and control?

    5. Analyze the psychological and behavioral aspects that distinguish anorexia nervosa from ARFID. How might
        these differences influence nursing care?

    6. As a clinical nurse, how would you plan care for a client with avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID)
        and what hypotheses might guide the prioritization of interventions, considering the unique challenges of this
        disorder?

    7. As a nursing student, you are working with a college student you suspect may have an eating disorder.
        Identify potential risk factors for bulimia nervosa in the student's history. How might recognizing these cues
        contribute to early intervention?

    8. How can a nurse collaborate with a multidisciplinary team to develop a comprehensive care plan for a client
        with bulimia nervosa?

    9. As a clinical nurse, how can you involve family members or support systems in the care of a client with binge
        eating disorder? What potential benefits can this collaboration offer?

  10. In the context of binge eating disorder treatment, what actions can a nurse take to address potential client
        barriers to adherence and engagement in therapy?

  11. As a clinical nurse, why is it important to be aware of associated conditions when caring for a client with pica?

  12. As a clinical nurse, how can you evaluate the outcomes of treatment for a client with pica? What indicators
        suggest improvement or the need for adjustments in the care plan?

21.3 Factitious Disorder
21.4 Illness Anxiety Disorder
INTRODUCTION Somatic symptom and related disorders are fascinating areas of study in the field of psychiatric-
mental health nursing, illustrating the complexities of the relationship between mind and body. These disorders
encompass a range of conditions where physical symptoms manifest without a clear medical explanation, leading to
distress and impairment in daily functioning. By delving into the world of somatic symptom and related disorders,
nursing students can gain valuable insights into the delicate interplay between physical health and psychological
well-being. These conditions challenge understanding of the mind-body connection. It is the nurse's responsibility
to provide holistic care that encompasses both the physical and psychological dimensions of health. This way,
nurses can develop the knowledge and skills necessary to approach clients with empathy, respect, and a
comprehensive understanding of their unique struggles.

     21.1 Psychological and Behavioral Factors in Somatic Symptom Disorders

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Discuss the DSM-5-TR diagnosis relative to somatic symptom disorders and their presentation
         · Identify psychosocial and behavioral risk factors for somatic symptom disorders
         · Give examples of client symptoms associated with somatic symptom disorders
         · Describe stress responses reported by clients due to somatic symptom disorders
         · Plan nursing and collaborative care for clients seeking treatment for somatic symptom disorders

     Somatic symptom disorder (SSD), formerly known as somatization disorder, is a condition where individuals
     experience distressing physical symptoms that cannot be explained fully by an underlying medical condition.
     Somatic symptom disorder presents a unique challenge for health-care professionals because it involves the
     manifestation of physical symptoms without a clear underlying medical cause.

     The nursing role goes beyond addressing physical ailments; it extends to acknowledging and addressing the
     psychological and emotional dimensions of health. Learning about the relationship between mind and body to
     understand these complexities is essential for providing compassionate care and supporting individuals with these
     disorders.

     DSM-5 Medical Diagnosis

     When a client is focused on physical symptoms to the point of significant distress and disruption of normal
     functioning, they are considered to have somatic symptom disorder (SSD) (American Psychiatric Association [APA],
     2022). The term somatic means relating to or affecting the body. The physical symptoms experienced by the client
     may or may not be attributable to an actual physical problem. The defining feature of this diagnosis is the abnormal
     preoccupation with physical symptoms to the point that it causes distress and interferes with everyday life.

     According to the DSM-5-TR (APA, 2022), there are three criteria to meet in order for an individual to be diagnosed
     with somatic symptom disorder:

         · one or more somatic symptoms that cause significant distress and interference with daily life
         · excessive thoughts about one's symptoms, high-level anxiety about health or symptoms, or disproportionate

             time and energy spent on symptoms and illness
         · presence of symptoms for more than six months

     It is estimated that 5 to 7 percent of the population meets criteria for SSD (D'Souza & Hooten, 2023), and it can
     occur in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood. Women are ten times as likely as men to be diagnosed with SSD. The
     prevalence of SSD is higher in individuals with functional disorders, including fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome,
     and chronic fatigue syndrome.

             LINK TO LEARNING

     This case study of a thirty-one-year-old female client (https://openstax.org/r/77SSD) who was ultimately diagnosed
     with SSD after presenting with multiple complaints illustrates how SSD clients are usually diagnosed after
     presenting to primary care or emergency care departments, not psychiatric care settings.

     People with SSD may be excessively negative about illness and their health and think the worst, even if there is no
     medical evidence, or there is medical evidence to the contrary. They may avoid physical activity. High levels of
     services utilization, or use of health-care services, may be part of the client's history. This may include trips to
     multiple providers for the same symptoms. Some clients believe that their medical diagnoses and treatments have
     been and continue to be inadequate. They may demonstrate increased sensitivity to adverse effects of medication
     but seemingly show resistance to treatment.

     Clients with somatic symptom disorder may have a single complaint, but most often have multiple symptoms
     contributing to their distress. The top client complaint is pain, but clients may complain of any variety of symptoms,
     including fatigue, heart palpitations, and more. Somatic symptom disorder frequently occurs alongside other

confirmed medical diagnoses. For example, a person may undergo an uncomplicated hip replacement operation
that does not result in any disability from the procedure itself, but become disabled by somatic symptom disorder
afterward. Still, many individuals with SSD do not have a confirmed medical diagnosis, yet the physical complaints
expressed and experienced by the individual are genuine, regardless of whether there is a medical explanation for it.

Psychosocial and Behavioral Risk Factors

Risk factors for SSD are varied and differ among life stages and cultures. These factors include psychosocial as well
as behavioral elements.

Psychosocial Risk Factors
Experiencing adverse events during childhood, such as abuse, neglect, or other traumatic experiences, has been
linked to an increased risk of developing somatic symptom disorder (SSD) later in life (D'Souza & Hooten, 2023).
Early life stressors can have long-lasting effects on psychological well-being and may contribute to the development
of somatic symptoms as a way of coping or expressing distress.

Anxiety and depression are commonly associated with SSD, as is a history of substance misuse. Additionally, certain
personality traits may increase the risk of SSD. People with avoidant, paranoid, self-defeating, or obsessive thinking
may be more prone to experiencing and focusing on somatic symptoms. Individuals who experience chronic stress,
trauma, or have difficulty coping with emotional problems may be more susceptible to developing SSD.
Dysfunctional family dynamics, including high levels of conflict, overprotection, or excessive attention to physical
symptoms, can contribute to the development of SSD.

Certain cognitive factors and illness beliefs also can contribute to the development and maintenance of SSD. These
may include catastrophizing (interpreting mild symptoms as indicative of severe illness), perceiving bodily
sensations more intensely, and a tendency to focus on and misinterpret normal bodily sensations as abnormal or
indicative of a serious medical condition. These illness beliefs can be formed by social and cultural factors that have
influenced the client. Societal beliefs about the legitimacy of physical symptoms and cultural norms related to
expressing distress, or the influence of cultural or religious beliefs on illness interpretations can all contribute to the
development of SSD.

        CULTURAL CONTEXT

Cultural Considerations and Somatic Symptom Disorder

Numerous studies have shown that unexpressed emotions play a notable role in somatic symptom disorder (SSD).
The country of Iran has been identified as having a particularly high rate of SSD. The authors of one study found
three main obstacles to the expression of emotion in Iran: genderizing of emotion (i.e., defining the expression of
emotion as excessively feminine and perceived as fragile), a prohibition on expressing emotions about parents and
authority figures, and problems expressing positive emotion.

The authors of the study concluded that because of these cultural barriers, SSD clients in Iran have difficulties
directly expressing their emotions. Cultural considerations such as these must always be taken into account when
evaluating a client with suspected or diagnosed SSD.

(Vaziri et al., 2019)

Behavioral Risk Factors
Importantly, behavioral factors can both contribute to the development of SSD and influence its persistence.
Observing and learning from others' illness behaviors can contribute to the development or reinforcement of SSD.
Per Leventhal (2001), illness is experienced as a threat and a need for protection, prompting the person to seek
medical care. Family members who model illness behavior, or place excessive focus on physical complaints, may
inadvertently reinforce somatic symptoms in individuals. For example, if a person frequently witnesses a family
member displaying exaggerated illness behaviors or utilizing excessive health care, they may learn and imitate those
behaviors.

People with SSD may frequently seek reassurance from health-care professionals, family members, or friends
700  21 · Somatic Symptom Disorders

     regarding their symptoms or concerns. This behavior stems from the need for validation and confirmation that their
     symptoms are not indicative of a severe medical condition. Seeking reassurance repeatedly can reinforce the focus
     on symptoms and contribute to the maintenance of SSD. Individuals with SSD may experience secondary gain--the
     inadvertent advantages one receives from an illness--from adopting a sick role, such as receiving attention,
     sympathy, or support from others, or avoiding responsibilities or stressful situations. These reinforcements can
     encourage continuation of somatic symptoms.

     Behaviors and Symptoms of Clients with SSD

     Individuals with somatic symptom disorder (SSD) may adopt maladaptive coping strategies, such as excessive
     rumination about their symptoms, catastrophizing (interpreting symptoms as indicating a serious illness), or
     engaging in behaviors that temporarily relieve distress but reinforce the illness belief. One example of this type of
     behavior would be constantly checking the body for signs of illness.

     Preoccupation with Health
     Clients with SSD often display a heightened and persistent preoccupation with their health. They may spend
     excessive time researching medical information, participating in online health forums, or seeking reassurance from
     health-care professionals to validate their concerns. They also engage in excessive health-care-seeking behavior.
     They may visit multiple doctors or specialists in search of a diagnosis or treatment for their symptoms, even when
     medical tests and evaluations show no clear evidence of an underlying medical condition.

     Clients with somatic symptom disorder often spend a significant amount of time and energy focused on their
     symptoms. This can involve constantly monitoring their bodies for any changes, analyzing symptoms, and engaging
     in excessive self-examination or self-checking behaviors. They may also exhibit exaggerated or dramatic
     expressions of their physical symptoms. This can involve amplifying the severity or impact of their symptoms during
     medical consultations or interactions with others, seeking validation or attention.

     Avoidance Behaviors
     Individuals with SSD may engage in avoidance behaviors that may affect their daily functioning and overall quality of
     life. They may refrain from physical activity or certain situations that they believe may exacerbate their symptoms.
     This avoidance can lead to a reduction in daily functioning, social withdrawal, and isolation. The symptoms of SSD
     can significantly impair an individual's ability to carry out their daily activities and fulfill their responsibilities.

     Resist Psychological Explanations
     Clients with somatic symptom disorder may resist psychological explanations for their symptoms. They may reject
     or dismiss the idea that their symptoms have psychological or emotional roots and instead continue to seek physical
     explanations.

     Expression of Pain
     Pain is the most cited single complaint among clients with SSD. Some of the specific symptoms reported include
     muscle and joint pain, back pain, headaches, noncardiac chest pain, heartburn, and irritable bowel. A variety of
     factors may contribute to SSD-related pain. These include possible genetic and biological vulnerability, such as
     increased sensitivity to pain.

     Expression of Fear
     People with SSD may have a heightened emotional response to their physical symptoms, experiencing extreme
     anxiety, fear, or distress even when the symptoms are mild or temporary. Their reaction may seem excessive or out
     of proportion to the actual medical severity of the symptoms.

     Stress Responses Reported by Clients

     Individuals with SSD experience persistent physical and emotional symptoms that are distressing and disruptive to
     their daily lives. These symptoms may cause pain, discomfort, fatigue, or other physical sensations, resulting in
     functional impairment and limitations in different aspects of client life. These clients are also likely to experience
     anxiety, depression, frustration, or fear related to their symptoms. They may worry about the cause of their
     symptoms, the impact on their health, and the potential for serious underlying conditions. The symptoms may
     interfere with work or school attendance, social interactions, personal relationships, and recreational activities. The
     cycle of medical appointments, tests, and treatments brought on by frequent health-care utilization can be

emotionally and financially draining. The level of impairment to the client's daily life can vary from mild to severe,
depending on the severity and frequency of the symptoms.

SSD can strain personal relationships. Loved ones may become frustrated or concerned about the persistent focus
on physical symptoms, leading to tension. SSD, like many other somatic disorders, can be stigmatized, leading to
further challenges for individuals affected by it. There is often a lack of awareness or understanding among the
general public, friends and family, and even health-care professionals, which may result in skepticism, dismissal, or
blame placed on the individual experiencing the symptoms, and can lead to feelings of isolation and invalidation.

Nursing Care for Clients with SSD

The first step in effective nursing care of a client with SSD is building trust and rapport with the client. Nurses should
create a safe and nonjudgmental environment where clients feel comfortable discussing their symptoms and
concerns. Demonstrate empathy and active listening skills when interacting with clients. Nurses should validate the
client's experiences, concerns, and emotions. It is important for the nurse to remember that clients with SSD are
experiencing distress and this distress might not receive validation by medical tests (i.e., stomach upset with no
explanation or insight gained from diagnostic testing). Nursing validation by acknowledging the client's distress can
help build trust and improve the therapeutic relationship.

Nurses are encouraged to remain aware of professional boundaries and seek clinical guidance in care of clients with
SSD. Some clients may have developed dependent behaviors that may be inadvertently reinforced by the nurse.
Clients are likely to benefit more from empowerment toward self-care. For example, nurses may tend to spend more
time with clients who readily express needs that the nurse can fulfill, strengthening the helping relationship. Nurses
should remain aware that the helping relationship also exists when the nurse encourages the client toward self-care
and gives honest praise for their efforts.

The nurse should provide the client with accurate information and education about SSD to help them understand
the nature of their condition. Explain that SSD is a real illness, and symptoms are not intentionally produced or
under the client's conscious control. Offer resources, such as educational materials or support groups, to assist
them in learning more about their condition.

One of the more effective strategies for clients dealing with SSD is to "focus on the here and now." By encouraging
clients to focus on the present moment, nurses can assist clients in finding relief from their distress and promote a
sense of calm and control. Focusing on the here and now emphasizes the present moment and encourages clients
to redirect their attention away from distressing or anxious thoughts to the present experience. For example, a nurse
may engage a client in grounding exercises, such as deep breathing, guided imagery, or sensory stimulation, to help
them anchor themselves in the present and alleviate anxiety or pain.

Work together with the client to establish realistic and attainable goals. Involve the client in their care plan to
promote a sense of ownership and engagement. Realize that insight into the condition of SSD may develop slowly or
not at all; the ultimate goal should be to restore the client to their optimal level of functioning.

Nursing Assessment
Medical screening tools include client self-report rating scales, which can be combined with the interview to
determine symptom burden in order to make a medical diagnosis. When performing a nursing assessment on a
client with potential SSD, the nurse must gather a thorough physical and psychiatric history, paying particular
attention to the client's symptoms, their onset, duration, and any potential triggers. It is important to approach the
process with sensitivity and empathy. Ask the client about their perception of their symptoms, their impact on daily
functioning, and any previous medical evaluations or treatments they have undergone. Observe any inconsistencies
or incongruence between the reported symptoms and medical findings. Be attentive to the client's emotional
responses and their understanding of the mind-body connection.

Assess the client's mental health status, including any history of anxiety, depression, trauma, or other psychiatric
disorders. Evaluate their emotional well-being, coping mechanisms, and stress levels. Look for any underlying
psychosocial stressors that may contribute to the manifestation or exacerbation of somatic symptoms. Assess their
ability to carry out activities of daily living, work, and engage in social interactions. Evaluate the impact of SSD on the
client's daily functioning, relationships, and overall quality of life; this will help determine their treatment plan.

             CLINICAL SAFETY AND PROCEDURES (QSEN)

     QSEN Competency: Safety for the Client with Somatic Symptom Disorder

     The nurse will:

         · discuss effective strategies for maintaining and ensuring safe environment, and provide client and family
             education

     Approaches to Treating Somatic Disorders
     The management of SSD can be complex. Individuals may face challenges in receiving an accurate diagnosis, finding
     appropriate health-care providers who understand the condition, and accessing effective treatments. The
     involvement of various health-care professionals, such as primary care physicians, psychiatrists and advance
     practice providers, psychologists, and other specialists, is necessary to provide comprehensive care. The client
     should be treated as a partner on the health-care team, and the team should employ a client-centered care
     approach. As discussed by Agarwal et al. (2020), there are several ways in which the nurse can advocate for the
     client and assist in finding and evaluating appropriate treatments. The nurse should encourage the client to
     participate in CBT, an evidence-based psychotherapy that focuses on identifying and modifying the maladaptive
     thoughts, emotions, and behaviors associated with SSD. Reinforce the benefits of therapy and provide referrals to
     mental health professionals as needed. Nurses can help the client develop strategies to manage their physical
     symptoms effectively. Encourage healthy coping mechanisms, such as relaxation techniques, deep breathing
     exercises, mindfulness, or guided imagery. Collaborating with the health-care team to ensure appropriate
     pharmacological interventions if indicated (medication management) is a critical nursing function. This may include
     the use of medications, such as SSRIs to manage associated anxiety or depression that often coexist with SSD.
     Nurses should also schedule regular appointments to monitor the client's progress, reassess symptoms, and adjust
     the treatment plan if necessary. Regular check-ins provide an opportunity to reinforce therapeutic interventions and
     provide ongoing support.

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Discuss the DSM-5-TR diagnosis relative to functional neurological disorder
         · Identify risk factors for functional neurological disorder
         · Give examples of client behaviors associated with functional neurological disorder
         · Describe stress responses reported by clients due to functional neurological disorder
         · Plan nursing and collaborative care for clients in treatment for functional neurological disorder

     When clients present with puzzling neurological symptoms that defy traditional medical explanations, intricate
     connections between the mind and body may be the cause. Nurses encounter individuals experiencing a wide range
     of symptoms, from unexplained paralysis and tremors to sensory abnormalities and gait disturbances. The hidden
     connection may be that these symptoms often emerge in response to psychological stress or trauma. The intricacies

of functional neurological disorder call for exploration of the complex relationship between emotions, the brain, and
physical health.

Medical Diagnosis

Also known as conversion disorder, functional neurological disorder (FND) is a condition where a person
experiences neurological symptoms in the form of one or more altered motor or sensory symptoms that cannot be
attributed to a specific medical or neurological condition (APA, 2022). In formulating a medical diagnosis of FND,
there may or may not be compatibility of the symptoms with a known neurological diagnosis, but clinical findings
(lab work, EEG, imaging) are incompatible. Medical evaluations and diagnostic tests may not reveal any underlying
medical or neurological cause for the symptoms, and the symptoms experienced by the person may or may not
follow typical patterns of known neurological disorders. It is thought that FND symptoms may occur because of a
psychological conflict. It is important to note that clients are not intentionally producing symptoms; rather, the
production of symptoms is involuntary and unconscious.

It is also important to note that FND can be present in clients with physical illness. Clients with epileptic seizures
may also have nonepileptic seizures. And clients with significant and life-threatening physical illnesses may also
present with dissociative symptoms and FND symptoms.

        LINK TO LEARNING

Though research is ongoing regarding effective therapies, this article tells of a twenty-six-year-old male client who
experienced severe neurological symptoms after an assault (https://openstax.org/r/77neurosympt) and how he was
ultimately diagnosed with functional neurological disorder.

Risk Factors

Neurologic illness, such as epilepsy, stroke, or migraine, can increase the risk of symptoms of FND (Peeling & Muzio,
2023). Symptoms usually begin suddenly after a stressful experience. Other risk factors for FND include medical
illness, dissociative disorder, and personality disorders.

Psychosocial Risk Factors
Psychosocial risk factors can contribute to the development and manifestation of FND. While the exact causes of
FND are not fully understood, several psychosocial factors have been associated with an increased risk.

Individuals with a history of traumatic experiences, such as physical or sexual abuse, accidents, or witnessing
violence, and those with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are more likely to develop FND because these
conditions can overwhelm an individual's coping mechanisms. High levels of emotional distress, such as anxiety,
depression, or unresolved conflicts, increase the vulnerability to FND. Individuals who have difficulty expressing or
managing their emotions may unconsciously convert their emotional distress into physical symptoms as a way of
coping or communicating their distress. Stressful life events, such as financial difficulties, relationship problems, or
major life transitions, can contribute to the development of FND. The experience of acute or chronic stress and the
inability to cope effectively with stressors can manifest as physical symptoms.

Certain personality traits or characteristics may increase the risk of FND. Individuals with a high level of neuroticism,
perfectionism, or a tendency to internalize stress may be more prone to developing other symptoms affecting
thoughts, physical movement, or sensory function. Poor coping strategies, such as avoidance or suppression of
emotions, can contribute to the development of FND. Inadequate coping mechanisms may lead to the conversion of
emotional distress into physical symptoms as a way of managing internal conflicts or stressors.

One's environment can play a large role in the risk of development of FND in the form of cultural and family systems.
Dysfunctional family relationships, high levels of family conflict, or a history of childhood adversity can increase the
risk, as can the presence of family members who inadvertently reinforce or encourage the symptoms. Additionally,
cultural beliefs about illness, social expectations, and stigma associated with mental health can influence the
expression of FND symptoms and can influence how a client perceives, interprets, and addresses symptoms within
a particular cultural context (Canna & Seligman, 2020).
704  21 · Somatic Symptom Disorders

     Behavioral Risk Factors
     Behavioral risk factors for FND can both trigger the onset of the disorder and reinforce the cycle of its continuation.
     Seeking and receiving reassurance from others, especially regarding physical symptoms, may reinforce the belief
     that physical symptoms are the only way to gain attention or support, contributing to the maintenance or
     exacerbation of FND symptoms.

     As with SSD, secondary gains associated with assuming the "sick role" can perpetuate FND symptoms. This may
     include receiving increased attention, sympathy, or support when experiencing physical symptoms, which may be
     more acceptable than emotional distress. If individuals receive attention or support primarily when they exhibit
     physical symptoms, they may be more likely to continue expressing those symptoms. This support can
     unintentionally strengthen the association between emotional distress and physical symptoms.

     Maladaptive behaviors and poor coping mechanisms can increase the likelihood of FND symptoms. If individuals
     lack effective strategies for emotion regulation, they may unconsciously convert psychological distress into physical
     symptoms as a coping mechanism. This can present in multiple ways, from a client consciously engaging in
     maladaptive behaviors to a client experiencing trauma and not having the coping skills to respond to the trauma.

     It is important to approach the understanding of behavioral risk factors cautiously, as the relationship between
     behavior and FND is complex, and not all individuals with FND exhibit the same behavioral patterns.

     Behaviors and Symptoms Associated with FND

     The symptoms associated with FND can be quite complex because they manifest as neurological symptoms that
     take the form of either altered motor symptoms or sensory symptoms. See the following lists for examples of the
     most common symptoms (NHS Inform, 2024).

     Altered motor symptoms:

         · Weakness or paralysis: Partial or complete loss of muscle strength or control in specific body parts, such as an
             arm or leg

         · Abnormal movements: Involuntary movements, such as tremors, jerking, or dystonia (sustained muscle
             contractions causing abnormal postures)

         · Abnormal gait: Difficulty walking or an unusual manner of walking
         · Speech difficulties: Trouble speaking or slurred speech
         · Swallowing difficulties: Difficulty swallowing or a sensation of a lump in the throat, called globus
         · Nonepileptic seizures: Also known as pseudoseizures, which are seizure-like episodes without the

             characteristic electrical abnormalities observed in epilepsy on an electroencephalogram (EEG)

     Sensory symptoms:

         · Numbness or loss of sensation: Decreased or absent sensation in a specific body area
         · Vision problems: Blurred vision, tunnel vision, or double vision
         · Hearing loss or deafness: Partial or complete loss of hearing without any detectable organic cause
         · Loss of touch or pain sensation: Reduced or absent ability to feel touch or pain

     Other common behavioral symptoms include:

         · a debilitating symptom that begins suddenly
         · a history of a psychological problem that gets better after the symptom appears
         · a lack of concern that usually occurs with a severe symptom

     Stress Responses Reported by Clients

     FND carries a wide range of neurological symptoms that can be distressing and debilitating, leading to limitations in
     mobility, self-care, and overall physical functioning. They may also interfere with activities of daily living and work or
     school attendance. For this and other reasons, living with FND can be emotionally challenging. Individuals may
     experience anxiety, depression, frustration, or a sense of loss due to the effect of symptoms on their daily lives.

     The uncertainty surrounding the symptoms and the difficulty obtaining a clear medical explanation can contribute to
     heightened anxiety and distress. Clients can also experience distress when getting results from medical tests,

     Access for free at openstax.org
21.2 · Functional Neurological Disorder                                                                                   705

especially if the medical tests do not validate their physical symptoms. FND can lead to a sense of self-doubt and
identity issues for clients. They may question the legitimacy of their symptoms, feel invalidated by others, or
struggle with the dichotomy between physical symptoms and the absence of an identifiable medical cause. This can
have a profound impact on self-esteem, self-image, and overall identity. Also, the stigma associated with functional
disorders can further exacerbate emotional distress.

FND can strain personal relationships because loved ones may struggle to understand or accept the nature of the
symptoms. The unpredictable nature of symptoms can lead to frustration, confusion, or feelings of helplessness
among family members and friends. This may result in social isolation, as individuals with FND may withdraw from
social activities due to embarrassment, fear of judgment, or limitations imposed by their symptoms.

FND symptoms can interfere with work or educational activities, leading to absenteeism, reduced productivity, or
the need for accommodations. The impact on occupational functioning can result in financial difficulties, loss of
employment opportunities, and diminished career prospects. Similarly, students with FND may face challenges in
attending classes, completing assignments, and maintaining academic progress.

Individuals with FND often seek medical care from multiple health-care providers in an attempt to find an
explanation or treatment for their symptoms. This can result in a long, expensive, and frustrating diagnostic journey,
with frequent medical appointments, tests, and treatments. The fragmented nature of health care and the lack of
awareness about FND among some health-care professionals can lead to stressful delays from appropriate
diagnosis and treatment.

Nursing Care for Functional Neurological Disorder

FND is a medical condition classified by the DSM-5. As with other somatic symptom-related disorders, nursing care
for FND begins with a caring and nonjudgmental approach to establish trust and rapport. The nurse should provide
the client with accurate information about FND to help them understand the nature of their condition. Explain that
FND is a real illness, that the client is not intentionally producing symptoms, and that they are not under the client's
conscious control. Providing emotional support and reassurance to the individual is important because FND can be a
chronic and debilitating condition.

Nurses should advocate for clients' needs and assist them in accessing appropriate resources and support groups.
Work together with the individual to set realistic goals for their care. Involve them in decision-making processes and
encourage their active participation in their treatment plan for best outcomes. Nurses can also help ensure
continuity of care by maintaining regular communication with the individual and the health-care team. Monitor their
progress, adjust the care plan as needed, and provide ongoing support throughout their journey.

        REAL RN STORIES

Nurse: Jamila, RN
Years in Practice: Five
Clinical Setting: Charge nurse on a neurology floor at a large tertiary care hospital
Geographic Location: Major metropolitan area

Our neurology floor is large, and we care for a diverse population. We have a special epilepsy monitoring unit, which
consists of eight client rooms with special equipment used for monitoring clients for seizures. These clients are
planned admissions. They come in and stay for several days, attached to a continuous EEG that is monitored by
clinicians who can interpret the client's brain activity. Clients are also monitored visually by camera around the clock
for their own safety. If they are on any seizure medications, they are usually discontinued in advance of their stay,
and we do not give them any while they're in the hospital unless there is an emergency and the clinician orders
something.

Clients with confirmed epilepsy are sometimes admitted and their EEG studied in order to adjust their seizure
medications to provide better control over their illness. Many of the clients in our epilepsy monitoring unit are
admitted, however, because of suspected functional neurological disorder, or having psychogenic nonepileptic
seizures (PNES). These seizures don't result from electrical activity in the brain but instead from psychological
706  21 · Somatic Symptom Disorders

     distress. So, when the client has one of these seizures, it will not register on the EEG like an epileptic seizure.

     One afternoon I was called to a client's room and told they wanted to speak to the charge nurse. The client was a
     thirty-six-year-old female who had been on the epilepsy monitoring unit for four days and, based on her clinical
     assessments and testing, she appeared to be having nonepileptic seizures. She was tearful and angry when I
     entered the room. She informed me that she had heard two employees talking in the hallway right outside her door.
     One of the employees mentioned to the other that the client was not having "real" seizures and was, instead,
     "faking" them to get attention. The client was hurt and offended and felt like nursing staff did not believe her. She
     felt like she could no longer trust nursing staff with her care. I assured the client that we did care about her and as a
     unit were invested in providing her with accepting and nonjudgmental care. I told her that her nonepileptic seizures
     did not mean she was "faking it" and told her that I would provide her with some client education regarding
     functional neurological disorder. I also told her that I would educate all of the nurses on the floor to ensure they
     were providing understanding, supportive, and nonjudgmental care.

     The client was still hurt but thanked me for listening to her. I spoke with both staff members who were involved
     individually. I provided them with information on FND and educated them on why clients are not "faking it." Both
     staff members chose to apologize to the client, which she appreciated. I also made sure to lead staff huddles each
     shift for the rest of the week to provide the staff with education on FND and to ensure that they were not talking
     about clients in the hallway. FND is a psychiatric disorder and nurses will not encounter it in everyday medical client
     care; they should be educated on its signs and symptoms and how to educate clients and staff on how to manage it.

     Nursing Assessment
     The nurse should approach the assessment of the FND client with a comprehensive and compassionate mindset.
     Perform a thorough physical and psychological assessment to understand the client's symptoms, their impact on
     daily functioning, and any underlying emotional or psychological factors contributing to the symptoms. Evaluate the
     client's mental health status, including any history of anxiety, depression, or trauma. Assess their emotional well-
     being, coping strategies, and levels of stress.

     Obtain a detailed history of the client's symptoms, including their onset, duration, and any potential triggers or
     stressors. Ask the client about their perception of their symptoms and any previous medical evaluations or
     treatments they have undergone. Assess the specific neurological symptoms experienced by the client, such as
     motor abnormalities, sensory disturbances, or nonepileptic seizures. Perform a thorough physical examination to
     rule out any organic causes of the client's symptoms. Pay close attention to neurological findings, reflexes, and
     coordination. Observe and document the characteristics of these symptoms, including their frequency, duration, and
     any pattern or association with emotional or psychological factors.

     Some assessment tools used within the interdisciplinary team may include observation of specific body regions and
     functions, or interviews with the client to evaluate improvements, such as the Simplified Functional Movement
     Disorders Rating Scale (S-FMDRS), and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale (Keatley & Molton, 2022).

     Assess the impact of FND on the client's daily functioning, relationships, and overall quality of life. Explore any
     occupational, social, or personal difficulties they may be experiencing as a result of their symptoms. This
     assessment helps guide the development of individualized care plans. Observe boundaries within the therapeutic
     relationship so as not to reinforce behaviors.

     Approaches to Treating Functional Neurological Disorder
     Managing FND is complex. As with many somatic disorders, individuals may face challenges in receiving an accurate
     diagnosis, finding appropriate health-care providers who understand the condition, and accessing effective
     treatments (Keatley & Molton, 2022). Education helps clients understand the nature of their symptoms, the mind-
     body connection, and the absence of an underlying organic pathology. By increasing clients' knowledge and
     understanding, nurses can empower them to participate in their treatment and self-management.

     CBT is an evidence-based psychological therapy used in the treatment of FND. It aims to address maladaptive
     thoughts, emotions, and behaviors associated with FND. By targeting anxiety, fear, and avoidance behaviors, CBT
     can help clients regain control over their symptoms and improve overall functioning.

     Physical therapy plays a crucial role in the treatment of FND. It focuses on improving physical functioning and

minimizing functional limitations caused by FND symptoms. Rehabilitation programs also emphasize functional
restoration and quality of life. And while medications are not typically used as the primary treatment for FND, they
may work to address comorbid psychiatric conditions, such as anxiety or depression.

Importantly, collaboration among health-care professionals, including nurses, physicians and advance practice
providers, psychologists, physical therapists, and occupational therapists, is vital in managing FND. A coordinated
and integrated approach centered around the client ensures a holistic treatment plan tailored to the needs of the
individual. Regular communication, joint treatment planning, and shared decision-making help optimize outcomes
and promote continuity of care.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Discuss the DSM-5-TR diagnosis relative to factitious disorder
    · Identify risk factors for factitious disorder
    · Give examples of client symptoms and behaviors associated with factitious disorder
    · Describe stress responses of clients due to types of factitious disorder
    · Plan nursing and collaborative care for clients seeking treatment for factitious disorder

Factitious disorder and its counterpart, factitious disorder imposed on another, involve individuals who feign illness
or intentionally make others believe they are sick. Factitious disorder, also known as Munchausen syndrome (named
after Baron von Munchausen, a German military officer who was a "teller of tall tales"), is characterized by a desire
for attention and validation through self-inflicted illness. Meanwhile, factitious disorder imposed on another,
formerly known as Munchausen by proxy, involves caregivers who fabricate or induce illness in another person,
often their own child. This part of the chapter delves into the psychology behind these behaviors, covers assessment
skills to identify factitious behavior, and touches upon the ethical challenges that arise in providing care for
individuals with these disorders.

Medical Diagnosis

The mental health condition in which individuals intentionally and consciously fabricate or induce physical or
psychological symptoms in themselves or another is called factitious disorder. The primary motivation behind this
behavior is to assume the role of a client or caregiver and receive medical attention, sympathy, or support. The
defining feature of factitious disorder is the conscious fabrication or induction of symptoms with no external
incentives, such as financial gain. There are two main types of factitious disorder (Carnahan & Jha, 2023; Cleveland
Clinic, 2021). Factitious disorder imposed on self involves individuals who purposely exaggerate, simulate, or self-
inflict physical or psychological symptoms to assume the sick role. They may go to great lengths to deceive medical
professionals, including faking or inducing symptoms, manipulating medical tests, or even undergoing unnecessary
medical procedures. The underlying motive is to obtain medical care, attention, and validation for their concerns.
The condition in which an individual intentionally causes illness or symptoms in another person under their care,
often a dependent, such as a child, older parent, or other vulnerable individual, even a pet, is called factitious
disorder imposed on another (FDIA). The person with factitious disorder imposed on another may falsify
symptoms, tamper with medical tests, administer medications or substances, or engage in other deceptive
behaviors to make the dependent appear, become, or remain sick. The motivation may be to gain attention,
sympathy, or a sense of control in the caregiver role, or even to obtain controlled substances.

Risk Factors for Factitious Disorder

The risk factors for factitious disorder are multifactorial but center around a history of childhood trauma as well as
attention-seeking behavior. Known risk factors are limited because obtaining reliable data is difficult due to the
708  21 · Somatic Symptom Disorders

     nature of factitious disorder.

             LINK TO LEARNING

     Visit this website for further information regarding the two main types of factitious disorder (https://openstax.org/r/
     77factitioustyp) provided by the Cleveland Clinic.

     Psychosocial Risk Factors
     Adverse experiences during childhood, such as abuse, neglect, or significant disruptions in attachment, have been
     associated with an increased risk of developing factitious disorder. These adverse experiences can impact an
     individual's emotional development, self-esteem, and coping mechanisms, potentially leading to the development
     of maladaptive behaviors to gain attention or control.

     Individuals with factitious disorder often have a strong need for attention and validation. They may feel a sense of
     emptiness, insecurity, or low self-worth and use the fabricated symptoms or illness as a way to receive the attention
     and care they desire. If the individual has experienced positive reinforcement, such as sympathy or validation for
     displaying symptoms or illness behavior, they may be more likely to develop factitious disorder.

     Certain personality traits may increase the susceptibility to developing factitious disorder. Individuals with histrionic
     personality traits, for example, may have a strong need for attention, drama, and a desire to be the center of
     attention. Other characteristics, such as narcissistic traits or borderline personality disorder, may also play a role in
     seeking attention and validation through the fabrication of symptoms. Difficulties in regulating and expressing
     emotions can also contribute to the development of factitious disorder as can depression and poor self-esteem.
     Individuals may use the fabrication of symptoms or illness as a way to cope with unresolved emotional pain,
     distress, or to avoid other challenging life situations.

     Behavioral Risk Factors
     Behavioral risk factors for factitious disorder refer to specific behaviors or patterns of behavior that may increase
     the likelihood of developing or maintaining the disorder, such as:

         · childhood trauma, such as emotional, physical, or sexual abuse
         · a serious illness during childhood
         · the loss of a loved one through death, illness, or abandonment
         · past experiences during a time of sickness and the attention it brought
         · the desire to be associated with doctors or medical centers
         · work in the health-care field (Mayo Clinic, 2019)

     Some individuals who assume the caregiver role for someone with a genuine illness or disability may develop
     factitious disorder imposed on another as a way to maintain their involvement in the medical system, gain attention,
     or fulfill a need for control. This may occur when the individual feels threatened by the improvement or recovery of
     the person for whom they are caring.

     Behaviors and Symptoms of Factitious Disorder

     Individuals with factitious disorder engage in deceptive behaviors to fabricate or induce symptoms. They may
     exaggerate existing symptoms, simulate new symptoms, or tamper with medical tests to maintain the appearance
     of illness. Deception and manipulation become habitual and central to their behaviors, serving as a means to
     assume the sick role and receive attention or care. Individuals with factitious disorder tend to be resistant to
     disclosing the truth about their fabricated symptoms. They may be evasive or provide inconsistent information
     during medical evaluations, making it challenging for health-care providers to reach an accurate diagnosis. This
     reluctance to reveal the truth perpetuates the cycle of deception and maintains their identity as a client.

     Individuals with factitious disorder may establish a close relationship with health-care professionals, seeking their
     approval, validation, and attention. They may exhibit ingratiating behaviors, such as excessive praise, flattery, or
     compliance, to maintain a favorable rapport with medical staff. This behavior is aimed at reinforcing the perception
     of being a cooperative and deserving client.

21.3 · Factitious Disorder                                                                                               709

Individuals with factitious disorder may persist in their deceptive behaviors despite negative consequences, such as
repeated medical evaluations, exposure to unnecessary treatments or procedures, financial strain, or difficult
relationships with health-care providers and loved ones. Their desire for attention and validation overrides concerns
about the potential harm caused by their actions.

It is important to note that factitious disorder is different from malingering, where individuals feign symptoms for
external incentives, such as financial compensation or avoiding legal responsibilities. Individuals with factitious
disorder feign symptoms for intrinsic incentives, such as attention and validation from health-care providers or
others.

The symptoms of factitious disorder can vary depending on the individual and the specific presentation of the
disorder. Some individuals with factitious disorder go beyond fabrication and actually induce physical or
psychological symptoms in themselves. They may engage in self-harm or self-poisoning, deliberately manipulate
their body to create physical signs of illness or injury, or intentionally cause themselves pain or discomfort.

Individuals with factitious disorder often possess wide-ranging knowledge of medical conditions, procedures, and
treatments. They may acquire this knowledge through personal experience, professional background in health care,
or extensive research. This knowledge enables them to present their symptoms convincingly, manipulate medical
professionals, and navigate the health-care system to their advantage.

Stress Responses

Stress responses are broken down into those experienced by clients with factitious disorder and those diagnosed
and involved with factitious disorder imposed on another; they can vary widely.

Stress Responses in Factitious Disorder
Maintaining a facade of illness and deception can negatively affect relationships with family, friends, and health-care
providers. Loved ones may become frustrated, confused, or even distrustful as they try to understand the
motivations behind the client's behavior. Health-care providers may also feel frustrated or deceived, which can
impact the quality of care and support they provide. Individuals with factitious disorder may isolate themselves or
become alienated from others due to the complexities and secrecy surrounding their condition. They may fear
discovery or judgment, leading to social withdrawal and a sense of isolation. This isolation can exacerbate feelings
of loneliness and reinforce the cycle of seeking medical attention as a primary source of social interaction.

The extensive medical attention sought by individuals with factitious disorder can result in frequent absences from
work, loss of employment, or financial strain. Hospitalizations, medical tests, and treatments can disrupt
employment stability and financial security. Additionally, the financial burden of unnecessary medical expenses can
accumulate over time.

Factitious disorder is often associated with underlying psychological distress. The motivations behind the disorder
may be rooted in unresolved emotional pain, trauma, low self-esteem, or a need for control or validation. These
underlying psychological issues can contribute to ongoing distress, self-doubt, and a diminished sense of self-worth
if left untreated.

Stress Responses in Factitious Disorder Imposed on Another
Factitious disorder imposed on another is a serious form of factitious disorder that can have profound and
devastating effects on the lives of both the victim and the perpetrator. Here's how factitious disorder imposed on
another affects the lives of clients and others involved:

Impact on the victim includes the following (Cleveland Clinic, 2021):

    · Physical and emotional harm: The victim, usually a child or vulnerable adult, is subjected to unnecessary
        medical procedures, treatments, and interventions. This can cause physical harm, pain, and distress,
        potentially leading to long-term health complications.

    · Medical trauma: Repeated medical evaluations, hospitalizations, and invasive procedures can lead to medical
        trauma for the victim. They may develop a fear or aversion to medical settings and procedures, which can have
        lasting psychological and emotional consequences.

    · Disrupted development: Factitious disorder imposed on another can disrupt a child's physical, emotional, and
        social development. It may compromise their normal developmental milestones, and they may experience
710  21 · Somatic Symptom Disorders

             delays in education, socialization, and overall growth.

     Impact on the perpetrator includes the following:

         · Legal consequences: Perpetrators of factitious disorder imposed on another can face legal repercussions for
             their actions. They may be charged with child abuse, neglect, or other criminal offenses, like battery. Legal
             interventions, child protective services, and court proceedings may be involved to ensure the safety and well-
             being of the victim.

         · Loss of trust and relationships: Factitious disorder imposed on another can lead to a breakdown of trust and
             relationships for the perpetrator. Friends, family members, employers, and health-care providers may become
             aware of the deception and may distance themselves from the individual. The perpetrator may face significant
             social isolation and stigmatization.

     Impact on family and support systems includes the following:

         · Family dynamics: Factitious disorder imposed on another can severely disrupt family dynamics and
             relationships. Other family members may be unaware of the deception or may become complicit in it, leading
             to strained relationships and conflicts within the family.

         · Emotional distress: Family members who discover the truth may experience significant emotional distress,
             ranging from shock and disbelief to guilt, anger, and betrayal. The revelation of such abuse can have a
             profound and lasting impact on their emotional well-being.

         · Need for support and healing: The entire family may require therapeutic support and counseling to heal from
             the trauma and to rebuild trust and healthy relationships. Support systems, including mental health
             professionals and support groups, can play a vital role in facilitating the healing process.

     Nursing Care

     Building trust and rapport with the client is a crucial first step in the care of the client with factitious disorder, even
     though the client's behaviors may seem deceptive. Nurses should create a nonjudgmental and empathetic
     environment where clients feel safe discussing their concerns, while still setting clear boundaries and limits with the
     client. Nurses are cautioned to remain aware of personal involvement.

     The goal of treatment is to replace maladaptive attention-seeking behavior with positive behaviors. Treatment
     usually involves long-term psychotherapy. Nurses can offer stress coping skills as alternatives to expression of
     illness symptoms.

             PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

     Client Empowerment

     In this scenario, the nurse builds trust with a client with factitious disorder while still maintaining clear boundaries.
     Nurse: Good morning, AJ, how was your night?
     Client: Another sleepless eight hours! I guess I just don't deserve a good night's sleep!
     Nurse: You don't deserve it?
     Client: Well, I can't catch a break in any part of my life, why would sleep be any different?
     Nurse: (using silence and active listening)
     Client: Hey nurse, you said you were here to help me, right? Like get the doctor to give me something at bedtime? Or
     maybe you could, you know, just get me something?
     Nurse: Sounds like this is a problem for you, is that accurate?
     Client: Yes, it is! If you're not going to help me, just say so.
     Nurse: AJ, I support your concern. Let's review the plan we discussed together. We talked about some relaxation
     techniques. You had some suggestions.

Nursing Assessment
Begin by gathering a thorough medical history, including past hospitalizations, surgeries, and treatments. Pay
attention to inconsistencies or discrepancies in their reported medical history and observe any discrepancies
between reported symptoms and medical findings. Inquire about their health-care-seeking behaviors, including
frequent visits to different health-care providers or hospitals. In factitious disorder imposed on another, the abuser
is the client. This disorder is a form of maltreatment toward a child, adult, or elder. The recipient of actions by the
abuser may also experience mental illness due to the abuse.

Observe the client's behavior and physical presentation during the assessment. Note any indications of intentionally
induced symptoms or fabrication of symptoms. Be attentive to any evidence of self-harm or manipulation of medical
devices or test results. Assess the client's mental health status, including any history of personality disorders, past
trauma, or emotional distress. Evaluate their understanding of the mind-body connection and their motivations for
seeking medical attention. Observe for any signs of secondary gain, such as attention-seeking behavior or a desire
to assume the "sick role."

Collaborate with other health-care professionals, such as psychiatrists or social workers, to gather additional
information and perspectives. Seek collateral information from family members, friends, or previous health-care
providers to validate or refute the client's reported medical history and behaviors.

Throughout the assessment, maintain a professional and nonjudgmental approach. Document all observations and
findings accurately and objectively. Clients may sometimes withhold information, lack trust, or be fearful. Some
clients will pause the assessment and ask the nurse's opinion on past or present treatment options, choices in their
care, or for the nurse to provide a diagnosis. The nurse should respond to the client's questions by acknowledging
their feelings and educating the client on the treatment process. The nurse can reflect upon the client's own words,
such as, "You mentioned you have a therapist you like," or, "You shared with me that your Dad offered you a place to
live." This identifies the client's strengths and encourages the client's participation.

Approaches to Treating Factitious Disorders
According to Weber (2023), a multidisciplinary approach is most effective when treating factitious disorder. Nurses
should engage in collaboration with psychiatrists and primary care providers, social service professionals, and
therapists. The client's family members are included. A multidisciplinary approach allows for comprehensive
assessment, coordinated treatment planning, and ongoing support for the client. Regular communication and
information sharing are vital to ensuring a consistent and integrated approach to care.

It is crucial to address any underlying psychiatric conditions, such as personality disorders or trauma-related
disorders, that may contribute to the development or maintenance of factitious disorder. Treating co-occurring
mental health conditions can help improve overall well-being and decrease the motivation for engaging in deceptive
behaviors. Psychotherapy, particularly CBT, can be especially beneficial in treating factitious disorder. CBT aims to
address the underlying psychological factors and motivations that drive behavior. It helps clients identify and modify
unhelpful thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors associated with factitious disorder. Therapy can also focus on developing
healthier coping mechanisms and addressing underlying emotional distress or trauma.

Providing a supportive and nonjudgmental environment is also critical when treating factitious disorder. Nurses can
play a key role in building trust, establishing therapeutic relationships, and demonstrating empathy toward the
client. By creating a safe space for open communication, clients may feel more comfortable sharing their
motivations and experiences, which can aid in treatment progress.

Nurses can also assist by providing education about factitious disorder to help clients gain insight into their behavior
and understand the potential consequences of their actions. By increasing their knowledge and awareness, clients
may be more motivated to engage in treatment and make positive changes. Education can also be extended to
family members or caregivers to help them better understand the condition and provide appropriate support.

As discussed in Mood Disorders and Suicide, potential for self-harm is part of the mental health assessment. Client
safety is a high priority in nursing care of clients with factitious disorder, or factitious disorder imposed on another.
Social and Emotional Concerns presents the legal responsibility of the nurse, as a mandatory reporter, to report
712  21 · Somatic Symptom Disorders

     suspected or known abuse and neglect.

     Setting clear boundaries and limits is essential in managing factitious disorder. Health-care providers must establish
     guidelines for appropriate care and interventions, such as planning with the client which topics to be discussed
     during therapy sessions or nursing interactions. Consistent monitoring, strict adherence to protocols, and verifying
     information can help prevent unnecessary procedures or treatments, and assist to resolve factitious behavior.

             PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

     Factitious Disorder Imposed on Another

     Nursing care for factitious disorder imposed on another is a highly complex and challenging situation. It involves a
     caregiver, typically a parent, intentionally fabricating or causing illness in a child or other dependent person to
     assume the sick role and seek medical attention. Here are some important considerations for nursing care in these
     cases:

         · Recognize the signs: Nurses should be vigilant in recognizing the signs and symptoms of factitious disorder
             imposed on another. These may include inconsistent or unexplained medical presentations, failure to respond
             to treatment, unusual symptoms, and a history of multiple hospitalizations or medical interventions.

         · Protect the victim: The primary focus in these cases is to ensure the safety and well-being of the victim. If
             there are concerns of abuse or neglect, follow appropriate reporting protocols and involve the appropriate
             protective services.

         · Collaborate with the health-care team: Work closely with the health-care team, including physicians and
             advanced practice providers, child protection specialists, social workers, and psychologists, to develop a
             comprehensive approach to care. Collaboration and regular communication are crucial for the welfare of the
             vulnerable party and the effectiveness of interventions.

         · Gather information: Obtain information from multiple sources, such as previous medical records, other health-
             care providers, and school personnel, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the victim's medical history
             and potential discrepancies or inconsistencies.

         · Document carefully: Maintain accurate and detailed documentation of all assessments, interventions, and
             observations. This documentation is essential for the continuity of care, legal purposes, and the well-being of
             the victim.

         · Focus on the victim's needs: Provide appropriate medical care and support for the victim's genuine health
             needs while avoiding unnecessary interventions related to fabricated or induced symptoms. The victim's well-
             being should always be the top priority.

         · Monitor and observe: Continuously monitor the victim's condition and response to treatment. Be vigilant for
             any signs of the caregiver's interference or manipulation of medical information or treatment.

         · Educate and support the family: Provide education and support to family members, including the caregiver, to
             help them understand the disorder and its consequences. Offer resources for psychological support and
             therapy to address underlying psychological factors.

         · Promote safety and security: Create a safe and supportive environment for the victim and the family. Ensure
             that appropriate security measures are in place to prevent further harm or manipulation.

         · Ethical considerations: Recognize and address the ethical dilemmas that arise in caring for child victims.
             Balancing the provision of appropriate care, protecting the victim's well-being, and addressing legal and
             ethical considerations can be complex. Consult with the health-care team, follow institutional protocols, and
             seek guidance from ethics committees as needed.

         · Legal and child protection involvement: Cooperate with legal authorities and child or adult protection
             agencies. Provide accurate and objective information to aid in the investigation and protection of the victim.

         · Ongoing assessment and support: Nursing care for factitious disorder imposed on another requires ongoing
             assessment and vigilance. Continuously evaluate the victim's progress, collaborate with the health-care team,
             and provide support for the victim and family during and after interventions.

     It is important to note that nursing care for factitious disorder imposed on another is highly complex and requires a
     multidisciplinary approach. The primary goal is to protect the victim from harm and provide appropriate care while

21.4 Illness Anxiety Disorder

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Discuss DSM-5-TR diagnosis relative to illness anxiety disorder
    · Identify risk factors for illness anxiety disorder
    · Give examples of client symptoms and behaviors associated with illness anxiety disorder
    · Describe stress responses reported by clients due to illness anxiety disorder
    · Plan nursing and collaborative care for clients in treatment for illness anxiety disorder

Illness anxiety disorder is a condition that also involves the complex relationship between physical health and
psychological well-being. Nurses' understanding of illness anxiety disorder is essential for providing compassionate
care and support to individuals who experience excessive worry and anxiety about their health. This section
discusses the details of illness anxiety disorder, examining its causes, symptoms, and impact on individuals' lives. It
explores evidence-based nursing interventions and strategies that can empower nurses to assist individuals in
managing their health anxieties, promoting their overall well-being, and fostering a therapeutic relationship
grounded in empathy and understanding.

Medical Diagnosis

The mental health condition characterized by excessive worry and fear about having a serious medical condition,
despite having little or no medical evidence to support the belief, is called illness anxiety disorder (IAD). With
illness anxiety disorder, somatic symptoms are not present, or if they are, are mild in intensity. The client's concerns
persist despite lack of symptoms and despite medical reassurance, and often cause significant distress and
impairment in daily functioning. The key features/diagnostic criteria of illness anxiety disorder include:

    · illness preoccupation must be present for six months for diagnosis
    · clients often misinterpreting or exaggerating normal bodily sensations, such as dizziness or belching, as

        evidence of an underlying illness
    · excessive health-related behaviors done as a result of their fears and driven by the need for reassurance and

        validation of their concerns
    · high levels of anxiety, distress, and preoccupation with illness that impairs their ability to function normally in

        various aspects of daily life
    · seeking out multiple, different providers for various opinions or exhibiting avoidance behaviors due to fears

        about a "worst-case scenario" diagnosis or being dismissed as overly anxious
    · excessive reassurance-seeking, which either briefly decreases or fails to decrease their anxiety
    · heightened awareness and continuous self-examination for signs and symptoms of illness

(Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], 2019)

Risk Factors

The risk factors for illness anxiety disorder include a history of trauma, learned behavior, and stress. History of
experience with serious illness also increases the likelihood of developing IAD.

Psychosocial Risk Factors
Certain developmental and familial factors may increase the likelihood of developing illness anxiety disorder, such
as traumatic experiences in childhood. Having a family member with a history of anxiety disorders or somatic
symptom disorders may also increase the likelihood of developing illness anxiety disorder. Observing family
members or close friends who exhibit excessive health concerns or engage in frequent doctor visits for minor issues
can also influence its development.

Constant exposure in the home environment to medical information, particularly from the internet or media, can
lead to excessive health-related concerns. Misinterpretation of medical information or exposure to stories of severe
714  21 · Somatic Symptom Disorders

     illnesses from family or others can fuel anxiety and hypervigilance.

     Specific personality traits and coping styles may be associated with a higher risk of developing illness anxiety
     disorder. These include high levels of anxiety, neuroticism, and a tendency to catastrophize or amplify physical
     sensations. Significant life stressors, such as major life changes, job loss, relationship difficulties, or financial
     problems, can contribute to the onset or worsening of illness anxiety disorder, especially in those with poor coping
     skills.

     Negative experiences with the health-care system, such as misdiagnosis or inadequate medical care, may
     contribute to the development of illness anxiety disorder. Additionally, individuals who have experienced a genuine
     medical condition in the past may develop a heightened fear of recurrence or new illnesses.

     Behavioral Risk Factors
     Certain behaviors may predate, reinforce, and maintain excessive health concerns. Individuals with illness anxiety
     disorder have often engaged in other excessive behaviors, such as worrying and seeking reassurance from others.
     People with illness anxiety disorder may spend excessive time online researching medical conditions or diseases,
     contributing to IAD. Misinterpretation of information or exposure to alarming stories can further fuel anxiety.

     Behaviors and Symptoms Associated with Illness Anxiety Disorder

     Individuals with illness anxiety disorder may frequently schedule medical appointments, seeking validation or
     reassurance about their perceived symptoms. They may consult multiple health-care providers or request numerous
     diagnostic tests and procedures, even in the absence of medical indications. Yet while some clients with illness
     anxiety disorder actively seek out medical information, others may avoid it altogether to prevent further anxiety or
     triggering their health-related worries. They may avoid reading or watching news about diseases or medical
     conditions because it can increase their anxiety and reinforce their fears.

     People with illness anxiety disorder tend to be hyperaware of bodily sensations and may interpret normal bodily
     functions as signs of a severe illness. They may constantly monitor their bodies for any perceived abnormalities and
     attribute them to serious medical conditions. Individuals with IAD often seek reassurance from others, including
     health-care professionals, family members, or friends, regarding their health concerns. They may repeatedly ask for
     confirmation that their symptoms are not indicative of a serious illness.

     The preoccupation and anxiety associated with illness anxiety disorder can significantly affect a person's daily
     functioning. They may experience difficulty concentrating on tasks, have impaired social interactions due to
     excessive health-related discussions, or experience interference in work or relationships. Some individuals with
     illness anxiety disorder may develop strict routines or rituals that provide a sense of control and temporary relief
     from stressors and concerns.

       CLINICAL JUDGMENT MEASUREMENT MODEL

       Recognizing and Analyzing Cues: Illness Anxiety Disorder

       Dimi is a thirty-five-year-old female referred to psychiatry from the hospital emergency department (ED) where
       she presented demanding diagnostic imaging. The client stated that she was fired from her job for attendance
       and performance issues and wanted to have "proof" to take to the employer. Before meeting Dimi in the mental
       health unit admission room, the nurse reviews the electronic record from the ED, noting client vital signs and
       other examination elements to be normal, except for heart rate of 106. The nurse plans to spend an hour
       completing the admission interview and assessment while establishing a therapeutic relationship with the
       client.

       The nurse introduces themself, describes the environment, asks the client to share what has brought her here
       today, and begins the nursing data collection.

       Client's responses: "Well, I was fired because of my health problems. I know I have some disease and I'm tired
       all the time and I need a special diet because of my medical problems. I have a lot of doctor's appointments, so
       I miss work. I live by myself and I really can't date or go out because I never know how I'll be feeling. I've lost

The client begins to cry, and the nurse offers her some tissues and waits for her to continue.

"I just really don't want to have cancer or something bad! I can't help it if I'm sick, can I? Doctors don't listen to
you! I can't find one I really like. They do a bunch of tests, but they never find anything. I go online and I see
those commercials and I know I have something wrong with me!"

The client is restless in the chair, wringing hands, shaking head. "I try to keep my mind off it . . ."

     TABLE 21.1 Nursing Data Collection/Cues

     Stress Responses Reported by Clients

     Illness anxiety disorder can have varied and serious effects on the lives of clients. People with illness anxiety often
     experience persistent worry and preoccupation with the idea of having a serious medical condition. This
     preoccupation can consume a significant amount of their time, attention, and mental energy, making it difficult for
     them to focus on other aspects of their lives. Individuals may constantly feel on edge, experience panic attacks, or
     be overwhelmed by fear and worry about their health. This anxiety can interfere with their ability to relax, enjoy
     activities, or maintain positive relationships. Individuals may withdraw from social interactions or avoid social
     events due to their health-related fears. They might be reluctant to share their concerns with others or may seek
     reassurance excessively, which can strain relationships with family, friends, and health-care providers.

     While illness anxiety disorder is primarily a psychological condition, the constant stress and anxiety associated with
     it can have physical effects on the body. Chronic stress can lead to fatigue, sleep disturbances, muscle tension,
     headaches, and other physical symptoms, further adding to the individual's distress.

     The preoccupation with health concerns and the associated anxiety can interfere with occupational or academic
     functioning. Individuals may have difficulty concentrating on tasks, experience reduced productivity, or miss work or
     school due to medical appointments or health-related worries. This can have a negative impact on their career or
     educational progress.

     People with illness anxiety often seek repeated medical evaluations and undergo numerous medical tests, even
     when there is no evidence of an underlying medical condition. This excessive health-care utilization can lead to
     increased medical expenses, time spent in health-care settings, and unnecessary procedures, potentially straining
     the health-care system.

     The persistent worry and preoccupation with health, along with the associated anxiety, can significantly reduce the
     overall quality of life for individuals with illness anxiety. They may feel trapped in a cycle of fear, distress, and
     uncertainty, which can impact their overall well-being and satisfaction with life.

     Nursing Care

     Nursing care of the individual with illness anxiety disorder begins with building a trusting relationship. The nurse
     should foster an environment where the client feels comfortable expressing their concerns, fears, and anxieties
     openly. The nurse should actively listen, validate their feelings, and provide reassurance that their concerns are
     being taken seriously.

     Assessment/Screening Tools
     When assessing and screening clients with illness anxiety, it is important for nurses to employ a comprehensive and

sensitive approach. Begin by conducting a thorough medical history, paying attention to the individual's health
concerns, past medical experiences, and any significant life events that may have contributed to their anxiety.
Explore their thoughts, ideas, and beliefs about their symptoms.

Assess the specific symptoms that are causing distress for the individual. Document the nature, duration, severity,
and impact of these symptoms on their daily life. Use open-ended questions to encourage the individual to express
their concerns and fears regarding their health. Evaluate the impact of illness anxiety on the individual's daily
functioning, relationships, and quality of life. Determine if the anxiety is causing significant distress, avoidance
behaviors, or interference with their ability to engage in normal activities.

Evaluate the individual's mental health status, including any history of anxiety disorders, depression, or previous
psychological treatments. Assess their overall emotional well-being, coping strategies, and stress levels. Determine
if there are any significant life stressors that may be contributing to their anxiety. Observe the individual's behavior
and communication patterns during the assessment. Document their nonverbal cues, such as body language or
physical manifestations of anxiety, which can provide additional insights into their condition.

Utilize validated screening tools/questionnaires, such as the Health Anxiety Inventory, the Illness Attitude Scale, or
the Whiteley Index, to assess illness anxiety symptoms and severity. These tools can help quantify the level of
anxiety and provide a standardized measure for monitoring changes over time.

        LINK TO LEARNING

Access the Health Anxiety Inventory (https://openstax.org/r/77HltAnxyInvtry) to see an example of a standardized
screening tool for IAD.

Make sure to engage the individual in a collaborative discussion, allowing them to express their concerns, fears, and
beliefs openly. Be mindful of cultural factors that may influence the individual's beliefs, attitudes, and expression of
health concerns. Respect cultural diversity and incorporate cultural sensitivity into your assessment approach.
Foster a nonjudgmental and empathetic environment that encourages trust and promotes effective communication.

Approaches to Treating Illness Anxiety Disorder
The treatment of illness anxiety disorder aims to alleviate the excessive health-related worries and anxiety
experienced by individuals and restore maximum functioning. Here are some approaches commonly used in treating
IAD (French & Hameed, 2023):

    · Cognitive behavioral therapy: CBT helps individuals identify and challenge their irrational thoughts and beliefs
        about health concerns. The therapist works with the individual to reframe catastrophic thinking patterns and
        replace them with more realistic and balanced thoughts.

    · Exposure and response prevention (ERP): ERP is a component of CBT with specific focus on prevention, that
        is, confronting anxious thoughts, objects, or situations and making a choice not to respond. It involves
        gradually exposing individuals to situations that trigger health-related anxiety and allowing them to confront
        their fears in a controlled manner.

    · Mindfulness techniques: Mindfulness techniques, such as "here and now" exercises, meditation, and
        breathing exercises, can be helpful in managing anxiety and reducing the preoccupation with physical
        symptoms.

    · Education: Providing education about illness anxiety disorder and how it differs from genuine medical
        conditions can be beneficial. It also helps clients recognize triggers and develop strategies to cope with
        anxiety effectively.

    · Supportive therapy: Supportive therapy focuses on providing emotional support, empathy, and validation to
        individuals with illness anxiety disorder. Supportive therapy can help individuals feel understood and can
        facilitate the development of a trusting relationship with health-care providers.

    · Medication: In some cases, medication may be part of the treatment plan for illness anxiety disorder.
        Antidepressant medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), can help manage
        associated anxiety. A psychiatrist or advance practice provider should collaborate to evaluate and monitor
        medication carefully.

Summary

21.1 Psychological and Behavioral Factors in Somatic Symptom Disorders

Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) is a condition that occurs when a client is focused on physical symptoms to the
point of significant distress and disruption of normal functioning. Risk factors include a history of childhood trauma,
family history of SSD or mental health disorders, certain personality traits, and sociocultural traits affecting views on
illness. Examples of behaviors commonly associated with SSD include excessive preoccupation with physical
symptoms, high utilization of health-care services, disproportionate distress and anxiety, and impairment in daily
functioning. The level of impairment to the client's daily life can vary from mild to severe, depending on the severity
and frequency of the symptoms. Nursing care for clients with SSD includes a nonjudgmental approach, a thorough
history and assessment, collaborative planning with the health-care team, and goal setting so the client can live the
most functional life possible.

21.2 Functional Neurological Disorder

Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a condition where an individual experiences one or more altered motor or
sensory neurological symptoms that cannot be attributed to a specific medical or neurological condition. Risk
factors for FND include a history of trauma; previous medical conditions; other mental illness, such as anxiety or
depression; family history; and certain sociocultural factors. Client symptoms include dizziness, gait disturbance,
numbness and tingling, and psychogenic seizures. FND affects clients' lives in numerous ways, including
interpersonal relationships, employment status, financial status, and more. Nursing care involves a nonjudgmental
approach with education to help the client understand the condition and access effective evidence-based
treatments, such as CBT.

21.3 Factitious Disorder

Factitious disorder is a mental health condition in which individuals intentionally and consciously fabricate or induce
physical or psychological symptoms in themselves or another. Risk factors include a history of trauma, an underlying
personality disorder, and a desire for attention and sympathy. Client behaviors associated with factitious disorder
include intentionally fabricating symptoms, sometimes to the point of self-injury (or injuring the victim), and
manipulative behavior, especially around health-care professionals.

Factitious disorder can create serious and lifelong issues for the client and for the victim. Factitious disorder can
lead to psychological disorders, permanent physical problems, dysfunctional interpersonal relationships, legal
issues, and more. Nursing care for factitious disorder involves a nonjudgmental, interprofessional approach,
supportive care, referral to appropriate counseling and medical services, boundaries and ethical considerations, and
long-term follow up, management, and monitoring.

21.4 Illness Anxiety Disorder

Illness anxiety disorder is a mental health condition characterized by excessive worry and fear about having a
serious medical condition, despite having little or no medical evidence to support the belief. Clients with illness
anxiety have few to no somatic symptoms. Risk factors include anxiety or depression, childhood experiences with
illness, life stressors, personality traits, and excessive use of medical information. Behaviors associated with illness
anxiety disorder include intense focus on mild or normal physical sensations, regular checking of the body, frequent
medical visits and excessive testing and diagnostics, too much online research, or unwarranted avoidance of
activities perceived as risky for one's health. Illness anxiety can cause disruptions in a person's everyday
functioning, having a negative impact on social and occupational functioning, emotions, and overall quality of life.
Nursing care for someone with illness anxiety disorder focuses on providing support, education, and reassurance to
help the individual manage their anxiety and concerns about their health and maximize functioning.

What Should the Nurse Do?

You are the RN working with twenty-four-year-old Carey, who is diagnosed with somatic symptom disorder. Carey
has withdrawn from college courses due to inability to drive to school and stay seated through class because of back
pain. You evaluate Carey's medical record, which contains diagnostic imaging, vital signs, and blood work, all with
normal results. You find no medical history of injury. Carey's self-report: "I have something wrong with my back. The
doctors can't figure out what is wrong with me." Carey sits slumped in the chair with downcast gaze and states,
"Only my mom understands me. She takes care of me."

    1. How will you show nursing sensitivity to the client's report?
    2. From where should you be gathering your information for a full and accurate assessment of this client and

        what information might you obtain?
    3. Which assessment questions would be important to ask Carey in gathering information for a full and accurate

        assessment?
    4. What are some signs and symptoms that might suggest the presence of SSD in this client?
    5. What are some potentially helpful interventions for this client?

Competency-Based Assessments

    1. As a nurse, come up with a plan to approach a client who denies the psychological components of their
        somatic symptoms. How can you promote trust and collaboration in the therapeutic relationship?

    2. Discuss a scenario where a client with somatic symptom disorder expresses frustration with their health-care
        providers. How can nurses advocate for improved communication and coordination among the health-care
        team to enhance client satisfaction and outcomes?

    3. Think about a scenario in which a client with functional neurological disorder is resistant to psychiatric
        interventions. How can nurses explore alternative therapeutic approaches and engage the client in their care
        plan?

    4. As a nurse working on an interdisciplinary team, how would you advocate for effective communication and
        coordination among team members to provide holistic care for a client with functional neurological disorder?

    5. Think about the ethical considerations related to caring for a client with factitious disorder. List at least two
        resources within the workplace and two personal behavior changes nurses can make to assist professional
        interactions with these clients. Share your list with one peer.

    6. Imagine a scenario where you are seeing a client with illness anxiety disorder who insists on multiple medical
        tests despite consistently negative results. How can you engage the client in a collaborative discussion to
        explore underlying concerns and develop a holistic care plan?

    7. Ethically, how should nurses balance the provision of reassurance to clients with illness anxiety disorder

Sexual Dysfunction and Gender Dysphoria

CHAPTER OUTLINE
22.1 Categories of Sexual Dysfunction
22.2 Paraphilias
22.3 Gender Dysphoria

INTRODUCTION Sexuality is a central aspect of human identity. As children grow and develop, they are socialized
into categories dictated by the dominant culture by things such as their name, their clothes, and their toys. Young
children soon learn to identify with a particular gender, denoting a masculine or feminine status according to cultural
expectations. Gender identity continues to develop through the process of puberty to be sexually mature, capable of
giving rise to the next generation of human beings (Testa et al., 2015).
The concept of sexuality and its many dimensions is extremely complex and varied. Consider recent changes in
completing demographic forms. No longer are individuals asked to identify as merely male or female, but now have
many other choices, such as neither male nor female, binary, nonbinary, or prefer not to state. Regardless of these
changes in terminology, the concepts of sexuality and identity, and their overlap, are rife with emotion for many
people. Nurses are entrusted with many of the intimate details of people's lives, and issues surrounding these
concepts frequently arise. Nursing education programs vary in their approach to human sexual development and
sexual behavior. Regardless of any formal preparation and knowledge about human sexuality, psychiatric nurses
sooner or later find themselves drawn into a conversation where a client is experiencing distress related to their
sexual identity, orientation, health, illness, or specific behavior.
Nurses are encouraged to think and speak in terms of gender inclusivity, and to welcome those in their care to share
726  22 · Sexual Dysfunction and Gender Dysphoria

     their preferences. This positively affects access to health care by supporting inclusivity.

     According to the World Health Organization (WHO), sexual health is a critical aspect of human development and
     well-being (2023a). To realize sexual health, individuals must have sufficient and accurate knowledge about sex and
     human sexuality and the ability to access health care that affirms sexual health. The term sexual health refers to the
     absence of reproductive infections and diseases, unintended pregnancy, sexual dysfunction, and harmful practices,
     such as female genital mutilation and sexual violence.

     Although external genitalia play important roles in the arousal and expression of human sexuality, the brain plays a
     dominant role in sexual arousal. Sexual arousal includes not only physiological responses to stimulation of the
     external genitalia, but also sexual fantasy and imagination. Here the brain plays a central role in organizing sensory
     stimuli, including touch, sight, smell, taste, and sound. The brain also processes the role that society and culture
     play in the experience of sexual arousal and sexual behavior.

     The term sexual dysfunction is used to describe difficulties that individuals and couples experience in terms of
     sexual desire, arousal, physical and psychological response, and specific sexual behavior. Sexual difficulties may
     occur in myriad ways within the individual and/or between sexual partners. Some such difficulties are associated
     either directly or indirectly with medical conditions or surgical treatments for specific diseases, such as cancer or
     metabolic disease. Not all sexual dysfunctions result in diagnosis of a psychiatric condition. Many circumstances of
     sexual dysfunction are common and temporary. Some remit spontaneously and others may require the professional
     assistance from a licensed sex therapist (Wincze & Weisberg, 2015).

     DSM-5-TR Terminology Related to Sexual Dysfunction

     The DSM-5-TR (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2022) provides detailed descriptions of eight specific
     sexual dysfunctions:

         · delayed ejaculation
         · erectile disorder
         · female orgasmic disorder
         · female sexual interest/arousal disorder
         · genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder
         · male hypoactive sexual desire disorder
         · premature (early) ejaculation
         · substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction

     Two additional categories included in the DSM-5 are other specified sexual dysfunction and unspecified sexual
     dysfunction (p. 509). These categories are identified to address symptoms of a sexual dysfunction that do not
     include all of the criteria identified for the eight categories in the preceding list. The DSM-5 descriptions include
     diagnostic criteria and features of each disorder; associated features, such as greater detail about the specificity of
     symptoms a person experiences; prevalence; how the dysfunction typically develops; factors that increase risk for
     and predict prognosis of the disorder; information about comorbidities; and gender- and culture-related diagnostic
     issues. Each description also carries important information about differential diagnosis to help the practitioner
     distinguish between the disorder and other conditions with similar symptoms.

     Sexual dysfunctions constitute a group of disorders wherein a person's ability to experience sexual pleasure or to
     respond sexually to erotic stimuli are diminished or missing. Such experiences cause the individual ongoing and
     often serious distress. Although sexual dysfunctions have many characteristics in common with one another, they
     are a group of disorders with wide variation. Sexual dysfunctions affect all sexes and include subtypes such as

lifelong, which refers to a dysfunction that has existed since an individual's first sexual experience, or acquired,
which refers to a dysfunction that becomes apparent after the individual has had normal sexual function or behavior
for some period of time. Other subtypes include generalized versus situational. Generalized dysfunctions mean that
the experience occurs regardless of the circumstances or settings, including one's partner(s) or with any or all types
of stimulation, whereas situational disorders mean that the dysfunction occurs in only select circumstances or
settings, with specific types of stimulation, or only with a specific partner or partners. In addition to these subtypes,
some of the disorders are further specified as mild, moderate, or severe, referring to the extent of the clinical
distress experienced by the individual with the disorder.

Sexual Response Cycle
To understand sexual dysfunction, it is critical to have some understanding of the sexual response cycle, which is a
uniquely human process that is the pattern of physiological changes that occur in the human body during sexual
arousal, stimulation, and engagement in sexual behavior (Crooks & Baur, 2017). Regarding the physical aspects of
this cycle, the research team of obstetrician/gynecologist William Masters and therapist Virginia Johnson pioneered
a study of human sexuality characterized by direct observation. Masters and Johnson described a four-phase model
for males and females in 1966: excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution. There are distinctive differences
between males and females. There is also much variation among individuals and their response to actual or
imagined sexual activity. Two common physiological processes do occur in both males and females during sexual
arousal, however: vasocongestion and myotonia. Vasocongestion refers to the swelling and filling of specific bodily
tissues with blood as arteries in the body dilate in areas, such as the penis, clitoris, and nipples. Myotonia refers to
muscle tension that occurs in the body throughout sexual arousal and excitement. This tension can be found in both
voluntary and involuntary muscles throughout the body and is most evident in the muscle spasms characteristic of
orgasm.

In sexual arousal, arteries dilate throughout the body, but particularly in the external genitalia, and these tissues
become swollen, red, and engorged with blood. In males, this is manifest in the erection of the penis, whereas in
females this is manifest in enlargement of the clitoris as well as in enlargement of the labia and nipples. This first
phase of the sexual response cycle is known as excitement. In this first phase, vaginal lubrication also begins.

The second phase of sexual arousal is known as plateau and is characterized by several physiological changes in the
body. Involuntary muscle contractions in the hands and feet begin to occur and cardiorespiratory changes are
apparent in increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, and more rapid breathing. The third phase, orgasm, is
marked by involuntary muscle spasms throughout the body, including contractions of the uterus and rectal
sphincter. Cardiorespiratory mechanisms continue to be elevated and reach their peaks. During this phase, the male
ejaculates seminal fluid into the urethra and out the urinary meatus. Following orgasm, males, but generally not
females, experience a refractory period in which orgasm cannot occur again until the tissues return to their pre-
arousal states. The length of this period is quite varied, ranging from minutes to hours or days. In contrast to males,
females can experience multiple orgasms in quick succession, but this varies depending upon factors, such as age
and emotional attraction to one's partner.

The final phase of sexual arousal, according to Masters and Johnson (1966), is known as resolution and is
characterized by genitalia returning to pre-arousal states, the lowering of cardiorespiratory responses, and an
overall period of relaxation. There is variation among individuals for each of these phases. In general, however, there
is greater variability in the sexual response patterns of females than of males (Crooks & Baur, 2017).

Many sexual dysfunctions are related to one or more chronic conditions, such as spinal cord injury, stroke, diabetes
mellitus, sleep apnea, depression, and alcohol abuse. In many cases, the diagnosis of substance use disorder, for
example, is made instead of the sexual dysfunction diagnosis. These chronic conditions often compromise the two
biological functions of vasocongestion and myotonia, and once the biological condition improves, the sexual
dysfunction may improve as well. In some cases, the diagnostic symptoms may actually be attributable to some
other nonsexual mental disorder, such as post-traumatic stress disorder.

Sexual dysfunction may be related to a number of psychological factors alone or in combination with the preceding
chronic conditions noted. Stressors related to daily living may lead to generalized anxiety, thus forming a deterrent
to sexual arousal. Anxiety, for example, may arise out of concern for unplanned pregnancy and result in the lack of
sexual desire or arousal. Interpersonal relationships or communication issues between sexual partners may
728  22 · Sexual Dysfunction and Gender Dysphoria

     contribute to sexual dysfunctions. A mental disorder such as major depressive disorder is another source of some
     sexual dysfunctions. Periods of social isolation, such as incarceration or the COVID-19 pandemic, may also
     contribute to the development of sexual dysfunctions. The experiences of childhood sexual abuse or exploitation
     (e.g., trafficking) or interpersonal violence in adolescence or adulthood may also result in diagnosable sexual
     dysfunctions.

     Male Sexual Dysfunction
     Male sexual dysfunctions include (1) hypoactive sexual desire disorder, (2) erectile disorder, (3) delayed ejaculation,
     and (4) premature (early) ejaculation. It is important to mention here that the diagnoses of sexual dysfunctions as
     described in the DSM-5 may appear not to fit gender-diverse individuals. In most instances, the diagnosis is made
     based on the person's current anatomy and not on the basis of their sex assigned at birth. This is an area that
     requires sensitive clinical judgment, which includes serious consideration of the moral and ethical questions that
     accompany the provision of gender-affirming care. Such care depends on a multidisciplinary approach, including
     nursing, and a need for more research (Gerritse et al., 2018; Gerritse et al., 2022).

     Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder
     Hypoactive sexual desire disorder includes the lack or negligible experience of sexual desire either prior to or during
     the sexual experience. This condition of hypoactive desire applies to thoughts and fantasies as well as to actual
     behavior. To meet the diagnostic criteria, the condition must have persisted for at least six months and cause a
     clinically significant amount of distress. As in other sexual dysfunctions, it may be further specified as mild,
     moderate, or severe. Decreased activity of the ovaries or testes, or hypogonadism, can cause endocrine disorders,
     such as low levels of testosterone. Some prolactin-producing pituitary tumors may result in hypoactive sexual
     desire.

     The prevalence of this disorder increases with age and with alcohol use and may occur with smoking and obesity. It
     is found more often in males older than sixty years of age than in those under age twenty-five. The prevalence varies
     across cultures and appears to be higher in males from Southeast Asia than in those from Northern Europe. This
     disorder is also reported more often by homosexual males than by heterosexual males (APA, 2022).

     Hypoactive sexual desire disorder may co-occur with erectile and/or ejaculation disorders as well as depression. An
     erectile disorder is difficulty in obtaining or maintaining a penile erection or experiencing a significant decrease in
     the rigidity of the erection during sexual activity. An ejaculation disorder is a pattern of ejaculation occurring either
     prematurely or delayed. The experience of prolonged difficulty in achieving or maintaining an erection may lead to a
     person's loss of interest or desire in sexual activity. The condition may also be influenced by the characteristics of
     the person's relationship with a sexual partner whose interest in sexual activity may be altogether different. When
     making this diagnosis, it is important to be mindful of communication and sexual desire patterns of the person as
     well as situational stressors, such as the loss of a job or death of a close family member or friend. Consider also
     conservative religious beliefs and practices when describing and treating this disorder. For example, in a study of
     Orthodox Jewish couples, Friedman (2019) found that one of the most frequently reported problems was inhibited
     arousal and orgasm in the males related to their religious belief system and attitudes toward sexuality. Moreover,
     Friedman pointed out that sex education was limited among Orthodox Jewish couples and that they often do not
     know how to talk with one another about their sexual needs and desires.

     Until recently, clinicians, researchers, and the general public have viewed the sexual response cycle of males to be
     relatively uniform. Researchers in one study, however, documented five different classes of arousal and response
     that are unique to males, different in duration of sexual experiences, and variable in terms of relationship
     satisfaction (Busby et al., 2020). These researchers found that despite differences in arousal and desire, the groups
     of males in this study did not differ significantly from each other by age, income, educational level, religiosity,
     number of children, or sexual orientation. Although this study was limited by not including a representative sample,
     it does provide findings that could help reduce the stigma or pressure some males may feel surrounding this
     disorder.

     Erectile Disorder
     Erectile disorder refers to a person's difficulty in obtaining or maintaining a penile erection or a significant lack of
     rigidity of the erection during sexual activity at least 75 percent of the time they engage in sexual activity. This
     disorder may be further classified as mild, moderate, or severe in terms of the amount of distress it causes.

     Access for free at openstax.org
22.1 · Categories of Sexual Dysfunction                                                                                      729

Erectile disorder has been implicated in fertility problems among males and may be identified in individuals with
other sexual dysfunctions, such as early ejaculation. In addition, many individuals who experience erectile disorder
may experience reduced self-esteem and self-efficacy. They may also feel a loss of masculinity and an increase in
anxiety and depression.

The condition varies by age. It is seen more often in males over seventy years of age and much less often in those
under forty years of age. When erectile disorder occurs in younger populations, the distress associated with it is
higher than when it occurs in older populations. Although relatively less is known about childhood sexual abuse in
boys compared with what is known about girls, boys who are victims of sexual abuse often suffer from altered
feelings of masculinity, shame, and guilt (Gewirtz-Meydan & Ofir-Lavee, 2021). According to literature reviewed by
Gewirtz-Meydan and Ofir-Lavee (2021), males who have experienced childhood sexual abuse are much more likely
than other males to experience sexual dysfunction accompanied by feeling anxious and distressed. In addition, as
children, the survivors of sexual abuse may lack the ability to trust others and thus develop difficulties with intimate
relationships.

Certain surgical and medical factors can play a substantial part in the occurrence of acquired erectile disorder later
in life. For example, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and diabetic neuropathy are known causes of
erectile dysfunction in males. In the case of TURP, prostate tissue is removed through the urethra, and often causes
swelling and pain or it may result in damage to nerves that affect the process of erection. More recent robotic
surgery for prostate cancer has reduced the damage to the urethra, but urinary problems remain to some extent
during the healing process, which may lead to erectile difficulties in some males (Feng et al., 2020). In diabetes
mellitus type 2 (T2DM), elevated blood sugars over a long period of time damage nerves and blood vessels in the
penis. Males with erectile dysfunction related to T2DM may find improvement with better glucose control, weight
loss, decreased intake of alcohol, and increased exercise.

Difficulty in obtaining and/or maintaining sufficient erection of the penis for sexual activity may also be related to the
use of both legal and illicit drugs. It is likewise not uncommon among clients who have cardiovascular, endocrine,
and/or neurological conditions, including those with spinal cord injuries. Users of enzyme inhibitors and
neuropsychiatric medications report a high incidence of adverse effects in this regard (Kaplan-Marans et al., 2022).

        LIFE-STAGE CONTEXT

Age Differences between Client and Nurse

The sexual response cycle in adulthood has both biological and psychosocial underpinnings. After reaching sexual
maturity, physiological changes in hormones, muscles, and the circulatory system may contribute uniquely to the
development of a sexual dysfunction. For example, an adult with cancer may experience changes in sexual
functioning (e.g., difficulty with erection of the penis) related to the location of the disease or the negative effects of
the treatment.

Many nursing students and new graduate nurses may have only recently completed puberty. They may still be trying
to figure out their own sexual orientation and gender identity when they find themselves observing the struggles of
clients with concerns about sexuality. Given that sexual dysfunctions tend to increase with age, discussing this
diagnosis with clients may be particularly difficult for young nurses. Similarly, older nurses may find that a client who
is experiencing a sexual dysfunction is near their own age, or the age of their parents. An encounter with such a
client may trigger conflicting feelings within the nurse. Nevertheless, whereas it is important for the nurse to
acknowledge their own feelings and concerns, the focus should be on giving the client permission to express their
feelings about their condition and working together to seek a solution.

Having a support group of other nurses may help them to process their feelings and thoughts about how to give
supportive care to others. It is important to remember, as well, that many of the sexual dysfunctions may be
secondary to another disorder, such as substance misuse or spinal cord injury. Thus, it is possible to discover, for
example, that a young male who sustained a spinal cord injury from a skiing accident also experiences an erectile
dysfunction. It is good to remember that sexual dysfunction, in general, may have multiple causes.
730  22 · Sexual Dysfunction and Gender Dysphoria

     Premature and Delayed Ejaculation
     Premature or early ejaculation is the most common sexual dysfunction, seen almost universally in males' first sexual
     experiences. It is defined as ejaculation that occurs within one minute of penetration. To be a dysfunction, the
     concern must have been apparent 75 to 100 percent of the time for at least six months (APA, 2022). It may also
     occur in nonvaginal sexual contact (e.g., males having sex with males). Some estimates state that 20 to 30 percent
     of males ejaculate early at some time in their lives. As with any sexual dysfunction, it is important to consider the
     many factors that may be contributing to the dysfunction. These factors include the partner's health,
     communication patterns, one's history of sexual or emotional abuse, comorbidities, such as anxiety or depression,
     and medical history. The condition is more common in cultures where arranged marriages are the norm (APA, 2022).

     Delayed ejaculation means that an individual experiences either a marked delay or absence of ejaculation. To be
     diagnosed with this, according to the DSM-5, the client must have experienced these symptoms for a period of at
     least six months and it must cause the client serious distress. The term "marked delay" does not have a precise
     definition and could vary with the male's sexual partner at a given time.

     The lifelong subtype begins with early sexual experiences and the prevalence of the condition increases with age.
     Delayed ejaculation has been associated with reduced androgen levels within the aging process. Several medical
     conditions may interfere with one's ejaculatory function. Endocrine and neurological disorders, such as spinal cord
     injury, epilepsy, and stroke, may lead to delayed ejaculation. Similarly, several drugs, including alcohol, may disrupt
     ejaculation. It is not unusual to find older adult males who stop taking their antihypertensive medications because
     of the associated delayed ejaculation experience.

     Delayed ejaculation causes substantial psychosocial distress in males and in their partners. In couples who hope to
     have children, this disorder might be a major hurdle and needs to be discussed during fertility assessment. Although
     the issue might not meet the full set of criteria as a psychiatric diagnosis, it is a treatable condition well known to
     psychotherapists.

     Female Sexual Dysfunction
     Female sexual dysfunctions include (1) female orgasmic disorder, (2) sexual interest/arousal disorder, and (3)
     genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder. The female sexual response cycle has been shown to be highly variable, but
     many practitioners have historically been unaware of this, leading to erroneous labeling of female arousal as
     "dysfunctional" (Leavitt et al., 2019).

             PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

     Literature Review of Stress Related to Sexual Dysfunction in Females

     A systematic literature review showed that female sexual dysfunction is more strongly related to relationship stress
     than it is for males (McCabe & Connaughton, 2017). In this paper, the authors reviewed studies of sexual
     dysfunction in both males and females. They found that females who experienced sexual dysfunction also reported
     high degrees of stress in their relationships. Based on this review of studies, however, they were not able to
     conclude whether the stress caused the sexual dysfunction or the sexual dysfunction caused the stress in the
     female's relationship with her partner. One of the studies reviewed did show that relationship stress was a predictor
     of low sexual desire and arousal in females. They suggested that, for females in particular, treatment of sexual
     dysfunction would be more successful if the treatment also included working on improvement of their relationship.
     This phenomenon did not hold true for males with sexual dysfunction in the studies included in this systematic
     review.

     Orgasmic Disorder
     An orgasmic disorder is disordered frequency or intensity of orgasm during sexual arousal and stimulation. The
     diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder is made when a client has either infrequent, delayed, low-intensity, or absent
     orgasm the majority (i.e., 75 to 100 percent) of the time the client engages in sexual activity. This situation must
     have existed for at least six months at the time of diagnosis and caused a great deal of stress in the client. As with
     many other sexual dysfunctions, this disorder may be classified as mild, moderate, or severe (APA, 2022).

     Female orgasm is a highly unique and varied phenomenon. Some females require stimulation of the clitoris to

22.1 · Categories of Sexual Dysfunction                                                                                    731

experience orgasm whereas others may have this experience solely through penile-vaginal intercourse. For many
females, orgasm may be consistently stronger and satisfying with self-stimulation than with sexual intercourse. As a
diagnosed sexual dysfunction, female orgasmic disorder is accompanied by anxiety and is frequently associated
with relationship problems. Physical health problems, such as spinal cord injury, radical hysterectomy, diabetes, or
multiple sclerosis and medications used to treat these conditions may contribute to the development of this
disorder. Sociocultural factors, such as religion or arranged marriages, may also contribute to the development of
this disorder.

Although sexologists have studied the female sexual response cycle for decades, there is no precise definition of
what female orgasm is. Individual females describe the sensation of orgasm in different terms and have unique
expectations for what it "should" be. As already noted, the sexual response cycle consists of two physiological
processes of vasocongestion and myotonia. In the models described by Masters and Johnson as well as Bancroft
and Janssen, female orgasm occurs when cardiorespiratory rates reach a peak during sexual activity and the female
experiences involuntary muscle spasms in areas throughout the body, including the muscles of the pelvic floor and
the uterus. Sexologists have investigated the reports that numerous females have made about experiencing orgasm
that is connected to an area of sensitivity in the anterior wall of the vagina. This area is known as the Gräfenberg
spot (a.k.a. "G-spot"), named for the gynecologist who first described this erotic area (Crooks & Baur, 2017). The
phenomenon of the "G-spot" remains controversial. Physicians from Yale Medical School conducted a systematic
review of literature and concluded that there is "no irrefutable evidence" for its existence (Kilchevsky et al., 2012, p.
724). These researchers also confirmed that the anterior wall of the vagina is quite sensitive and that scientific
attention to this phenomenon has contributed to a more positive view of female sexuality by the public.

Sexologists' descriptions of female orgasms simply address the physiological changes that occur in the body, but
the individual brings myriad psychosocial factors into the experience of orgasm, and there is undoubtedly much
variation in expectations and outcomes among diverse females (Vieira-Baptista et al., 2021). As noted in the
descriptions of other sexual dysfunctions, psychosocial factors, such as cultural and religious upbringing, adverse
childhood experiences, and sex education or the lack thereof, may converge to form the context in which the
individual anticipates and experiences orgasm.

Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder
A sexual interest/arousal disorder is greatly reduced or lack of interest in or arousal by sexual stimulation. To meet
DSM-5 diagnostic criteria of female sexual interest/arousal disorder (APA, 2022), the client must exhibit at least
three of the following six symptoms:

    · absence or reduction of interest in sexual activity
    · absence or reduction of erotic or sexual thoughts and fantasies
    · absence or reduction of initiating or responding to sexual activity with a partner
    · absence or reduction of pleasure or excitement during sexual activity
    · absence or reduction of sexual interest or arousal to a variety of visual, written, or verbal erotic cues
    · absence or reduction of physical sensations in genital and nongenital areas of the body during sexual

        encounters

This arousal disorder is estimated to exist in about one of every three females (APA, 2022) and is often found in
tandem with other female sexual dysfunctions, such as dyspareunia (painful intercourse) and orgasmic disorder.
These conditions depend a great deal on context and a complete assessment of the client's biopsychosocial history,
relationships, communication patterns, levels of stress, and mood disorders. Religion and cultural beliefs may also
play a major role in the development or continuation of this disorder. The condition is also affected by age; duration
of symptoms is an important feature to consider.

Sexual Pain Disorders
In females, genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder is also known as dyspareunia. Genito-pelvic pain/penetration
disorder may be attributed to a female's frequent and persistent experience of (a) pain with vaginal penetration, (b)
anxiety or actual pain felt in the vulva, vagina, or pelvis during attempts at vaginal penetration, (c) anticipation of
such pain, leading to anxiety or fear, or (d) intense tightening of the pelvic floor muscles (vaginismus) during
attempts or actual vaginal penetration (APA, 2022). Very strong, involuntary contractions of the pelvic muscles
during vaginal penetration is called vaginismus.
732  22 · Sexual Dysfunction and Gender Dysphoria

     Approximately one out of every ten females experience vestibulodynia, which refers to an experience of severe
     pain at the entrance to the vagina (Crooks & Baur, 2017). A recent randomized clinical trial showed that a
     multimodal treatment of physical therapy combined with biofeedback and dilation had better treatment outcomes
     than application of topical lidocaine ointment in reducing this pain (Morin et al., 2021). Other conditions that can
     cause pain deep in the pelvis during intercourse include stretching of the uterine ligaments and endometriosis.
     Painful intercourse may be related to a wide variety of other factors: inadequate arousal, lack of adequate
     lubrication, hormonal changes throughout the menstrual cycle and aging process, and sexual transmitted infections
     (STIs). Painful intercourse has also been found to be related to the client having a negative self-image of her
     genitalia (Crooks & Baur, 2017).

     Both males and females can experience dyspareunia, but it is more common among females. In males, dyspareunia
     may be associated with uncircumcised foreskin that is too tight. Infections of the genitourinary system can also lead
     to experiences of dyspareunia in either sex. Males who are diagnosed with Peyronie disease also experience
     dyspareunia. This condition is the result of calcium deposits in the shaft of the penis, and it often leads to a curved
     or "bent" position of the shaft, which may interfere with erections and sexual intercourse (Crooks & Baur, 2017).

     Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) in females as well as males has been associated with opioid use disorder (OUD) and its
     treatment and is worthy of investigation in populations undergoing OUD treatment (Reichmann et al., 2022). For
     females, CPP may be associated with menstrual cramping as well as sexual intercourse. For males, CPP is generally
     associated with prostatitis and sexual dysfunction. In both sexes, CPP diminishes quality of life.

     Stressors Reported by Clients Associated with Sexual Dysfunction

     Clients with sexual dysfunctions have reported a wide range of stressful experiences, which they may view as
     antecedents or consequences of the specific disorder. Sexual behavior is intimately connected to one's sexual
     identity and is highly visible in American society. Childhood experiences of sexually curious exploration are
     normative, but other childhood experiences of abuse and exploitation are traumatic and may leave indelible and
     damaging impressions on individuals. The adolescent phase of development is characterized by an expanded view
     of oneself as a sexual being. Learning to accept the changes of one's physical body from that of a child to that of an
     adult, capable of reproduction, is a significant part of this development. Sexual awareness and arousal become
     more important as puberty unfolds. When sexual expectations are met, human sexuality can become an exciting
     and valuable part of life, while unmet expectations may create stress.

     Some individuals experience great conflict if they are prescribed medications that are intended to enhance their
     quality of life but result in a sexual dysfunction. Some of these drugs, including antihypertensives, have unintended
     consequences that affect sexual arousal and functioning. Experiencing a sexual problem in response to taking
     prescribed drugs may be very stressful to some people. Similarly, some individuals who experience chronic pain
     may develop sexual difficulties in response to their pain, or the pain may exacerbate an existing sexual dysfunction
     (Wincze & Weisberg, 2015). The lack of estrogen may result in vaginal dryness that is then accompanied by pain
     with vaginal penetration. Although this is not an uncommon complaint as people age, it may be associated with
     other symptoms of sexual dysfunction and become an added stressor for the client. There is also confusion about
     terminology to address the experience of pain. Such terms include vulvodynia, vaginismus, and vestibulodynia,
     which are not included in the DSM-5 (APA, 2022).

     Clients with serious mental illnesses may seek to maintain intimate relationships, including sexual activities, with
     partners. Stress related to expressing this wish honestly to family and health-care providers, and utilizing treatment
     strategies, can be overwhelming. This could result in the client ignoring their sexual needs. Nurses can provide
     permission for these clients to open up about their needs for intimacy. They can also provide staff education to
     promote the sexual health and safety of their psychiatric clients (Hortal-Mas et al., 2020).

     Stressors Reported by Males
     Sexual dysfunctions in males may occur at any stage of development, but they tend to increase with age. As already
     noted, however, some dysfunctions are temporary and may be related to intrapersonal and interpersonal
     experiences. For example, low self-esteem or a feeling of weak masculinity may result in lack of confidence in the
     ability to attain or maintain an erection of sufficient rigidity or time to satisfy the partner. Thus, the intrapersonal
     psychological state will influence the interpersonal sexual relationship. This complexity of factors blends with
     biological and cultural factors to create perplexing situations related to sexual functioning. Comorbidities, such as

diabetes and hypertension, may contribute to the increased prevalence of sexual dysfunctions in older males.
Sociocultural influences, such as the use of drugs, including alcohol and marijuana, may also contribute to the
sexual dysfunction experience (Ghadigaonkar & Murthy, 2019).

The development of sexual dysfunctions in males depends, in part, on several of the social determinants of health,
including knowledge deficit. Despite their overall educational level, many males lack knowledge about their sexual
anatomy and physiology that can lead to an undesired alteration in sexual functioning. Inadequate role models
during critical times of sexual development may subsequently impact both knowledge, skills, and confidence in
pursuing sexual activity with a consenting partner. Early childhood experiences that included trauma may contribute
to sexual dysfunction. Children who have been sexually abused can often develop feelings of guilt and shame
(Gewirtz-Meydan & Ofir-Lavee, 2021). Depending on the situation and the communication patterns within the family,
these victims may not have received help. Communication skills are essential for effective sexual expression, and
these skills have their origins in early childhood.

Persons who have diagnosable sexual dysfunctions experience distress that may include (Gewirtz-Meydan & Ofir-
Lavee, 2021):

    · feeling guilt or shame
    · feeling anxiety or anger associated with sexual behavior
    · being afraid of being touched by a potential sexual partner
    · lacking the ability to trust others
    · feeling helpless to change one's feelings or behaviors

Stressors Reported by Females
Hamilton and Meston (2013) examined the effect chronic stressors may have on sexual arousal in females.
Distraction was found to be a significant factor. Of note is that the distractions were naturally occurring, ongoing
stressors in the females' lives and not those manipulated for the purpose of the study. According to Sathyanarayana
et al. (2018), one study in the United States revealed over 40 percent of females experience some form of sexual
dysfunction, with 22 percent of females experiencing low sexual desire. Sathyanarayana et al. (2018) investigated
the effect of addictive disorders and chronic use of substances on sexuality. Individuals may turn to substance use
to enhance sexual performance, though this may have the opposite effect (Sathyanarayana et al., 2018). The
research found that therapy is best focused on the couple, the relationship, and the individual aspects of their
sexual function (Sathyanarayana et al., 2018). Literature review by Galanakis et al. (2015) found that females' daily
life stressors of fatigue, anxiety, and disease (such as diabetes or psoriatic arthritis) negatively affect relationship
quality and, therefore, negatively affect sexual desire and sexual experience.

        CULTURAL CONTEXT

Culture and Female Genital Mutilation (FGM)

Sexual dysfunctions in some females are related to cultural practices involving various forms of circumcision or
genital cutting. Referred to as female genital mutilation/circumcision (FGM/C) by the World Health Organization
(WHO) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), FGM/C is practiced in many countries in the Middle East and
Africa. There are several types of FGM/C, mostly performed on five to fourteen-year-olds, that include
clitoridectomy, in which all or part of the clitoris is removed; excision of the clitoris and the labia minora and majora;
infibulation; and nicking or pricking. Infibulation is the most severe form of this procedure and involves removal of
the external genitalia and stitching the vaginal opening to prevent penetration. The infibulated area must be forced
open to allow for sexual intercourse and childbirth. These procedures are now considered child abuse by the WHO
and the United Nations. These practices have great cultural meaning that revolves around femininity, premarital
virginity, and marital fidelity (WHO, 2024a). Strong beliefs are related to the specific cultures that condone these
practices, but there are signs of shifts occurring in specific countries where females are beginning to share their
voices and fathers are joining in the efforts to end these practices (Mwendwa, 2020).

several cultures in which this practice is ongoing and identifies variations in the types of procedures that are done to

     young girls. She also discusses the physical, emotional, and spiritual harm that these rituals can cause in young girls
     and how this affects them as they get older. The article concludes with specific suggestions for practitioners working
     with female clients who have experienced FGM, which begins with health-care professionals becoming familiar with
     the various types of FGM and communicating with sensitivity and cultural humility.

     Many females who immigrate to the United States have undergone female circumcision or infibulation with
     subsequent complaints of vaginismus, orgasmic disorder, or vestibulodynia. Although these may not rise to the level
     of psychiatric diagnoses, they are aspects of sexual dysfunctions about which nurses must be aware and a sensitive
     area of client-centered care.

     The young woman in this video experienced FGM (https://openstax.org/r/77FemaleGenMuti) at age six as part of her
     culture in Somalia. At the age of twenty-nine, she discusses the trauma of the actual cutting, the lack of discussion
     about it within her family after the fact, and the lack of response from medical personnel in the years since that day.

     Nurses' Potential Reactions to Clients with Sexual Dysfunction Issues

     Nurses may encounter adults with sexual dysfunction issues in many different settings, ranging from general adult
     health clinics to postoperative in-hospital settings. They may also encounter such clients in psychiatric outpatient or
     inpatient settings. Regardless of the settings, nurses need self-awareness of their own attitudes about sexuality,
     knowledge about the vast variety of sexual issues related to health, and communication skills that enable them to
     assess and respond to clients with actual or potential problems. The less aware nurses are of their own sexuality,
     the less likely they are to respond in a sensitive, timely, and appropriate manner to the sexual concerns of their
     clients.

     Nurses may fail to see potential or actual sexual concerns in their clients for several reasons. First, they may not
     think of their clients as sexual beings. They may lack confidence in their knowledge of human sexual development
     and behaviors and, similarly, they may lack experience in discussing aspects of human sexuality with other
     individuals. Their own culture and upbringing may create barriers as well (Williams & Addis, 2021).

     In a descriptive study of nursing students in Pakistan, Jadoon et al. (2022) found that baccalaureate students had
     generally positive attitudes about addressing sexual health in their clients, but they felt uncomfortable or
     embarrassed in doing sexual assessments of people of the opposite gender. In another study of midwifery students
     in Turkey, researchers found that the students were restricted in asking questions about sexual health as part of
     their care plan; the students did not complete the sexuality component of their care plans (Serin et al., 2020). Many
     of these students felt the topic was private, and they were embarrassed to ask clients about sexual matters.
     Moreover, these students felt that their culture and religion established sexual taboos that restricted their ability to
     provide this aspect of client care.

     Nursing education has a responsibility to include information about human sexuality in prelicensure programs as
     well as in graduate programs for advanced practice roles. Without exposure and opportunities to practice
     assessment, communication, and referral skills, nurses may feel confused and embarrassed when issues related to
     sexuality arise. Lack of adequate preparation leads to avoidance of this essential topic in health-care settings.
     Nurses need to be aware of the salience of sexuality and intimacy to overall health and well-being of persons in their
     care (Quinn & Happell, 2011; Quinn & Happell, 2013). Moreover, students should consider enrolling in electives in
     sociology, psychology, or human development on the topic of human sexuality.

     Nurses may have encountered adverse childhood experiences that included sexual abuse or exploitation that stand
     as a barrier between them and providing sexual health care to clients. Some nurses in clinical settings experience
     sexual harassment by clients, visitors, and other hospital staff members. If nurses feel sexually unsafe in their work
     environment, this will present an enormous barrier to their ability to provide competent nursing care, particularly in
     areas that include sexual health matters.

Nursing Interventions and Management

Nursing interventions and management of individuals experiencing sexual dysfunctions are related to the nurse's
self-confidence and competencies in dealing with sexual health issues in general. Nurses' responses to their clients
are influenced by their own upbringing and sociocultural experiences throughout their lifetime. It is important to
acknowledge that issues concerning sexual health may trigger earlier or ongoing sexual experiences of the nurse.
This is a very critical area in which nurses, and nursing students, must be willing to do some serious self-reflection
to determine their comfort with and ability to address the sexual issues of those persons entrusted to their care. If
nurses have unresolved conflicts or trauma related to sexual experiences in their earlier lives or if they are currently
experiencing their own issues related to sexuality or sexual relationships, they will not be able to provide the
compassionate and knowledgeable care that is required of them in giving care to clients with actual sexual
dysfunctions.

Basic human sexuality education is critical in preparing nurses to manage clients who have been diagnosed with
sexual dysfunctions. Such education provides the student and the graduate nurse with a beginning vocabulary and
understanding of the erotic and reproductive organs and processes within the human body. Utilizing cues from
nursing assessment, which includes client collaboration, priority problems may be identified as:

    · altered interest in others
    · altered self-interest
    · altered sexual activity
    · altered sexual excitation
    · altered sexual role
    · altered sexual satisfaction
    · decreased sexual desire
    · perceived sexual limitation
    · seeks confirmation of desirability
    · undesired alteration in sexual function

Accompanying these priority problems are related factors, including clients having inaccurate information and
inadequate knowledge about sexual function, lack of privacy, unaddressed abuse, value conflict, inadequate role
models, and perceived vulnerability. Each of these factors constitutes an area in which nurses can begin a
conversation with clients about sexual dysfunction.

PLISSIT Model
In 1976, Jack Annon developed and published the Permission Limited Information Specific Suggestions, and
Intensive Therapy (PLISSIT) model to address behavioral problems related to human sexuality. This acronym has
provided an easy-to-remember set of steps that nurses can follow in delivering sexual health care to clients. The
four steps of the PLISSIT model are:

        P = permission
        LI = limited information
        SS = specific suggestions
        IT = intensive therapy

Each step in this model requires additional comfort, education, and experience before the practitioner can apply it,
but having an awareness of the steps involved in managing the nursing approach to sexual dysfunction is a good
place to start. Annon's original assumption was that most people who had sexual problems could solve these
problems by following the steps of having permission to discuss them, and by receiving limited information, specific
suggestions, or intensive therapy. Although nursing students and recent graduates may not have received adequate
and detailed sexuality education to enable them to provide specific suggestions or intensive therapy, they can give
clients permission to talk about sexuality and may also be able to provide limited information that would be helpful
to the client. A recent study of nurse practitioners (NPs) revealed that even with advanced education, these NPs felt
inadequately prepared to manage clients with dyspareunia, pelvic pain, or erectile dysfunction (Cappiello &
Boardman, 2022).

     The PLISSIT model of sex communication (https://openstax.org/r/77PLISSIT) demonstrates the steps of giving
     permission, limited information, specific suggestions, and intensive therapy as a conceptual approach to working
     with clients experiencing sexual health issues.

     In 2007, Taylor and Davis expanded the PLISSIT model, revising the name to be Extended PLISSIT or ExPLISSIT
     (explicit) model as it has come to be known. In their extension, Taylor and Davis reiterated that the very first step,
     permission (i.e., giving permission to a client to talk about their sexual health and concerns), should not be assumed
     or overlooked by rushing to more detailed steps. They underscored the importance of giving the client permission at
     any and all steps to talk about their sexual health needs and concerns. The Extended PLISSIT model outlines a
     process that begins with self-awareness, leads to reflection, then moves on to review, knowledge, and challenging
     assumptions. Each of the four steps includes permission, followed by reflection and review. Reflection and review
     apply to both client and nurse. The nurse needs to understand that just because the subject has been discussed on
     one occasion, it has not necessarily been resolved. Rather, it provides the opportunity for further permission-giving,
     reflection, and review.

     Overall Health Benefits on Sexual Health
     The World Health Organization (2024b) describes sexual health as similar to overall health, that is, not only the
     absence of disease, but also general well-being for every person. Cardiac health is essential for circulatory function,
     physical energy, and endurance--all of which can affect sexual activity and response. Individuals living with
     hypertension may have these concerns. The American Heart Association (AHA) (2023) recommends partnership
     with health-care providers to manage high blood pressure. The AHA further endorses heart-healthy measures to
     contribute to overall health, and to sexual health, consisting of balanced low sodium diet, maintenance of physical
     activity and healthy weight, low alcohol consumption, no tobacco use, and stress reduction (2023).

     Kudesia et al. (2021) describe a plant-based dietary approach to women's health. Addressing topics of fertility,
     sexual disorders, and menopause, the authors assert a dietary connection, even phrasing this as a public health
     initiative. Kudesia et al. advocate a wellness focus for the U.S. health-care system, while acknowledging existing
     disparities within the system (2021).

     Proposing an orientation away from risk and disease, Mitchell et al. (2021) call for a wellness public health focus
     concerning the concept of sexual well-being. Utilizing a biopsychosocial model, the authors address public health
     aspects that impact sexual well-being, such as human migration patterns and the COVID-19 pandemic.

     Human sexuality is evident throughout the lifespan. As people age, they may experience changes in hormonal
     structure as well as changes in muscle tissue that create dysfunctions involving the pelvic floor. This can result in
     urinary incontinence in addition to a lack of interest and arousal for sexual activity (Buyuk et al., 2021). Learning to
     strengthen the pelvic floor may be important for clients who have experienced trauma to the external genitalia and
     may also enhance their ability to experience sexual arousal and satisfaction. Teaching clients how to do Kegel
     exercises may be part of the limited information or specific suggestions that nurses can share. Kegel exercises are
     also important following childbirth for the person who has given birth to strengthen the muscles of the pelvic floor.

22.2 Paraphilias

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Discuss terminology from the DSM-5-TR relative to paraphilias
    · Describe stressors reported by clients due to paraphilias
    · Identify nurses' potential reactions to clients with paraphilias
    · Apply evidence-based nursing management of client/family distress as related to these conditions

A paraphilia is a sexual desire or behavior involving inanimate objects or nonconsenting other persons, or including
subjugation. For example, some people are aroused and find sexual pleasure and gratification by fantasizing about
or actually engaging with articles of clothing. Other people may be aroused and find sexual pleasure and experience
orgasm by exhibiting their genitalia to nonconsenting individuals. Still others may find sexual pleasure dressing up
differently than they typically would, such as dressing as a different gender. Most of these paraphilic fantasies and
behaviors are more common in males than in females (APA, 2022); often, such thoughts and behaviors begin in
childhood and may be exacerbated by adverse childhood experiences.

There is still debate as to whether some of these uncommon phenomena exist on a continuum of normal sexual
arousal and behavior or whether they should be considered deviant (Castellini et al., 2018). Some of these
paraphilic behaviors, such as pedophilia or sexual sadism, are illegal because they result in harm to other people.
Others, such as fetishes (e.g., being sexually aroused by a person's shoes), do not necessarily harm other people,
thus may be considered along a continuum of normalcy. Regardless of these classifications, there are situations in
which the personal fantasies, thoughts, and behaviors associated with paraphilias rise to the level of psychiatric
diagnoses, requiring psychiatric nursing and medical care.

DSM-5-TR Terminology Related to Paraphilias

A variety of uncommon sexual practices are considered paraphilias and may be diagnosable psychiatric disorders.
To rise to the level of psychiatric diagnosis, a paraphilia must cause intense distress or impairment to oneself and/or
to others (APA, 2022; Castellini et al., 2018). In the DSM-5, the eight specific paraphilic disorders identified are:

    · fetishistic disorder
    · transvestic disorder
    · voyeuristic disorder
    · exhibitionistic disorder
    · frotteuristic disorder
    · sexual masochism disorder
    · sexual sadism disorder
    · pedophilic disorder

Two other categories identified in the DSM-5 are other specific paraphilic disorder and unspecified paraphilic
disorder (APA, 2022). For all these disorders, the diagnostic criteria are that the sexual arousal experienced by the
client is both intense and recurrent for a minimum of six months and that the feelings, urges, and behaviors create
marked distress or impairment in the client's social functioning. "Other" and "unspecified" paraphilia means they do
not meet all the diagnostic criteria for the other paraphilic disorders or that there is insufficient information to make
a complete diagnosis (APA, 2022). The category of diagnosable psychiatric disorders known as paraphilias may
refer to behaviors carried out by a person alone, in a consensual relationship with another person, or in a
nonconsensual relationship that often carries legal consequences with it.
738  22 · Sexual Dysfunction and Gender Dysphoria

     Solitary Behaviors
     In the period after World War II, the so-called "sexual revolution" of the 1960s and 1970s led to changing attitudes
     about what sexual topics and behaviors were increasingly tolerated in American society (Crooks & Baur, 2017). With
     the increase in scientific study of sexual attitudes and behaviors (i.e., sexology), topics that had previously been
     taboo in society began to be understood in a more permissive light. For example, the sexology team of Masters,
     Johnson, and Kolodny (1988) clarified that masturbation, the process of providing sexual pleasure to oneself, was a
     solitary sexual behavior that provided comfort and gratification to adults and children alike. They confirmed that it
     was a phenomenon also seen in other members of the animal kingdom. They also debunked several previous myths
     about masturbation, including beliefs that it could be habit-forming, or unnatural. As the sexual revolution unfolded
     in America and sexologists began to publish the results of their research, much more is now known about the
     difference between sexual fantasies and behaviors as well as the difference between what sexual behaviors are
     "common" and healthy versus those that are unusual, offensive, and illegal. The human sexual repertoire is not a
     simple continuum from common to extreme, but there is much variation. Paraphilias in solitary behavior may involve
     a pattern of thoughts or actions specific to sexual arousal. Unless the thoughts or behaviors are distressful or
     harmful to the person, intervention is not required.

     Fetishism
     A fetishistic disorder refers to a paraphilia in which an individual has had intense and recurring sexual arousal from
     the use of nonliving objects, such as garments, or a highly specific focus on nongenital body parts. The individual
     with this disorder acts on fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors that result in great distress or social impairment.
     When making the diagnosis, the disorder may be specified with a body part (typically not genitalia), with an
     inanimate object(s), or with combinations of these. For example, a person may have a foot fetish as well as a shoe
     fetish, deriving sexual arousal and gratification from both a specific part of the body and a related garment. Another
     person may have a fetish involving wearing female undergarments while engaging in foreplay with a female. If this
     person is not distressed by this behavior and the sexual partner views this as consensual, however, it would not
     meet the diagnostic criteria of a fetishistic disorder. A client with a diagnosable disorder may be aroused by more
     than one object or situation; some individuals acquire vast collections of the desired inanimate objects, such as
     shoes or leather boots.

     Transvestism
     A transvestic disorder refers to a paraphilia in which the person becomes sexually aroused or has urges and
     fantasies about becoming sexually aroused from cross-dressing (i.e., dressing in items usually worn by a different
     sex) and the person experiences great distress and social impairment from this situation. Some people enjoy
     dressing up as the opposite sex, but do not meet the diagnostic criteria of having this disorder because they lack the
     emotional distress and social impairment associated with the diagnostic category. This practice, and the mental
     disorder, may be more common in males than in females and often has its origin in childhood (Zucker et al., 2012).
     In some cases where cross-dressing is habitual in a male, it may also be accompanied by gender dysphoria (see
     Gender Dysphoria).

     Behaviors Involving Others
     Sexual fetishes are often experienced only as urges or fantasies. As such, they do not involve behaviors that are
     enacted with or toward another person. The behaviors that do involve others are, in general, enacted without the
     consent of the other. This lack of consent may lead to legal consequences. For example, pornographic depiction of
     children as sexual objects is illegal and can result in incarceration of the adult in possession of pictures, videos, etc.
     (Crooks & Baur, 2017). Examples of these behaviors are voyeurism, in which one is sexually aroused and satisfied
     from watching others, against their knowledge, as they undress or are in the nude; exhibitionism, in which one
     exposes their external genitalia to another, nonconsenting individual; frotteurism, in which one rubs against another
     person's body for sexual gratification; and pedophilia, in which one engages in sexual behavior with a child (who is
     unable to consent). Sadism also is a sexual behavior that involves another person and brings harm to them because
     the perpetrator inflicts physical or psychological suffering.

     In a study of young adults attending six universities in Italy, Castellini et al. (2018) found that 68 percent of the
     sample admitted to having experienced paraphilic fantasies at some time during their lives. These researchers
     found that voyeurism was the most common paraphilia reported by males and females, whereas females tended to
     act on fetishism and masochism more often than males. These behaviors can be subject to criminal prosecution if

injury or death occurs, regardless of consent status of the participants.

Voyeurism
The term voyeurism means the experience of intense and recurring sexual arousal from observing another person,
who is unsuspecting and nonconsenting, naked, undressing, or engaging in sexual activity. The person diagnosed
with a voyeuristic disorder acts on the sexual urges involving a nonconsenting other person or in fantasies.
Moreover, the person who engages in such behavior also experiences great distress or social impairment. This is one
of the most common illicit paraphilias and is found more often among males than among females. A person must be
at least eighteen years of age to receive this diagnosis to distinguish it from the natural curiosity associated with
puberty. Although the exact cause of this disorder is unknown, there is evidence that it is associated with childhood
sexual abuse, hypersexuality, and substance misuse; comorbid conditions may include attention-deficit
hyperactivity disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety (APA, 2022).

Voyeurism also has legal implications. With the advancement in technology has come a new form of voyeurism
known as "video voyeurism." In this situation, the perpetrator may place a small camera in a public or private
bathroom and record strangers' genitalia during urination. Or they may place the camera on the ceiling of a room
and record sexual activity of others. In addition to their own sexual gratification, they may sell the videos to others.
Currently, almost all states have laws to prohibit these activities, but the laws are difficult to enforce (Crooks & Baur,
2017).

Exhibitionism
Sexual arousal that comes from displaying one's external genitalia to another nonconsenting person is called
exhibitionism. If the nonconsenting "other" is a child, then it is possible that the client also has a pedophilic
disorder (APA, 2022). An individual diagnosed with exhibitionistic disorder has both intense and recurring sexual
arousal from the exposure of their genitals to an unsuspecting and nonconsenting other person (child, adult, or
both) for a period of at least six months and has acted on the urges or experiences great distress and social
impairment as a result. A person could have an exhibitionistic sexual interest, but not act on the interest and,
therefore, would not meet the criteria for the psychiatric diagnosis.

Although the diagnosis may be found in both males and females, it is far more common in males than in females.
Among males, the interest in this behavior may arise in adolescence and eventually wane in older age. Antisocial
behaviors or antisocial personality disorder may be a precursor or increase the risk for developing this disorder.
Alcohol use and pedophilic disorder are also commonly associated with exhibitionistic disorder. High rates of
comorbidity have been found in bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, and substance use disorder as well (APA,
2022).

Frotteurism
The term frotteurism is the sexual arousal that comes from touching or rubbing against another nonconsenting
person. As with other paraphilic disorders, to meet the DSM-5 criteria for psychiatric diagnosis, the behavior must
be exhibited at least three times over six months and the client must experience great distress (e.g., shame, guilt,
anxiety) and social impairment (e.g., difficulty working). Most studies indicate that approximately 8 to 9 percent of
males in North America may have this tendency (Savoie et al., 2021), but most do not meet the diagnostic criteria
(APA, 2022). Frotteurism has been associated with various neurocognitive disorders, including schizophrenia, and
substance intoxication. The condition may also be seen in individuals with conduct disorder and antisocial
personality.

Sexual Masochism
The paraphilia sexual masochism disorder is where an individual has intense and recurring sexual arousal from
being made to suffer from being beaten, bound, or humiliated. The sexual urges, behaviors, or fantasies lead to the
individual feeling great distress or impairment in social or other important situations. This type of paraphilia may be
specified as "with asphyxophilia" or "autoerotic asphyxia" when an individual achieves sexual arousal from
restricted breathing (Crooks & Baur, 2017).

Sexual Sadism
Sexual sadism is sexual arousal that results from inflicting physical or psychological suffering on another person.
The diagnosis in which an individual has intense sexual arousal from the suffering of another person and is
740  22 · Sexual Dysfunction and Gender Dysphoria

     distressed and socially impaired by this arousal is called sexual sadism. Sadistic behaviors may include those that
     are gentle and playful, such as soft biting, but they may also be highly violent, such as the intense pain inflicted with
     violent rape or torture (Masters et al., 1988), which would have legal implications.

     The term bondage-domination-sadism-masochism (BDSM) is broadly used to refer to a wide range of behaviors that
     individuals with sexual masochism and/or sexual sadism (as well as other individuals with similar sexual interests)
     engage in, such as restraints or restriction, discipline, spanking, slapping, sensory deprivation (e.g., using
     blindfolds), and dominance-submission role-play involving themes, such as master/enslaved person, owner/pet, or
     kidnapper/victim (APA, 2022).

     Pedophilia
     Pedophilia is the intense sexual arousal of an adult by a child or children. The paraphilia in which an individual, age
     sixteen years or older, is intensely attracted to a child or children and may engage in actual sexual behavior,
     including vaginal or rectal penetration is called pedophilic disorder. To reach the level of psychiatric diagnosis, the
     intense attraction, fantasies, urges, and/or actual behaviors must have continued for a period of at least six months,
     the child victim must be at least five years younger than the perpetrator, and the perpetrator must have been very
     distressed by this behavior, or the behavior must have resulted in great social problems (APA, 2022). Criminal law
     varies by state under statutory rape, child abuse, or sex offender categories. It is possible that an adult has a
     pedophilic sexual interest, which means that they are sexually aroused by children or engage in sexual fantasies
     involving children, but they do not overtly behave in a sexual way with children.

     Pedophilia is considered a crime in the United States, so the individual with this psychiatric diagnosis requires
     particular attention. A condition known as emotional congruence with children is often an attribute found in persons
     who have either pedophilic sexual interest or pedophilic disorder. Emotional congruence in this sense means that
     the individual (adult) has feelings and thoughts that may be more like those of children than of adults. Moreover, this
     type of individual tends to prefer to spend more time with children than adults, including working in occupational or
     volunteer roles involving children in a variety of settings. Although it is uncommon in females, the prevalence in
     males is estimated to be about 3 percent. The intensity of the actual disorder may fluctuate throughout one's life,
     generally with onset in puberty. Many males may have been sexually abused as children themselves. Other
     attributes that may be found in the person with a paraphilic disorder include impulsivity, antisocial personality,
     substance intoxication, and a high degree of willingness to take risks. This disorder may occur with other paraphilic
     disorders, such as exhibitionistic disorder or may be diagnosed concurrently with obsessive-compulsive disorder,
     depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder (APA, 2022).

     Stressors Reported by Clients Associated with Paraphilias

     As noted earlier, not all paraphilias are illegal or deviant. Rather, many individuals may experience erotic stimulation
     and arousal from any number of different inanimate objects. When the fantasy or urge to act on these feelings is
     translated into actual behavior that is harmful to oneself or others, paraphilias become problematic. As with all the
     paraphilias identified in the DSM-5-TR, two criteria must be met for the diagnosis. The first criterion is the recurrent
     nature of the behavior, urge, or fantasy over a period of six or more months, and the second criterion is that the urge,
     fantasy, or behavior "cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty" (APA, 2022, p. 792). When behaviors cause
     harm or distress, they may become diagnosable psychiatric disorders. Some also have associated legal implications.
     The distress that one experiences with the diagnosis of a paraphiliac disorder may include anxiety, depression, guilt,
     shame, stigma, and loneliness. The stressors associated with paraphilic disorders may create psychological pain for
     which a client seeks relief through other behaviors, such as excessive gambling, eating, or drinking (Crooks & Baur,
     2017).

     Comorbid conditions that have been associated with paraphilias include dysthymia (a mood disorder), major
     depressive disorder, substance misuse, and childhood attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (Pang, 2023). Clients
     with these disorders are often managed with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications to reduce
     excessive fantasizing. Cognitive behavioral therapy may provide some assistance with the motivation to engage in
     associated compulsive behaviors (Pang, 2023).

     Nurses' Potential Reactions to Clients with Paraphilias

paraphilic disorders. Nurses' responses to clients with paraphilias may depend upon whether the paraphilia is illegal
and/or if it reaches the level of a psychiatric disorder. A particularly salient aspect of paraphilias is the individual
client's behavior. Many people may have urges or fantasies that involve a paraphilia, but they do not actually act out
that urge or fantasy. Such thoughts and feelings are not illegal. Exhibitionism, pedophilia, and voyeurism, if enacted,
however, are illegal (Yakeley & Wood, 2014).

Initially, nursing students may be curious and intrigued by the description of sexual arousal and other sexual
behaviors that are different from or similar to their own. This is a normal response, and they should be encouraged
to read and learn about differences in sexual interests and behaviors as much as any other area of human attributes
that may be different from or similar to their own.

        LINK TO LEARNING

Read this report of original research done with university students in Italy (https://openstax.org/r/77adversesexexp)
to learn more about the relationship between paraphilias, hypersexuality, and adverse childhood sexual
experiences.

Nurses are cautioned to be nonjudgmental in their attitudes about those whose behavior is drastically different from
their own, and this applies also to clients who have been diagnosed with paraphilic disorders. What may add to
confusion in this particular area of human behavior, however, is the lack of consensus about what is normal,
abnormal, or how criminal penalties apply. Some of the paraphilic disorders (e.g., pedophilic disorder) are against
the law, because of the harm they can do to children. The nursing student, faculty, and practitioner should know the
laws of the state in which they work so that reporting suspected or actual criminal behaviors, especially when they
pertain to children, can be done consistently and without reservation. It is also important to remember the
difference between urges and fantasies versus actual behaviors. It is not criminal to experience urges or fantasies
about sexual expression, but it may be criminal to enact such expressions.

Some nursing students and practicing nurses may find some of their own sexual arousal described in the
paraphilias. This attests to the view that sexual arousal may exist along a continuum in many cases rather than a
clearly dichotomized prevalence of normal versus deviant. Wherever one's arousal and preferences lie, it is essential
that nursing students learn to be self-aware and self-reflective. When attitudes and beliefs lie outside one's
consciousness, they have the potential to be misunderstood and create havoc in one's daily lives. If a student or
practitioner discovers that their sexual behaviors are congruent with the diagnosable paraphilic disorders, it is
imperative that they seek help from another health professional with specialized training in sexual dysfunction
therapy, psychiatric advanced practice nursing, or other similar certifications (e.g., American Association of Sex
Educators, Counselors, and Therapists [AASECT]).

Nursing Interventions and Management

Nurses who work in psychiatric or mental health settings may encounter clients with paraphilias; similarly, those
who work in prisons or juvenile detention settings may also encounter clients who have enacted these behaviors
and are now serving the criminal or sex offender punishments as a result. Nursing education at both entry level and
graduate, advanced practice seeks to promote quality and safety through adherence to basic competencies. One of
the most helpful of these competencies for nurses adjusting to rapid changes in sexuality content is to understand
the concept of evidence-based practice (EBP).

The process to achieve EBP is a growing conversation. Bell (2020) reflects upon progress made. Themes identified
by Bell (2020) through study of the literature include that nurses must:

    · begin with a sense of inquiry and determine a clinical question
    · locate research evidence to address the clinical question and think critically about application of the evidence
    · implement practice change that incorporates nursing expertise and client preference with the evidence
    · evaluate the outcome of the change
    · work to share and sustain EBP

These themes are aspects of the nursing process and nurses' clinical judgment. EBP is a model for building nursing

     expertise. To paraphrase anthropologist and scholar, Margaret Mead (1901-1978), who found that culture, not
     biology, determines gender, nurses should learn how to think, rather than what to think. Due to rapid developments
     in science and diversity awareness, nurses can no longer depend on tradition and routine for practice guidance.

     Some topics of concern to nurses do not have published literature review or meta-analyses. With respect to the
     topic of paraphilias, the nursing literature does not provide much guidance, so one must venture into databases
     outside nursing to obtain evidence about this population and the health issues they experience. Nurses in clinical
     practice may develop a journal club in which they can find and evaluate current literature to enhance their basic
     understanding of human sexual functioning and behaviors.

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Discuss terminology from the APA DSM-5-TR relative to gender identity
         · Describe stressors reported by clients due to gender dysphoria

         · Identify nurses' potential reactions to clients with gender dysphoria

     Gender is a social construct and an individual experience (WHO, 2024b); people learn to act in accordance with the
     socially constructed expectations of their gender as they grow up. A person's sex is determined by a person's
     chromosomes, reproductive organs, and other characteristics; we typically determine sex by the genetic makeup of
     an individual as 46,XX (female) or 46,XY (male). The society in which an individual develops holds specific norms
     about roles, responsibilities, and behaviors to which individuals are expected to conform. These norms are based on
     the society's beliefs about what male and female roles, responsibilities, and behaviors "should" be. A person's
     gender identity is their deeply held internal perception of their gender. Generally, "cisgender" individuals are those
     whose gender identity and often their roles and behaviors are congruent with their sex. Other people may identify as
     both male and female or neither male nor female; some believe that they are not in the right body. Some terms in
     current use include genderqueer or genderfluid, which fall under the broader term of "nonbinary" (Clark et al.,
     2018). Transgender is a broad term that can be used to describe people whose gender identity is different from the
     gender they were thought to be when they were born. A transgender woman is a person who was assigned male at
     birth but who identifies and/or lives as a woman; a transgender man was assigned female at birth but lives as a man.
     Some, but not all, transgender or nonbinary people may experience gender dysphoria, a distress or unease that can
     occur when one's gender identity does not match their sex assigned at birth. The DSM-5-TR defines the term as "a
     marked incongruence between one's experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender" (APA, 2022, p. 511).
     More specifically, gender dysphoria is defined as a condition that must persist for at least six months and leads to
     significant dissatisfaction or discomfort.

     In recent years, the subject of gender dysphoria has come to the forefront. There is greater awareness of children
     and early adolescents who persistently feel that they are in the "wrong body" (Testa et al., 2015). In a
     representative sample of high school students living in San Francisco, 3.4 percent reported either being sure they
     were Transgender or seriously questioning if they were (Johns et al., 2019). Many of these young people experience
     gender dysphoria and other mental health problems, including suicide attempts (Lowry et al., 2018).

     Many parents of children who believe they were assigned the wrong sex at birth seek medical and psychological
     attention because of the extreme distress experienced by these children. Some children may express their
     disappointment and frustration associated with gender dysphoria at as young as four years of age; many display
     clinical depression and suicidal ideation and attempts (Olson et al., 2015). Medical response to this angst has
     resulted in the increased use of puberty blockers to help early adolescents and their families deal with these mental

health issues. Puberty blockers are drugs (usually gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists [GnRHa]) that are
prescribed for those children when they reach Tanner stage 2. The purpose of these drugs is to stop the process of
puberty temporarily, giving the child and family more time to determine the authenticity and determination of the
child's desire to transition to the other sex; this is one aspect of a phenomenon known as gender-affirming care
(Edwards-Leeper et al., 2016).

The use of puberty blockers is part of the expert guidelines for children with gender dysphoria provided by the
Endocrine Society in the United States (Hembree et al., 2017) and the World Professional Association for
Transgender Health (Coleman et al., 2022). The use of these drugs is controversial because few longitudinal studies
have been done to support the claim that they are reversible and cause no long-term consequences. These drugs
have been shown to be safe in treating children with other endocrine disorders, such as precocious puberty (Lee et
al., 2014). The limited studies completed to date provide some evidence that these hormones decrease lean body
mass and height velocity; they are also credited, however, with providing hope and improved psychological
functioning to gender-dysphoric youth (Rew et al., 2021).

The U.S. health-care system has been developed historically within the context of gender as a binary construct
(Kilicaslan & Petrakis, 2019). That is, persons were assigned male at birth merely from the appearance of the
external genitalia (penis and scrotum with or without descended testicles), or female from the appearance of the
vulva and vaginal opening. These birth assignments have generally not been made from analysis of chromosomes
that would confirm the male as 46,XY and the female as 46,XX. A cisnormative person has a gender identity that is
congruent with their biological sex, or sex assigned at birth (Cicero & Wesp, 2017), whereas others may be identified
as gender diverse (i.e., Transgender, Queer, Intersex, agender). Persons who do not identify as cisgender frequently
experience health disparities related to stigma and discrimination related to their sexual identity and expression
(Puckett et al., 2018).

Many persons who experience gender dysphoria engage in a process of transition from the sex assigned at birth to
the sex they believe they are. These people may identify as Transgender or trans. Owing to a lack of understanding
on the part of much of society, including those providing health-care services, they often experience a lack of
appropriate services and, therefore, frequently avoid seeking routine health-care screenings and other services. The
actual meaning of transition is highly individualized, meaning not all trans people take hormones or undergo
cosmetic or gender-affirming surgery, especially when considering the cost of these services and lack of available
providers.

        REAL RN STORIES

Nurse: Calvin N., RN ADN
Years in Practice: 2+ years
Clinical Setting: Public family clinic
Geographic Location: Tampa, FL

I completed my associate degree nursing program in December 2021. My roommate for the last two semesters was
Dex, and the two of us had spent every waking moment studying, being in class or clinical, or "socializing" with other
students, which meant we were either studying for an exam or working on a group project.

The night of graduation, Dex went back to the apartment while I spent a few hours celebrating. When I got home,
Dex had bags packed and was waiting to tell me goodbye. I asked what was going on--and I did say it wasn't
necessary to explain because I could see Dex was preoccupied. I was surprised to learn that Dex had decided to put
nursing on hold to pursue getting gender affirmation surgery.

After Dex left, I thought a lot about the situation and realized that I had only known Dex as a hard-working,
stressed-out nursing student just like me. Thinking back, Dex was sort of a loner and seemed sad much of the time.

Since graduation, I have been working in a public family clinic and it has been great! There is a pediatrician on staff
who has referred several adolescents to a multidisciplinary team for gender dysphoria and I am glad to see that
these issues can be addressed early on.

     It is expected that health-care providers will be responsive to the unique needs of Transgender individuals and
     develop gender-affirming care. WPATH, the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, "is an
     international, multidisciplinary professional association whose mission is to provide evidence-based care,
     education, research, public policy, and respect in transgender health" (Coleman, et al., 2022, p. S3). WPATH has
     published Standards of Care since 1979 to guide health-care professionals in providing safe care for gender-diverse
     individuals.

             LIFE-STAGE CONTEXT

     Age-Related Matters of Transgender Behaviors

     The age at which a child begins to experience the incongruence between assigned gender and preferred gender
     varies widely. One study indicated the onset of symptoms of gender dysphoria in children as young as four years of
     age (Olson et al., 2015). Children and adolescents with gender dysphoria exhibit a variety of psychosocial problems
     that may include illicit drug use, binge drinking, symptoms of depression, and suicidal ideation (Zou et al., 2018).
     Some of their behavioral problems are responses to perceived parental and/or sibling rejection (Schmitz & Tyler,
     2018). The early adolescent, assigned female at birth, with gender dysphoria may bind the breasts during puberty
     hoping to appear more masculine. Similarly, the young person who was assigned male at birth, may bind the
     scrotum to appear more feminine. These behaviors emphasize the extreme discomfort the child with gender
     dysphoria has for their own body.

     Gender Identity

     Gender identity is a category of social identity that differs from sex (APA, 2022). It is one's sense of self as being a
     male, female, or another gender, such as genderfluid or gender neutral. During childhood, children explore gender
     roles and may try on behaviors more commonly seen in the other sex. Feedback from parents, siblings, and peers
     helps to shape their sense of identity. In addition, the larger culture in terms of the location of their home, school,
     and religious affiliation provides enlarged areas in which to experience what it means to be male or female. During
     puberty, one's identity is of central importance as the adolescent is in the developmental stage of deciding who they
     are. This decision process is complex and involves reflection on earlier stages of life and ongoing stages of
     exploration and experimentation. In emerging adulthood, one ultimately integrates the many possible selves into an
     identity that strongly influences one's education, occupation, social relationships, and self as a mature sexual being
     (Harter, 2015).

     It is important to make the distinction between sexual orientation and gender identity. The common acronym
     LGBTQIA+ refers to both sexual orientation and gender identity. The term queer may be used to describe either
     sexual orientation or gender identity; Q may also refer to questioning about one's orientation, identity, or sexual
     expression (Cicero & Wesp, 2017).

             LINK TO LEARNING

     This link presents a video of several Transgender youth who clarify terminology (https://openstax.org/r/

     The word dysphoria means to feel dissatisfied or very unhappy. For individuals who experience gender dysphoria,
     they may feel this dissatisfaction and unhappiness in at least three general ways: physical, social, and mental. In
     terms of the physical domain, people with gender dysphoria are generally unhappy with the sexual parts of their
     body. For example, a person who was assigned the sex of male at birth may feel very unhappy to have the external
     genitalia of a penis and scrotum. Some children who were assigned male at birth (AMAB) have even announced that
     they wanted to or actually tried to cut off their own penis. In terms of the social domain, people with gender
     dysphoria are generally unhappy or dissatisfied with how they are expected to act or dress. For example, the person
     AMAB may state that they want to wear dresses and not pants; they may also want to change their name from John
     to Johanna, for instance. In terms of the mental domain, people with gender dysphoria are generally quite certain
     that they are inhabiting the wrong body and cannot believe that the sex assigned to them at birth is truly accurate

for who they really are.

Stressors Reported by Clients Owing to Gender Dysphoria

Children and adolescents who experience gender dysphoria may find schools to be hostile environments.
Harassment, bullying, and discrimination are not uncommon, even in early childhood. As a result, many children,
already feeling depressed and lonely because of their confusing gender identity, resort to using tobacco and alcohol.
Most schools lack policies that would protect Transgender children and adolescents, which may lead to excessive
absenteeism and victimization (Cicero & Wesp, 2017). It is important to note that gender diversity itself is not a
psychiatric disorder or diagnosable illness. The child, adolescent, or adult who experiences gender dysphoria may
also feel psychosocial distress that may manifest as symptoms of depression, anxiety, or eating disorders, however
(Diemer et al., 2015).

The prevalence of gender dysphoria in the general population is relatively low, but the stress experienced by this
underrepresented group is relatively enormous, sometimes even leading to and resulting in suicide. Suicidal
ideation is particularly high in people of color who also experience discrimination related to their sexual orientation
and gender identity (Sutter & Perrin, 2016). Insecurity, inferiority, irritability, shame, fear, loneliness, and
hopelessness are among the stressful feelings associated with gender dysphoria (Testa et al., 2015).

Studies have shown that individuals who experience gender dysphoria not only experience heightened anxiety and
suicidal ideation, but they experience ongoing concerns about gender-affirming health care (Edwards-Leeper et al.,
2016; Reisner et al., 2015). For example, transmasculine individuals, those who are assigned female at birth, do not
identify as female and may seek hormone therapy or gender-affirming surgery. In particular, those from racial and
ethnic underrepresented populations face unique barriers to reproductive health-care services. They continue to be
at high risk for STIs, HIV, and unplanned pregnancy (Agenor et al., 2022). Most health-care services that address
gynecological care are provided under labels such as "women's health," but this term does not reflect the sensitivity
needed to provide similar services to Transgender individuals who were assigned female at birth but identify as
males. One participant in a qualitative study of transmasculine persons affirmed that just talking to the doctor ". . .
about sexual health stuff always gave me violently bad dysphoria" (Agenor et al., 2022, p. 124).

In its Standards of Care, the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) recommends that
health-care professionals use the correct terms and language when interacting with gender-diverse individuals that
reflect respect, uphold their dignity, and assure their safety. This international organization of multiple disciplines
recognizes that persons who experience gender dysphoria or who are in transition from their natal sex (sex assigned
at birth) to their expressed sex or gender experience stigma and discrimination, which often leads to health
disparities. Many people who transition from their natal sex to their preferred gender do not receive adequate health
care because they encounter numerous barriers, including discrimination (Puckett et al., 2018). As a result of such
discrimination, many stop having regular health checkups, screening, and vaccinations.

Nursing Interventions and Management

Political rhetoric in the United States has drawn attention to the experiences of Transgender children and early
adolescents. The nation's health objectives, known as Healthy People 2030, include an objective that is specific to
improving "the health, safety, and well-being of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people" (U.S. Department of
Human Services, n.d., para 1). As a result of these forces, researchers have begun to examine the preparation of
nursing students in providing care to sexually and gender-diverse persons. To provide safe and culturally
appropriate care for sexual minorities, nurses must first recognize and examine their own personal beliefs, biases,
and assumptions about those who are different from themselves (Campinha-Bacote, 2007).

McCann and Sharek (2016) analyzed the findings from ten published papers and found that mental health services
for Transgender individuals are often missing or inadequate. They recommended that "mental health nurses needed
746  22 · Sexual Dysfunction and Gender Dysphoria

     relevant knowledge and skills to be able to deliver culturally competent care that encourages resilience and
     empowerment in transgender clients" (p. 284). Moreover, they noted that nurses may require additional training
     about the process of Transgender transition, use of hormones, HIV prevention and care, and other aspects of
     gender-affirming care.

     The American Nurses Association opposes restrictions on Transgender health and calls for nursing advocacy (ANA,
     2022). Throughout nursing education and services, nurses are encouraged to be knowledgeable about their clients'
     disease/illness processes and treatment. Nurses working with children and adolescents should listen to what they
     say about their gender, provide support, and refer to other health-care professionals who have more experience or
     comfort with this subject (Cicero & Wesp, 2017). Nurses should be knowledgeable about community resources that
     may be available for diverse clients and their families. Nurses should seek to learn from their peers who have
     different sexual orientations or gender identities from their own; such interactions provide essential social support
     to all nurses.

             CLINICAL SAFETY AND PROCEDURES (QSEN)

     Teamwork and Collaboration to Address Gender Dysphoria

     Although there is a paucity of nursing literature addressing gender dysphoria, nurses have the potential to
     contribute to greater knowledge and understanding of this important area of health care. One of the hallmarks of
     Quality and Safety Education for Nurses (QSEN) is that of teamwork and collaboration. Nurses who can reach out to
     other health professionals and seek answers to questions of how best to address the health-care issues of these
     clients will be making an important contribution to the overall health of society. Interprofessional education that
     includes social workers, pharmacists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, as well as physicians and nurses
     should address the unique needs of clients with gender dysphoria. In particular, there is a great need to understand
     how this phenomenon affects young children and young adolescents. The political climate in some conservative
     states, however, currently threatens the expansion of knowledge and understanding in this area. Nurses can
     advocate for citizens in these states to consider the evidence of how treatments, such as using puberty blockers for
     young adolescents who might otherwise be suicidal, is a good, not immoral, thing to do. Similarly, nurses can
     advocate for all members of society to learn to accept others who are different from themselves and to bring an end
     to "hate speech" and discriminatory behavior.

     As in all areas of sexual health, the PLISSIT and ExPLISSIT models of sexual communication can be an important
     component of planning excellent nursing care. Many clients have developed fears related to their sexual health that
     stem from adverse childhood experiences or from learning from well-meaning adults in their lives that sex and
     sexual matters are not subjects to be approached in polite company. Nonetheless, communication is essential in
     developing sexual health. Just giving another permission to talk about a matter that has been long forbidden is often
     a life-changing first step in managing a sexual health issue.

     It's also important to know one's own limitations concerning sexual health information. If you don't know the
     answer, be willing and ready to refer a client to someone who has more knowledge and experience in this important
     subject. If you are not certain about the information you are sharing with a client, do not give them misinformation.
     Be willing to explore professional literature in nursing, medicine, psychology, and sociology to find answers to your
     questions and those of your clients. Also be willing to start a conversation with a more experienced nurse, whom
     you trust, and who may have previous experience planning and providing care for persons with gender dysphoria.

     Nurses' Potential Reactions to Clients with Gender Dysphoria

     Some nurses may feel conflicted and uncomfortable when assigned to care for a person with gender dysphoria.
     Religious upbringing, strong beliefs about sexuality, and what is "right" or "wrong" may have resulted in the nurse
     holding unexamined biases and stereotypes of persons who are "different." When this is the case, it is important to
     share this discomfort with the person who has made the assignment so that the nurse can process the feelings and
     thoughts that come to the surface.

     Some nurses may be going through a questioning process or may be in transition themselves. Awareness of one's
     own sense of gender identity will influence how the nurse thinks about clients who experience gender dysphoria.

Such awareness may enable the nurse to be an ally, offer support, and provide encouragement to the client. Having
a safe and supportive group of friends and family will make such a journey healthy (Testa et al., 2015). When nurses
are comfortable and secure in their own gender identity and feel confident that they can provide safe and sensitive

Summary

22.1 Categories of Sexual Dysfunction

Sexuality and sexual health are central to human well-being. Nurses in all health-care settings must keep in mind
that their clients are sexual beings and that they may experience mild, moderate, or severe problems in different
aspects of their sexual identity and/or behavior. Psychiatric care settings may provide the greatest opportunity for
nurses to view and respond to the symptoms and distress of human sexual dysfunction; nurses and nursing
students must first become aware of their own attitudes and beliefs about sexuality, however, before they can
become skilled in this aspect of nursing care. Nursing students may need to enhance their educational preparation
by taking a human sexuality elective in another department if their nursing curriculum does not provide sufficient
information.

22.2 Paraphilias

The paraphilias are a type of sexual interest (i.e., urges, fantasies, behaviors) that are not limited to genital
stimulation or fondling between mature, consenting human partners (APA, 2022). This classification of sexual
interest is controversial as a psychiatric disorder, but when the urges or fantasies are enacted by an individual on
another, nonconsenting individual, they may have dire legal consequences. Paraphilias may be limited to private
thoughts and feelings, or they may involve acting out the urges and fantasies that involve other, nonconsenting
individuals.

22.3 Gender Dysphoria

Gender dysphoria is characterized by unease or discomfort related to a person's strong belief or desire to be a
gender other than one they were assigned at birth, with associated distress. This strong sense may manifest
differently at a very young age than it does in adolescence or adulthood. The dysphoria often results in great distress
for the child and the family. Children and adolescents may cope with their distress through many harmful behaviors,
including illicit drug use, binge drinking, or exhibiting symptoms of depression. Moreover, they may also have
suicidal ideation. The treatment of children and adolescents with gender dysphoria is somewhat controversial,
especially in terms of the use of puberty blockers and gender affirmation surgery (usually reserved for adults).
Health-care providers, however, are currently expanding what has become known as gender-affirming care to meet
clients where they are and provide care as needed to clients who might otherwise avoid engaging in routine health
checks.

What Should the Nurse Do?

Paul, a forty-two-year-old male, arrives at the urology clinic with concerns related to sexual dysfunction. He reports
symptoms of erectile dysfunction, including difficulty achieving and maintaining an erection, leading to increased
stress and strain in his relationship. Paul's medical history reveals a diagnosis of hypertension for which he is
prescribed antihypertensive medication. His vital signs indicate a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, heart rate of 78
beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and temperature of 98.5°F. During the assessment,
Paul discloses stressors associated with his sexual dysfunction, citing work-related pressures and a recent family
loss.

    1. How might Paul's recent family loss and work-related pressures contribute to his experience of sexual
        dysfunction, and what implications does this analysis have for developing a holistic care plan?

    2. As a nursing student, what solutions can be generated to address both the physiological and emotional
        aspects of Paul's sexual dysfunction, and how might these be integrated into his care plan?

Nick, a thirty-five-year-old male, seeks support at the mental health clinic for distress related to paraphilias. He
reports symptoms of recurrent, intense sexual fantasies and urges involving nonconsenting partners, leading to
significant personal distress. Nick's symptoms include persistent, intrusive thoughts about these fantasies that
interfere with his daily functioning and interpersonal relationships. His anxiety and depression, managed with
medication, have intensified with the distress caused by these symptoms. Vital signs are stable, with a blood
pressure of 120/80 mmHg, heart rate of 76 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and
temperature of 98.7°F.

    3. Given Nick's history of anxiety and depression, what hypothesis should be prioritized in understanding the
        relationship between his mental health history and the exacerbation of paraphilic symptoms, and how does
752 22 · References

        this guide the selection of interventions?
    4. How will a nursing student determine the effectiveness of interventions in alleviating Nick's distress and

        improving his overall well-being, and what adjustments might be necessary based on ongoing assessment?

Alex, a twenty-five-year-old Transgender individual, presents to the LGBTQIA+ health clinic seeking support for
gender dysphoria. Alex reports experiencing significant distress due to a misalignment between assigned gender at
birth and gender identity. Vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 118/76 mmHg, heart rate of 80 beats per
minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and temperature of 98.6°F. Alex has a history of anxiety and
depression, managed with therapy.

    5. How might societal discrimination and challenges in social relationships contribute to Alex's experience of
        gender dysphoria, and what implications does this analysis have for planning nursing care?

    6. Given Alex's history of anxiety and depression, what hypothesis should be prioritized regarding the impact of
        mental health on gender dysphoria, and how does this guide the selection of interventions?

    7. What gender-affirming interventions and counseling support can you generate to address Alex's distress, and
        how might these be integrated into the nursing care plan?

Competency-Based Assessments

    1. In a clinical setting, identify three common stressors reported by clients experiencing sexual dysfunction and
        explain how these stressors can impact both the physiological and psychological aspects of the condition.

    2. As a clinical nurse, what potential reactions might you experience when caring for a client with sexual
        dysfunction issues, and how can self-awareness and empathy contribute to providing effective care?

    3. As a nursing student, explain how evidence-based nursing management can be applied to address client and
        family distress related to sexual dysfunction, providing at least two evidence-based interventions.

    4. What potential reactions might you experience when providing care to a client with paraphilias, and how can
        self-awareness and education help mitigate these reactions?

    5. Why is it important for nurses to discuss terminology from the APA DSM-5-TR when providing care to clients
        with gender dysphoria, and how can this knowledge enhance communication and foster a supportive
        environment?

    6. Discuss the potential reactions you might experience when providing care to a client with gender dysphoria,
        and explain how cultural competence and self-awareness can help manage these reactions.

INTRODUCTION Nurses should be aware of the ways that neurodevelopmental and neurocognitive disorders affect
the brain and neurological systems function (Environmental Protection Agency [EPA], 2023). These disorders most
often begin during a person's developmental stages, such as in toddlers, children, and adolescents, but they persist
into adulthood (Blain, 2022). Neurodevelopmental disorders have a genetic component, but can also be associated
with environmental factors, such as lead exposure (EPA, 2023). Nurses have a role in educating clients about
environmental factors that have the potential to cause or exacerbate these conditions. A child with a
neurodevelopmental disorder can have "difficulties with language and speech, motor skills, behavior, memory,
learning, or other neurological functions" (EPA, 2023, About the Neurodevelopmental Disorders Indicators section,
para. 2). Nurses also have a role in performing and staying attuned to continued research on new treatments,
medications, and preventive strategies for neurodevelopmental disorders.

     23.1 Intellectual Disabilities

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the issues involved in diagnosing intellectual disabilities
         · Recall the major forms of intellectual disability
         · Outline approaches used in the treatment of intellectual disability

     According to the American Psychiatric Association (2021b), intellectual disabilities affect 1 percent of the
     population. Most cases are found in males and, of all cases, about 85 percent of them are considered mild
     intellectual disability. The onset must be during the person's developmental period, which is before they turn
     twenty-two (American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, 2023). There are two areas of
     functioning involved in intellectual disabilities: intellectual functioning, the way a person learns and problem-
     solves; and adaptive functioning, a person's ability to conduct their activities of daily living through communication
     and independent living.

     Defining and Diagnosis of Intellectual Developmental Disorder

     The preferred term for intellectual functioning that falls below an IQ of 70 and starts before age eighteen is
     intellectual developmental disorder, previously known as "mental retardation" (EPA, 2015). These disabilities can
     affect speech, thought, language, socialization, motor skills, and behavior (Empower Behavioral Health, 2023).
     Categories range from mild to severe. Classification is generally dependent upon the person's IQ level in
     combination with their functioning. Levels and manifestations of intellectual disability vary greatly in children.
     Children with an intellectual disability might have a hard time communicating their needs, and an intellectual
     disability can cause them to develop more slowly than other children of the same age.

     Causes of intellectual disabilities include genetic disorders (Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, Prader-Willi
     syndrome); maternal infections and exposure to alcohol during pregnancy; traumatic injuries during the birth
     process; and exposure to measles, whooping cough, or meningitis (EPA, 2015; Special Olympics, 2023). In 30 to 50
     percent of cases, the cause is unknown; researchers suspect that in milder forms of intellectual disabilities with an
     unknown cause, environmental factors, such as lead, mercury, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) exposure, may
     be determining factors (EPA, 2015). Intellectual disability can be caused by a problem that starts any time before
     birth to when a child turns eighteen years old.

     Life expectancy for individuals with intellectual disability may be that of the general population, according to the
     Association on Aging with Developmental Disabilities (2024). Loved ones of those with intellectual disabilities are
     advised to plan for their support in later life, including care providers, housing, and possibly estate planning or
     assets held in trust (Helpers Community, 2022).

     Diagnosis of intellectual developmental disorders typically occurs when a parent or medical provider notices that a
     child is not meeting age-appropriate developmental guidelines for speech, language, socialization, motor skills, and
     behavior (Empower Behavioral Health, 2023). The nurse or medical provider can assess the child's development
     and then refer them for additional testing that might include a standardized IQ test (American Psychiatric
     Association, 2021a). The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria focus on three domains: conceptual, social, and practical.
     Diagnosis is no longer based solely on IQ test scores, but instead connects the severity of the impact the disability
     has on a child's functioning to how they scored on an IQ test (American Psychiatric Association, 2013a). Therapies
     available include medication for specific symptoms, speech and behavior therapy, and counseling. Early intervention
     is important because it can improve the outcomes for the individual and their family.

     The more severe the degree of intellectual disability, the earlier the signs can be noticed during developmental
     monitoring, such as the following (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2021a):

         · sitting up, crawling, or walking later than other children
         · talking later than other children or having trouble speaking
         · difficulty remembering things
         · difficulty understanding social rules
         · difficulty seeing the results of their actions
         · difficulty solving problems

23.1 · Intellectual Disabilities                                                                                        759

Refer children who are suspected to have an intellectual disability based on developmental screening to
developmental pediatricians or other specialists for treatment. In children with a mild intellectual disability, there
may not be an identification of deficit until after the child enters school, when they begin to show difficulties with
learning (Committee to evaluate the supplemental security income disability program for children with mental
disorders, 2015).

        LINK TO LEARNING

Visit this website to understand the Classifications of Intellectual Disability Severity (https://openstax.org/r/
77disabilitysev) published by the National Academy of Sciences.

Conceptual Domain
The conceptual domain of adaptive functioning includes a person's abilities in language, reading, writing, math,
reasoning, knowledge, and memory (American Psychiatric Association, 2013a). Symptoms in this domain include
slower learning; slower reading speed; difficulties with problem-solving, planning, and logical thinking; being easily
distracted; and lacking focus (Cleveland Clinic, 2023a).

Social Domain
The social domain of adaptive functioning considers the individual's ability to make friends and have relationships
with others. It encompasses communication skills, empathy, and social judgment (American Psychiatric
Association, 2013a). Symptoms in this area include the inability to understand social boundaries, difficulty
understanding relationships with others--friendships, romantic relationships--and appropriate social interactions
(Cleveland Clinic, 2023a).

Practical Domain
The practical domain of adaptive functioning considers the individual's ability to act independently in their personal
care, job role, school and work tasks, and money management (American Psychiatric Association, 2013a).
Symptoms in this domain include having a slower ability to learn self-care activities, such as toileting, bathing, and
dressing; inability to understand concepts, such as time or money management; and difficulty learning to complete
chores (Cleveland Clinic, 2023a).

Types of Intellectual Disability

The types of intellectual disability are based on their causes, if known. Genetic mutations cause Down syndrome,
fetal alcohol syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, and birth defects (Special Olympics, 2023). Cerebral palsy can be
caused by trauma during delivery or infections during the pregnancy, such as toxoplasmosis or rubella, that
interrupt fetal development (Cleveland Clinic, 2023a). Exposure to alcohol, tobacco, illicit drugs, medications, and
radiation also interrupt fetal development. Certain medical conditions, such as hypothyroidism in the mother, can
also affect the developing fetus and the intellectual abilities of the child once born. Head trauma to a baby or child
can cause intellectual disabilities.

        CULTURAL CONTEXT

Cultural Stigma toward Those with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDDs)

Individuals with IDD experience stigma. And stigma may vary by culture. Nurses should be aware of specific cultural
stigmas that may be applied to this population of people in order to provide individualized treatment that aligns with
personal/family beliefs. Some Asian and African cultures believe in interdependence and harmony, so they would be
more apt to appreciate family interventions in which the person with IDD can feel accepted. In Thailand, for
instance, it is important for families to be involved in cultural activities as a way of inclusion. Some Bangladeshi
families want their family members who have IDD to be active participants in life, thus decreasing stigma. On the
other hand, some Arab and Chinese families need more privacy because their cultures are more concerned with
protecting the family from shame. These examples show the need for health-care providers to be cognizant that the
interventions they provide must be culturally relevant in order to help decrease stigma while providing support to
760  23 · Children and Adolescents

     individuals and their families.

     (Jansen-van Vuuren & Aldersey, 2020).

     Down Syndrome
     When a baby is born with an extra chromosome 21, they are diagnosed with Down syndrome. The medical term for
     having an extra chromosome is trisomy; therefore, the medical name for Down syndrome is Trisomy 21 (CDC,
     2023a). Down syndrome is the most commonly diagnosed chromosomal disease in the United States and occurs in
     about one out of seven hundred babies born each year (CDC, 2023a).

     According to the CDC (2023a), distinguishing physical factors for Down syndrome include:

         · a flattened face, especially the bridge of the nose
         · almond-shaped eyes that slant up
         · a short neck
         · small ears
         · a tongue that tends to stick out of the mouth
         · tiny white spots on the iris (colored part) of the eye
         · small hands and feet
         · a single line across the palm of the hand (palmar crease)
         · small pinky fingers that sometimes curve toward the thumb
         · poor muscle tone or loose joints
         · shorter in height as children and adults

     Diagnosis typically happens during routine prenatal testing. There are two types of testing: screening tests, such as
     a blood test or ultrasound, and diagnostic tests, such as amniocentesis, that look at a sample of amniotic fluid.
     Screening tests are less invasive and considered safer for both the pregnant person and the fetus.

     People with Down syndrome often have comorbidities, such as hearing loss, heart defects, and eye diseases.
     Medical treatments and surgery may be used to treat these conditions. Other services to help the person live a
     better life include speech, occupational, and physical therapy (CDC, 2023a). These services address the person's
     functioning in the conceptual, social, and practical domains.

     Fragile X Syndrome
     Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder that involves the Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene
     responsible for producing a protein that helps brain development. When a person has Fragile X, they do not have
     this protein, and that causes developmental delays--such as an inability to sit up, walk, or talk by developmental
     guidelines--learning disabilities, and behavioral problems--such as not making eye contact, hand flapping, or an
     inability to sit still (CDC, 2022a). If it is suspected that the child is not reaching developmental milestones due to
     this disorder, providers can perform genetic testing by collecting blood to test the person's DNA (CDC, 2022a).

     Physical features seen in a person with Fragile X include a long, narrow face, a large forehead and jaw, large ears
     and lazy eyes, soft skin, flat feet, decreased muscle tone, a high arch to the palate, and enlarged testicles in males
     (Cleveland Clinic, 2021). This disorder has no cure, but treatments include therapy to help a person learn to walk
     and talk. Medications may be used to help control behavior issues.

     Early intervention services provided to children from birth to three years old help to increase the child's
     development. Parents can access information about services that are available in their state by going to the Center
     for Parent Information and Resources website (https://openstax.org/r/77parentresourc) and clicking on the tab for
     their state.

     Fetal Alcohol Syndrome
     Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) can occur when a fetus is exposed to alcohol during the prenatal period
     (CDC, 2022b). The symptoms that individuals experience can range from mild to severe and affect physical,
     behavioral, and cognitive functioning. The most serious of the FASDs is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Signs and
     symptoms of FAS include problems with the central nervous system, facial features (such as small eye opening, thin
     upper lip, low nasal bridge), and growth (such as a small head); learning disabilities; vision or hearing problems; and

difficulty in school. While there are no specific tests to diagnose FAS, medical assessment includes the alcohol
intake history during the pregnancy, the baby's birth weight, facial features, and any problems with coordination or
small head size. Although an exact number of cases is difficult to determine, the CDC has based an estimate on
reviewing medical records and determined that in some areas of the United States one in one thousand live births is
born with FAS (CDC, 2023b). According to the CDC (2022), there is no cure for FAS and treatment consists of
medication management for some symptoms along with behavior therapy and parent training.

Prader-Willi Syndrome
Prader-Willi syndrome affects approximately one in 20,000 to 30,000 people in the United States (Fermin
Gutierrez & Mendez, 2023). It entails an abnormality in the fifteenth chromosome that results in a genetic disorder
affecting metabolism, behavior, and development. A hallmark symptom is a chronic feeling of not being full after
eating (hyperphagia) combined with low metabolism that can lead to obesity (Cleveland Clinic, 2023b). Symptoms
in infancy include a weak cry, weak muscle tone, lethargy, and inability to feed well. As the child grows, other
physical symptoms may become more obvious. These include "almond shaped eyes, a long, narrow head, a
triangular mouth, small hands and feet, short height, and underdeveloped genitals" (Cleveland Clinic, 2023b, para.
8). Behavioral and developmental symptoms, such as temper tantrums, intellectual disability, sleep problems, skin
picking, and hyperphagia, also become more apparent. There is no cure for this syndrome and treatment is based on
managing symptoms. Medications to increase certain hormones are given based on gender assigned at birth.
Supportive therapies, such as physical, speech, and special education, can increase both physical and cognitive
function in these children. Complications from the obesity related to overeating in Prader-Willi syndrome may
include diabetes, heart disease and hypertension, respiratory problems, and sleep apnea (Cleveland Clinic, 2023b).

Treatment of Intellectual Disability

Treatment of intellectual disability is based on three categories: treatments or mitigation related to underlying
causes, treatments of comorbid physical and mental disorders, and early behavioral and cognitive interventions
(Committee to evaluate the supplemental security income disability program for children with mental disorders,
2015). All treatment should be person-centered and tailored to the individual.

        LINK TO LEARNING

The American Nurses Association's position statement relating to people with intellectual and developmental
disabilities (https://openstax.org/r/77nurseposition) asserts that individuals with these disabilities experience
health-care disparities, require support across their life spans, and should receive person-centered care that
includes advocacy and strengths identification.

Mitigation of Underlying Causes of Intellectual Disability
Research has shown that the causes of these disorders can be genetic, biological, psychological, and/or
environmental (Committee to evaluate the supplemental security income disability program for children with mental
disorders, 2015). While some of the causes occurring prenatally are related to genetics, and cannot be mitigated as
easily, pregnant clients can have genetic testing and avoid other causes. Encourage clients to talk to their medical
provider about genetic counseling prior to becoming pregnant if there is any family history of any genetic condition
that can cause an intellectual disability. Educate pregnant clients to avoid things like drinking alcohol, smoking, and
changing litter boxes (exposure to toxoplasmosis) during pregnancy. Keeping up with maternal vaccines that prevent
illnesses prior to becoming pregnant, such as those for rubella, whooping cough, and meningitis, reduces the risk of
fetal exposure. Accessing proper prenatal care and screenings can decrease the chances of premature birth.
Although close observation by an obstetrician during the birth process can decrease brain injury that might occur
during birth, there may still be birth complications that cause the baby not to get enough oxygen, resulting in an
intellectual disability. After birth, parents can protect their children through proper use of car seats to prevent head
trauma, by following the recommended vaccination and well-child appointments, eating a healthy diet, and limiting
exposure to toxic metals, such as lead and mercury (Cleveland Clinic, 2023a).

       CLINICAL JUDGMENT MEASUREMENT MODEL

       Take Action: Interventions to Prevent Cognitive Disabilities

       A first-time mother is at her obstetrician's office for her first prenatal visit. As part of the visit, the nurse goes into
       the exam room to provide education to the client. The nurse explains the importance of keeping up with her
       prenatal appointments and screenings. She also double-checks the client's vaccination history to determine if
       any important vaccines are missing, explaining to the client that diseases, such as rubella, can cause future
       cognitive disabilities for her baby. The nurse confirms that the client has a cat at home and asks the client if
       there is someone else in the house who can clean the litter box because possible exposure to the toxoplasma
       parasite in the cat's stool is harmful to the growing fetus (CDC, 2022c). As the client progresses through her
       prenatal visits, the nurse will continue to provide interventions to help ensure that the client is aware of
       prevention techniques to keep the baby safe from environmental factors that could cause cognitive disorders.

       (Hooper, 2021; CDC, 2023b)

     Treatment of Comorbid Physical and Mental Disorders
     As many as 25 percent of people with intellectual disabilities have a psychiatric comorbidity. The most common of
     these are schizophrenia, depression, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (Committee to evaluate the
     supplemental security income disability program for children with mental disorders, 2015). Medication and
     psychological support are the standard treatments. Genetically caused intellectual disabilities also may have
     associated physical disorders. Each of these is treated according to their severity--with medication or supportive
     therapies.

     Early Behavioral and Cognitive Interventions
     Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (1990), early intervention services must be available to identify
     and help infants and toddlers (up to age three) who have disabilities (Center for Parent Information & Resources,
     2017). Generally, early intervention programs, special education, vocational programs, day programs for adults,
     residential options, and case management (American Psychiatric Association, 2021a) may be available. The U.S.
     Department of Education and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) offer special education
     programs for educational support once a child enters school. As a person ages, vocational training helps them learn
     how to work. An example of this is having a work partner to assist the high school individual in a work environment,
     such as a grocery store. Day programs provide the individual with an opportunity to get out of the house and be
     involved in activities with other people. There are residential options, such as group homes, for people whose
     intellectual disabilities are so severe that they are unable to care for themselves in their own home. Community
     agencies, such as local mental health centers, may also provide case management to assist clients with tasks, such
     as getting to medical appointments, managing medications, and grocery shopping.

     More specifically, early intervention is a process that involves the child, the parent, and the intervention team
     meeting with the goal of providing problem-solving resources to the parent and child (Guralnick, 2017). The team
     develops an individualized education program (IEP) to address the child's educational needs (Center for Parent
     Information & Resources, 2017). Another resource is services under Section 504 for accommodations in school,
     including extracurricular programs (PACER Center, 2018). Parents can find a list of early intervention programs, by
     state, on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://openstax.org/r/77earlyinterven). These
     services can increase the child's success in school by helping them overcome challenges they may have related to
     learning new skills (CDC, 2023c).

etiology for communication disorders, some risk factors include medical problems, motor skill problems, and
genetics (Law et al., 2017). Early intervention is the best way to treat communication disorders. Children with
language disorders may feel frustrated when they cannot understand others or make themselves understood and,
as a result, may act out, act helpless, or withdraw. Language or speech disorders may also be present with other
disorders, such as ADHD, anxiety, or autism (CDC, 2021b). Table 23.1 lists some key signs of speech, language, and
hearing disorders by age.

Age              Presentation

Birth to 3 months No smiling or playing with others

4 to 7 months    No babbling

7 to 12 months   Minimal vocalization; no gestures

7 months to 2 years No understanding of spoken words

12 to 18 months  Saying only a few words

1½ to 2 years    Not putting two words together

2 years          Saying fewer than 50 words

2½ to 3 years    Struggles with early reading and writing; shows no interest in books or drawing

2 to 3 years     Struggles with playing and talking with other children

TABLE 23.1 Early Signs of a Speech, Hearing, or Language Disorder (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association,
2023)

Defining Communication Disorders

Persistent difficulty with language and/or speech is considered a communication disorder. There are set
developmental milestones that mark a healthy progression on the speech-language trajectory, and individuals with
communication disorders may not meet them. Problems with articulation, quality, pitch, loudness, and repetition of
speech sounds (stuttering) may characterize issues with speech. Overall causes of communication disorders include
"hearing loss, neurological disorders, brain injury, vocal cord injury, autism, intellectual disability, drug abuse,
physical impairments, emotional or psychiatric disorders, and developmental disorders" (Psychology Today, 2022,
para. 15). There is an increased risk for communication disorders if there is a family history of these disorders.
Communication disorders are more common in boys aged three to seventeen than their female counterparts (NIH,
2016).

Early intervention is the best treatment. Nurses should recommend that parents follow pediatric developmental
milestones and can refer to the CDC website (https://openstax.org/r/77commhelp) (CDC, 2023d). The nurse can
also recommend that the parents talk to the pediatrician when concerns arise regarding their child not reaching
speech-language age-related milestones, such as making squealing sounds by age six months or saying mama or
dada by age twelve months. Each age group listed on the CDC website has specific things that a child should be able
to do or say by that age. Treatment may involve seeing a speech-language pathologist.

        LIFE-STAGE CONTEXT

Stages of Communication Development in Childhood

During the first five years of a child's life, they are developing critical skills that assist them with learning verbal and
reasoning skills, how to socialize with others, and growing their independence. Developmental milestones help both
764  23 · Children and Adolescents

     parents and health-care professionals to recognize any deficits a child has that may indicate a communication
     disorder. Nurses working with pediatric clients can ask the parent questions about family history, when a child's
     symptoms were first noticed, and provide support to the parents.

     (Psychology Today, 2023)

     The DSM-5 breaks communication disorders into five categories: language disorder, speech sound disorder,
     childhood-onset fluency disorder (stuttering), social communication disorder, and unspecified communication
     disorder, which can be caused by a medical or neurological condition and will not meet the DSM-5 criteria.

     Language Disorder
     A language disorder is when an individual has difficulty learning and using spoken, written, or signed language.
     They can physically make the sounds but cannot use language correctly. Their language ability is below what is
     expected for their age. A person with language disorder is unable to adequately express and receive communication
     (Psychology Today, 2022). Expressive communication involves making the verbal or nonverbal signal and receptive
     communication is understanding the language that is taken in from another person.

     Language disorders caused by a medical or neurological condition are not diagnosed with DSM-5 criteria. These may
     include brain injury, a problem that occurred during pregnancy--such as maternal stress, folic acid and vitamin D
     insufficiency, and smoking and alcohol use (D'Souza et al., 2019)--a birth defect, or have an unknown cause. Other
     language disorders have a strong genetic factor; many children who develop them have a familial history. Treatment
     for language disorders is primarily through speech-language therapy. There may also be the need for psychotherapy
     in cases where the individual has behavioral issues.

     Speech Sound Disorder
     A speech sound disorder is the inability to articulate words or sounds in order to communicate with others. While
     this disorder may be the result of a physical complication, such as cleft palate, it may be related to a hearing
     impairment, a genetic component, or can be related to a neurodevelopmental problem in which the brain fails to
     correctly deliver impulses to muscles involved in making the sounds (Psychology Today, 2022).

     Symptoms observed in children with a speech sound disorder include stuttering, lisping, using shorter words and
     syllables past the age of seven, having a nasal quality to their voice, and running out of air when talking. Referral to a
     speech-language pathologist for assessment and diagnosis is a common beginning of treatment. Treatment will
     involve speech and language therapy to identify and correct articulation problems. Speech therapy helps 75 percent
     of children resolve their speech sound disorder by the time they turn six (Psychology Today, 2022).

     Child-Onset Fluency Disorder
     Children between the ages of two and five can sometimes stutter, but this is just part of learning to speak. It usually
     goes away on its own, but there are some individuals who have chronic stuttering that persists into adulthood (Mayo
     Clinic, 2021), which is considered child-onset fluency disorder. Symptoms that may occur include repeating a
     word or a sound, difficulty beginning to say a word, adding extra words like "um," facial tightness or tension in the
     face and upper body, anxiety when talking, and decreased ability to communicate. Interestingly, people who stutter
     usually do not stutter when talking to themselves or while singing a song (Mayo Clinic, 2021). Treatment by a
     speech-language pathologist might be needed if the stuttering lasts more than six months, gets worse with anxiety,
     and is affecting school, work, or social situations.

             PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

     Effects of Stuttering on Social Anxiety in Children

     Stuttering can cause children to have social anxiety because of the bullying and negativity they receive from peers.
     The DSM-5 describes social anxiety disorder as the fear of performance-based social interactions. In the case of a
     child or adolescent who stutters, the school environment is a prime target for this type of anxiety. When a child
     stutters, they often avoid social situations due to their embarrassment. This avoidance can lead to decreased social
     development, low self-esteem, and inability to create healthy relationships with peers.

One potential treatment for stuttering is psychodrama. This therapy provides a safe environment in which a child
can role-play certain situations in order to learn how to resolve conflicts. Psychodrama has been shown to be
effective in decreasing stuttering and social anxiety and improving self-esteem. Psychodrama gives the child the
chance to see what they could do during a certain situation to help them cope better and envision their strengths
(López-González et al., 2021).

(Younis et al., 2021)

Social Communication Disorder
A person with social communication disorder has difficulty using verbal and nonverbal communication within a
social situation. This may cause problems with making and maintaining friends. The individual might not understand
how to effectively carry on a conversation or understand nonliteral language meanings or grasp the rules of
conversation. The exact cause of social communication disorder is unknown, and it is often connected to another
condition, such as intellectual disability or a traumatic brain injury (American Speech-Language-Hearing
Association, 2023). A speech-language pathologist is the primary treatment provider and is responsible for
screening, assessment, and diagnosis. It is within the scope of practice of the speech-language pathologist to
provide "clinical services, education, advocacy, research, and administration" (American Speech-Language-Hearing
Association, 2023, Roles & Responsibilities section, para. 1). The Individuals with Disabilities Education
Improvement Act of 2004 (IDEA) requires that children and adolescents with social communication disorders be
provided speech-language services in schools.

Unspecified Communication Disorder
When a child exhibits some symptoms of communication disorders, but the symptoms do not fall into a pattern
according to the DSM-5, then they are described as having unspecified communication disorder. There is no
particular cause noted in the DSM-5 for this disorder. The age of onset is typically early childhood (Porter, 2023).
There are no specific treatments specified by the DSM-5 for this disorder, but speech-language therapy may be
helpful.

Treatment of Communication Disorders

Treatment for communication disorders generally begins with a parent telling their child's health-care provider
about concerns for their child's language development. The provider then may make a referral to a speech-language
pathologist for assessment, diagnosis, and treatment. Early intervention, some of which may be free or low-cost, is
considered to have the best outcomes.

The speech-language pathologist (SLP) follows four basic principles for the provision of services: "(1) Family
centered and culturally and linguistically responsive; (2) developmentally supportive promoting children's
participation in their natural environments; (3) comprehensive, coordinated, and team based; and (4) based on the
highest quality evidence available" (Paul & Roth, 2011, p. 320). These four principles are used to focus on the
individual needs of each child and their family.

There are three main goals of treatment for communication disorders. The first is helping children work on and
improve their communication. The second is to teach children coping skills and alternative ways to communicate
when they are having difficulty with communication. The third is encouraging children to use and practice their
communication skills at home, at school, and with friends (MentalHelp.net, 2023).

Nursing Implications
With those goals in mind, treatment of communication disorders is collaborative, meaning that different
professionals and caregivers work together to assist the child in learning how to communicate better. These roles
can be shared by the speech-language pathologist, school nurse, peers, parents, and classroom teachers (American
Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2023). A treatment plan is agreed upon with different parts of that plan
being implemented by identified members of the team. School nurses can work individually with clients or in group
settings (e.g., special education).

Nurses need to remember that just because a client cannot communicate in the same way as the nurse, it is
important to include them in the care that is being provided. This quote from a nurse who was part of a focus group
in Mimmo et al. (2022) highlights the importance of treating the client with respect and dignity: "talking to the
766  23 · Children and Adolescents

     patients whether or not they can talk back to me . . . treating them as though they can listen so talk to them . . . just
     say, hi, . . . treat them with dignity" ("Know the Child" section).

     Types of Interventions Used to Treat Communication Disorders
     The types of intervention recommended to treat a communication disorder is based on the child's age, the severity
     of the disorder, and whether or not it is connected to another disorder. Interventions are intended to assist the child
     in developing their language skills and remove barriers to social participation (Law et al., 2017). Direct interventions
     are those that focus on the child as an individual or in a group. Indirect interventions are those that involve the
     parents interacting with their children as a way of modeling speech and language behavior. Indirect interventions
     are used less as the child ages. Rewards, such as stickers, are often used as reinforcement for the child following
     the directions of the therapy by repeating sounds, vocabulary, and sentence structures (Law et al., 2017). As
     children get older, the therapy focuses on teaching skills that encourage the use of judgment to determine the
     correct phonics and grammar to use in the moment. Considerations for therapy focus on who is going to deliver the
     therapy, where it will take place, the frequency/intensity/duration of the therapy, and the expected outcomes.

     23.3 Autism Spectrum Disorder

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define autism spectrum disorder
         · Understand the different types of family support available to children with autism spectrum disorder
         · Identify resources for information and support

     Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be found four times more often in males than in females. It is seen in all racial,
     ethnic, and socioeconomic groups (CDC, 2022d). The prevalence of ASD was 50 percent higher in White children
     than among Black or Hispanic children in years prior to 2016, but between 2016 and 2018, it evened out (Maenner
     et al., 2023). This developmental disorder has multiple causes that result in brain differences that affect a person's
     interaction with others, communication, and learning. According to the CDC (2022d), in 2020, approximately one in
     thirty-six children were identified as having ASD.

     Definition of Autism Spectrum Disorder

     The developmental disorder of the brain that causes impairment in behavior, communication, interaction with
     others, and learning is called autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The signs and symptoms of ASD usually begin
     before a child turns three years old. These symptoms continue through the life span, but can change or improve over
     time. ASD is characterized by the following: (1) difficulty with communication and interaction with other people, (2)
     restricted interests and repetitive behaviors, and (3) symptoms that hurt the person's ability to function properly in
     school, work, and other areas of life. Autism is known as a "spectrum" disorder because there is wide variation in
     the type and severity of symptoms experienced by individuals. Although ASD is a lifelong disorder, treatments and
     services can improve a person's symptoms and ability to function (National Institute of Mental Health, 2022).

     Since the publication of the DSM-5, several disorders have been classified as falling under ASD rather than as
     separate from it or have been removed from the classification. For example, pervasive developmental disorder not
     otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) has been reclassified as under ASD and was formerly used when the child did not
     meet all the criteria for autism. Asperger syndrome is a disorder that has been reclassified as under ASD and has no
     requirement for onset by age three or language delay, and no criteria for communication or cognitive deficit (Gehret,
     2022). Another disorder reclassified as falling under ASD is childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD) is rare,
     affecting only 1.7 in 100,000 children (Gehret, 2022), and is defined as a severe form of autism with a late onset,
     usually around the age of four years.

     One disorder removed from the DSM-5 list of autism disorders is Rett syndrome, which affects mostly girls and
     often displays symptoms that are similar to autism. Less than 1 percent of cases are inherited; instead, they come
     from a gene mutation (Gehret, 2022). Due to genetic etiology, this disorder is a distinct category and, therefore,
     removed from DSM-5 diagnostic criteria.

     Screening and Diagnosis
     Because there is no specific test to diagnose this disorder, parents and health providers look at how the child is

     Access for free at openstax.org
23.3 · Autism Spectrum Disorder                                                                                        767

developing and meeting age benchmarks. It is important to diagnose a child as early as possible so that they can
begin to receive services that will support their development over time. Health-care providers can sometimes
diagnose ASD as early as eighteen months of age (CDC, 2022e), with most children being diagnosed before thirty
months of age.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (2023) recommends screening children during their regular pediatric
appointments at ages eighteen months and twenty-four months. This screening helps to identify developmental and
behavioral challenges. The parent is given the M-CHAT-R/F screening tool, a twenty-three-question standardized
form to complete. Examples of the yes/no questions include "Does your child like climbing on things, such as
stairs?" and "Does your child look you in the eye for more than a second or two?" This form is used in combination
with health history, family history, and observation of the child's development, especially if behavior is delayed or
different than expected. Additional referrals for psychological evaluation and support can follow analysis of the M-
CHAT-R/F.

There are also tests that check for other medical conditions that can cause ASD-like symptoms
(Healthychildren.org, 2023) and tests to check for symptoms that often accompany ASD. For instance, lead
screening involves a blood test to check for serum blood levels of lead in children who live in a high-risk
environment. Moreover, providers may recommend genetic testing, because 42 percent of children will have a
genetic component. Some risk factors include a family that already has one child with ASD, having chromosomal
conditions like Fragile X syndrome, birth complications, and being born to older parents (CDC, 2022e). They may
also recommend a test to check for an iron or vitamin deficiency because most children with ASD are picky eaters.

Watch this American Academy of Pediatrics informational video (https://openstax.org/r/77autism) to help parents
understand the CDC's 2023 statistics about the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder. It can be useful when
educating families receiving a diagnosis of ASD in their child.

Areas of Concern
A parent or guardian may become concerned when they notice that their child is not meeting published
developmental guidelines. The CDC (2023) checklists help parents document milestones that their child is or is not
meeting. Parents can take the completed checklist for the primary care provider to review at scheduled well-child
appointments. This form includes social/emotional, language/communication, cognitive, and movement/physical
developmental milestones for specific age groups along the developmental trajectory. If the provider suspects ASD,
then they may refer the child to speech, behavioral, or occupational therapies (Healthychildren.org, 2023).

A parent may also notice that their child is having a problem with emotional dysregulation, where an individual is
unable to control their feelings and emotions. This is common in people who have ASD (Cleveland Clinic, 2023c).
Most children will experience temper tantrums at some point, but they usually grow out of them. A person with
emotional dysregulation is not able to control their emotions and that can result in mood swings, angry outbursts,
and losing their temper.

Another sign that parents may observe in their child is the presence of unusual repetitive and stereotyped
behaviors, such as hand flapping, body rocking, repeating words, or placing toys in the same order all the time
(CDC, 2022e). Other areas of concern include difficulty in social interactions, communication, and relationships.

Social Interactions
People with ASD have difficulty with social communication and interaction, experience restricted interests, and
exhibit repetitive behaviors. Here are some examples of behaviors in these categories (National Institute of Mental
Health, 2022):

    · making little or inconsistent eye contact
    · not looking at or listening to people
    · rarely sharing enjoyment of objects or activities by pointing or showing things to others
    · being slow to respond (or failing to respond) to someone calling their name
768  23 · Children and Adolescents

         · having difficulties with the back-and-forth nature of a conversation
         · talking at length about a favorite subject without noticing that others are not interested or without giving

             others a chance to respond
         · exhibiting facial expressions, movements, and gestures that do not match what is being said
         · using a tone of voice that may sound flat and robotlike
         · having trouble understanding another person's point of view or being unable to understand other people's

             actions
         · repeating certain behaviors or exhibiting unusual behaviors
         · echolalia, which means the involuntary repetition, or echo, of words, phrases, or vocalizations
         · having a lasting, intense interest in certain topics, such as numbers, details, or facts
         · having overly focused interests, such as with moving objects or parts of objects
         · getting upset by slight changes in a routine
         · being more or less sensitive than other people to sensory input, such as light, noise, clothing, or temperature;

             this sensitivity can present as physical touch, like a hug, actually being experienced as painful; items, such as
             seams on pants, can be overwhelming and extremely agitating

     Although people with ASD experience many challenges, they also often have many strengths, including these
     strengths (National Institute of Mental Health, 2022):

         · being able to learn things in detail and remember information for long periods of time
         · being strong visual and auditory learners
         · excelling in math, science, music, or art

     Communication
     Communication skills are different for each person with ASD. According to Posar et al. (2022), approximately 25 to
     30 percent of children with this illness do not develop language skills at all or remain minimally verbal Some people
     with ASD use single words or repeat the words they hear others say. Others have great vocabularies and can talk
     about specific topics at length (NIH, 2020). It all depends on their level of autism and its effect on their intellectual
     and social development.

     Relationships
     Due to being unable to pick up on cues from others or an inability to initiate conversations or interactions,
     relationship building can be difficult. Their repetitive behaviors, such as pacing and hand flapping, may be
     distracting or uncomfortable for others (Autism Speaks, n.d.).

     Family Support

     Families must adapt to the needs of the child with ASD. Sensory considerations, such as modifying the environment,
     creating routines, or using other strategies can help manage discomfort in a child with ASD (Autism Speaks, n.d.).
     Siblings may feel added stress as their responsibilities within the household increase. Lack of insurance coverage for
     therapies may increase parental stress. Having family outings can be difficult due to the decreased social skills of
     the child with ASD.

     Nurses can support families through careful assessment of their needs. Nurses must consider the severity of the
     ASD of the child and how much the parents understand about ASD. Nurses can assist parents in finding community
     resources and services that support the care of the child with ASD. These services must be culturally relevant and
     affordable for the family. Parents must be included in the planning process, just as clients are included when nurses
     create individual care plans.

     Levels of Support by Severity
     In order for a child to be diagnosed with ASD, they must meet certain criteria set forth by DSM-5 (CDC, 2022d). The
     child must have deficits in the three areas of social communication and interaction, as well as exhibit two to four
     restricted/repetitive behaviors. There are three levels of support that are based on severity of need; three is the
     highest level of support (Table 23.2).

TABLE 23.2 Levels of Support for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (Rudy, 2023)

Interdisciplinary Team
Current treatments for ASD seek to reduce symptoms that interfere with daily functioning and quality of life. ASD
affects each person differently, meaning that people with ASD have unique strengths and challenges and thus
different treatment needs. Treatment plans typically involve multiple professionals with interventions customized to
the individual (National Institute of Mental Health, 2022). As individuals with ASD exit high school and grow into
adulthood, additional services can help improve their health and daily functioning and facilitate social engagement.
Supports may help complete job training, find employment, and secure housing and transportation (National
Institute of Mental Health, 2022).

There are many categories of treatments available, and some treatments involve more than one approach.
Treatment categories include (National Institute of Mental Health, 2022):

· behavioral
· developmental
· educational
· social-relational
· pharmacological
· psychological
· complementary and alternative

Developmental Approaches
Developmental approaches focus on improving specific developmental skills, such as language skills or physical
skills. Developmental approaches are often combined with behavioral approaches. The most common
developmental therapy for people with ASD is speech and language therapy. Speech and language therapy helps
improve the person's understanding and use of speech and language. Some people with ASD communicate verbally.
Others with severe symptoms of ASD may communicate using signs, gestures, pictures, or an electronic
communication device (National Institute of Mental Health, 2022). Occupational therapy teaches skills to help the
person live as independently as possible. Skills may include dressing, eating, bathing, and relating to other people.
Occupational therapy can also include sensory integration therapy to help improve responses to sensory input that
may be restrictive or overwhelming (National Institute of Mental Health, 2022). Physical therapy may help improve
physical skills, such as fine movements of the fingers or larger movements of the trunk and body (National Institute
of Mental Health, 2022).

     Educational Approaches
     Educational treatments take place in a classroom setting. One type of educational approach is the Treatment and
     Education of Autistic and Related Communication-Handicapped Children (TEACCH) approach. TEACCH is based on
     the idea that people with autism thrive on consistency and visual learning. It provides teachers with ways to adjust
     the classroom structure to improve academic and other outcomes. For example, teachers can write daily routines
     and place them in clear sight, set boundaries around learning stations, and accompany verbal instructions with
     visual instructions or physical demonstrations (National Institute of Mental Health, 2022).

     Behavioral Approaches
     Behavioral approaches focus on changing an individual's behaviors by promoting understanding of what happens
     before and after the behavior. A notable behavioral treatment for people with ASD is called applied behavior analysis
     (ABA). Applied behavior analysis encourages desired behaviors and discourages undesired behaviors to improve a
     variety of skills, and progress is tracked and measured (National Institute of Mental Health, 2022).

     Social-Relational Approaches
     Social-relational treatments focus on improving social skills and building emotional bonds. For example, "social
     stories" provide simple descriptions of what to expect in a social situation. "Social skills groups" provide
     opportunities for people with ASD to practice social skills in a structured environment.

     Pharmacological Approaches
     There are no medications used to treat ASD, but medications may be used to treat symptoms and improve
     functioning. For example, medication may be used to manage high energy levels, improve focus, or limit self-
     harming behavior, such as head banging or hand biting. Medication may also treat concurrent psychological and
     medical conditions, such as anxiety, depression, seizures, or sleep problems (National Institute of Mental Health,
     2022).

     Psychological and Behavioral Approaches
     Psychological and behavioral approaches can help people with ASD cope with anxiety, depression, and other mental
     health issues. For example, CBT helps individuals focus on the connections between their thoughts, feelings, and
     behaviors. During CBT, a therapist and the individual work together to identify goals and change how the person
     thinks about a situation to change how they react to the situation (National Institute of Mental Health, 2022).

     Complementary and Alternative Treatments
     Some individuals with autism use special diets, herbal supplements, chiropractic care, animal therapy, art therapy,
     mindfulness, or relaxation therapies (National Institute of Mental Health, 2022). Treatment is most effective when
     tailored to the individual, and additional enriching therapies can help individuals with ASD to thrive.

     Nurse's Role
     The nurse's role is primarily education-based. Nurses can educate themselves on new treatment techniques,
     community resources, and how to support the family of their clients who have ASD. Nurses can work with families to
     develop the interventions that will work best for the individual client. If the client needs help with communication,
     the nurse can assist the family with getting communication devices, such as picture boards (Lesser & Ebert, 2020).
     School nurses can review the use of these tools with their students to build rapport in the school setting.

       CLINICAL JUDGMENT MEASUREMENT MODEL

       Take Action: The Nurse Performs an Intervention

       Care of a client with ASD requires interventions that fit the abilities of the individual and are based on the
       specific level of support required by that individual. Depending upon where that individual falls on the autism
       spectrum, the nurse can choose from a wide variety of interventions. For instance, if a nurse is caring for several
       clients who need Level 1 support, a good intervention would be to facilitate a social cues group to teach them
       about understanding social cues and what they mean.

Community Services and Information Resources

There are several levels of intervention services available depending on when ASD is suspected and diagnosed
(Healthychildren.org, 2023). The first is early intervention programs available through the state if the child is under
the age of three when ASD is first suspected. Once the child is between ages three and five, the parent can contact
the local school district to find out if the child is eligible to attend a developmental preschool program.

The Autism Speaks website (https://openstax.org/r/77autismspeaks) contains a variety of useful information about
available resources. This website has filters for state, life stage, and level of support that the user can click to get the
information that best fits the individual they are hoping to support. The National Autism Association
(https://openstax.org/r/77autismassoc) is another useful site to explore resources; education for individuals,
families, first responders, and teachers; and ways to advocate for those with autism.

23.4 Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Outline diagnosis and presentation of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
    · Define the nurse's role in creating a family plan for child with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
    · Identify resources for information and support

One of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders is attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which
involves difficulty paying attention, difficulty controlling impulsive behaviors, or excessive activity (CDC, 2023e). It is
usually first diagnosed in childhood and often lasts into adulthood. Not everyone living with attention deficit shows
hyperactivity; attention-deficit disorder (ADD) involves distractibility and difficulties with mental focus and working
memory. ADHD can negatively affect a person's academics, social functioning, and relationships with peers. It can
also have a negative effect on their family life. While ADHD and ADD have typically been associated with childhood,
both can be diagnosed during adulthood; childhood ADHD and ADD can also persist into adulthood.

        LINK TO LEARNING

This website provides information on ADD and ADHD (https://openstax.org/r/77ADDADHDinfo) and includes a
comparison of ADD to ADHD, self-tests for children and adults, and many credible resources and references.

Diagnosis and Presentations of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder

ADHD affects approximately 9.8 percent of American children aged thirteen to seventeen (CDC, 2022f). The global
prevalence of ADHD in children and adolescents who are younger than nineteen is estimated to be 5 percent
(Wüstner et al., 2019). It is normal for children to exhibit challenging behaviors and have trouble focusing at certain
times. Children with ADHD, however, often have more severe symptoms that cause difficulties at school, at home, or
with friends (CDC, 2021c), including:

    · daydreaming
    · forgetting or losing things
    · squirming or fidgeting
    · talking too much
    · making careless mistakes or taking unnecessary risks
    · difficulty resisting temptation
    · difficulty getting along with others

Diagnosing a child with ADHD is a process requiring several steps by a mental health professional or pediatrician.
There is no single test to diagnose ADHD, and many other problems, such as anxiety, depression, sleep problems,
and learning disorders can have similar symptoms as ADHD. The diagnostic process includes a medical exam;
hearing and vision tests; and a checklist rating ADHD symptoms completed by parents, teachers, and the child (CDC,
2021c). ADHD lasts into adulthood for at least one-third of children with ADHD. Treatments for adults can include
medication, psychotherapy, or a combination of treatments (CDC, 2021c). There are three types of ADHD,
772  23 · Children and Adolescents

     depending on which types of symptoms are strongest in the individual: inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive, and
     combined (CDC, 2021c).

     Inattentive
     A person who is inattentive finds it difficult for the individual to organize or finish a task, to pay attention to details,
     or to follow instructions or conversations. The person is easily distracted or forgets details of daily routines. The
     presentation of these symptoms can be missed or misinterpreted by others as "laziness" or "not paying attention."

             LIFE-STAGE CONTEXT

     ADHD Is Not Just for Kids

     According to an article published by the Harvard Medical School (Collier, 2020), older adults who may not have ever
     been diagnosed with ADHD often seek the advice of their primary care provider when they begin to notice problems
     with their memory or completion of tasks. It is often not recognized until the older person realizes that other people
     in their family are being diagnosed with ADHD. This disease is one of the "most inherited disorders in medicine"
     (para. 4) so providers will look at family history when addressing memory concerns in older adults.

     (Collier, 2020)

     Hyperactive-Impulsive
     The person fidgets and talks a lot. It is hard for them to sit still for a length of time (such as during a meal or while
     doing homework). Young children may run, jump, or climb constantly. The individual feels restless and has trouble
     with impulsiveness. Someone who is impulsive may interrupt others, grab things from other people, or speak at
     inappropriate times. It is hard for the person to wait their turn or listen to directions. A person with impulsiveness
     may also have more accidents and injuries than others.

     Combined Type
     Mixed symptoms of the above two types are equally present in the person with the combined type. It is important to
     remember that a person's symptoms of ADHD can change over time, and their predominant presentation may
     change.

     Nurse's Role in Supporting Families with Children with ADHD

     A nurse can support parents of children with ADHD by educating them on some interventions they can use with their
     children. The CDC (2023) suggests that families:

         · Create a routine to help the child to stay focused.
         · Organize things like shoes, toys, school bags, and keep them in the same place.
         · Provide a quiet environment for completing homework. Limit distractions, such as background noise from TVs.
         · Do not give the child a lot of choices because that can be overwhelming for them. It is better to give them just

             two options to choose from when they need to make a choice.
         · Be clear with directions that you give your child. Be sure to include praise for when the child meets goals that

             have been set. The use of a sticker chart is a visual reminder of the work they are accomplishing.
         · Help the child try different things like sports or after-school activities to see which ones they really like and are

             good at because this helps to create positive experiences for them.
         · Provide healthy lifestyle options--good food, time for exercise, and plenty of sleep.

     Nurses should be aware of the different community resources available and refer parents to those entities. Nurses
     also need to be aware of cultural beliefs, financial concerns, and support systems in place for the family/child and
     provide the nursing care accordingly. Patient-centered care is outlined in the QSEN Institute Competencies (2022).

        CLINICAL SAFETY AND PROCEDURES (QSEN)

Client/Family-Centered Care for the Client with ADHD

When caring for a client with ADHD, nurse will:

    · Recognize the client's inability to focus as a potential barrier to participation in the plan of care.
    · Promote and facilitate the client's involvement in extracurricular activities as a means to promote healthy

        lifestyle, socialization and well-being.
    · Allow the client time to make decisions in order to show the nurse's respect for the client's unique abilities.

Promoting Overall Wellness
Many children with ADHD also have other disorders. These can include learning disabilities, conduct problems,
anxiety, and depression, so it is important for nurses to screen children with ADHD for additional disorders (CDC,
2023e). The main symptoms of ADHD, being impulsive and inattentive, can cause these children to have a higher
risk for injuries. They may ride a bicycle and not pay attention to traffic, be reckless when driving a car, act
aggressively (in children who also have conduct disorder), and not remember to make healthy food choices or
participate in regular physical activity. Parents and health-care providers can work together to remind children
about safety and to monitor their well-being.

Medications
Nurses may play a role in medication management. Medication may help children aged six and older manage their
ADHD symptoms and control behaviors that cause difficulties with family, with friends, and at school (CDC, 2021c).
A comprehensive medical exam, including height, weight, blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiovascular history,
should precede medication. Providers should establish a pretreatment baseline to measure common side effects,
such as appetite and sleep changes, headaches, and abdominal pain. Adolescent clients should also be assessed
for substance use (Krull, 2022).

The choice of medication by the prescriber depends on many factors, such as the following (Krull, 2022):

    · duration of coverage (e.g., desired coverage for school day plus completion of homework)
    · the desire to avoid medication administration at school
    · the ability of the child to swallow pills or capsules
    · coexisting emotional or behavioral conditions
    · history of substance misuse in the client or a household member (i.e., stimulants with less abuse potential are

        prescribed)
    · expense
    · preferences of the child and their caregivers

Stimulants, such as methylphenidate (Ritalin), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine), and dextroamphetamine-
amphetamine (Adderall), are considered first-line treatment because of rapid onset of action and a long record of
safety and efficacy. Stimulants are available in short-, intermediate-, and long-acting formulations. The exact
mechanism of action of stimulants in ADHD is unknown, but they are known to affect the dopaminergic and
noradrenergic systems, causing a release of catecholamines. Stimulants have been found to improve caregiver-child
interactions, aggressive behavior, and academic productivity (Krull, 2022).

Stimulants are controlled substances and require a Schedule II prescription. There is a black box warning for CNS
stimulants, including methylphenidate and amphetamine-like substances, because they have a high potential for
abuse and dependence. In fact, up to 29 percent of school- and college-aged students with stimulant prescriptions
have been asked to give, sell, or trade their medication (Krull, 2022). Assess the risk of abuse by the client or their
family members before prescribing stimulants, and evaluate for signs of abuse and dependence while the client is
receiving therapy (Food and Drug Administration, 2023).

Stimulants may cause minor side effects that resolve with lower dosage levels or a different prescription. The most
common side effects include the following (National Institute of Mental Health, 2016; U.S. National Library of
Medicine, n.d.): difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, loss of appetite and weight loss, stomach pain, and/or
774  23 · Children and Adolescents

     headache. Less common side effects include motor or verbal tics (sudden, repetitive movements or sounds) or
     personality changes, such as appearing "flat" or without emotion (National Institute of Mental Health, 2016).
     Neurobiology and Pharmacological Standards provides more information on pharmacology.

     SNRIs, such as atomoxetine (Strattera), are an alternative to stimulants for clients who experience side effects. They
     may also be helpful in treating concurrent depressive or anxiety disorders. SNRIs are not controlled substances, so
     they may be prescribed for adolescents (or their family members) with substance use disorders. The dosage
     depends on the child's weight, and the duration of action is ten to twelve hours. Atomoxetine has a black box
     warning about increased risk of suicidal ideation in children and adolescents (Krull, 2022).

     Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists, such as clonidine, may be utilized in combination with stimulants to reduce
     hyperactivity and sleep difficulties. These medications may also be used when children respond poorly to stimulants
     or SNRIs, have unacceptable side effects, or have significant coexisting conditions. Neuchat et al. (2023) assert that
     further research is indicated into the safe and effective long-term use of Alpha-2 agonists.

       CLINICAL JUDGMENT MEASUREMENT MODEL

       Analyze Cues: The Use of Graphic Organizers to Develop Clinical Judgment Related to the
       Use of Medication to Treat ADHD

       Nursing students today are being encouraged to use some type of graphic organizer to assist them with
       organizing the vast amount of information they are learning. Being able to analyze cues from assessment date is
       a priority nursing action. Concept maps are a tool that can be used to identify how data points are connected. To
       understand the side effects of certain medications, such as medications used to treat ADHD, a student could be
       asked to create a concept map. This would clearly connect certain side effects to certain medications and help
       the student to understand the importance of asking their clients if they are having any significant side effects
       since beginning a medication.

       (Ignatavicius & Silvestri, 2023)

     Behavioral Therapies
     Behavioral therapies are aimed at helping the child with ADHD decrease their disruptive behaviors and increase
     their positive behaviors (CDC, 2023e). Parent training in managing their children's behavior is the go-to first therapy
     for children younger than six years old. Training parents helps them be better equipped for their young children. For
     children older than six years, a combination of medication and behavior therapy is recommended, along with parent
     training and school involvement in which teachers educate children on the behavior that is expected within the
     classroom and help them to create focus plans. Behavioral therapies include parent training in "behavior
     management, behavior therapy with the child, and behavior management in the classroom" (CDC, 2023e, para. 6).

     Community Services and Information Resources

     Parents can be referred to the National Resource Center on ADHD (https://openstax.org/r/77NatADHDresour),
     funded through the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities (NCBDDD) and the CDC
     (Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder [CHADD], 2023). This program provides
     resources, an ADHD Helpline, digital media, weekly newsletters, education, and advocacy for those with ADHD and
     their families. Another great resource is the ADHD Resources Center (https://openstax.org/r/77AACAPwebsite) on
     the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry website. Parents can find educational resources, locate
     treatment resources, watch video clips, and learn about clinical resources. To find local resources, parents can

23.5 Specific Learning Disorders and Motor Disorders

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Define the various forms of specific learning disorders
    · Outline approaches used to treat specific learning disorders
    · Define and categorize motor disorders

Globally, learning disabilities occur in nearly 5 percent of all school-aged children. Learning disorders are caused by
genetic and environmental factors (Dominguez & Carugno, 2023). Risk factors for developing learning disabilities
include genetics, poverty, premature birth, alcohol exposure in utero, and traumatic brain injuries (Dominguez &
Carugno, 2023). Typically, children will be evaluated for learning disorders after they begin experiencing difficulties
in school. Children with learning disorders may feel frustrated when they cannot learn a topic or skill and may act
out, act helpless, or withdraw. Learning disorders may also be present with other disorders, such as ADHD or
anxiety, making it hard for a child to succeed in school. Children with learning disorders often require specialized
instruction to meet their needs (CDC, 2021d). Moreover, motor disorders occur in two ways: increased movement
and decreased movement. The most common motor disorder in children are tic disorders (Ueda & Black, 2021).

Defining Specific Learning Disorders

A learning disorder occurs when a person has a difficult time in an area of learning, but it is not related to
motivation or IQ level, emotional problems, cultural differences, or level of disadvantage. There are four commonly
recognized learning disorders: dyslexia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia, and nonverbal learning disability (Dominguez &
Carugno, 2023).

Dyslexia
The most common learning difference is dyslexia, which affects a person's ability to read because it causes
problems with phonological processing (Dominguez & Carugno, 2023). Dyslexia occurs in 7 to 10 percent of the
population (University of Michigan, 2023a) and is the result of brain differences in the regions that process language
(Mayo Clinic, 2022). Symptoms are often missed until the child begins school and, at that time, the teacher may be
the person to notice that the child is having a problem with word recognition. Some indications of dyslexia are being
a late talker; reversing sounds in words; difficulty naming colors, letters, and numbers; difficulty spelling; taking a
long time to complete reading and writing assignments; and avoiding reading. Early intervention is the best
treatment. Nurses should encourage parents to talk to their child's health-care provider if they notice their child is
having difficulty with reading and comprehension.

Because dyslexia affects a person's reading and comprehension, it is understandable that it would affect their
academic performance. Every subject in school requires some type of reading or writing. Students with dyslexia
might overcompensate by memorizing material and using their verbal processing skills (University of Michigan,
2023b). These students may be gifted in other learning areas, such as "thinking outside of the box, creativity,
hands-on learning, and sports" (para. 3). Teachers can use a variety of approaches in the classroom that incorporate
verbal, visual, and hands-on applications to address these students' learning needs. Accommodations (such as
having more time to take a test), an IEP (individualized education program), or a 504 (a less detailed plan often
related to accommodations) are interventions that help to support the student who has dyslexia.

Dyscalculia
Difficulty with calculation and completion of arithmetic problems is called dyscalculia. In this disorder, the child
may have difficulty completing math problems, learning basic math, using math symbols, and understanding the
way numbers relate to one another (Mayo Clinic, 2023a). Early intervention can help the child better understand
basic math by offering extra support to teach them ways to get their schoolwork completed. The child may also
benefit from an individualized education program (IEP), which sets individual learning goals to meet the child's
needs.

Dysgraphia
Distorted writing, even with instruction and intact motor ability, is called dysgraphia. This disorder causes the child
to have trouble remembering how to form letters, trouble with spelling, grammar, and punctuation, and difficulty
putting thoughts into words (Mayo Clinic, 2023a). Tutoring, getting extra time to complete assignments, or
776  23 · Children and Adolescents

     occupational therapy may help the child have an easier time with the task of writing.

     Nonverbal Learning Disability
     Nonverbal learning disorders are often undiagnosed until the third grade when children begin to have difficulty with
     reading comprehension. This disability causes difficulty with "problem-solving, recognizing social cues and body
     language, and visual-spatial tasks" (Dominguez & Carugno, 2023, para. 9). Children with these disorders often have
     good language skills. They can also be good at memorizing words. Examples of symptoms seen in this disability are
     difficulty understanding abstract concepts, not being able to read other's expressions, poor physical coordination,
     problems with fine motor skills, such as writing, and difficulty paying attention (Mayo Clinic, 2023a).

     Approaches to Treating Specific Learning Disorders

     Parents can ask the school to assess their child for learning disorders. A general physical exam may start the
     process to be sure that there are no problems with vision, hearing, or another medical condition that could be
     hindering learning. There may be a team of professionals to evaluate the child. This team can consist of a school
     psychologist, a special education teacher, an occupational therapist, a social worker or nurse, and a speech-
     language pathologist (Mayo Clinic, 2023a). The team gathers information through tests, feedback from teachers,
     feedback from parents, and a review of the child's academic history. Based on all of this information, the team will
     determine whether the child has a learning disorder and plan for the best way to help that child reach age-
     appropriate learning goals.

     The treatment plan is different for each child. It may include interventions, such as tutoring, an IEP, classroom
     accommodations, occupational or speech-language therapy, and possibly medication to address depression,
     anxiety, or behavioral issues (Mayo Clinic, 2023a).

     Criteria for Defining Motor Disorder

     The Virginia Commission on Youth (2021) describes motor disorders as a group of disorders that begin in the
     developmental years and contribute to delays in children reaching motor milestones. Symptoms include difficulty
     climbing stairs and tying shoes, making repetitive movements, and possibly having physical or verbal tics.

     The three most common categories of motor disorders are developmental coordination disorder, stereotypic
     movement disorder, and tic disorders (Virginia Commission on Youth, 2021). Developmental coordination disorder
     presents as a child not meeting motor milestones. Often, these discrepancies are not diagnosed until the child
     enters school. Stereotypic movement disorder presents early in childhood. In this disorder, individuals are unable to
     control repetitive movements other than by restricting themselves by wrapping their arms in their clothes or sitting
     on their hands. Tic disorders include vocal, motor, simple, and complex tics. The DSM-5 describes three primary tic
     disorders: Tourette disorder, persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder, and provisional tic disorder (CDC,
     2023f). The nurse is a member of the treatment team and acts as an educator and support person. See 23.6 Tic
     Disorder and Tourette Syndrome for focused information on diagnosis, medical treatment, and nursing care.

collaborated with the school nurse, as part of the treatment team for Dani, nine years old.

Dani had been born prematurely to a teen mother and was raised mostly in foster care before coming to our facility.
Dani's problem list included speech-language difficulty that impaired communication. The school's treatment team
had recommended picture boards to help with communication, but on the first day of using them, Dani had thrown
them on the floor and run out of the classroom.

At first, we worked to develop a plan to make the picture board more appealing to Dani, using different colors and
images, but the child was still resistive. One day, as we walked on the grounds, I asked Dani to tell me about the
picture boards. Struggling to explain, Dani relayed a scenario of "my Mom aways drawing `cos she could never read."
Using the picture boards in the classroom made it seem that Dani could not read and this was not how Dani wanted
to be seen by the other students.

In a treatment team meeting, Dani told us that if the teacher could give a longer time frame to answer questions,
verbal answers would be better than the pictures on the board.

It was reinforced to me that Dani's self-determination was clearly a component of advocacy, as well as a strategy,
for supported decision-making in nursing care for this client.

23.6 Tic Disorder and Tourette Syndrome

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Describe diagnosis of tic disorder and Tourette syndrome
    · Understand treatment options and the nurse's role in treatment of children with tic disorder and Tourette

        syndrome
    · Identify resources for information and support

Tourette syndrome (TS) and other tic disorders affect approximately 1 percent of school-aged children in the United
States (Tourette Association of America, n.d.). Tics are sudden twitches, movements, or sounds that occur
repeatedly in a person who is unable to stop their body from doing these actions. There are two types of tics: motor
and vocal. Motor tics are movements of the body, such as blinking, shrugging the shoulders, or jerking an arm. Vocal
tics are sounds that a person makes with their voice, such as grunting, humming, clearing the throat, or yelling out a
word or phrase. Although the media often portray people with TS as involuntarily shouting out swear words (i.e.,
coprolalia) or constantly repeating the words of other people (i.e., echolalia), these symptoms are rare (CDC,
2021e).

Diagnostic Criteria for Tic Disorder and Tourette Syndrome

A tic disorder causes a person to uncontrollably twitch, move, or make sounds. The first symptoms are often motor
tics that occur in the head and neck area. Tics are often worse during times that are stressful or exciting and tend to
improve when a person is calm or focused on an activity (CDC, 2021e). Tourette syndrome (TS) tics typically begin
when a child is five to ten years old. According to the CDC (2023g), diagnosis of Tourette syndrome occurs when a
person has two or more motor tics and at least one vocal tic that have lasted at least a year and began prior to the
age of eighteen years old. The symptoms must not be related to any other medical condition.

In most cases, tics decrease during adolescence and early adulthood and sometimes disappear entirely. But many
people with TS experience tics into adulthood and, in some cases, tics can become worse during adulthood (CDC,
2021e). Tics are typically mild and do not require treatment, but it is essential to educate the individual and others
about TS and provide appropriate support across all settings (e.g., school, work, and home). Behavioral treatment or
medication may become necessary when tics become problematic or interfere with daily functioning (Tourette
Association of America, n.d.). The DSM-5 includes three types of tic disorders: Tourette syndrome, persistent motor
or vocal tic disorder, and provisional tic disorder (CDC, 2023f).

Movements
All three types of tic disorders can have motor tics present (CDC, 2023f). In persistent motor or vocal tic disorder,
the individual has either motor or vocal tics (but not both) for at least one year (CDC, 2023f). In provisional tic
disorder, the individual has one or the other or both but symptoms must be less than a year. Tourette syndrome
778  23 · Children and Adolescents

     must have two or more motor tics and a vocal tic for at least a year. Movements include blinking, shrugging, and
     twitching.

     Vocalizations
     Vocalizations always occur in Tourette syndrome and may occur in persistent motor and vocal tic disorder and
     provisional tic disorder. Vocalizations include clearing the throat, humming, and/or yelling a phrase or word,
     sometimes an obscenity (CDC, 2023f). Despite its portrayal in media, coprolalia (using inappropriate language) only
     occurs in one in ten people who have Tourette (CDC, 2023g).

     Treatment

     There is no known cure for tic disorders, but there are medications and therapies available to reduce the tics.
     Parents should be made aware that, for some children taking stimulant medication for ADHD, tics are a possible side
     effect (Nam et al., 2022). Nurses can educate parents on support systems that are available in the community to
     help them feel less alone and able to provide comfort and support to their children.

             PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

     Teens with Tourette Syndrome

     When an adolescent enters middle school and then high school, their peer group becomes their focus. A young
     person with Tourette syndrome may experience bullying, stigma, and misunderstanding (Tourette Association of
     America, 2023). Educating others about this disorder is an important part of the school community's role to
     decrease judgmental behavior toward the student with Tourette. All students want to feel supported and able to
     make friends. This is especially important during their adolescent/teen years.

     (Tourette Association of America, 2023)

     Medications and Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics
     Both medications and behavioral interventions for tics have been found to be helpful in reducing tics. Therapies
     available include Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention Therapy (CBIT); psychotherapy to help with accompanying
     disorders, such as anxiety, depression, and ADHD; and deep brain stimulation (DBS). CBIT entails creating
     awareness of the tics and tic triggers, choosing a different behavior to replace the tics, and figuring out
     environments and stressors that increase tics and altering them. This form of therapy includes education, relaxation
     training, and behavioral rewards to the person with tics. CBIT has been shown to improve tics and offers long-term
     progress (Frey & Malaty, 2022). When a person has severe tics that are not responding to any other type of
     treatment, DBS is an option in which a battery-operated device is implanted into the person's brain. This device
     gives electrical stimulation to the targeted area of the brain that controls movement (Mayo Clinic, 2018).

     Some of the medications used to treat tics include antipsychotics, such as haloperidol (Haldol), risperidone
     (Risperdal), pimozide (Orap), and aripiprazole (Abilify). The potential side effects of weight gain and involuntary
     movements (Mayo Clinic, 2018) vary. Botox (botulinum) injections administered to an affected muscle can reduce a
     motor or vocal tic. Stimulant medications used for ADHD, such as methylphenidate (Ritalin and Metadate CD), can
     be used to increase concentration (but in some people with Tourette syndrome, this will also increase their tics).
     Antidepressants, such as fluoxetine (Prozac), assist with feelings of sadness or anxiety. And, it has been recently
     found that topiramate (Topamax), an anti-seizure medication, helps some people with Tourette syndrome (Mayo
     Clinic, 2018).

     Clonidine and guanfacine may be used to stimulate alpha2 adrenergic receptors in the brain, though these
     medications may be sedating. Also, used outside the United States, benzamides are dopamine receptor blocking
     agents with fewer side effects. These include tiapride, sulpiride, and amisulpride (Frey & Malaty, 2022).

Cincinnati Children's Hospital.

Nurse's Role
Nurses support clients and their families through diagnosis, treatment, and management of tic disorders. Nurses
can educate parents on psychosocial development in their children and the way their focus changes from family to
school to their social circles once they become teenagers (Lee, 2022). Nurses can also teach parents ways to
educate their children on tic management for long-term care. Learning how to cope with the effects of tics,
physically, educationally, and emotionally are other areas in which a nurse can assist the family (Lee, 2022). The
school nurse can be a source of support to the student by giving them a safe space to display their tics, educating
staff about Tourette syndrome, and being aware of the medications that the student is taking.

Community Services/Information Resources

The Tourette Association of America offers resources to train teens to advocate for those with Tourette and tic
disorders, while educating the public about these conditions (CDC, 2023g). The teen can download a guide to the
disorder (https://openstax.org/r/77touretteguide) to access more information about the illness, navigating school
and social situations, and becoming an ambassador to others. The website also contains a page dedicated to
resources listed in A-Z format (https://openstax.org/r/77helptourette) for individuals, parents, and professionals.

Schools can work with faculty and parents to set up an individualized education program (IEP) to support the child's
academic needs while also educating them on how to cope with this illness. The IEP might include items such as
using worksheets that require minimal writing or allowing the student to leave the classroom two to three minutes
early when moving to another class, in order to avoid crowded hallways (PACER Center, 2018).

23.7 Conduct Disorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, and Disruptive Mood
Dysregulation

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Describe disruptive, impulse control disorders, such as conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder,
        and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder

    · Understand multisystemic treatment for a child with conduct disorders
    · Identify resources for information and support

Disruptive, impulse control disorders may arise in childhood or in adolescence. This category includes behavioral
problems demonstrating lack of regard for others' feelings or rights. In 40 percent of adolescents with conduct
disorder, this disorder may develop into antisocial personality disorder in adulthood (American Psychiatric
Association, 2021b). Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) is a lesser version of conduct disorder, but 30 percent of
children diagnosed with it will go on to be diagnosed with conduct disorder. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder
(DMDD) is defined by a child's angry outbursts.

Definitions of Disruptive Disorders

These disorders may be a combination of genetic and environmental factors, but the exact cause is unknown
(Cleveland Clinic, 2022a).

Conduct Disorder
When a child shows An ongoing pattern of aggression toward others with serious violations of rules and social norms
at home, at school, and with peers is called conduct disorder (CD). These rule violations may involve breaking the
law and result in arrest (CDC, 2021f). Adults with antisocial conduct disorder typically show symptoms of CD before
age fifteen (Mayo Clinic, 2023b). Examples of CD behaviors are as follows (CDC, 2021f):

    · breaking serious rules, such as running away, staying out all night, or skipping school
    · being aggressive in a way that causes harm, such as bullying, fighting, or being cruel to animals
    · lying, stealing, or purposefully damaging other people's property

Children who exhibit these serious behaviors should receive a comprehensive evaluation and treatment by a mental
health professional. Some signs of behavior problems, such as not following rules in school, can be related to
780  23 · Children and Adolescents

     learning disorders that require additional assessment and interventions. Without treatment, many children with
     conduct disorder are likely to have ongoing problems resulting in the inability to adapt to the demands of adulthood
     (American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, 2018).

     Conduct disorder may have onset in childhood or adolescence. Symptoms can begin as early as preschool, but
     usually more serious symptoms appear when a child reaches middle school to age eighteen (American Psychiatric
     Association, 2021b). It is more common in males than in females. Conduct disorder occurs in 2 to 10 percent of
     children in the United States (Cleveland Clinic, 2022a). Conduct disorder is not diagnosed after age eighteen, so an
     adult who has the symptoms of conduct disorder may be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder.

     The exact cause of conduct disorder is unknown. It is believed to be a combination of genetic and environmental
     factors (Cleveland Clinic, 2022a). Genetic and biological factors include traumatic brain injury and seizures, higher
     than normal levels of testosterone, and inheriting the traits of conduct disorder. Environmental factors include lack
     of structure in the home environment, exposure to domestic violence, low socioeconomic status, drugs and crime in
     the child's neighborhood, and parents who have substance use problems or conduct disorder behaviors.

     Diagnosis is made after a child or adolescent is fully assessed by a mental health professional after the individual
     exhibits three or more of the following symptoms in the past twelve months and at least one symptom in the past six
     months: "seriously violating their parents' rules, lying or stealing, destruction of property, and aggression toward
     people and/or animals" (Cleveland Clinic, 2022a, "How is conduct order diagnosed?" section).

     Oppositional Defiant Disorder
     A behavioral condition in which the child has symptoms of being uncooperative, defiant, and may be hostile toward
     people in authority is called oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) (Cleveland Clinic, 2022b). Most children will
     display this type of behavior at some point in their early years, but if this behavior lasts longer than six months, then
     the child may be diagnosed with ODD. About 30 percent of children with ODD go on to develop the more serious
     behavioral symptoms of conduct disorder. This disorder can be treated with CBT, family therapy, and peer group
     therapy (Cleveland Clinic, 2022b). Although medications are not typically used, there have been studies conducted
     showing that medications, such as guanfacine, may have some benefit at decreasing symptoms (Newcorn et al.,
     2020).

     Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder
     Another behavioral disorder seen in children is disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) in which children
     experience chronic, intense, angry outbursts. This disorder may be a comorbidity with autism and other
     neurodevelopmental disorders. To diagnose DMDD, symptoms need to be present before the child turns ten years
     old and must disrupt their daily lives (Cleveland Clinic, 2022c). Psychotherapy is a first-line treatment for this
     disorder tried prior to considering the use of any medications. There is not specific FDA-approved medication for
     DMDD, but medications may be prescribed to manage certain symptoms--stimulants to decrease irritability,
     antidepressants for mood, and atypical antipsychotic medications to treat aggression (Cleveland Clinic, 2022c).

     Multisystemic Treatment (MST)

     Multisystemic treatment (MST) is an intensive therapy that takes place over a three- to five-month period and uses a
     family-based approach (AnnaFreud.org, 2023). This type of therapy provides support for both the child/adolescent
     and their parents. It can occur in the home, school, or other chosen area within the individual's local community.
     The goal is to interrupt the cycles leading to disruptive behaviors. The MST therapist works closely with the family to
     provide twenty-four-hour support and education on ways to avoid antisocial behaviors. Benefits of this treatment
     include reduced incarceration, reduced delinquent behavior, improved mental health, and improved family
     functioning (County Health Rankings, 2023).

Medications
Medication is not a first-line treatment for conduct disorder. If the child/adolescent is experiencing explosive anger,
then the health-care provider may suggest that the individual take risperidone (Risperdal). Risperidone is an
antipsychotic medication that has been FDA-approved to help children with autism spectrum disorder. It may be
used off-label for short periods of time in children/adolescents with conduct disorder (Miller, 2023).

Treatment Settings, Family Therapy
Starting treatment early for CD is important. For younger children, research indicates the most effective treatment is
behavior therapy training for parents where a therapist helps the parent learn effective ways to strengthen the
parent-child relationship and respond to the child's behavior. For school-age children and teens, a combination of
behavior therapy training that includes the child, the family, and the school is most effective (American Academy of
Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, 2018).

Behavioral interventions for the classroom help children and adolescents succeed academically. Behavioral
classroom management is a teacher-led approach that encourages a student's positive behaviors in the classroom
through a reward system or a daily report card and discourages their negative behaviors. Organizational training
teaches children and adolescents time management, planning skills, and ways to keep school materials organized to
optimize student learning and reduce distractions (CDC, 2021f).

Behavioral interventions reward desired behaviors and reduce maladaptive coping behaviors. Most child and
adolescent treatment settings use structured programs to motivate and reward age-appropriate behaviors. For
example, the point or star system may be used where the child receives points or stars for desired behaviors, and
then specific privileges are awarded based on the points or stars earned each day.

The basis of family therapy is to decrease negative interactional patterns between family members. The parents of
children with conduct disorders often place blame on their children for everything else that is not going well in the
family environment (Helimaki et al., 2020). Developing a working relationship with the different family members can
be a challenge for the therapist as the layers of relationships all influence family dynamics. One point that Helimaki
et al. (2020) make is that it is important to be sure that if the child is present in sessions with the parents that the
child is not left out of the conversation or just a passive participant who is listening to what is being said about them.

        PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Family Empowerment

Families that have a child with conduct disorder can feel overwhelmed by the behaviors present in this disorder.
Nurses and other mental health professionals are in a position in which they can help to empower these families.
Family therapy offers a safe space for family members to share their feelings of guilt, fear, shame, and vulnerability
(Helimaki et al., 2020). Therapists and nurses can teach the family how to build better communication between
family members while dealing with their child's difficult behaviors.

(Helimaki et al., 2020)

Nurse's Role
There are several evidence-based strategies that nurses can teach parents and caregivers to help manage behaviors
of children and adolescents with conduct disorder, such as time-out and special time (Hilt & Nussbaum, 2016). As
part of parent management training (PMT), the intervention of time-out may be effective for emotional regulation
when used consistently in a therapeutic manner (Roach et al., 2022). Such consistency increases the child's feeling
of security as opposed to dysfunctional forms of discipline. Roach et al. (2022) acknowledge the need for further
research in this area. Time-out is a strategy for shaping a child's behavior through selective and temporary removal
of the child's access to desired attention, activities, or other reinforcements following a behavioral transgression.
This strategy works for children who experience regular positive praise and attention from their parents or
caregivers because they feel motivated to maintain that positive regard. The length of time should be about one
minute for each year of age, but adjustments need to be made based on the child's developmental level. For
example, children with developmental delays should have shorter durations (Hilt & Nussbaum, 2016). Tips for
caregivers implementing time-outs include the following (Hilt & Nussbaum, 2016):
782  23 · Children and Adolescents

         · Set consistent limits to avoid confusion.
         · Focus on changing priority misbehaviors rather than everything at once.
         · After setting a time-out, decline further verbal engagement until a "time-in."
         · Ensure time-outs occur immediately after misbehavior rather than being delayed.
         · Follow through if using warnings (e.g., "I'm going to count to three . . . ").
         · State when the time-out is over. Setting a timer can be helpful.
         · When the time-out finishes, congratulate the child on regaining personal control and then look for the next

             positive behavior to praise.
         · Give far more positive attention than negative attention.

     Special time is a strategy for a caregiver and a young child to establish the enjoyment of each other's company. It is
     also referred to as "child-directed play" because it emphasizes that caregivers follow the child's lead. Tips for
     caregivers implementing special time include the following (Hilt & Nussbaum, 2016):

         · Commit to setting aside a regular time for "special time." Daily is best, but two to three times a week
             consistently also works.

         · Select the time of day and label it as "our special time." Choose a time short enough that it can happen
             reliably, usually 15 to 30 minutes. Ensure that this time happens no matter how good or bad the day's
             behaviors were.

         · Allow the child to select the activity, which must be something you do not actively dislike or does not involve
             spending money or completing a chore.

         · Follow the child's lead during play, resisting the urge to tell them what to do.
         · End on time; a timer may be helpful. Remind the child when the next special time will be.
         · If the child refuses at first, explain you will just sit with them during the "special time."
         · Expect greater success if you set your own special times for yourself, too.

     Strengths and Protective Factors Identification
     Children and adolescents pull their strengths from several areas. Nurses recognize that these strengths then
     become the children's protective factors. When children can engage in activities with others and gain a sense of
     enjoyment and well-being from that activity, they build their own sense of self-esteem and social support systems
     (Go et al., 2017). Children growing up in a home environment with positive parental influence have a higher
     likelihood of more positive outcomes versus children who are exposed to intimate partner violence and sexual
     abuse. School involvement is also a protective factor that supports children and adolescents by encouraging
     engagement and minimizing the number of conduct issues (Go et al., 2017).

     Functional Analysis
     Functional analysis is a strategy for preventing a recurring problematic behavior by first identifying why a behavior
     keeps recurring and then devising a plan to prevent recurrences. For example, a parent reports their young child
     "throws temper tantrums every time we go to the store." As the mental health professional, the nurse helps the
     parent analyze the behavior, the parent realizes they have been giving the child candy to halt the tantrums, which
     actually functions to reward the behavior and encourages it to happen again. If the parent were to stop delivering
     this unintentional reward, the tantrums would theoretically decrease. Alternatively, the parent may focus on
     avoiding reexposing the child to a recognized trigger for the behavior (Hilt & Nussbaum, 2016).

Summary

23.1 Intellectual Disabilities

Intellectual disabilities are diagnosed in the developmental years but continue to affect individuals across the life
span. Intellectual disabilities affect about 1 percent of the world's population. There are many categories of
intellectual disabilities that range from mild to severe. There are three areas of functioning affected by intellectual
disabilities: conceptual, social, and practical. Causes can be related to genetics, maternal exposure to toxins while
pregnant, and environmental factors. Treatments are based on the type of intellectual disability that has been
diagnosed and any comorbidities that exist. Early intervention is a key component of all treatments.

23.2 Communication Disorders

Approximately one in ten American children have a communication disorder, one of a group of neurodevelopmental
disorders that affect speech and language development (Psychology Today, 2022). The DSM-5 breaks
communication disorders into five categories: language disorder, speech sound disorder, childhood-onset fluency
disorder (stuttering), social communication disorder, and unspecified communication disorder (those that do not
meet the DSM-5 criteria).

The type of intervention used to treat a communication disorder is based on the child's age, the severity of the
disorder and whether it is connected to another disorder. Interventions are intended to assist the child in developing
their language skills and remove barriers to social participation (Law et al., 2017). Early intervention is considered to
have the best outcomes and low-cost or free services may be available.

23.3 Autism Spectrum Disorder

According to the CDC, in 2020, approximately one in thirty-six children were identified as having autism spectrum
disorder (ASD). ASD is a developmental disorder of the brain that causes impairment in behavior, communication,
interaction with others, and learning. The American Academy of Pediatrics (2023) recommends screening children
during their well-child visits at ages eighteen months and twenty-four months. This screening helps to identify
developmental and behavioral challenges.

The nurse's role is primarily education-based. Nurses can assist parents in finding community resources and
services that support the care of the child with ASD. Current treatments for ASD seek to reduce symptoms that
interfere with daily functioning and quality of life. ASD affects each person differently, meaning that people with ASD
have unique strengths and challenges and thus different treatment needs. Treatment plans typically involve multiple
professionals with interventions customized to the individual.

23.4 Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders of
childhood. It is usually diagnosed in childhood but often lasts into adulthood. ADHD affects approximately 9.8
percent of children aged thirteen to seventeen (CDC, 2022f). There is no single test to diagnose ADHD, and many
other problems, such as anxiety, depression, sleep problems, and learning disorders, can have similar symptoms as
ADHD. There are three types of ADHD, depending on which types of symptoms are strongest in the individual:
inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive, and combined (CDC, 2021c). The main symptoms in ADHD, being impulsive and
inattentive, can cause these children to have a higher risk for injuries.

Nurses should be aware of the different community resources available and refer parents to those entities; they
should understand the medications prescribed to those with ADHD and therapies that have proven effective.
Stimulants such as methylphenidate (Ritalin), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine), and dextroamphetamine-
amphetamine (Adderall) are considered first-line treatment because of rapid onset of action and a long record of
safety and efficacy. Behavioral therapies are aimed at helping the child with ADHD decrease their disruptive
behaviors and increase their positive behaviors (CDC, 2023e).

23.5 Specific Learning Disorders and Motor Disorders

Globally, learning disabilities occur in nearly 5 percent of all school-aged children. Learning disorders are caused by
genetic and environmental factors (Dominguez & Carugno, 2023). Risk factors for developing learning disabilities
784 23 · Key Terms

include genetics, poverty, premature birth, alcohol exposure in utero, and traumatic brain injuries (Dominguez &
Carugno, 2023). There are four commonly recognized learning disorders: dyslexia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia, and
nonverbal learning disability (Dominguez & Carugno, 2023). The treatment plan is different for each child. It may
include interventions, such as tutoring, an IEP, classroom accommodations, occupational or speech-language
therapy, and possibly medication to address depression, anxiety, or behavioral issues (Mayo Clinic, 2023a). Motor
disorders are a group of disorders that begin in the developmental years and cause delays in children reaching
motor milestones. Symptoms include difficulty climbing stairs and tying shoes, making repetitive movements, or
having physical or verbal tics.

23.6 Tic Disorder and Tourette Syndrome

Tourette syndrome (TS) and other tic disorders affect approximately 1 percent of school-aged children in the United
States (Tourette Association of America, n.d.). Tics are sudden twitches, movements, or sounds that people do
repeatedly with the inability to stop their body from doing these actions. In most cases, tics decrease during
adolescence and early adulthood, and sometimes disappear entirely. The DSM-5 includes three types of tic
disorders: Tourette syndrome, persistent motor or vocal tic disorder, and provisional tic disorder (CDC, 2023f).

There is no known cure for tic disorders, but there are medications and therapies available to reduce the tics. Some
of the medications used to treat tics include antipsychotics, such as haloperidol (Haldol), risperidone (Risperdal),
pimozide (Orap), and aripiprazole (Abilify). Botox (botulinum) injections administered to an affected muscle can
reduce a motor or vocal tic. Comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics (CBIT) includes education, relaxation
training, and behavioral rewards to the person with tics. CBIT has been shown to improve tics over the long-term
(Frey & Malaty, 2022).

23.7 Conduct Disorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, and Disruptive Mood Dysregulation

Conduct disorder (CD) is diagnosed when a child shows an ongoing pattern of aggression toward others with serious
violations of rules and social norms at home, at school, and with peers. Conduct disorder symptoms can begin as
early as preschool but usually worsen when a child reaches middle school to age eighteen (American Psychiatric
Association, 2021b). It is more common in males than females. Conduct disorder occurs in 2 to 10 percent of
children in the United States (Cleveland Clinic, 2022a). The exact cause of conduct disorder is unknown.
Multisystemic treatment (MST) is therapy that takes place over a three- to five-month period and uses a family-
based approach (AnnaFreud.org, 2023). This type of therapy provides support for both the child/adolescent and
their parents. Medication is not a first-line treatment for conduct disorder. Research indicates the most effective
treatment is behavior therapy training for parents where a therapist helps the parent learn effective ways to
strengthen the parent-child relationship and respond to the child's behavior. For school-age children and teens, a
combination of behavior therapy training that includes the child, the family, and the school is most effective
(American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, 2018).

INTRODUCTION The fastest-growing portion of the population, older adults, will call for nurses and other health-
care professionals with specialized training to meet their needs. A holistic approach to nursing care for the older
adult population is necessary to address the physical, psychological, social, and economic factors that affect the
health of older persons. People age differently, so there are variations in older adults' physical, psychological, and
cognitive health. Even though aging is associated with typical physiological changes, many people disregard
symptoms by incorrectly attributing them to age. For instance, many older persons misunderstand the pain
associated with arthritis and wrongly think it is a natural part of becoming older. As a result, they do not seek
treatment, which results in a reduction in physical activity and an increased risk of acquiring chronic disease. Older
clients can benefit from receiving specialized nursing care and client education that will help them take charge of
their health.

     24.1 Healthcare Concerns and Decisions of Older Adults

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Discuss complexity of health status of older adults
         · Summarize healthy aging and health literacy for older adults
         · Outline resources available for planning care for older adults

     A successful aging goal for older adults is staying as healthy as possible for as long as possible. Education that
     meets the person's health literacy can help with this goal. Health can be a complex situation for many older adults
     and requires not only the involvement of the client but also of the family or caregiver. Access to care is vitally
     important as is communication within the multidisciplinary health-care team. The nurse can provide the connection
     that keeps all the pieces together.

     Complexity of Health Status in Older Adults

     People of any age can have complex health statuses. With older adults, however, the chances are higher due to the
     normal aging process as well as the long-term effects of a long life lived. It is common for an older adult to have
     multiple illnesses that are complex on their own, but become more so when combined with other health issues. For
     example, a client may have high blood pressure with chronic kidney disease as well as depression. Managing each of
     these on their own requires knowledge and skill, but adding in how they interact with each other can make the care
     even more complicated. In this example, a medical provider must know how the treatment choices affect other
     systems or illnesses. If an antidepressant is prescribed for this client, how does it affect the kidneys and how do the
     kidneys process the medication? What are the drug-to-drug interactions? The age factor and treatments or
     medications affect the more fragile physiological systems of the client and all contribute to the complexity of the
     health status.

     Access to Care for Older Adults
     Access to care is a very complex issue for older adults for many reasons. For some older adults, access is no issue;
     for others, every step of the process is a barrier or a potential barrier. Challenges like locating providers and
     scheduling appointments, lack of transportation, lack of knowledge for use of technology, the general affordability of
     care, and cultural considerations that may lead to actual and perceived barriers to care may affect access to health
     care for older adults. The need to see various specialists and the possible need for more frequent visits may add to
     access issues.

     Adults aged sixty-five and over have access to Medicare for health-care insurance coverage. Medicare Part A is
     available with enrollment, and Part B is available with enrollment and a premium. Medicare Part A covers hospital
     and rehabilitation care while Part B covers ambulatory or home care. Some older adults have secondary insurance
     to supplement Medicare. Older adults with limited income may be eligible for Medicaid, health insurance available
     based on income, in the state where they reside. Some clients have both Medicare and Medicaid.

     Seeking medical care, particularly preventative care, is important for older adults. For older adults who are eligible
     for Medicare and/or Medicaid, there may be resources available for locating care. Some people have very little or no
     access to care, however. Older adults who do not hold citizenship or are visiting from other countries do not have
     access to Medicare or Medicaid in most circumstances. Those without insurance must either pay out of pocket for
     care if they can afford it or, if available, can access care in community-funded clinics or care systems.

     Locating care in itself can be difficult in some cases. Even in large cities, insurers may limit coverage that providers
     accept. Resources, such as telehealth/e-health virtual services, that are mainly available via the Internet may not be
     available for, or understood by, older adults. Wilson et al. (2021), while acknowledging the benefit of improved
     electronic services design, assert that education in use of computerized data would greatly influence older adults'
     engagement with the resource. Further, such education could also address older adults' perceptions of information
     presented online and provide clarity. This educational aspect is an excellent opportunity for nurses. Whether as
     educators or facilitators, nurses are well positioned as trusted professionals to promote knowledge acquisition in
     the older adult community.

     Transportation to appointments can be a major barrier to care. Many older adults may not drive, may not have

caregivers to assist, or may live in areas that do not have public transportation. Even those who do live in areas that
have public transportation may not be able to afford the cost, or may be physically or mentally unable to navigate
the complex routes.

Cultural barriers are complex because some of the barriers are perceived rather than actual; that does not, however,
make them easier to navigate. This is particularly true in mental health care. According to the National Council for
Mental Wellbeing (2019), culture can impact mental health by creating a cultural stigma (seeing mental health
challenges as a weakness) that can cause people to avoid seeking care as well as attempt to hide their mental
health challenges. Symptoms may be misunderstood when the mental health provider is of a different culture than
the client because the descriptors may differ when describing physical and mental symptoms. Culture can
determine the amount of support that a person can expect from their community or their family. Lastly, culturally
specific resources may be difficult or time-consuming to locate (National Council for Mental Wellbeing, 2019).

        CULTURAL CONTEXT

Coping Styles

Because coping styles vary according to cultural influence, the nurse must be sensitive to differences in clients'
approach to health concerns. Some may avoid acceptance of problems, while others may turn to family members or
spiritual advisors. Individuals may view seeking assistance from the health-care system in different ways; some
behaviors may be based on mistrust or language barriers.

Providers of care may have their own cultural perspective, for example, valuing Western medicine or strict
adherence to treatment guidelines. Providers may harbor implicit bias toward older adults as frail or cognitively
impaired or believe that everyone has equal access to health care.

(Mental Health First Aid, 2019)

Partnering with Providers of Care for Older Adults
The family of the older adult is of primary importance. The family of the client needs support just like the client. In
some cases, the definition of family includes a close trusted friend, an extended family member, a caregiver, care
managers, or a guardian. The care of older adults may require a team, and in some cases, the team includes multiple
health-care professionals. In addition to the client and their family caregivers, the team may include nurses, social
workers, therapists, and case managers, as well as medical specialists. Communication between members of the
team is imperative to prevent errors in care and ensure continuity (Bhatt & Swick, 2017).

Chronic Disease
The National Council on Aging provides statistics on chronic conditions in adults aged sixty-five and older. According
to its research, 80 percent of older adults have at least one chronic condition, and up to 68 percent have two or
more (National Council on Aging, 2023). There are many factors that affect a person's likelihood of developing a
chronic disease, from genetic predisposition to risk factors like smoking or environmental exposure. People can
make choices--like lifestyle changes and consistent medical care--in their lives to prevent or reduce the risks and
effects of chronic illnesses if they choose to do so. Table 24.1 lists the top ten chronic conditions for adults over the
age of sixty-five.

     Healthy Aging

     Staying well for as long as possible is healthy aging. It encompasses the whole person. Staying active, which entails
     safe driving, physical exercise, and activities of daily living can help older adults maintain functional independence
     and promote general independence. Staying connected with the community is another factor that plays a role in
     healthy aging. This may mean attending a church group, joining a Bingo or game group, spending time with family,
     volunteering, or participating at a community center.

     Likewise, nutrition is an important part of healthy aging. Maintaining a healthy diet has many benefits, including a
     longer healthy life, maintenance of energy, and prevention or reduction of chronic illness. According to DeSilva
     (2021), older adults have a higher diet quality than younger people, but still have room for improvement. Encourage
     older adults to increase fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and dairy while cutting back on added sugars, sodium,
     and saturated fats. Older adults could also improve their protein consumption, particularly seafood, dairy, and
     alternatives, such as beans, lentils, and peas, which all have additional calcium, vitamins D and B12, and fiber
     (DeSilva, 2021). The absorption of vitamin B12 decreases as people age, particularly with the use of some
     medications and may require supplementation. If access is an issue, there are multiple programs available to help
     older adults with food availability, such as Meals on Wheels (https://openstax.org/r/77mealsonwheels) and
     Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) (https://openstax.org/r/77SNAP) as well as local food banks and
     services.

     Another critical component of healthy aging is maintaining mental and brain health. Mental health issues, such as
     depression, anxiety, mood disorders, and cognitive impairment, are common as people age. According to the
     National Council on Aging (Cameron, 2023), up to 25 percent of those age fifty-five and up are affected by a mental
     health issue. There are many resources available for mental health care, from primary care psychiatrists to various
     levels of mental health professionals, such as psychologists, counselors, therapists, social workers, nurse
     practitioners, peer specialists, and pastoral counselors (National Alliance on Mental Illness [NAMI], 2020). The brain
     changes with aging and more so with certain chronic illnesses, due to reduction in blood flow or neuronal activity or
     inflammation. Keeping the brain as healthy as possible involves keeping the body and mind as healthy as possible.
     Although some memory lapses are normal from time to time, there are resources available to help determine when
     the older adult should speak with their medical provider about concerning memory loss. A wealth of information for
     professionals who care for older adults can be found at the National Council on Aging's web site
     (https://www.ncoa.org/professionals/health/center-for-healthy-aging).

     Managing chronic illness and preventing new illness, along with managing medications and treatments, help
     contribute to healthy aging. Knowing and understanding medications that are prescribed, as well as over-the-
     counter and supplemental medications can help with side effects and prevent interactions and duplications. Lastly,
     keeping vaccinations up to date prevents many communicable illnesses.

     Self-Management
     Chronic disease is a normal part of aging, and millions of people struggle to manage these chronic illnesses and

their symptoms. A person's active involvement in their own health-care decisions and intervention to promote their
own best possible wellness with the help of the health-care team is considered self-management. Older adults age
sixty-five and above are prescribed medications more commonly than any other age group in the United States.
Being able to correctly self-manage medications involves establishing habits, establishing routines, setting
reminders, and keeping track of current medications with dosages, frequency, and times.

There are available programs, such as the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP), that provide
workshops for adults with at least one chronic disease. The focus is on decision-making, action planning, and
problem-solving for disease management. It is an interactive program with goals to increase knowledge of ways to
manage chronic disease; motivate older adults to manage the challenges associated with chronic diseases, as well
as their physical and psychological well-being; and help increase confidence. The target audience is adults with
arthritis, those with one or more chronic conditions, and older adults.

One of the most significant barriers to self-management of chronic health issues and medications is cognitive
status. The older adult with cognitive issues, such as mild or moderate cognitive impairment, may be unable to
adhere to medication regimens or make decisions. The management of chronic disease and management may fall to
a family member or caregiver. Low health and medical literacy can also be a barrier to self-management. If a person
or caregiver is unable to fully understand the illness or disease and the related treatment, it can compromise their
ability to manage the illness or disease.

Health Literacy
As with all people, older adults have varying levels of cognitive ability, education, and general knowledge. The ability
to obtain, comprehend, and utilize information in the process of making health decisions is called personal health
literacy, according to the National Institutes for Health (NIH). It is a crucial component to healthy aging. Critical to
this process are resources to inform a decision and the ability to understand and use the resources. Personal health
literacy is a very important factor to consider when nurses provide education in any form, when giving instructions
for care, and when asking a person to provide informed consent, for instance.

Defined by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), organizational health literacy is how well an
organization assists clients and family members to receive and understand information used to render health
decisions (2022). The ability of persons and families to make a well-informed health-care decision may be
dependent on the hospital's ability to provide the needed information and professional staff to assist, in a way that
consumers can understand. The seminal study by the National Center for Education Statistics (2006) reports that 71
percent of older adults age sixty and above have difficulty with using printed materials, 80 percent have difficulty
with using forms or charts, and 68 percent have difficulty with interpreting numbers and doing calculations.

        LINK TO LEARNING

Communicating with older adults can be challenging as is ensuring they have an adequate level of health literacy.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has provided some suggestions for effective communication
with older adults (https://openstax.org/r/77oldadultcomm) to help ensure they fully understand health-related
messages.

Available Resources for Older Clients

There are many resources available for older adults in the United States: resources to help with services for older
adults aging in place in their homes and living independently, help with taxes, help deciding about medical
insurance, help securing transportation, help finding eligibility for government or state benefits, help modifying a
home, or help finding a caregiver. In the following paragraph are listed some of the most frequently used resources.

The National Council on Aging (https://openstax.org/r/77NatlCounclAge) is a resource that works with nonprofit
organizations, government programs, and businesses to provide community programs and services. It is a great
place to locate programs that are available to assist with healthy aging and financial security for people sixty years
old and above.

The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) (https://openstax.org/r/77AARP) is a nonprofit organization
802  24 · Older Adults

     that focuses on helping people aged fifty and older and improving their quality of life. The website has information,
     discounts, products, and news that is specific to older adults. AARP also has the AARP Foundation, which works to
     assist low-income older adults with getting many necessities, such as food, affordable housing, legal assistance,
     and social connections.

     The Eldercare Locator (https://openstax.org/r/77Eldercare) is a free national resource provided by the U.S.
     Administration of Aging (AoA) and the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging (n4a). The goal is to help older
     adults find local resources, such as the following types of programs:

         · nutrition and meal programs, such as Meals on Wheels or nutritionists
         · caregiver support, such as support groups, caregiver training, or possibilities for respite care
         · information about state or local assistance programs, such as the state's department of aging or local

             volunteer groups
         · health insurance/benefits counseling
         · resources for help with applications, such as for Medicaid, respite care, and veterans' programs

     The National Institute on Aging (NIA) (https://openstax.org/r/77NIA) is a subsection of the National Institute on
     Health that conducts research dedicated to aging, health, and well-being of older adults. It also runs an interactive
     site called Go4Life (https://openstax.org/r/77Go4Life) for adults aged fifty years and older for starting a home
     exercise and physical activity routine. There are many other national, state, and local resources that are available to
     families and older adults online.

     Nutrition and Housing
     The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has a long list of resources for older adults and nutrition as well as other
     helpful resources, such as an older adult care locator, exercise and physical activity guidance, and general health
     tips. The MyPlate Plan (https://openstax.org/r/77myplateplan) gives a personalized food plan based on a person's
     age, sex, height, weight, and physical activity level. Figure 24.2 shows a sample meal plan appropriate for a ninety-
     year-old female who is 5ft 2in and 110 pounds and is minimally active. For older adults, the MyPlate
     recommendations include the following:

         · Make eating a social event.
         · Drink plenty of liquids.
         · Add a touch of spice.
         · Make the most of your food choices.
         · Be mindful of your nutrient needs.
         · Keep food safe (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2022).

According to Feeding America (2023), 5.5 million seniors (sixty and over) experienced hunger in 2021. That
represents 7.1 percent of all seniors or one in fourteen. Seniors' health is severely affected by hunger, which
exacerbates chronic illnesses, including diabetes, asthma, and depression. Federal poverty income guidelines for
2024 are set for individuals as annual income of $15,060 (Healthcare.gov, 2024). Older adults who have an income
at or below 185 percent of the federal poverty income guidelines are eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program (SNAP). SNAP provides a debit card that can be used to buy food. Moreover, Meals on Wheels is
a community-based meal program and provides healthy meals to homebound older adults who have limited
resources.

Housing also plays a major role in older adults aging in a healthy manner. Older adults live in a variety of types of
housing: individual homes, alone or with family; standard apartments or senior apartments; independent living
facilities; assisted living facilities; personal care homes; memory care facilities; and nursing homes. The most
challenging part of housing for older adults is paying for care when they can no longer live independently or when
they require significant care. Private caregivers are very expensive as is institutional care. Most of this is paid
privately. Medicaid and long-term care insurance are the only means of funding for facility-based long-term care,
with Medicaid only paying for nursing home care for eligible people.

Individual homes, apartments, and senior apartments are generally the same in terms of services. Either
independent older adults provide their own care, transportation, and management or family/caregivers assist them.
A senior adult apartment complex may provide additional services, such as activities, meals, and on-site home
health or pay-for-service caregivers. Independent living facilities usually provide some or all meals, nursing staff in
an emergency, as well as utilities and routine housekeeping.

Characteristics of assisted living facilities (ALF) differ from state to state, are regulated by the states, and are
804  24 · Older Adults

     generally licensed in categories based on intensity of services. All levels of assisted living (sometimes referred to as
     Level 1, 2, or 3) help with activities, meals, housekeeping, caregiving, and employ varying levels of nursing staff. The
     independent living category requires that residents are able to evacuate in an emergency, get to the dining room
     under their own power, and may receive minimal supervision and assistance. The second category includes facilities
     that provide more care and can have residents that require assistance with mobility and activities of daily living,
     more hands-on care, and more supervision. The third category may be known as memory care and provides secured
     facilities or units within a larger assisted living. Residents of these facilities range from those who wander
     independently to those who require total care by caregivers, but not intensive nursing care.

     As far as nursing staff, most facilities have licensed vocational nurses (LVN)/licensed practical nurses (LPN) to
     provide direct care and administer medications; a registered nurse is designated in a supervisory role. Medication
     aides may be present in some facilities. Nursing assistants generally provide most of the basic direct care twenty-
     four hours a day, as well as caregivers the residents may have individually.

     Personal care homes are considered assisted living facilities but are different in that they are usually standard
     houses in neighborhoods housing multiple residents and maintaining caregivers twenty-four hours a day. This type
     of housing runs the entire spectrum of care, from houses that care for younger people with psychiatric or
     developmental issues who only require medication administration and supervision, to total care residents who are
     ventilator-dependent with feeding tubes. The staff in these facilities are trained on the job and do not require
     licensing or formal training programs. According to the Compendium of Residential Care and Assisted Living
     Regulations and Policy (Carder et al., 2015) published by the Department of Health and Human Services, the range
     of in-service or continuing education time that states required of the direct care staff ranges from unstated to
     eleven+ hours. There is no requirement to have a nurse on staff. Most states require licensing, but do not stop
     unlicensed facilities from opening and continuing to care for clients.

     Some long-term or extended care facilities are categorized as "nursing homes" and provide full care for multiple
     residents with varying levels of need and ability. These facilities are staffed twenty-four hours a day with nurses,
     usually LVNs/LPNs, with RNs designated in a supervisory role, and nursing assistants providing the personal care.
     Within these facilities are residential clients as well as skilled nursing clients. "Skilled" is a reimbursement term,
     which means the service will qualify for insurance coverage. Such services include rehabilitative therapies and
     complex nursing care that has more of a medical focus, such as wound care or intravenous therapy. Clients admitted
     for skilled care remain for a temporary time before they return to their previous living situation, usually after an
     acute hospital stay.

     Caregiver Considerations for Older Adults
     Resources for older adults often include finding caregivers. A caregiver for an older adult must be prepared to
     provide multiple types of support and assistance. The goal should always be to provide assistance in a way that
     promotes as much independence as possible while maintaining safety. Autonomy is an important goal to maintain
     as long as possible because it contributes to quality of life. A caregiver should be prepared to provide several basic
     types of care. Personal care entails helping with activities of daily living (ADLs), such as bathing, dressing, grooming,
     or other personal care that the client may require. Household help or instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs)
     include cleaning, laundry, cooking, yard work, or repairs. Emotional support means spending time, talking, or
     otherwise offering reassurance that the client is cared for. Health-care support involves assisting with going to
     doctor appointments, handling medication, and even making medical decisions if the client is not able to and the
     caregiver has the legal authorization to represent the client.

     Quality of Life in Older Clients
     Many factors affect our lives on a daily or continual basis. Some factors may not seem like they would significantly
     affect our lives, but the buildup of frustration due to lack of resources or any number of difficulties in accessing care

or day-to-day necessities can lead to dissatisfaction with life or with a period of life. A person's individual view of
their health, comfort, and ability to enjoy activities of daily living is considered their quality of life (QOL). This is a
very individual concept and would be different for each person asked. QOL also changes as a person ages and as
their physical and medical situation changes. For example, a healthy person in their sixties may consider a high QOL
to mean being active, engaged, and healthy. A person in their nineties with severe cognitive impairment, on the
other hand, may define QOL as being provided comfort care and an ability to eat and enjoy their food. QOL is rooted
in a person's culture, faith, condition, and personal life experiences. Consider QOL when making decisions on care
both medically and in caregiving.

Advance directives are documents that describe the person's wishes in advance of when the information may be
needed and usually include a living will or health-care surrogate designation. An advance directive is created by a
person when they are still in a cognitively intact status; it gives directions to their medical providers to be used in
certain situations, such as code status when they have an irreversible terminal illness. Advance directives are very
helpful in making sure that the health-care team follows the client's wishes even if they cannot speak for
themselves. They are also helpful for the family so that they do not have to guess what their loved one wants for end
of life or in the case of a terminal illness. These legal instructions also prevent a family member from making
changes to the end-of-life plan when the client is no longer able to participate in the conversation. Refer families
interested in creating advance directives to the National Institute on Aging (https://openstax.org/r/77NatlInstAging).

        REAL RN STORIES

Nurse: Bruce, RN
Years in Practice: Twenty-two
Clinical Setting: Assisted living facility
Geographic Location: Texas

Bruce is an RN and the director of nursing for a Level 2 assisted living facility with a memory care unit. He is working
with a resident and his family in the memory care unit. The resident is a ninety-six-year-old man with advanced
dementia. He has multiple medical issues that are currently managed but is now having difficulty swallowing. The
current options are either to leave him eating foods by mouth with the knowledge that he may be aspirating (getting
food in his lungs) or to have a feeding tube put in his stomach. Bruce must discuss the change with the resident's
family and the medical provider in charge of his care. Because Bruce's first concern is safety, he suggested to the
family to have a feeding tube put in. This suggestion has a secondary effect in that the resident will have to move
into a nursing home because his care becomes more complex and his medication will have to be given through the
feeding tube. Bruce discusses both options with the family and leaves them to make the final decision. The family
brings up the question of quality of life and states that the resident has said that if he cannot eat foods that he loves,
he does not want to be alive. The family elects not to place a feeding tube and to allow him to eat as he chooses.
Should he aspirate, the family will consider hospice to provide comfort and symptom management.

24.2 Depression

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Discuss the potential changes in mental status for older adults
    · Describe ways to prevent depression in older adults
    · Outline the approaches to treating an older adult with depression
    · Support the family with an older adult who has depression

Depression is not a normal part of aging, but it is also not an uncommon occurrence in older adults. There are many
factors that can contribute to depression in older adults, but in many cases, depression is preventable. The signs
and symptoms are frequently overlooked or dismissed as normal parts of aging. It is well within the nurse's scope of
practice to recognize when a client may be depressed or be at risk for depression.
806  24 · Older Adults

     Mental Changes Associated with Aging

     Aging affects the entire body, including the brain, even in those with "normal" aging. With normal aging, certain
     parts of the brain shrink, and in certain brain areas, the neurons may not be able to communicate as effectively.
     Blood flow to the brain may be less due to cholesterol deposits or atherosclerosis and narrowing of blood vessels.
     Inflammation, which is a normal response to injury or disease, increases with age. All of these changes can affect a
     person's mental function. Complex memory and learning tests may be more difficult. Learning new tasks may take
     more time. The brain does, however, maintain the ability to change and adapt to manage new challenges with aging.

     Chronic illness can exponentially increase the changes to the brain. Microvascular changes, or tiny, microscopic
     strokes that occur with high blood pressure, add up over time and can lead to vascular neurocognitive disorder in
     some people. Larger strokes, such as those caused by atrial fibrillation, also have significant effects both short- and
     long-term. There are things that people can do to slow or reduce the chances of changes to the brain, such as not
     smoking, limiting alcohol use, being physically active, receiving proper medical care, taking medications as
     prescribed, keeping appointments with providers, and eating a healthy balanced diet.

     The older a person becomes, the more loss they may encounter. They may lose pets, friends, family, possibly a
     spouse or even a child. The loss of independence and/or loss of function also happens to some aging adults. This
     may happen gradually or suddenly. All of this loss must be processed and grieved. Bereavement is associated with
     cognitive decline (Atalay & Staneva, 2020).

     Development Task: Integrity versus Despair
     One cannot discuss changes to the brain through aging without considering psychosocial changes. Integrity versus
     despair is the final stage of Erik Erikson's stages of psychosocial development, beginning at age sixty-five and
     ending at death. (See 2.2 Interpersonal Theories and Therapies for more information on Erikson's theory.) In this
     final phase, individuals reflect on their lives and achieve either integrity, when they feel fulfillment, or despair, when
     they identify regrets and missed opportunities.

     The benefits of integrity are acceptance of life, peace and fulfillment, and wisdom. The successful resolution of
     crises of this stage is called ego integrity. With peace and fulfillment, people can reflect back on their lives with
     satisfaction and approach death with wisdom and no regrets. Wisdom is defined by Erikson (1964) as an "informed
     and detached concern with life itself even in the face of death itself" (p. 133).

     The consequences of despair are increased depressive symptoms, increased regret, and decreased life satisfaction.
     These can have detrimental effects on a person's health and well-being as they age. Increased depressive
     symptoms can lead to feelings of sadness, low mood, hopelessness, and feelings of worthlessness. Increased regret
     happens when people look back at their lives with guilt and fixate on mistakes. Feeling less satisfied with life can
     reduce resilience and hinder stress management.

     People can improve their integrity and reduce their despair with counseling, seeking meaningful relationships, or
     working to repair damaged relationships. They also have the option to reframe their thinking by looking back at the
     mistakes and focusing on what can be learned from mistakes rather than thinking about personal failures.

     Functional Ability and Comorbidities
     Functional abilities are the fundamental self-care activities that people perform in their everyday lives. There are
     two types of functional abilities: activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs),
     which are activities that are necessary to living independently. These specifically include using the telephone,
     shopping, preparing food, housekeeping, doing laundry, independently transporting oneself, managing medication,
     and handling finances.

     The ability to provide for one's care and be as independent as possible is very important for quality of life and for
     maintaining self-esteem and self-worth in many people. This is not the case for all older adults because some can
     maintain healthy outlooks even with low functional ability. Some adults who have lived independently for all or the
     majority of their lives have emotional difficulty when faced with dependence or with loss of functionality. This
     emotional difficulty can transition to depression in some older adults when the loss of function continues or
     becomes permanent. Chronic illness can also cause emotional difficulty that can lead to depression. This can be
     compounded when there is loss of functional ability and/or independence as well.

Common medical conditions that impair functional ability include cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders,
diabetes mellitus, cancer, obesity, dementia, emotional disorders, eye and hearing disorders, fractures, and stroke.
The incapacitating effects of an ailment differ depending on what the client is trying to accomplish. Stroke can cause
severe incapacitation and challenges with self-care. Arthritis is generally less serious but is more common and may
make high-activity work (e.g., housework) difficult.

        CULTURAL CONTEXT

Culture and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living

There are several cultures where older adults are not required to perform household tasks or IADLs. For example,
Hispanic culture traditionally is one of respect for one's elders and dictates that it is the duty of the family to care for
family members who can no longer care for themselves. The Korean culture is another example where the younger
members have a duty to care for aging family members. In cultures such as these, a decline in IADLs can easily be
overlooked and considered "normal aging." Sometimes, it results in dementia being more advanced when
discovered due to the person not having the responsibility of performing any of these activities.

Prevention of Depression in Older Adults

The first step in preventing depression is to understand the factors that lead to the onset of symptoms and to
understand what those symptoms are in older adults. According to the World Health Organization (WHO, 2023),
roughly 14 percent of those over sixty years old experience a mental health issue, most commonly anxiety and
depression. Over 27 percent of deaths by suicide are those over the age of sixty, worldwide (WHO, 2023).

The risk of depression for older adults increases by factors, such as limited access to education, the adoption of
risky lifestyle habits (such as substance use, inactivity, and obesity), poor social support, financial stress, a lack of a
confidant, chronic medical conditions, significant life events (such as death, divorce, trauma, or abuse), and the
effect of material or functional losses (WHO, 2023). Interventions that can have the most significant effect are social
activities that improve positive mental health, quality of life, and life satisfaction. Supportive therapies and programs
that aim to promote social interactions and decrease loneliness can improve mental health among older
communities (WHO, 2023).

Older adults may have different symptoms than younger ones, making it challenging to identify depression in older
adults. Sadness is not the major symptom of depression in some older adults. In contrast, they may experience
more numbness or a lack of interest in activities. They might not be as eager to discuss their feelings.

Keep in mind, everyone experiences depression differently, and may have symptoms other than those listed here.
However, the common symptoms include:

    · a persistently depressed, nervous, or "empty" feeling
    · a sense of powerlessness, guilt, or worthlessness
    · irritability, restlessness, or difficulties staying still
    · decreased energy or fatigue
    · slower movement or speech
    · difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions
    · difficulty sleeping, waking up too early in the morning, or oversleeping
    · eating more or less than usual, typically with unplanned weight gain or loss
    · thoughts of death or suicide or attempts at suicide

Another possible sign and symptom of severe depression in an older adult is pseudodementia, a cognitive
impairment that looks like dementia but is actually due to depression. The common symptoms include memory loss
and impaired executive functioning. Unlike dementia, though, pseudodementia is reversible with treatment of the
depression.

Socialization
Socialization is crucial for older adults. Those who have an active and fulfilling social life are less likely to experience
many of the physical, cognitive, and emotional issues that isolated older adults face (WHO, 2023). Socially active
808  24 · Older Adults

     older adults have higher levels of physical activity, more positive moods, and fewer negative feelings. They also
     frequently score higher on cognitive testing. There are many other benefits of socialization, including longer lifespan
     and reduced stress, which can result in better cardiovascular health and an improved immune system, better
     fitness, reduced risk of anxiety and depression caused by isolation, and greater self-esteem. The National Council
     on Aging (Garcia & Jordan, 2022) reports that social isolation and loneliness can increase the risk of mortality by 50
     percent, which is higher than the effects of obesity and alcohol abuse.

     As many benefits as there are to socialization of older adults, there are many barriers, too. Those with mobility
     issues may not be physically able to leave the home. The loss of a spouse or other close loved one may cause
     situational depression that can lead to isolation and loss of social contacts. Real or perceived cognitive decline can
     isolate older adults by the fear and anxiety of forgetting important social information or by altering inhibitions, which
     can upset peers. There are ways that older adults can increase their social sphere:

         · maintaining relationships with children and grandchildren
         · volunteering to increase social exposure and a sense of purpose
         · taking advantage of community resources, such as church activities and senior centers
         · going to a daycare center for older adults
         · moving to a retirement or senior apartment complex that has activities and social events
         · organizing events with other seniors, like a game night or book club
         · having a dog or other pet to decrease loneliness; having a dog can increase socialization on walks, as well as

             help maintain physical activity

     Physical Health
     Maintaining functional mobility and physical condition is an important part of healthy aging and can help with the
     symptoms of depression. Mobility helps older adults achieve the best quality of life, by maintaining independence,
     helping prevent and manage chronic illness, and even helping with the pain of osteoarthritis. Being physically active
     can also lead to social interaction.

     Resources for physical activity information with the goal of managing arthritis and other chronic conditions include
     the following:

         · How Much Physical Activity Do Older Adults Need? (https://openstax.org/r/77physactiviy) from the CDC
         · Physical Activity and Educational Programs Proven to Help Arthritis (https://openstax.org/r/77arthritis) from

             the Arthritis Foundation
         · Physical Activity (https://openstax.org/r/77WHOactivity) from the WHO

     Maintaining physical health also plays a large part in maintaining emotional health and preventing depression. A
     person who feels good physically will have more energy and is less likely to suffer from depression compared with a
     person who is chronically ill and with chronic fatigue. A physically healthy person is also much more likely to be
     engaged socially and with their family because they have the energy to do so.

     Treatment for Depression in Older Adults

     The American Psychological Association's (APA, 2023) clinical practice guidelines recommend a combination of
     psychotherapy interventions, including suicide assessment, and second-generation antidepressants. The three
     psychotherapy interventions most effective in treating depression for older adults include group cognitive behavioral
     therapy (Group-CBT), interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), and group review/reminiscence therapy.

     Group-CBT focuses on the relationship between behaviors, ideas, and feelings; tackles existing issues and
     symptoms; and seeks to change those patterns that limit pleasure and hinder a person's capacity for optimal
     performance. IPT focuses on resolving challenging situations and relationships that are most directly related to the
     current depressive episode. Group review/reminiscence therapy assists older adults in focusing on their life's
     journey while analyzing and reflecting on changes and difficulties in order to have a more balanced and accepting
     outlook on life. Group therapy can provide peer support, reduce social isolation, and enhance coping skills (APA,
     2023).

     Most importantly, assess suicide potential with an evidence-based lethality assessment for suicide ideation. Clients
     with suicidal ideation vary widely in their risk for a suicide attempt depending upon whether they have a plan, intent,

     Access for free at openstax.org
24.2 · Depression                                                                                                          809

or past history of attempts. In-depth assessment of clients who screen positive for suicide risk will help providers
make a plan to keep them safe from harm. Assessment for suicide risk includes asking about their suicidal ideation
(i.e., thoughts of suicide), if they have a plan for committing suicide, their intent on completing the plan, previous
suicidal or self-harm behaviors, risk factors, and protective factors. When assessing for a suicide plan, the goal is to
determine if they have a plan, if it is specific, and if they have thought of a method that they plan to use. The risk of
acting on suicidal thoughts increases with a specific plan. The risk also increases if the plan includes the use of a
lethal method that is accessible to the client.

An example of an evidence-based suicide risk assessment tool is the Columbia Protocol, also known as the
Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). The C-SSRS is a six-question tool containing a series of simple,
plain-language questions that anyone can ask. The answers can provide insight into suicide risk and needed
support.

        LINK TO LEARNING

The Columbia Lighthouse Project (https://openstax.org/r/77LighthousePjt) provides education on assessing for
suicide risk as well as training on how to use it.

Treatment for depression can be provided in the hospital setting or in the outpatient setting. Psychotherapy may be
used alone for treatment of mild depression or in combination with antidepressant medications for moderate to
severe depression. Psychotherapy may involve only the individual, but it can include others, such as family members
or couples therapy to help address issues within these close relationships. Depending on the severity of the
depression, significant improvement can be made in ten to fifteen sessions. Group therapy brings people with
similar disorders together in a supportive environment to learn how others cope in similar situations.

Medications and Electroconvulsive Therapy
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are common antidepressants that increase the levels of serotonin in
the brain to stabilize mood. This class of antidepressants is better tolerated by older adults than most other
antidepressants and generally has successful outcomes in treating depression (APA, 2023). The most commonly
used and best-tolerated SSRIs are sertraline, citalopram, and escitalopram. All antidepressants carry the possibility
of side effects and there are a few specific side effects that may cause the person to feel that the medication is not
worth the benefit. The inability to feel pleasure, anhedonia, is one of those unwanted side effects. Anhedonia can
cause people to withdraw from social activities due to reduced pleasure from daily activities.

According to published research, ECT is a treatment that sends an electric current through the brain, in effect
triggering a small seizure, and is a safe and effective therapy option for older adults with significant depression, even
when are very old older than eighty-five years). When compared with younger individuals, the effectiveness of ECT is
noticeably higher in older adults. Research revealed that older persons with serious depression who had ECT lived
longer and showed more clinical recovery than those who just received medication (Kerner & Prudic, 2014). ECT can
be done in the ambulatory or outpatient setting.

Nurses' Role in Collaborative Care
The role of a nurse in treating older adult clients with depression is part of primary nursing care. Nurses also work
with interprofessional teams that may include a psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, or other health-care
professionals. Each team member's role and practice are defined in their professional licensure.

The duty of the psychiatric-mental health nurse includes a clinical component in both hospital and ambulatory
settings. Nurses use their clinical assessment skills and by implementing treatments that will improve the client's
ability to care for themselves and advance toward optimal health, nurses who are serving in the capacity of case
managers help the client function at their maximum level. Risk assessment; supportive counseling; problem-
solving; instruction; medication and health status monitoring; comprehensive care planning; and linking to,
identifying, and coordinating a variety of different health and human services are just a few examples of these
interventions. Table 24.2 provides the most common signs and symptoms of depression with possible nursing
interventions.

     Family Support for an Older Adult with Depression

     To assist a loved one living with depression, the family may consider the following:

     · Encourage your loved one to remain in treatment by encouraging them to take their medication as directed
        and to fulfill their scheduled visits.

     · When asked, be prepared to listen without passing judgment. Pay close attention when they are speaking.
        Avoid making too many judgments or offering too much advice. Being receptive and understanding can be a
        very effective healing strategy.

     · Give encouraging feedback. Remind them of their strengths and how much they mean to others.
     · Offer to help. It can be difficult for someone with depression to perform some activities. Offer to help with the

        chores that they are struggling to complete.
     · Aid in creating a routine. An older person may find it challenging to make good decisions if they are depressed.

        It becomes essential to establish routines and make time for daily tasks. Make a timetable for meals,
        medication, physical exercise, sleep, time outdoors or in nature, and other duties.
     · Make plans together. Invite them to go on a stroll, to a movie, or to work on a hobby or other activity together.
        Don't try to compel the person to act in a certain way.

    · Do not rush. After beginning medication, symptoms for some people may immediately become better. Others
        will find it takes a lot longer.

    · Do not forget to look after yourself. It's difficult to watch a loved one battle with depression while realizing you
        can't help. Recognize that whatever feelings you feel, including irritation, helplessness, anxiety, guilt, or wrath,
        are normal reactions. It's crucial to look after your needs as well.

24.3 Anxiety

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Understand the presentation, causes, and levels of anxiety in older adults
    · Perform a nursing assessment of anxiety in an older adult
    · Plan nursing care within a collaborative approach to treating an older adult with anxiety

Older adults frequently experience underdiagnosed and undertreated anxiety. Complex physiological conditions can
confuse the older adult's presentation or report of anxiety. Stress/loss, sadness, underlying medical illness,
substance addiction, adverse drug/herb interactions, withdrawal syndromes, or general incapacity may all present
as late-life anxiety symptoms.

Levels, Causes, and Support for Anxiety in Older Adults

Hildegard Peplau (1909-1999), the well-known psychiatric-mental health nurse theorist, developed a model
describing four levels of anxiety: mild, moderate, severe, and panic. Behaviors and characteristics can overlap
across these levels, but it can be helpful to tailor interventions based on the level of anxiety the client is
experiencing. Nurses should learn to recognize these levels and utilize approaches most effective (Table 24.3).

Anxiety   Behavior                               Nursing Approach                              Example

Etiology and Symptoms
Anxiety disorders are thought to have a complex etiology, with major contributions from both hereditary and
812  24 · Older Adults

     environmental factors. Heritable factors, however, have less of an effect on older adults; instead, more attention is
     paid to the role of the biochemical changes that come with aging, illness, and neurodegenerative changes. In the
     context of polypharmacy, the role of medications, including drug interactions and side effects, should be taken into
     account. In this population, social and psychological factors are also important in the development of anxiety. Older
     adults may experience anxiety, for instance, in stressful situations like driving in heavy traffic. Anxiety may be
     precipitated by changes in the older adult's routine, pain, fear, stressors in the environment, or worry. Frustration
     with mobility limitations, sensory impairment, or attitudes and behaviors of others can manifest as anxiety. It is
     imperative to take into account concerns related to life transitions, including but not limited to bereavement,
     financial strains, and relocation or downsizing. Feelings of helplessness resulting from the following circumstances
     can trigger anxiety: losing a partner or other sources of support, experiencing medical conditions that impair senses,
     and losing control or mastery over oneself.

     In contrast to younger adults, older adults are more likely to exhibit physical symptoms like tachycardia or digestive
     problems. They may also be more prone to fatigue, tense muscles, and sleep disturbances. The following are
     indicators and symptoms of anxiety disorders in older adults:

         · tachycardia, dyspnea, trembling, nausea, diaphoresis
         · depression
         · lack of routine or consumed by routine
         · excessive or irrational worry/fear
         · sleep disturbances (insomnia, oversleeping, nightmares)
         · avoidant behavior, especially of social environments
         · excessive concern for safety
         · muscle tension, pain, or weakness
         · hoarding
         · alcohol or other CNS depressant misuse

     Supporting Older Adults with Anxiety
     Having a relationship with an individual who is compassionate and addresses inactivity and isolation directly can be
     very beneficial for some older adults suffering from anxiety disorders. This could be a friend, relative, health-care
     provider, employee of an assisted living facility, chaplain or clergyman, or someone else entirely. Getting anxious
     people involved in creative, social, or other enjoyable activities can be quite beneficial. It can make a big difference
     to assist older adults in managing issues that could cause anxiety, such as handling health issues, financial matters,
     and worries about burdening others. Some tasks support people can help with include the following:

         · acknowledge concerns and deal with any fears that are manageable
         · assist in implementing deep abdominal breathing, prayer, meditation, and stress-reduction strategies
         · encourage talk with family, a friend, or a spiritual leader
         · arrange for or join in exercise
         · caution avoidance of triggers for anxiety, such as caffeine, smoking, alcohol, or other substance use
         · share news of current events to keep them informed but not trigger anxiety
         · allow time for treatment to work

TABLE 24.4 Nursing Interventions for Signs and Symptoms of Anxiety

Nursing Assessment

As discussed, recognition of behavioral cues can prompt focused care planning. Clients who are restless, tremulous,
agitated, or socially withdrawn may benefit from anxiety reduction, which the nurse can plan. Anxious clients may
not be capable of identifying the cause of their feelings, so nursing assessment becomes important. An inability to
employ personal strategies to manage psychological distress, or ineffective coping, may be another priority
problem.

The behaviors of anxiety in older adults are often different than in younger people. Behaviors may overlap with
illnesses and other medical conditions. Complaints may present as medical or somatic, such as pain as opposed to
psychological distress. Anger, agitation, or sleep disturbance may be results of underlying anxiety. This frequently
leads health-care practitioners to miss the anxiety and possibly misdiagnose the client.

Older individuals who are anxious may become less self-reliant, which could place stress on family. Low compliance
with medical treatment is linked to anxiety problems, and this could exacerbate chronic medical diseases and raise
the chance of nursing home admission. Older adults who are anxious report having less life satisfaction, memory
loss, a worsening self-perception of their health, and more loneliness.

Older adults may have more topics of worry than younger people, such as memory loss, medical illnesses, and fear
of falls. One component of anxiety is worry, persistent, uncontrollable negative thoughts, ideas, and verbalizations
resulting from attempts to problem-solve issues with uncertain outcomes (Makovac et al., 2018). Worry can have a
protective role by shielding individuals from the full effects of the fear and motivating them to take prompt action
toward resolution which, in effect, is a coping mechanism. As a coping mechanism, the person is creating a scenario
where they rehearse and anticipate a fearful event so that they can prevent or mitigate the effects of the scenario in
question. Worry is a problem when it becomes a negative feedback loop that the person struggles to escape.

Nurses' Role in Collaborative Management

The primary role of the nurse in collaborative management is one of assessment, support, advocacy, and education
of the client. Support and advocacy are built into the framework of all types of nursing care and are essential
qualities in mental health care, especially with older adults. This population is high risk and frequently requires a
high level of support and frequent advocacy, particularly if there is no or minimal family support. It is not uncommon
for adults and older adults with mental health issues to become estranged from family and therefore no longer have
support. In these cases, the nurse may be the one person who makes the difference in advocating for an older adult
who, due to anxiety, has difficulty advocating for themselves and interacting with the team. The nurse can also serve
as a major communicator for the medical provider in the client's care. The nursing assessment is valuable to the
client and their management team. As the person who spends the most time with the client, the nurse can see the
bigger picture of how the client's anxiety is affecting the thought process, functioning, and daily life. Nurses provide
supportive care in helping with coping techniques and nonpharmacological interventions. Nurses also provide

     education about coping mechanisms.

     Nurses can educate clients about the symptoms of their anxiety and techniques to manage it. For some individuals,
     even being aware that something is a symptom of anxiety, naming it, and connecting it to anxiety can help reduce
     the intensity of the anxiety.

     Certain substances, such as caffeine, some over-the-counter cold medicines, illicit drugs, and herbal supplements
     may aggravate the symptoms of anxiety or interact with prescribed medications. Clients should be advised to avoid
     or minimize use of these substances.

     Physical exercise and meditation are highly effective in reducing stress. Older adults can learn progressive muscle
     relaxation to refocus away from emotional stress. Other stress reduction activities include sharpening cognitive
     skills with puzzles, games, music, and art. Spending time outdoors or interacting with companion animals can be
     effective as well.

     Nurses can teach and coach self-management and offer honest praise for the older person's accomplishments.
     These interventions serve to promote the activities, and also to enhance the person's self-esteem.

     24.4 Delirium

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Identify risk factors for delirium in older adults
         · Comprehend the three categories of delirium in older adults
         · Identify ways to detect delirium in an older adult
         · Discuss the nurse's role in planning care for an older adult with delirium

     Medical and psychological problems co-occur often in older persons who are hospitalized for medical, psychiatric,
     and surgical reasons. In a U.S. teaching hospital's quality improvement program, prospective chart reviews of
     medical records revealed comorbidity of delirium in 10.1 percent of the cases (Bayer et al., 2022). Delirium can
     occur in any setting.

     Risk Factors

     Psychosis caused by medical issues is often referred to as delirium, which is a mental state in which the client
     becomes temporarily confused, disoriented, and not able to think or remember clearly. It usually starts suddenly
     and can indicate the onset of a life-threatening medical condition. Delirium resolves as the underlying condition is
     effectively treated.

     Causative Factors of Delirium
     The first step in managing delirium is to address the causative factors. There are many common causes of delirium,
     including the following:

         · dehydration and/or electrolyte imbalances
         · dementia
         · hospitalization, especially in intensive care
         · intoxication or withdrawal from alcohol or drugs
         · kidney or liver failure
         · medications, such as sedatives, opioids, anesthesia, antihistamines, anticholinergics, antidepressants,

             antipsychotics, or anticonvulsants
         · metabolic disorders, such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
         · serious infections, such as urinary tract infections, pneumonia, and influenza
         · severe pain
         · sleep deprivation

     If the cause is infection, the delirium resolves as it is treated. If it is a medication, then stopping the medication
     should resolve the delirium. Frequently, there are multiple causative factors and some can be difficult to address.
     For example, Teng and Frei (2022) found that antibiotics produced a higher delirium rate in individuals sixty-five
     years of age and older than in younger people, and some antibiotics are included on prescribers' reference lists as

inappropriate for older persons.

A person with dementia can become delirious with a change of environment where orienting cues are not available.
When the causative factor is unavoidable, such as hospital admission or postanesthesia, supportive care can help to
resolve the delirium over time. The state of delirium may wax and wane, which means that the client has periods of
confusion followed by periods of clarity in waves. Over time, the periods of confusion or inattentiveness become less
and less until the person is back to their baseline level of cognition. Delirium superimposed on dementia appears as
new onset behavior, distinct from the changes in memory and cognition that occur with the gradual progression of
dementia over months or years.

Risk Factors Due to Comorbidities
There are many risk factors for older adults for delirium; comorbidities can contribute significantly and exacerbate
those risk factors. Any older person with multiple medical issues, and particularly those with any level of cognitive
impairment, is at risk for developing delirium. An alteration in cognition that causes a decline in memory and
thinking that happens with age and many medical and inherited factors is considered cognitive impairment.
Delirium is not only an issue for hospitalized people but can happen in the home or any other residential setting.
There are many factors that can contribute to delirium, with many being preventable. The most preventable are
those caused or contributed to by medications. Polypharmacy (the use of five or more medications simultaneously)
increases this risk with each medication added. Especially high risk are anticholinergics, narcotics, and sedative-
hypnotics. Some antibiotics can increase risks as well. In some people, it is not the addition of a drug that causes
delirium, but the removal with withdrawal. Infection is another very common cause of acute delirium.

HealthInAging.org (Health In Aging, 2023) displays the following map outlining the reversible causes of delirium
using the acronym, DELIRIUM:

    · Drugs, including any new medications, increased dosages, drug interactions, over-the-counter drugs, alcohol,
        etc.

    · Electrolyte disturbances, especially dehydration and thyroid problems
    · Lack of drugs, such as when long-term sedatives (including alcohol and sleeping pills) are stopped, or when

        pain drugs are inadequate
    · Infection, commonly urinary or respiratory tract infection
    · Reduced sensory input, which happens when vision or hearing are poor
    · Intracranial (referring to processes within the skull), such as a brain infection, hemorrhage, stroke, or tumor

        (rare)
    · Urinary problems or intestinal problems, such as constipation or inability to urinate
    · Myocardial (heart) and lungs, such as heart attack, problems with heart rhythm (arrhythmia), worsening of

        heart failure, or chronic obstructive lung disease

Risk Factors Due to Psychosocial Status
Biopsychosocial status is an important factor in delirium. A low functional capacity, poor general health, or lack of
social support can increase the risk of developing delirium when the body and mind are challenged by exposure to a
high-risk factor. According to Ormseth et al. (2023), factors decreasing the risk of delirium are strong and consistent
family involvement, frequent reorientation, and supportive environmental cues. Physical wellness, enhanced by
sleep, oxygenation, and hydration, with good social support provides a higher resistance to delirium.

Categories of Delirium

Delirium is divided into three types based on the symptoms. The three types are hyperactive, hypoactive, and mixed.
In older adults, hypoactive and mixed delirium are the most common. Frequently, the nurse or the family are the
first to notice that a client is "not themselves" or has had a change in mental status from their baseline. Figure 24.3
provides a visual representation and summary of the two main forms of delirium.

     Hyperactive
     Hyperactive delirium will usually entail restlessness, anxiety, and sometimes aggressiveness, as well as potential
     hallucinations. Mood swings are also common. This is the easiest type to recognize because the clients frequently
     resist care.

     Hypoactive
     Hypoactive delirium is often overlooked as delirium because the client is quiet and withdrawn. Hypoactive delirium
     is characterized by symptoms of drowsiness and inactivity. The clients may seem to be in a daze and not interact
     with family or others. It is more difficult to recognize and is associated with poorer outcomes than hyperactive
     delirium.

     Mixed
     Mixed delirium is a combination of hyperactive and hypoactive delirium and may fluctuate between the two.

     Identifying Delirium

     One of the most frequent tools used to identify delirium is the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). The CAM is a

bedside screening tool used to determine if a client is showing signs of delirium. The CAM-ICU is also available for
ICU clients and can be used for clients who are unable to speak due to being on a ventilator or other reason.

The CAM is a questionnaire that prompts assessment answers of yes/no or entering a descriptive term, such as alert
or lethargic. The tool includes assessment data, such as onset, thought process, distractibility, level of
consciousness, orientation, and agitation. The scoring alerts to the need for follow-up care.

website.

Onset, Presentation, Signs, Symptoms, and Nursing Interventions
The symptoms of delirium usually start suddenly, over a few hours or a few days, and they often come and go. The
most common symptoms are as follows:

    · changes in alertness (usually more alert in the morning, less at night)
    · changing levels of consciousness
    · confusion
    · disorganized thinking or talking in a way that doesn't make sense
    · disrupted sleep patterns or sleepiness
    · emotional changes: anger, agitation, depression, irritability, or overexcitement
    · hallucinations and delusions
    · incontinence
    · trouble concentrating

Table 24.5 indicates the most frequent signs of delirium along with proposed nursing interventions.

     Identifying Delirium in a Person with Dementia
     A person with dementia, no matter the type of dementia, is automatically at very high risk of developing delirium. To
     make it more complicated, delirium can be difficult to recognize. A person with dementia may already exhibit
     behaviors that are consistent with delirium. The most notable difference is inattention. A person with dementia can
     be disoriented at baseline, but they are attentive. A change in mental status of a person with dementia at times can
     be the first indication of an acute illness and delirium. The most difficult factor in dementia with superimposed
     delirium can be figuring out the precipitating factors. When there was a recent medication or treatment addition, it
     can be easy, but when it is a possible infection, pain, sleep issue, or other seemingly small factor, it can be difficult to
     recognize.

     Care Partner Engagement for Older Adults with Delirium

     To improve care, clients, their families, and health-care professionals must actively participate at all levels of the
     health-care system. This is known as care partner (client and family) engagement and can be applied to
     collaborative care of the older adult with delirium.

     Engagement of care partners at the level of direct care can take several forms, from consultation and participation in
     decision-making to the delivery of direct care. It can also take place at the corporate and societal levels when
     developing health-care policy through shared leadership. With this model, both the quality of care and the quality of
     life are improved because of care partners' active involvement in decision-making and care management.

     The characteristics of the individual client, the preparedness of the care partner, including their knowledge and
     skills, and the capacity and preparedness of the care team all have an impact on the implementation of care
     partnerships in the delivery of care to delirium clients. A five-step engaged caring approach is used to operationalize
     care partnerships. It consists of negotiation and risk assessment, awareness and information support, a joint
     monitoring plan, shared decision-making and early intervention, and making adjustments (Hill et al., 2014).

  improvements in prior problems of agitation, distractibility, disorientation, and family's report of client behaviors
  unlike baseline. The nursing action is to continue providing orienting cues and comfort measures to the client,
  monitor hydration status and laboratory test values, and encourage family involvement. The nurse will reassess
  as needed and continue care to the next identified problem.

24.5 Alcohol Use

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Discuss risks, screening, and stigma related to alcohol use in older adults
    · Outline the clinical management of an older adult with alcohol use problems
    · Summarize aftercare for older adults in alcohol use recovery

Older adults are likely to be living with chronic health problems, using prescription and nonprescription medications
and remedies. In addition, older adults generally have a lower physical tolerance for alcohol. These factors put older
adults at risk for falls, accidents, injuries, drug interactions, and medical complications (U.S. Department of
Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2020). While many sources caution "limited"
alcohol consumption for older adults, a safe intake level may be difficult to determine.

Alcohol Use in Older Adults

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA, 2020) reports that alcohol is the most
used and misused substance among older adults, and more than 10 percent engage in binge drinking. Friends and
family may overlook an older adult's alcohol use, and alcohol consumption may be socially accepted (National
Institute on Aging, 2022). Tolerance for alcohol and the cumulative effects of drinking change over the lifespan,
however (National Institute on Aging, 2022).

Effects and Risks for Older Adults in Relation to Alcohol Abuse
As stated, there are effects of using alcohol that are unique to older adults. As people age, the body has a lower
tolerance for alcohol, leading to a faster feeling of the effects of alcohol. This can create higher risks that the older
adult can fall, have a car accident, or become injured.

Alcohol consumption can also worsen many health conditions. With diabetes, the liver stops releasing glucose while
processing alcohol, which can drop blood glucose quickly. This causes hypoglycemia and, with the effects of the
alcohol, it is easy to miss the symptoms of hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to seizures, coma, and
death. With hypertension, drinking too much alcohol can increase blood pressure and, with regular overuse of
alcohol, can lead to uncontrolled hypertension and the associated risks. Chronic heavy alcohol use increases the
risk for osteoporosis by decreasing bone density and weakening bones. Alcohol worsens memory issues and, in
some cases, with long-term use, can cause dementia. Given that alcohol is a depressant, it will naturally contribute
to mood disorders. All of this is on top of the long-term effects that chronic use of alcohol has on people of all ages,
such as liver problems.

Mixing alcohol and prescriptions and even over-the-counter medications can be very dangerous. Some frequently
used drugs that can cause serious alcohol interactions include, but are not limited to the following (National
Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 2019):

    · nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which can increase risk of strokes, ulcers, and stomach
        bleeding

    · blood-thinning medications, which can cause bleeding from minor injury, stomach or GI bleeding, and bruising
    · sleep medications, which can cause impaired breathing, drowsiness, lack of motor control, and falls
    · acetaminophen (Tylenol; also can be an ingredient in over-the-counter products and some prescription

        medications) combined with alcohol is one of the most common causes of major liver damage
    · over-the-counter antihistamines, which may cause increased sleepiness and falls
    · herbal treatments may have effects with alcohol, such as drowsiness, blood pressure changes, or liver

        damage
820  24 · Older Adults

     Screening for Older Adults Who Abuse Alcohol
     All older persons should be screened for alcohol, tobacco, prescription drug, and illicit drug use at least once a year,
     according to the consensus panel's recommendations from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
     Administration (SAMHSA, 2020). It is important to start with a complete history of substance use. Screening can
     result in better health and earlier treatment. There are a variety of screening tools available, but one, the Short
     Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test-Geriatric Version (SMAST-G), is specific to older adults.

             LINK TO LEARNING

     This presentation describes substance use disorder and addictions (https://openstax.org/r/77SMASTG) among older
     adults in health centers. The adapted SMAST-G is shown as well as how to generally screen older adults and provide
     brief interventions.

     Stigma and Ageism
     In the United States, older adults abusing alcohol is underestimated, underreported, misdiagnosed, and untreated.
     Many factors contribute to this, such as mistaking symptoms for other issues, a lack of education, denial, ageism,
     myths, stigma, and scant study and data. Stigma is a negative view that society holds on a specific group of people
     or on a behavior that a group exhibits. Discrimination of older adults due to stereotypes that are negative and
     inaccurate is considered ageism.

     In the case of alcohol use disorder (AUD), older adults face ageism and stigma from all levels of society, including
     health-care professionals. Glazier and Ko (2023) write that nurses and medical providers may interact with older
     adults differently than with younger clients, listen less, and attribute sensory impairments to cognitive decline.
     Providers may order less diagnostic testing and may minimize some complaints as due to older age. According to
     Glazier and Ko (2023), geriatricians may be more effective as primary care providers for older adults.

             PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

     Assessing Alcohol Misuse

     When talking with older adults about alcohol use, be mindful that some misuse may be unintended. The older adult
     may not realize the potential for alcohol to interact with medications. Be aware also of the older adult history, when
     alcohol consumption was an acceptable social activity and substance use in general may have been a societal norm.

     Some signs of alcohol use may be mistaken for signs of aging and, therefore, not addressed. Negative attitudes
     toward substance use may prevent older adults from seeking help. Approach the topic of alcohol without judgment
     and with an educational perspective so that older adults can have positive outcomes of treatment with resulting
     improvement in health.

     (SAMHSA, 2020)

     Clinical Management for Alcohol Abuse in Older Adults

     The treatment of AUD in older adults should be very closely monitored by a medical provider. It has been found that
     brief interventions for alcohol misuse can help with AUD and risk reduction. Brief interventions can be the starting
     point for many before moving into more intensive treatment. The focus is on helping the client to abstain or reduce
     their alcohol intake to decrease their health-related risks. Brief intervention starts with screening and a discussion
     of their alcohol use and determination of heavy use versus AUD. If AUD is determined, assess readiness to change
     and discuss reduction of intake and/or referral to treatment. If a client needs detoxification, the decision should be
     made of outpatient versus inpatient. Given medical comorbidities, outpatient detoxification is not common.

     Withdrawal from Alcohol for Older Adults
     Alcohol withdrawal is characterized by two or more of the following symptoms:

         · autonomic hyperactivity

     Access for free at openstax.org
24.5 · Alcohol Use                                                                                                    821

    · increased tremor
    · sleeplessness
    · nausea or vomiting
    · transitory visual, tactile, or auditory hallucinations or illusions
    · psychomotor agitation
    · anxiety
    · grand mal seizures

Although only around 5 percent of drinkers experience delirium or seizures during withdrawal, older adults with co-
occurring medical issues and limited physiologic reserve require monitoring while undergoing detoxification. In a
study of alcohol withdrawal among hospitalized clients, the older clients had a higher risk of delirium, falls, and
reliance on others to perform everyday tasks (Joshi et al., 2021). Older adults may experience protracted confusion,
which could lengthen their hospital stay and increase their chance of being sent to an extended care facility after
discharge. Hospitalization is frequently advised for older clients with AUD undergoing detox for close monitoring.

Hospital or Home Care for Older Adults with Alcohol Abuse Issues
As in the preceding discussion, the decision to treat the older adult in inpatient treatment or with outpatient
treatment is complex. Given the risks of outpatient detoxification, inpatient care may be more advantageous for this
age group. The risks of withdrawal are high, and the medications used to manage the withdrawal have their own
risks when used in older adults. Figure 24.4 shows the treatment algorithm for alcohol use in older adults.

     Pharmacology
     The cornerstone of pharmacologic therapy of alcohol withdrawal is the use of benzodiazepines; these can be given
     either regularly or as symptoms arise. Currently, there are no specific guidelines for managing withdrawal with
     benzodiazepines in older adults. When considering risk versus benefit, the benefit of using benzodiazepines may
     outweigh the risks. The risks of withdrawal with seizures and death are greater than the risks of acute delirium due
     to the use of benzodiazepines. Acute delirium is a common withdrawal symptom even without the use of
     benzodiazepines. Supplementing with thiamine and other vitamins, addressing electrolyte imbalances, and
     receiving general supportive care are all examples of concurrent treatment during detoxification. There are several
     medications available for treatment of AUD; some are used clinically but are not approved by the FDA for that use.

         · Acamprosate (approved by the FDA) is used for maintenance of abstinence from alcohol in those who have
             completed detoxification and are currently abstinent. It promotes balance of neurotransmitters and should

        not be used in those with reduced kidney function.
    · Disulfiram causes an unpleasant reaction when alcohol is consumed and is appropriate for highly motivated

        clients who have completed detoxification. This drug should not be taken within twelve hours of alcohol
        consumption in any form (mouthwash, cough syrups), and should not be used by individuals with heart
        disease or cardiovascular disease, risk of liver toxicity, or those with high levels of impulsivity or suicide risk.
    · Naltrexone reduces alcohol cravings and can reduce the number of drinks that a daily drinker consumes. It
        should not be used in those with liver dysfunction.
    · Gabapentin is not FDA approved for AUD, but it may still be helpful, used off-label, for mild withdrawal. As an
        anticonvulsant, gabapentin reduces central nervous system excitation. It should not be used in those with
        kidney disease, and it increases risk of falls.
    · Topiramate is not approved for AUD, but it may be helpful in reducing cravings. Extended release should not
        be used in those with recent alcohol use. There is also a risk of weight loss and short-term cognitive
        impairment, so it should not be a first-line choice in older adults.

Aftercare for Older Adults in Recovery

After initiating treatment, it is important to implement continual follow-up to monitor clients during acute and
chronic recovery and to prevent relapse. Provide continuous education through all levels of treatment and recovery
by providing training on how to manage stress, triggers, and cravings. Education and skills training should focus on
three foundational skills: coping skills, social skills, and communication skills.

An advocate and support system can make the difference between success and failure. Older adults encounter a lot
of loss, so grief is frequent and can lead to relapse. Moreover, the physical, social, and health changes that come
with aging can be stressful, so those without a strong support system or with poor coping mechanisms will always
be at high risk for relapse.

Twelve-Step Program for Older Adults
Twelve-step programs can be very beneficial for older adults. These programs address both loneliness and
addiction. One of the tenets of twelve-step programs is being of service and accepting help. This is vital to older
adults who may not have a social network or support system. The program connects people in order to support each
other and therefore provides socialization that can help prevent relapse. The segregation between young and old
that is seen in the general community is not present in twelve-step groups. Older adults receive respect and younger
members value their life experience (Gibson, 2021). Older adults are encouraged to share how they managed life's
challenges and how they persevered to make it through. The groups foster acceptance.

Family Support, Referrals for Older Adults with Alcohol Abuse Issues
Family support for older adults with AUD can help both the family and the client. Families who participate in therapy
with their loved one benefit as much as the person with AUD. There are also mutual help groups like Al-Anon that
provide support for children, spouses, and other family members of people with alcohol addiction. Family members
must be careful to avoid a situation of codependency where they are potentiating the problem by enabling the
addicted person to continue their self-destructive behavior. Support groups can be very helpful in pointing out these
behaviors and helping the enabler to alter their behaviors. A primary care provider can refer older adults with AUD or
clients can self-refer. Nurses can provide support by advocacy and education. An individual's health insurance
company is a good place to start to find out what the benefit coverage is as well as if there are local in-network
treatment options. There are also multiple online resources for finding and accessing treatment:

     24.6 Pain

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Classify types and levels of pain
         · Describe nursing assessment related to pain
         · Plan individualized pain management

     Older adults are at increased risk for undertreatment of pain. Many older adults in the community or living in long-
     term care centers have significant pain due to chronic conditions (AgeWays, 2019). Pain is often underassessed in
     older adults because they are less likely to report it and also because it may not present with a clearly identifiable
     cause (AgeWays, 2019).

     Types and Levels of Pain

     What distinguishes administering pain management in mental health settings from other acute care settings? It is
     the complicated interaction between mental illness, analgesic drugs, and related addiction, along with the necessity
     of preserving the environment's safety in order to establish and maintain the therapeutic relationship, which is client
     centered. The American Nurses Association (ANA Center for Ethics and Human Rights, 2018) presents a position
     statement that describes the nurse's ethical responsibility to relieve pain and to customize the nursing
     interventions.

     Onwumere et al. (2022) assert that the experience of those with mental illness who also experience pain is complex
     and requires understanding from caregivers. Accurate assessments are essential. Intervention must be
     individualized, such as physical activity as a therapy, and pain management must be considered within the overall
     care (Onwumere et al., 2022). Behavior may project anxiety, distress, or fear. Behavioral assessment tools for pain
     may be impacted by many other stressors. It can be difficult to separate emotional responses from sensory aspects.

     Pain can be divided into visceral, deep somatic, superficial, and neuropathic pain. Visceral organs are midline in the
     body within the abdomen, highly sensitive to stretch, ischemia, and inflammation. Visceral pain is diffuse, and often
     referred outward to other locations in the body. It may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting and may be
     described as sickening, deep, squeezing, and dull.

     Deep somatic pain comes from stimulation of nociceptors in ligaments, tendons, bones, blood vessels, fascia, and
     muscles and is a dull, aching, poorly localized pain. Examples include sprains and broken bones.

     Superficial pain comes from the activation of nociceptors in the skin or other superficial tissue and is sharp, well-
     defined, and clearly located. Examples of injuries that produce superficial somatic pain include minor wounds and
     minor (first-degree) burns.

     Neuropathic pain is defined as pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system. It is
     typically described by clients as "burning" or "like pins and needles." Neuropathic pain can be caused by several
     disease processes, such as diabetes mellitus, strokes, and HIV, and is generally undertreated because it typically
     does not respond to analgesics. Medications, such as tricyclic antidepressants and gabapentin, typically manage
     this type of pain.

     Pain can radiate from one area to another. For example, back pain caused by a herniated disk can cause pain to
     radiate down an individual's leg. Referred pain is different from radiating pain because it is perceived at a location
     other than the site of the painful stimulus. For example, pain from retained gas in the colon can cause pain to be
     perceived in the shoulder. See the following figure (Figure 24.5) for an illustration of common sites of referred pain.

Duration
Pain is also differentiated by duration, or acute pain and chronic pain. When the pain has limited duration and is
associated with a specific cause, it is considered to be acute pain. It usually creates a physiological response
resulting in increased pulse, respiration, and blood pressure. It may also cause diaphoresis (sweating, especially to
an unusual degree). Examples of acute pain include postoperative pain; burns; acute musculoskeletal conditions
like strains, sprains, and fractures; labor and delivery; and traumatic injury.

When pain is ongoing and persistent for three to six months or more, it is considered to be chronic pain. It typically
does not cause a change in vital signs or diaphoresis. It may be diffuse and not confined to a specific area of the
body. Chronic pain often affects an individual's psychological, social, and behavioral responses and can influence
daily functioning. Chronic medical problems, such as osteoarthritis, spinal conditions, fibromyalgia, and peripheral
neuropathy, are common causes of chronic pain. Chronic pain can continue even after the original injury or illness
that caused it has healed or resolved. Some people suffer chronic pain even when there is no past injury or apparent
body damage.

People who have chronic pain often have physical effects that are stressful on the body. These effects include tense
muscles, limited ability to move around, lack of energy, and appetite changes. Emotional effects of chronic pain
include depression, anger, anxiety, and fear of reinjury. These effects can limit a person's ability to return to work or
participate in leisure activities. It is estimated that chronic pain affects 50 million U.S. adults, and 19.6 million of
those adults experience high-impact chronic pain that interferes with daily life or work activities. For older adults,
chronic pain may be a part of life due to arthritis in the joints and back or due to previous injuries. They can also have
a higher risk of falls due to stiffness in the morning and when standing as well as knees that "give out." Whereas
some older adults consider this "just a part of getting old," others struggle with the limitations and can become
withdrawn, depressed, or lash out. This can cause frustration for both the client and the caregiver. Caregivers can
need support as well and caregiver burden and burnout are also within the nurse's scope of assessment.

     Severity and Assessment
     Pain severity refers to a person's individual concept of the level of discomfort that they are experiencing at a point in
     time. Generally, severity is measured in terms, such as none, mild, moderate, and severe, though more detailed
     assessments may come into play. Pain is a very subjective concept as is the severity of that pain. Each person is
     different, and their pain perceptions can vary by personality, experiences that they have had in their lives, and past
     experience with pain.

     Asking a client to rate the severity of their pain on a scale from zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the
     worst pain imaginable is a common question used to screen clients for pain. The Joint Commission, an accrediting
     body for health-care organizations, requires this quick question to be followed by a thorough pain assessment.
     Additionally, providers must assess the client's comfort-function goal. The comfort-function goal provides the basis
     for the client's individualized pain treatment plan and is used to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions. The
     same assessment tool utilized to plan care for pain management should also be used to evaluate relief and plan
     further care.

     The mnemonics "OLDCARTES," which stands for onset, location, duration, character, aggravating/relieving, time,
     and severity, or "COLDSPA," which stands for character, onset, location, duration, severity, pattern, and associated
     factors, can be helpful in remembering a standardized set of questions used to gather additional data about a
     client's pain. "PQRSTU" is another tool assessing these categories. Table 24.6 lists the questions utilized with a
     "PQRSTU" assessment framework. While interviewing a client about pain, use open-ended questions to allow the
     client to elaborate on information that further improves understanding of their concerns. Most older adults are fully
     able to participate in the pain interview, but for those who are unable, use alternative pain scales or more subjective
     pain assessment. If their answers do not seem to align, continue to ask focused questions to clarify information. For
     example, if a client states that "the pain is tolerable" but also rates the pain as a "seven" on a zero to ten pain scale,
     these answers do not align, and the nurse should continue to use follow-up questions using the PQRSTU framework.

     Upon further questioning, perhaps this client will explain that they rate the pain as a "seven" in their knee when
     participating in physical therapy exercises, but currently feel the pain is tolerable while resting in bed. Another
     question that can be asked is what is a pain level that is acceptable to them. This additional information assists the
     nurse in customizing interventions for effective treatment with reduced potential for overmedication with associated
     side effects. Assessment of pain and ongoing assessment of pain is important as pain is not always stated as a
     complaint. Sometimes pain is an underlying cause of behavior or mood. In some cultures, pain is not to be
     expressed or complained about and pain is expressed by withdrawal, making assessment more important.

Pain Scales
Pain assessments should be specific to the client. A client with psychosis, severe cognitive impairment, or socially
withdrawn may not be accurately assessed with questionnaires. Nursing observations are sometimes more
effective, such as monitoring vital signs, facial expressions, or vocalizations. Other physical signs that could indicate
pain are diaphoresis, muscle tension, agitation, or poor response to general comfort measures.

The FACES scale, for example, is a visual pain scale tool for assessing pain with children and others who cannot
quantify the severity of their pain on a scale of zero to ten. Figure 24.6 shows a sample pain rating scale. To use this
scale, explain to the client that each face represents a person who has no pain, some pain, or a lot of pain. "Face 0
doesn't hurt at all. Face 2 hurts just a little. Face 4 hurts a little more. Face 6 hurts even more. Face 8 hurts a whole
lot. Face 10 hurts as much as you can imagine, although you don't have to be crying to have this worst pain." Ask the
person to choose the face that best represents the pain they are feeling. This can be very helpful in the older adult
with cognitive impairment, illiteracy, or a language barrier because they may not be able to understand the number
scales.

Presentation and Tolerance
Some older adults may not complain of pain, particularly those with cognitive impairment, but will show signs in
other ways. There may be subtle signs, such as a change in functional status or body posture and gait. They may
socially isolate, even from family. Others may become agitated, or more agitated, or confused. Those who are
nonverbal may moan or grimace. Naturally, very functional older adults will complain of pain or increased pain to
loved ones or their medical providers. There also may be an association with depression or anxiety to pain.

Pain tolerance or sensitivity to pain is a very individual experience, particularly for older adults. Life experience plays
a very large role as previous exposures to pain and general discomfort impact how much acute pain a person can
tolerate. For example, a person who has had a low level of arthritis pain for many years will likely not report as high
of a level of acute pain as a person who has been largely without pain most of their lives. Pain tolerance or
expression of pain can be cultural as well. In some cultures, pain is expressed freely, in others, expression of pain is
discouraged. When the same dose of a drug has been given repeatedly, clients may demonstrate a reduced
response to pain medication called tolerance, requiring a higher dose of the drug to achieve the same level of
response. For example, when a client receives morphine for palliative care, the dosage often needs to be increased
over time because the client develops a tolerance to the effects of the medication.

     Quality of Life
     Pain is a huge component of quality of life. A person cannot live their best life if they are uncomfortable. The medical
     team and the client's family, as well as the client, have a responsibility to manage discomfort in ways that maximize
     that person's function and day-to-day life. Ongoing evaluation of the older adult with acute or chronic pain should be
     part of every assessment in order to monitor management of the pain.

     Person-Centered Care in Pain Management

     Person-centered care is defined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as integrated health-care
     services delivered in a setting and manner that is responsive to the individual and their goals, values, and
     preferences, in a system that empowers clients and providers to make effective care plans together (Centers for
     Medicare & Medicaid Services, n.d.). This includes:

         · care that is influenced and informed by the objectives, tastes, and values of the person
         · person-reported outcomes being used to gauge success
         · integrated care across health systems, providers, and care settings, that is coordinated
         · managing persistent and complicated disorders
         · relationships that are anchored in mutual trust and dedication to long-term well-being

     Person-centered care for pain, particularly chronic pain, is a holistic and therapeutic form of treatment allowing the
     client to take ownership of their pain management. The health-care provider's role is to guide the client in finding
     the best way to manage their pain. This may include medications but will also include possible alternative methods,
     such as massage, exercise, acupuncture, Tai Chi, supplements, and possibly addressing the underlying social and
     behavioral components of their pain. By addressing the spiritual, emotional, and psychosocial components of the
     whole person, the team provides more holistic care. This model is about listening to the individual and working with
     them closely to understand them as a person and empathize with them.

       CLINICAL JUDGMENT MEASUREMENT MODEL

       Taking Action/Evaluating Outcomes: Monitoring Effectiveness of Pain Management

       As the nurse enters a client's room, the client has just finished combing his hair. The client is smiling as he
       greets the nurse.

       Nursing knowledge is required to recognize the effect of pain-relieving medication one hour after administration.
       The client had been unable to perform personal grooming due to arthritic shoulder pain rated 6/10 on pain
       scale. The client had displayed a sad facial expression. The client elected to use the pain-relieving medication
       ordered on an as-needed basis, every six hours offered by the nurse. The nurse administered the medication.

       The nursing action is to apply the same assessment scale to the client's pain now as was used prior to
       medication administration. The client rates current pain as 2/10 on the scale.

       The nurse monitors for adverse effects of the medication, noting that the client has consumed 75 percent of his
       breakfast meal and denies nausea.

       The nurse will reassess as needed.

     Perspectives of Client and Family
     As part of person-centered care, the family plays a large role in pain management. The family has a strong influence
     on an individual's beliefs and behaviors surrounding pain as well as health and illness. The family can be an integral
     part of the pain management plan and treatment or can have a negative effect due to dysfunctional relationships
     and reactions. A positive family relationship can help a person cope with pain as well as work through strategies of
     pain relief. An individual with a dysfunctional family will frequently require more medication intervention, have more
     depressive symptoms, have lower activity levels, and will have more pain behaviors and more emotional distress
     (American Association of Colleges of Nursing, n.d.).

     Treatment Modalities
     Treatment modalities are an integral part of person-centered care as the client can work with the physical therapist

24.6 · Pain                                                                                                                   829

to choose the modality that is best for them. The therapist and the client work as a team with the therapist providing
instruction and support that respects the client's experience. A pain treatment modality is a method of treatment
utilizing electrical, thermal, mechanical energy, or medication that affects the body's physiology. Examples of these
are transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), heat or cold therapy, or vibration. These modalities are
typically used in physical therapy to reduce swelling, enhance circulation, and relieve pain. Physical therapy is an
integral part of both acute and chronic pain management. Incorporating these modalities in the pain management
plan with traditional physical therapy, such as exercise and massage, reduces the need for as many pharmacological
analgesics.

Pharmacological
When pharmacological pain agents are utilized in older adults, significant oversight and care is required. The current
trend has been toward multimodal pain management with nonopioid drugs for acute pain. There are limits to this
approach, however, depending on the chronic medical issues of the client and on drug interactions. There are also
times when opioids, narcotics that are powerful pain-reducing medications that carry a high risk of dependency,
must be used due to high levels of pain or limited options. The goal with opioid use is to use the lowest dose for the
least amount of time possible, while appropriately managing pain. Opioids in older clients should not be avoided if
needed, but they can cause delirium at higher doses, and all can increase risk of falls.

Nonopioid analgesics include acetaminophen and NSAIDs. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is used to treat mild pain and
fever but does not have anti-inflammatory properties. Acetaminophen is safe for all ages and can be administered
using various routes, such as orally, rectally, and intravenously. Many over-the-counter (OTC) medications contain
acetaminophen, along with other medications. Acetaminophen has a greater pain-relieving effect as a person ages
and can be a very effective pain reliever in older adults, particularly in the very older adult.

Duloxetine is a SNRI, which can help with painful neuropathies, low back pain, fibromyalgia, and chronic
musculoskeletal pain due to osteoarthritis. Titrate slowly to effect and to improve tolerability. Avoid in renal or
hepatic impairment.

The class of drugs called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) provides mild to moderate pain relief and
also reduces fever and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins. They can also be used as an
adjuvant with opioids for severe pain. Examples of NSAIDs include ibuprofen, naproxen, and ketorolac. All NSAIDs,
except aspirin, increase the risk of heart attack, heart failure, and stroke, with the risk being higher if the client takes
more than is directed or takes it for longer than directed. Common side effects include dyspepsia, nausea, and
vomiting, so it is helpful to administer this medication with food. Older adults and those taking NSAIDs concurrently
with other drugs, such as warfarin or corticosteroids, are at elevated risk for gastrointestinal bleeding. Renal failure
can also occur with NSAIDs. Generally, avoid giving NSAIDs to adults over seventy-five due to the risks for GI
bleeding, hypertension, renal injury, and fluid retention or edema.

Topical agents range from active numbing to using heat or cooling sensation to reduce pain. Lidocaine comes in
many forms and is applied as needed. It comes in prescription strength and there are many formulations of OTC
topical pain lotions, patches, and roll-ons that can be heat-creating, menthol, or capsaicin-containing.

Nonpharmacological
Nonpharmacological interventions can be used with or without pharmacologic interventions and often provide
tremendous benefits to the client. Clients can select from a variety of techniques according to what best fits their
needs and goals. Nonpharmacological interventions should be documented in the plan of care and their
effectiveness evaluated in terms of their ability to meet the client's goals for pain relief.

24.7 Psychiatric-Mental Healthcare Nursing Interventions

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Outline how care is customized for older adults
    · Understand the role of the psychiatric-mental health nurse in providing care for older adults within a

        collaborative approach to treatment

Caring for older adults can be very complex because there are many factors to consider and manage. It is also very
rewarding and is different than caring for any other age group. Older adults have so much to share about their lives
and experiences. They have problems and issues just like any other person, but so much can be learned from the
ways that they have overcome hardships in their lives. Frequently, caring for an older adult includes caring for
children or other family members as well. The care must be customized to include caregivers in that plan. Nursing
interventions should be specifically tailored to this population.

Customized Care for the Older Adult

Just like younger adults, each older adult is different. For example, one person who is eighty years old may be very
functional and even still working. Yet another eighty-year-old may be functionally dependent and ill. Each individual
person deserves customized care based on their level of health and function. Some older adults require direct
involvement of a family member for personal care or supervision whereas others may not require family
involvement. Communication is the key to discovering what is important to each person and the others potentially
involved in their care.

Therapeutic Communication
In all nursing care, the therapeutic relationship with the client is essential. This is especially so in psychiatric care,
where the therapeutic relationship is considered to be the foundation of client care and healing. Nurses engage with
clients in caring, supportive, nonjudgmental interactions within a safe environment, often during a stressful period
for the client. Being present and actively listening is the most valuable tool that the nurse has. For older adults with
sensory or cognitive impairment, the environment is very important for privacy and quiet with few distractions.

        CLINICAL SAFETY AND PROCEDURES (QSEN)

Using Effective Communication Skills Promotes Quality Mental Health Care

Tips for effective communication from the WHO mhGAP Intervention Guide include the following:

    · Create an environment that facilitates open communication.
    · Involve the person.
    · Start by listening.
    · Be friendly, respectful, and nonjudgmental.
    · Use good verbal communication skills.
    · Respond with sensitivity when people disclose traumatic experiences (i.e., sexual assault, violence, or self-

        harm).

(WHO, 2019)

Comprehensive Assessment
To develop a practical and client-centered treatment plan, older persons with unexplained or ambiguous symptoms
will benefit from a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), which assesses older adults across various
domains of health. The CGA assesses the following major areas: functional status, gait speed, cognition, mood,
nutritional status, comorbidity, polypharmacy, geriatric syndromes, social support, financial concerns,
environmental suitability, and advance care planning. The CGA helps to prioritize treatments that are in line with
client goals by attempting to understand disease in the context of function and adaptation. It may also spot
opportunities to improve health status by gaining access to community resources or by stopping treatments that are
out of line with client goals. The CGA utilizes evidence-based evaluation instruments in a variety of areas, including
mood and anxiety, in addition to an interdisciplinary approach.

     Outcomes of Care
     An outcome is a client behavior that can be measured in response to an intervention used by a nurse. The Outcomes
     Identification Standard of Practice by the American Nurses Association states, "The registered nurse identifies
     expected outcomes for a plan individualized to the health care consumer or the situation." The registered nurse:

         · engages with the health-care consumer, interprofessional team, and others to identify expected outcomes
         · collaborates with the health-care consumer to define expected outcomes integrating the health-care

             consumer's culture, values, and ethical considerations
         · formulates expected outcomes derived from assessments and diagnoses
         · integrates evidence and best practices to identify expected outcomes
         · develops expected outcomes that facilitate coordination of care
         · identifies a time frame for the attainment of expected outcomes
         · documents expected outcomes as measurable goals
         · identifies the actual outcomes in relation to expected outcomes, safety, and quality standards
         · modifies expected outcomes based on the evaluation of the status of the health-care consumer and situation

     After implementing nursing interventions, the nurse evaluates if the outcomes were met in the time frame indicated
     for that client. Outcome identification includes setting short-term and long-term goals and then creating specific
     expected outcome statements for each nursing diagnosis. Outcome statements are always client-centered. They
     should be developed collaboratively with the client and individualized to meet the client's unique needs, values, and
     cultural beliefs. They should start with the phrase "The client will . . . " Outcome statements should be directed at
     resolving the defining characteristics for that nursing diagnosis. Additionally, the outcome must be something the
     client finds worth achieving.

Nurses' Role in Collaborative Care

Nurses are collaborating with others in client care on a regular basis. All nursing interactions with another team
member involved in the care of a client is a collaboration. For example, when a client is struggling with their pain, the
nurse may discuss and collaborate with the provider about the medications or a change in the treatment plan. They
may also collaborate with the client's social worker or case manager about increasing caregiver time or any number
of possible social supports that the client may need or be eligible for. The nurse also may collaborate with the
client's family if they are directly involved in the care. Psychiatric-mental health nurses participate in this care
constantly, whether it is formal (i.e., the treatment team) or informal (i.e., discussing client care during a family visit).

Nursing Interventions
Implementation of interventions requires the nurse to use critical thinking and clinical judgment. After developing
the initial plan of care, the nurse should continually assess the client to detect any changes in condition requiring
modification of the plan. Should a modification be needed, the nurse collaborates with the team to make those
modifications. The need for continual client reassessment underscores the dynamic nature of the nursing process
and is crucial to providing safe care.

During the implementation phase of the nursing process, the nurse prioritizes planned interventions, assesses client
safety while implementing interventions, delegates interventions as appropriate, and documents interventions
performed. Prioritizing implementation of interventions follows a similar method to prioritizing nursing diagnoses.
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and the ABCs of airway, breathing, and circulation help to establish top-priority
interventions. When possible, use the least restrictive interventions possible.

It is essential to consider client safety when implementing interventions. At times, clients may experience a change
in condition that makes a planned nursing intervention or provider prescription no longer safe to implement. For
example, an established nursing care plan for a client states, "The nurse will ambulate the client 100 feet three
times daily." During assessment this morning, however, the client reports feeling dizzy, and their blood pressure is
90/60 mmHg. Using critical thinking and clinical judgment, the nurse decides not to implement the planned
intervention of ambulating the client and notifies the provider of suspected side effects of the client's
antidepressant medication. This decision, supporting assessment findings, and notification of the provider should
be documented in the client's chart and also communicated during the shift handoff report (Table 24.8).

     Nursing Competency
     APNA's Pharmacological, Biological, and Integrative Therapies Competencies states that a psychiatric-mental
     health registered nurse (PMH-RN) applies clinical skills with knowledge of pharmacological, biological, and
     complementary interventions to improve and maintain clients' health (APNA, 2022). As a result, the PMH-RN
     applies current research findings to guide nursing actions related to pharmacology, other biological therapies, and
     integrative therapies. The nurse also assesses the health-care consumer's response to biological interventions
     based on current knowledge of pharmacological agent's intended actions, interactive effects, potential untoward
     effects, and therapeutic doses. Another competency includes medication management to support health-care
     consumers in managing their own medications and adhering to a prescribed regimen. The nurse provides health
     teaching about mechanism of action, intended effects, potential adverse effects of a proposed prescription, ways to
     cope with transitional side effects, and other treatment options, including the selection of a no-treatment option. In
     terms of the team, the nurse communicates observations about the health-care consumer's response to biological
     interventions to other health clinicians.

     Advocacy and Teaching
     ANA's Health Teaching and Health Promotion Competencies include nursing education. Nurses should offer
     opportunities for the health-care consumer to identify needed health promotion, disease prevention, and self-
     management topics, such as healthy lifestyles; self-care and risk management; and coping, adaptability, and
     resiliency. Nurses should make sure to use health promotion and health teaching methods, including technology, in
     collaboration with the health-care consumer's values, beliefs, health practices, developmental level, learning needs,
     readiness and ability to learn, language preference, spirituality, culture, and socioeconomic status. They should also
     use feedback from the health-care consumer and other assessments to determine the effectiveness of the
     employed strategies. Nurses also provide anticipatory guidance to health-care consumers to promote health and
     prevent or reduce risk.

     Family Support and Transitional Care
     Any move of a client from the hospital to skilled nursing, skilled nursing to home, inpatient mental health facility to
     outpatient mental health or psychiatrist is considered to be a transition of care. There are many possible
     transitions, and they can be difficult for the client and the family. This is also a time that has a high possibility for
     errors in communication and in medications. These errors have also been shown to be linked to adverse effects, low
     satisfaction, and high rehospitalization rates. The nurse can be pivotal in many of these issues by providing a
     detailed and carefully reviewed discharge and handoff to the client and the family. Follow-up calls to the client and
     families are also helpful in being able to review the handoff education and medications.

Summary

24.1 Healthcare Concerns and Decisions of Older Adults

As older adults live longer, there are key factors that nurses can address to make sure that this population has the
tools available for healthy aging. Chronic disease management and the ability to self-manage are two factors to
consider. When self-management no longer seems possible, nurses should review options regarding care and
advance directives with families and caregivers. Nurses must consider healthy aging and quality of life to be the
overriding goals when offering education and other interventions. Health literacy and other obstacles to receiving
care, such as transportation, technological abilities, and cultural issues, should also be front of mind when providing
care to this population.

24.2 Depression

While not a normal part of aging, depression is also not uncommon in older adults. Older adults have higher rates of
chronic illness and loss of functional independence than younger people. They also have a general loss of
independence and loss of friends and family. Lack of support from family and community, lack of resources, lack of
medical care, and many other factors contribute to depression, though depression can be preventable and treatable.
Nurses are well positioned to recognize when a client may be depressed or be at risk for depression. Nursing
interventions include collaborative practice with other professionals and advocacy for the client and family.

24.3 Anxiety

Anxiety in older adults is complicated and can be very different than in younger adults both in presentation and in
management. Anxiety may be underdiagnosed and undertreated in older adults due to various factors, such as
beliefs about aging and existence of medical comorbidities. Nonetheless, anxiety is treatable with the right supports
and counseling. Nursing assessment and collaboration with other professionals can lead to effective interventions
for older adults experiencing anxiety. Nurses are in the best positions to be able to help clients and their families
with education and interventions that can truly make a difference for those living with anxiety.

24.4 Delirium

Delirium is a complication in medical care or in cognitive status for older adults and may occur in any setting. Risk
factors include changes to medications or environment, infection, or dehydration. Delirium may occur in different
categories with different presentations. Each situation is unique and requires careful nursing assessment and
collaborative practice with the health-care team. Nurses are the primary contacts and drivers in acknowledging and
assessing for delirium as well as the nonpharmacological interventions that are very important in management,
treatment, and education of family.

24.5 Alcohol Use

Problematic alcohol use in older adults and older adults with AUD are frequently underreported and more frequently
left unaddressed by providers. When treatment is sought, the care must be appropriate for older adults. The
pharmacology of treating withdrawal and the AUD cravings is specialized for older adults. Brief interventions can be
helpful in this population to reduce quantity and frequency of alcohol intake before moving into the need for more
intensive interventions.

24.6 Pain

Pain in the older adult is more challenging than in the general adult population. Every person is individual as to their
pain tolerance and perception of pain. Older adults who live with a mental health concern and also experience
physical discomfort need specialized care. Opioids can have different effects and can have significant side effects on
older adults, particularly those with cognitive impairment. There are also many medications that are used in younger
adults that are not used in older adults due to kidney function, side effects, or risks for delirium. Acetaminophen has
a greater effect on older adults than it does on younger adults. All of this adds up to a very different management
based on the age of the client. The goal is to treat pain while causing as few side effects as possible. Managing pain
leads to a higher quality of life, but only if done in a way that maximizes independence and function for as long as
possible.

24.7 Psychiatric-Mental Healthcare Nursing Interventions

Providing care for older adults with mental health concerns has its challenges, and is also rewarding. Collaboration
and teamwork are keys to success in providing appropriate and outcome-driven care. Outcomes should be
measurable using the SMART statement and should include appropriate and data-driven nursing interventions.
Geriatric comprehensive assessment is imperative for this population and should be ongoing. The family should be
included in all steps if appropriate and if the client is in agreement. Transitions of care are highly important as many
avoidable errors happen during this time and the nurse can be the key to stopping these errors before they happen
with care and attention to detail.

INTRODUCTION The word community may conjure images of a neighborhood, friend group, place of worship, or
elsewhere. It is likely a group of people who offer support and a sense of connection.
Community is a vital part of the human experience. Humans are social creatures and thrive as part of a group or
community. Community provides a sense of belonging, a support system, a place to share experiences, and a sense
of security. Communities offer opportunities for people to learn from one another, exchange ideas, and collaborate.
Additionally, communities often have shared values and goals, which can give individuals a sense of purpose and
meaning. Overall, communities provide a sense of identity and a feeling of being part of something greater than
oneself, which is essential to human well-being.
Community-based mental health services provide accessible and affordable mental health care to individuals within
their own communities, offering a range of support. Community-based mental health services work to reduce the
stigma surrounding mental illness by promoting awareness and understanding with advocacy and positive
outcomes. They can also help to prevent mental health crises by providing early intervention and support. By
offering services within a community, people can receive the care they need without having to travel long distances
or face other barriers that may prevent them from seeking help. Ultimately, community-based mental health

     services help to improve the overall mental health and well-being of communities. Nurses play an important part in
     helping clients as they navigate community-based mental health care.

     25.1 Identifying Varying Types of Care

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Identify varying types of care in the community
         · Describe the varying types of care available for clients across the life span
         · Determine the most appropriate type of care for a client

     Mental health is not always seen as the public health issue that it is. When an individual has unaddressed mental
     health issues--approximately one in five people with mental health disorders seek mental health services (Bruckner
     et al., 2019)--these can turn into issues for the public as a whole. These issues may manifest as safety concerns,
     homelessness, unemployment, poverty, or effects on the local economy (Substance Abuse and Mental Health
     Services Administration [SAMHSA], 2013). Resolving these underlying issues is a large part of the purpose of public
     community care.

     All nurses will encounter clients with mental health diagnoses and needs. According to the American Hospital
     Association, about one in four clients who are admitted to a general hospital have a mental health diagnosis (2022).
     Additionally, the evolution of the modern American mental health-care system has placed the burden of care
     increasingly on the community level. Over 100 million people live in areas with shortages of psychiatric providers.
     There is also a nationwide shortage of in-facility psychiatric beds that has led to an increase in emergency
     department visits for behavioral health-related issues.

     Community mental health offers services to these clients who might otherwise have difficulty in accessing mental
     health care. Nurses should be able to identify the different types of care available in the community and help
     identify the most appropriate type of care for the client to connect them with the best services for them.

     Types of Care in the Community

     Mental health treatment and activities that occur outside of an institution compose community mental health
     (American Psychological Association [APA], 2018). Care in the community may be classified into a number of
     different groups: ambulatory care programs, support groups, community-based behavioral health programs, home
     visiting services, school-based programs, intensive community/outpatient programs, programs in treatment
     settings, partial hospitalization or day treatment, and substance misuse services. Federal and state funds, financial
     grants, fundraising efforts, and donations support community mental health. Some clients have Medicare, Medicaid,
     private health insurance, or children's health programs to pay for covered services.

     Client-centered care with shared decision-making is a critical aspect of community mental health care. It involves
     tailoring treatment and support to the specific needs of each person with mental illness. Negative public attitudes
     and stigma regarding mental health may make clients resistant to receiving care in a public setting.

     Different geographic or catchment areas offer different types of services; they can be dependent on the
     demographics (National Alliance on Mental Illness [NAMI], 2023c). For those with limited resources or lack of
     support, or who are unhoused or uninsured, community health programs can be crucial to their health, support, and
     safety. Often, medication adherence can mean the difference between stability and relapse. Community mental
     health programs can assist individuals to manage medications and access prescriptions, therapy, education, and
     support to help them remain consistent with their treatment regimens. These community programs can support
     people in their communities and help to prevent hospitalization. There are a number of different types of mental
     health-care workers in the area of community health who are trained to respond to crises or provide psychotherapy,
     education, and consultation to those in need. Community health programs do not end with prevention, access, and
     education. Mental health clients may also recover at cooperative living environments, halfway houses, or group
     homes that are supportive and supervised residences. These clients may also benefit from supportive work
     arrangements in which mental health-care workers can help with maintaining employment. Adolescents and
     children may access special education or integrated educational program services. Clients across the life span can
     benefit from in-home or home care services, family support, personal-care assistance, case management and
     services coordination, and the use of mental health clinics. Telehealth may also be an option for clients who cannot

attend an in-person treatment program.

The quality of this vast array of services and support groups depends highly on the commitment of the community
itself. Cultural norms, local government funding, political climate, and environment can all affect the types of
community services available. People in the community may have to work together to create needed services if they
do not currently exist.

        LINK TO LEARNING

The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) periodically conducts and publishes community surveys
(https://openstax.org/r/77comsurveys) in order to assess and evaluate public attitudes and perceptions toward
various aspects of mental health.

Private Care within the Community
Community mental health care offers a range of care options that cater to the unique needs of individuals seeking
mental health support. Private treatment, which does not receive governmental support, can vary widely in
availability and cost. Because of this, it is not accessible to everyone. A portion of the cost of care may be covered by
insurance, or the client may be required to pay out of pocket (NAMI, 2022). Some private treatment services accept
Medicaid or Medicare as payment for services while others may not. Private services may take place in a variety of
settings and at different intervals depending on the treatment plan. For example, faith communities can play a
central role in the mental health of individuals in many communities by providing education and support to both the
client and their family. Many private faith-based services offer their own counseling centers or support groups.

Some other private care options available in community mental health care include individual therapy, group
therapy, medication management, and case management. Individual therapy involves one-on-one sessions with a
mental health professional that are tailored to the individual's specific needs and concerns, while group therapy
involves participating in therapy sessions with a group of people who are facing similar challenges. Medication
management involves working with a licensed mental health provider, such as a psychiatric nurse practitioner or
psychiatrist, to develop an appropriate medication regimen to manage symptoms. Case management involves
working with a mental health professional who can help coordinate care and connect individuals with additional
resources and support as needed. Some of these resources include the following:

    · Supportive community living services: Housing with support services focused toward independent living
    · Day habilitation: Provision of regular activities scheduled to enhance self-care skills and maintain or improve

        functional ability, such as assistance with adaptation to the environment for adults or reaching developmental
        milestones for children
    · Transitional/day programs: Assist with clients progressing between levels of function, from dependent or
        assisted to self-care, that is, personal care, social skills, money management, transportation, or employment
        training

Community Care: Public Resources
Public resources in community mental health care play a vital role in filling the gaps in access for clients who may
not be able to use private resources. Public forms of community mental health care can include crisis intervention
services, outpatient counseling, substance misuse counseling, and medication management. Crisis intervention
services offer immediate support to individuals who are experiencing mental health emergencies, such as suicidal
ideation or psychosis. Additionally, community mental health care can provide support groups, case management,
and vocational services to help individuals achieve their goals and improve their quality of life. The availability of
these services may vary depending on the location and resources of the community.

Community health centers have expanded over the last decade and aim to target underserved populations in
specific communities, offering treatment and preventative health services. These facilities are also known as
Federally Qualified Health Centers. These types of health centers offer an array of medical services, including
mental health, and are important safeguards in limited resource areas, qualifying for specific reimbursement
systems (such as Medicare and Medicaid) and other government funding. Clients seen at Federally Qualified Health
Centers typically are on Medicaid or do not have health insurance and are offered adjusted payment options; many
848  25 · Community Mental Health Treatment

     community health centers strive to remain affordable.

     Places that provide care to clients with all levels of mental illness and substance use, including those with complex
     needs or at high risk, and specialize in treating these individuals is a community mental health center. They can
     assist with medication, case management, community services, or intensive community services (NAMI, 2022). In
     addition, they may be used when a referral to a private provider is not possible for a variety of reasons. These
     centers are often interdisciplinary, with a team working to provide care to the client. Clients who are seen at these
     public facilities often are eligible for Social Security disability income and Medicare benefits.

     Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs) represent a significant advancement in the provision of
     comprehensive mental health and substance use disorder services in the United States (SAMHSA, 2023a). These
     clinics are part of a federal initiative designed to offer a holistic and integrated approach to mental health care and
     are funded through federal and state grants. They are required to provide timely treatment to any client requesting
     care for mental health or substance use issues, regardless of the client's ability to pay.

             LINK TO LEARNING

     SAMHSA describes how a CCBHC ensures access to coordinated comprehensive behavioral health care
     (https://openstax.org/r/77CCBHC) for all clients of all circumstances.

     CCBHCs provide a broad range of services, including community mental health treatment, substance use disorder
     services, crisis intervention, and even primary care services in some cases. These clinics play a pivotal role in
     addressing the gaps in the traditional mental health-care system, ensuring that individuals receive the full spectrum
     of care they need to manage their mental health conditions effectively. Every state is required to meet the federal
     guidelines and deadlines for the CCBHC programs.

             PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

     Peer Support Centers

     Peer support centers are a free or low-cost resource for people recovering from severe mental illness. Individuals
     use their own recovery experience and training to provide support, encourage hope, and promote social interaction.
     The goal is to aid people with mental illness on their recovery journey to live meaningful lives in their community.
     Resources offered at peer support centers can range from counseling to different therapies, such as art or pet
     therapy, crisis support, and long-term programs for those who may have greater needs as they transition back to the
     community. H.E.A.R.T.S. Peer Support of Greater Nashua, New Hampshire (https://openstax.org/r/77HEARTS), is
     one example of a peer support center that offers a wide range of resources for those seeking peer support in mental
     health recovery.

     Community Care: Individual-Focused
     Individualized care in the community can include individual counseling, psychotherapy, medication therapy, or
     rehabilitation (CDC, 2011). Some of the different kinds of individual-focused care available in community mental
     health care include cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, and trauma-focused therapy.

     Community mental health-care providers may also offer specialized services for individuals with specific mental
     health issues, such as addiction treatment or eating disorder treatment. Integrated Health Homes (IHH)
     (https://openstax.org/r/77IHH) are offered in nineteen American states. IHH are team-based professionals
     collaborating in holistic care for adults or children with severe mental illness.

     Housing and transportation circumstances can affect an individual's ability to access treatment options. Individuals
     with stable housing may be more likely to participate in treatment, as the treatment may be located at their home
     (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2021a). As more treatment shifts to a virtual environment, this has
     become more commonplace. The COVID-19 pandemic required many treatments to move to an online environment,
     and many clients who either would not previously engage in therapy due to stigma or lack of transportation were
     now able to receive services. Many of these services were found successful and even preferred by the clients, and

thus many of these community treatment options have continued in a virtual environment.

        PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Telehealth for Mental Health Services

Telehealth has emerged as a transformative approach to delivering mental health services, offering a multitude of
benefits for clients seeking support and treatment. One significant advantage is enhanced accessibility, allowing
individuals to receive care regardless of geographical location or physical mobility. This is especially crucial for
clients residing in remote or underserved areas, as well as those with mobility challenges or transportation barriers.
Telehealth eliminates the need for travel and enables clients to engage in therapy or consultations from the comfort
of their homes, promoting regular attendance and reducing the likelihood of missed appointments.

Telehealth promotes convenience and flexibility. Clients can schedule sessions that align with their daily routines,
making it easier to integrate mental health care into their lives. This flexibility extends to the availability of therapists
and specialists, allowing clients to access a wider range of expertise and therapeutic modalities that may not be
readily available locally. For clients who experience anxiety or discomfort in traditional clinical settings, telehealth
offers a more relaxed and private environment, potentially fostering increased openness and engagement.
Additionally, telehealth preserves anonymity, making it an appealing option for those concerned about social stigma
associated with seeking mental health support (NAMI, 2023f).

Community Care: Family-Focused
Family-focused care is an important part of community mental health care. Family-focused care recognizes the role
that family members and caregivers can play in supporting individuals with mental health issues. Different kinds of
family-focused care available in community mental health care include family therapy, education, support groups,
and respite care.

Family therapy involves working with the family as a whole to address issues within the family unit and to develop
strategies to support the individual with mental health issues, including communication techniques for improved
understanding and coping skills for family members. Family therapy may be helpful in cases of clients with severe,
chronic illness, such as schizophrenia, or someone who is in active recovery from substance misuse. It is especially
valuable when working with children and adolescents with mental health issues. Family education involves
educating family members about mental health issues, treatment options, and other ways to support their loved
one. Support groups are a way for family members to connect with others in similar situations, share their
experiences, and receive education and emotional support.

Respite care varies by state, with some states capping the number of days that the service may be provided in their
managed care contracts. Respite care provides temporary relief for family member caregivers and can be provided
in the home or in a facility where respite workers assume care, provide therapies, and supervise the client.

Community mental health-care providers also may offer services specifically for children and adolescents, such as
family-based interventions for early-onset psychosis (SAMHSA, 2022a). NAMI provides support groups for families
who are supporting people with mental illnesses; these group sessions are virtual or in person. The family may also
participate in group therapy with the affected client.

Community Programs: IOPs and PHPs
An intensive community program, or intensive outpatient program (IOP), is a type of community care that provides
structure and support for clients in a community setting, allowing them to receive intensive treatment without the
disruption of hospitalization (New York Office of Mental Health, 2023). IOPs are an important component of
community mental health care because they offer a higher level of care than traditional community services but do
not require the same level of commitment as hospitalization with twenty-four-hour supervision. IOPs typically
involve frequent and intensive therapy sessions, as well as additional support services, such as medication
management and group therapy. Clients attend these sessions as scheduled.

IOPs can be an effective way to provide targeted and intensive care for individuals with mental health disorders and
substance use disorders while allowing them the flexibility to continue to live in their communities and maintain
850  25 · Community Mental Health Treatment

     their daily routines. They can also be a more cost-effective option than hospitalization; they do not require the same
     level of resources, and can help prevent hospital readmissions. Community mental health-care providers may offer
     IOPs for a variety of mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, and eating disorders. For those with
     substance use disorders, an IOP can be helpful for those who do not require detoxification in a hospital setting
     (National Institutes of Health [NIH], 2014) or have recently completed the detoxification or hospital stay and are
     receiving treatment in the community. Other IOPs may be for adolescents with behavioral or psychiatric conditions;
     this may involve participation of the adolescent's family.

     A partial hospitalization program (PHP) is a step-down program for clients who require a higher level of care and
     support than that offered by IOPs, but who do not need twenty-four-hour supervision. These programs require more
     of a time commitment than IOPs, ranging from several hours per day to full-day sessions, multiple days per week.
     They take place in a hospital or clinic setting, providing a highly structured and supportive environment for
     participants. PHPs offer a comprehensive range of therapeutic services, including individual therapy, group therapy,
     family therapy, medication management, medical monitoring, and other specialized interventions. The treatment
     team usually includes psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, social workers, and other mental health professionals.
     PHPs often serve as a step-down program for people who have recently been discharged from hospitalization and
     still require support before transitioning to less intensive levels of care.

     Types of Care across the Life Span

     Different age groups have varying psychosocial needs to consider when developing an effective community health-
     care plan. Certain mental health conditions may be more prevalent in certain age groups. For instance, ADHD is
     more commonly diagnosed in children, while depression and anxiety disorders are more common in adults. Also,
     different age groups may require different approaches to treatment. For example, children and adolescents may
     benefit from play therapy and family therapy, while adults may benefit from individual therapy and group therapy.
     Older adults may require more assistance and support due to physical and cognitive limitations and may benefit
     from interventions that address their social isolation and loneliness. It is important for nurses to consider age when
     developing treatment plans and interventions for individuals.

     Care of Children and Adolescents
     Mental health disorders in children can be defined as a disturbance in thoughts, emotions, and/or behaviors that
     deviate from developmental norms for a child's age, and which cause distress, impairment in functioning, or both.
     Like adults, adolescents and children may experience a variety of mental health disorders, such as ADHD, anxiety,
     depression, behavior disorders, or substance misuse. Children are not "little adults," however, and often respond
     differently to medications and treatments than adults (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2021b).
     Additionally, the diagnosis process for mental health disorders in children and adolescents is complex and usually
     includes in-depth family interviews, gathering information from the child's school related to behavior, and
     professional observation and testing. It is important to know the adolescent or child's diagnosis and coordinate with
     the appropriate support systems to be able to provide care in the community.

     Evaluating a child's developmental milestones can provide crucial insights into their mental health because these
     milestones are closely linked to the child's cognitive, emotional, social, and physical development. Children who
     experience delays or difficulties in achieving these milestones may be at risk for mental health problems, such as
     anxiety, depression, and ADHD (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2021). For example, if a child is
     not meeting their developmental milestones for language, it could be an early warning sign of communication or
     social difficulties that could affect the child's mental health and development.

     A child's school and certain test results can be an important source of information on their behavior. Records can
     help reveal if children are reaching important developmental and emotional milestones. A thorough family history
     and interview about the history of the child will be part of a mental health evaluation. Home visits or in-clinic
     evaluations by professionals can also reveal any issues with developmental milestones. Early identification and
     intervention can help prevent or minimize the impact of mental health issues and support healthy development.

Screenings, such as the Denver II Developmental Screening Test (https://openstax.org/r/77devscreen) can help
assess developmental milestones in children and adolescents, which can support early diagnosis of a mental health
disorder or behavioral concern.

Bullying can have a significant impact on the mental health of children and adolescents; research has uncovered
correlations between bullying and generalized anxiety disorder, panic attacks, agoraphobia, and depression (U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, 2021b). Bullying can also lead to social isolation, which can further
exacerbate mental health issues. Children who are bullied may struggle with making friends, and may feel like they
do not belong, which can lead to feelings of loneliness and depression. In some cases, bullying can also lead to
more serious mental health issues, including suicidal thoughts. Suicide is a major concern as the third leading cause
of death for those fifteen to twenty-four years old (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2021b). Children
who experience severe or chronic bullying may be more likely to struggle with these issues. It is important for
parents, teachers, and other adults to be aware of the signs of bullying and to take steps to intervene when
necessary. Providing support and resources for children who have experienced bullying can help to mitigate the
negative effects on their mental health.

Prevention is a major intervention in the care of the adolescent or child in the community. There are several effective
ways that prevention can be used as an effective strategy for managing community mental health care for children
and adolescents:

    · Early identification and intervention take place through screening programs, regular check-ins with mental
        health professionals, and outreach programs that target high-risk populations.

    · Promoting mental health and well-being in children and adolescents happens through programs that focus on
        building social and emotional skills, promoting healthy lifestyles, and addressing risk factors for mental health
        problems. Such programs can be conducted in schools, through community health centers, or with assistance
        from individual health-care workers.

    · Education can help increase awareness and understanding of mental health issues in the community, reduce
        stigma, and encourage people to seek help when they need it. Schools can also be a major influence in
        identifying behavioral disorders in children, and in providing services that can support these children. Studies
        have shown that of those adolescents with a diagnosable psychiatric disorder, only half of them finish high
        school (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2021b).

    · Targeted interventions are aimed at specific mental health issues, such as depression, anxiety, or substance
        use. For example, prevention issues related to alcohol and drugs can delay the first drink of the individual,
        thus decreasing the risk of binge drinking, heavy alcohol use, and drug use (U.S. Department of Health and
        Human Services, 2021b). This can decrease the likelihood of the individual developing a substance use
        disorder as an adolescent or even later in life.

Adolescents and children with mental health disorders may receive their mental health services in conjunction with
their educational services. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA, 2004) provides public funding for
special education services, mandating that the services be provided in the least restrictive environment.

        LIFE-STAGE CONTEXT

Services for Children and Adolescents

There are multiple community-based services and toolkits to support mental health in the child and adolescent
populations. One community-based program supporting children and adolescents is Project Advancing Wellness
and Resiliency in Education (AWARE). Project AWARE (https://openstax.org/r/77AWARE) partners state mental
health agencies (SMHAs) with state educational agencies (SEAs) to increase mental health awareness and resiliency
among this population (SAMHSA, 2022b). Another is the Toolkit for Community Conversations about Mental Health
(https://openstax.org/r/77DHSToolkit) produced by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which
852  25 · Community Mental Health Treatment

     provides those in the community with information, discussion guides, planning guides, and infographics that can
     assist with creating community care for the adolescent and child population (U.S. Department of Health and Human
     Services, 2021b). SAMHSA also offers a toolkit specifically for high schools to provide education, support, and
     intervention (https://openstax.org/r/77SAMHSATool) for those at risk.

     For those children or adolescents with anxiety or depression, behavior therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy may
     work using an individual, group, or family approach (CDC, 2022a). Individuals can find a provider for this type of
     therapy in the community through a variety of locator tools (for example, the APA Psychologist Locator or the
     American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Finder) or through the parent's insurance network.

     As part of the mental health-care community, parents, educators, and health-care partners all play a role. Schools
     can provide care in the community by referring students to mental health services, integrating social-emotional
     learning into their curriculum, training staff appropriately, supporting mental health of the staff, maintaining
     equitable discipline policies for students, and providing a safe and supportive environment. Parents and caregivers
     should communicate openly and honestly with their children, support healthy decision-making, enjoy shared
     activities together, volunteer or be engaged in school activities, provide help with homework, and communicate on a
     regular basis with teachers and administrators. Health-care providers can use routine appointments to provide
     education about development and risky behaviors, screen about relationships, and encourage positive parenting
     (Division of Adolescent and School Health, 2023).

     Care of the Adult
     The adult population is a large one that encompasses people from ages eighteen through sixty-four. It is important
     to note that younger adults can have different mental health issues than older adults. For instance, in 2020, young
     adults aged eighteen to twenty-five years had the highest prevalence of mental illness (30.6 percent) compared
     with adults aged twenty-six to forty-nine years (25.3 percent) and adults aged fifty and older (14.5 percent) (U.S.
     Department of Health and Human Services, 2022a). Nevertheless, the percentage of young adults aged eighteen to
     twenty-five years with mental illness who received mental health services was the lowest of all three groups at 42.1
     percent, with adults aged twenty-six to forty-nine years at 46.6 percent and aged fifty and older at 48 percent. Table
     25.1 compares the unique challenges that can affect the mental health of the young adult and middle-aged adult
     populations.

TABLE 25.1 Mental Health Challenges Affecting Adult Populations

Depending on the severity of their illness and functional ability, clients may need assistance with determining what
care is needed, finding resources for housing, securing public health insurance if unemployed, managing
medications, and locating mental health therapies. NAMI (2023d) provides support groups in both English and
Spanish, either in person or virtual. Additionally, community outreach and education programs can help reduce
stigma and increase awareness about the importance of mental health. Support groups, individual counseling, and
other resources can provide much-needed support and guidance to this population. Those with income limitations
or serious mental health illnesses may benefit most from a community mental health center.

There are successful Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) model-based programs for the adult population. The
Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) program delivers individualized mental health services to individuals in the
community and aims to reduce clients' dependence on hospitalization. For clients with the most severe, persistent
mental illnesses and the greatest level of functional impairments, an evidence-based practice model, such as the
ACT model, can be beneficial in providing a framework for strategies to identify at-risk individuals (SAMHSA, 2019).
ACT teams work with individuals in their homes, workplaces, and other community settings to help them achieve
their goals and improve their quality of life and to prevent institutionalization. Research has shown that the ACT
model is effective in reducing hospitalizations, improving housing stability, increasing social functioning, and
enhancing overall quality of life for people with severe and persistent mental illness.

One example is the Center for Urban Community Services (CUCS) in New York City. CUCS operates an ACT program
that serves adults with serious mental illness, many of whom have experienced homelessness. The program
employs a multidisciplinary team of mental health professionals, including psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, and
employment specialists, who provide 24/7 support to clients in their homes, at work, and in the community (New
York City Department of Homeless Services, Department of Social Services, n.d.). The program also operates at the
national level as the CUCS Institute, providing training and assistance to organizations that help mentally ill and
homeless individuals across the country.

     Care of the Older Adult
     The older adult population in the United States is expected to approximately double in size by 2060. In addition to
     its economic impacts, this growth could also have a significant effect on the treatment of mental health in older
     adults. Research by SAMHSA (2019) has shown that 1.4 to 4.8 percent of the 49.2 million older adults over age
     sixty-five in the United States suffer from a serious mental illness. A serious mental illness, as defined by the
     Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), requires that the client have "a diagnosable
     mental, behavior, or emotional disorder that causes serious functional impairment that substantially interferes with
     or limits one or more major life activities" (2023b, para 3). Yet due to the nature of aging, many older adults exhibit
     impairments in functioning that may or may not be related to mental health issues, making diagnosing and caring for
     a mental health disorder difficult.

     Many people who work in mental health care may not be aware of the signs and symptoms of mental illness in older
     adults, or how to treat those symptoms (SAMHSA, 2019). Others may consider some signs and symptoms, such as
     confusion or forgetfulness, as signs of aging, and ignore what is really affecting the client. Caring for the mental
     health of older adults requires specialized knowledge and an awareness of what is typical and atypical for a
     particular individual.

     Nurses should be aware that older adults are more likely to have co-occurring health conditions, such as diabetes,
     heart disease, or dementia, which can complicate the treatment of mental health issues. Also, older adults are at a
     much higher risk for polypharmacy, or taking multiple medications, which, along with differences in drug
     metabolism, can increase the risk of negative drug interactions or adverse effects. A thorough and accurate
     medication list must be on hand during every client encounter.

     There are many access issues for older adults in community mental health care. Older adults face stigma and
     ageism related to mental health issues, which can prevent them from seeking help and accessing appropriate care
     due to fear of being judged. Additionally, numerous older adults live in rural or remote areas, which can make it
     difficult to access mental health-care services. Older individuals may not have access to technology or
     transportation or may have mobility issues that make it difficult to travel to appointments. Individuals over age
     sixty-five are more likely to rely on family members or other caregivers for support, and these caregivers may
     experience stress and burden related to managing the individual's mental health issues, or may no longer be
     available.

     Some older adults live in institutional types of settings, such as nursing homes or skilled nursing facilities, which are
     located in the community, but not necessarily community-based services. For those who are diagnosed with a
     chronic mental illness, they may be living in a behavioral health-specific facility that offers interdisciplinary services
     for the client. Many older adults, on the other hand, do not live in such facilities and are socially isolated, which can
     exacerbate mental health issues and make it more difficult to physically access care.

     Clients in older age groups may be prone to substance use. Older adults may misuse medications unintentionally
     through forgetfulness or error. Some older adults may turn to substance use to cope with losses in life, such as
     changes in employment or living situations, general health, or interpersonal relationships (NIH, 2020). The rate of
     substance use disorders is 0.2 to 1.9 percent in this population, and while this may seem like a small percentage,
     the 2016 National Survey of Drug Use and Health data noted that only 240,000 of the 863,000 older adults with a
     substance use disorder were receiving treatment (SAMHSA, 2019).

     Community groups, such as Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous, are essential for this age group. These
     meetings may be available in their institutional-based facility, online, or at local community centers or churches.

             LIFE-STAGE CONTEXT

     Resources for Older Adults

     Community-based senior centers can be an excellent resource for older adults. They often offer an array of services
     to improve the physical and mental well-being of older adults. Services include screenings, such as blood pressure
     checks, cholesterol tests, and vision and hearing tests. Many places also offer exercise and fitness programs tailored
     to the needs of older adults, as well as transportation services (https://openstax.org/r/77transport).

Centers often partner with mental health professionals to offer services, such as individual or group therapy, and
education sessions to address issues, such as depression, anxiety, grief, or cognitive decline. Additionally, senior
centers offer opportunities for recreation and socialization, which are crucial for good mental health in older adults.

Suicide in older age groups is also a risk. Men over the age of fifty are at higher risk for suicide, and attempts by older
adults generally result in more deaths (SAMHSA, 2019). A client in an institutional facility may require more
frequent supervision than others. Crisis lines and community support groups are significant community resources
for care. The 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline offers national 24/7 call, text, and chat access to trained counselors who
can assist those experiencing emotional distress. Anyone worried about a loved one can also dial 988 for support
and information.

clinics that specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders in older adults. Home health
services can provide older adults with access to mental health care in their own homes, including in-home
assessments, medication management, and psychotherapy. This can be especially helpful for those with limited
mobility or transportation issues. Resources vary by location, so it can be helpful to speak with case managers,
social workers, and other health-care professionals from the client's community to familiarize yourself with the
available resources.

The NIH provides information on mental health (https://openstax.org/r/77oldadultmh) in older adults.

The Psychogeriatric Assessment and Treatment in City Housing (PATCH) is an example of a program specifically for
older adults that is based on the ACT model. It is a collaborative program between mental health professionals and
housing providers, which aims to improve the quality of life of older adults with mental health issues (Robbins et al.,
2000). It provides them with access to comprehensive assessments, individualized treatment plans, and ongoing
support. The program is focused on addressing the specific needs of older adults, such as age-related health
concerns, cognitive impairment, social isolation, and the impact of physical disabilities. Other resources, such as the
Health Care Innovations Exchange through the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, provide care to this
population as well (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2021).

Determining Appropriate Care for a Client

Determining the appropriate community-based mental health care for a client is important because it can be more
cost-effective, motivate client engagement, increase access to care, and improve mental health outcomes.

The first step in determining the appropriate care involves a thorough assessment. This includes gathering
information about the client's mental health status, including their symptoms, behaviors, and overall functioning.
This may involve using standardized screening tools that can identify a client's risk for suicide, depression, anxiety,
and other concerns. The nurse may conduct interviews with the client and their family, perform a mental status
exam, and review medical records. Other relevant factors include age, income, medical history, access to health
insurance, transportation, and social support. This assessment can help the nurse identify the client's specific needs
and preferences, which can guide the selection of appropriate community-based mental health-care services that
meet the client's unique needs and goals. The nurse can also collaborate with other members of the health-care
team, such as the client's provider and mental health professionals, to develop an effective and coordinated care
plan for the client.

             REAL RN STORIES

     Nurse: B.T., MSN RN
     Years in Practice: 24
     Clinical Setting: Rural hospital
     Geographic Location: Atlanta, Georgia

     When I worked as a float nurse in a rural hospital, I was frequently assigned to psychiatry and I became known
     among other nurses as somewhat of an expert. I had an associate's degree at the time and had not sought a
     specialty area, though I truly felt an affinity for mental health nursing practice.

     One evening when I was working on a med-surg unit, a colleague approached me for advice working with an older
     adult who was being "stubborn" and refusing home health and other support services as part of the discharge plan.
     I explored how the discharge teaching was being delivered and heard words such as "told," "pointed out," and "tried
     to convince."

     I offered the nurse a strategy of therapeutic communication, which included empowering the older adult with choice
     and placing the emphasis on prevention--as opposed to correction. I encouraged the nurse to listen to the older
     adult's concerns and possibly provide a list of five or six services and have the older adult select two to try,
     recognizing the importance of the person's autonomy.

     A week later, I found a thank-you note and gift card in my mail slot from the nurse I had spoken to; she wrote, "It
     really worked!" I smiled as I read the message, thinking that it "worked" because the nurse did.

     Planning care will involve exploring a range of community-based services suitable to the individual client. When
     determining a plan of care for a client, the nurse should seek as much of the client's input as possible; when people
     have input into their own plan, they are much more likely to follow it. After implementing the plan of care, the nurse
     should periodically check with the client at appropriate intervals to see how they are progressing. If necessary, the
     nurse can make adjustments to the plan depending on how effective the care is. Ongoing evaluation of the plan's
     effectiveness will help ensure that the client is receiving the best possible care.

     25.2 Community Needs

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Understand the holistic approach to mental health care
         · Describe the physical needs of the mental health client in a community environment
         · Understand the social-emotional needs of the mental health client in a community environment

     The specific needs of mental health clients will vary depending on their diagnosis, treatment plan, and individual
     circumstances. Nursing is a holistic discipline that treats mental health from a whole person perspective; nurses
     should consider the physical, emotional, and spiritual aspects of the person when developing a community care
     treatment plan. Personalized care and ongoing assessment are crucial to meet the unique physical and social-
     emotional needs of each client in a community setting.

     Understanding the Holistic Approach to Mental Health Care in the Community

     The holistic approach is person-centered and considers all the determinants of health, such as economic stability,
     access to health care, education and spiritual expression, safe neighborhoods, and social networks in the
     community. Holistic care is integrated, combining resources for physical and psychosocial needs, and approaching
     the whole person, not simply the diagnostic category. Collaboration between the person and the health-care team
     can address symptom management as well as individualized outcomes of care.

     Mental health conditions can impact physical health, manifesting as poor nutrition, increased risk of comorbidities,
     and medication side effects. Basic physical needs, such as food and housing, must be addressed as part of any
     effective mental health-care plan. Physical needs also include transportation and work accommodations.

Similarly, physical health issues can affect mental health, causing anxiety, depression, stress, and fear. Additionally,
mental health clients may struggle to express their emotions and communicate their needs effectively, which can
lead to feelings of frustration and isolation.

Socialization and interpersonal relationships in the community provide a sense of connection, support, and purpose,
which can positively impact mental health outcomes. Social support can enhance a sense of belonging, reduce
feelings of isolation, improve overall health, and provide opportunities for skill building, engagement, and personal
growth.

  CLINICAL JUDGMENT MEASUREMENT MODEL

  Using the CJMM to Create a Nursing Plan of Care

  Davis, BSN RN, is working with Beatrice A., eighty-two years old, who was hospitalized after a fall with no
  fractures. Her discharge is planned in the next twenty-four hours. Davis reviews the electronic health record
  (EHR) and learns that Beatrice experiences orthostatic hypotension, consumes approximately one-half of her
  diet each day, is continent of bowel and bladder. Medications include lisinopril, metformin, omeprazole,
  simvastatin. Beatrice has health insurance through Medicare with a supplemental policy. She is financially
  secure with a retirement income.

  During interdisciplinary rounds, the physical therapy staff has reported Beatrice remains at risk for falls due to
  low vision and weakened physical strength and recommends discharge to short-term rehab. The social services
  representative reports that Beatrice was hospitalized last year after a motor vehicle accident and refused rehab
  at that time, not wanting to leave her home. Beatrice lives alone in her own apartment, attends weekly church
  with a neighbor, and has her groceries delivered. She no longer drives a car, has no history of substance use, and
  watches television programs two to four hours each day.

  Davis meets with Beatrice to discuss the discharge plan. Davis knows that the local community has the following
  services available:

      · ambulatory care programs
      · support groups, mental health clinics
      · home visiting services, medication management
      · partial hospitalization or day treatment
      · personal-care assistance, case management and services coordination
      · transportation services
      · telehealth

  Davis follows the CJMM steps and involves the client throughout the process.

     Physical Needs of Mental Health Clients in the Community

     In one sense, the physical needs of the mental health client are the same as those of anyone: to have secure
     housing, food, transportation, and potential work accommodations. But mental health clients seeking treatment in
     community or community environments may encounter stigma, and they have specific needs that involve how they

seek and access treatment, and how well they are able to continue their treatment. In essence, this means, for
instance, that accessible public transportation is, in part, a mental health issue. There are also a number of
comorbidities that can appear alongside many mental health illnesses; depression, for example, often accompanies
substance use disorder and physical illnesses like cancer, and is a significant and leading cause of disability in adults
of all ethnicities (Khodyakov et al., 2018).

Health and Medical Care
Mental health clients have been shown to have a higher incidence of certain medical issues than the general
population. Take cardiovascular disease, for example. Mood disorders, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD), and chronic stress are among those most studied in relation to cardiovascular disease; however,
other behavioral health disorders, including substance misuse, may be related to cardiovascular disease as well
(CDC, 2020). This correlation means that a client with a mental illness, such as depression, anxiety, and PTSD, may
be more likely to experience a stroke, heart failure, or myocardial infarction. Physical manifestations may be found
across the life span and are not necessarily specific to a particular age group. This is especially true of depression.
Research has found that clients with depression may experience increased inflammation, changes in heart rate
control and blood circulation, stress hormone abnormalities, and metabolic changes. These changes may lead to
cardiovascular disease, pain, stroke, diabetes, and even Alzheimer's disease (National Institute on Mental Health
[NIMH], 2021). Research has revealed that women, veterans, people with PTSD, and racial or ethnic minorities have
higher rates of heart disease that are related to mental health conditions (Gross et al., 2022).

Health-care providers can support these clients by working as multidisciplinary teams, providing resources to
mental health clients on risks, or using electronic health records to coordinate the care the client needs. Clients
should look for physical signs and symptoms of heart disease, determine any family history or genetic
predisposition, and try to keep a healthy lifestyle. This last point is of particular importance; an unhealthy routine, as
a result of anxiety or depression, can lead to smoking, being sedentary, or not taking necessary medications as they
should be taken. Unfortunately, medications used to treat mental health illnesses may have undesirable side effects
such as "obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, heart attacks (myocardial infarctions), atrial fibrillation, stroke ...
death," sexual side effects, and hyperglycemia (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2022b), making
compliance even more difficult for some mental health clients.

Clients with mental health disorders sometimes experience difficulties with basic physiological and safety needs
that increase the challenge to maintain their overall well-being. For example, clients with mental health illnesses
may also experience food insecurity, which is limited or inconsistent access to the amount of food required to live a
healthy lifestyle. Food insecurity has strong physical and emotional effects on an individual and can have serious
negative effects on mental health. Those who have a mental health illness are at increased risk for food insecurity
and may have to choose between food or treatment for their mental health (NAMI, 2023d). Clients across the life
span may qualify for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and those who are pregnant or with
children age five or younger may also qualify for the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program. NAMI states that
"it is critical to address food insecurity and related social determinants of health to allow people with mental health
conditions to focus on getting and staying well" (NAMI, 2023d, para 13).

government financial assistance and benefits for families.

Housing
Housing instability or neighborhood violence can affect clients across the life span, and potentially influence the
physical health and safety of a client. According to NAMI, a significant barrier to recovery from mental illness is the
lack of stable and/or affordable housing; if this need is not met, then the mental health client can end up unhoused,
in jail, in a shelter, or back in the hospital (NAMI, 2023d). Therefore, a client may need assistance with housing upon
discharge from a hospital. According to the National Alliance to End Homelessness, more than one in ten people
who seek substance misuse or mental health treatment in the public health system are homeless (2023). It is
important to collaborate with the client to determine the appropriate type of housing that the client may need to
860  25 · Community Mental Health Treatment

     support recovery. One option is group housing, a type of small-scale living facility that, in addition to housing,
     provides support, supervision, and other types of assistance. Group housing can be supervised or partially
     supervised. Other options in the community can include supportive housing, rental housing, or home ownership.
     Supervised group housing can provide mental health clients with a higher level of care, but still allow the
     independence of living in the community. This type of housing may assist the client with meals, medications,
     activities of daily living, paying bills, transportation, and treatment. Partially supervised group housing allows for
     more independence, but gives the mental health client access to help if needed; supportive housing combines living
     space with services.

     Nurses and clients can find more information on government financial assistance and benefits
     (https://Openstax.org/r/77govben) at the federal government's benefits site.

     The client may also need support in obtaining the finances for housing. Often clients with serious mental illnesses
     are living on Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and may not be able to afford sufficient housing. A client with a
     mental health illness may qualify for Section 8, which provides vouchers to low-income individuals and families, or
     Section 811, the Supportive Housing for People with Disabilities Program, for which a client with a chronic mental
     health illness may qualify. Be mindful of the fact that many housing options have age and/or income qualifications.

             REAL RN STORIES

     Nurse: Heather, RN, BSN
     Years in Practice: 3
     Clinical Setting: Medical-surgical unit
     Geographic Location: The inner city of a large metropolitan area in Florida

     We serve a diverse client population, but many of our clients are from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and either
     use Medicaid or have no health insurance. There is a large encampment of people who are homeless staying
     underneath the freeway overpass three blocks away, and we frequently see these individuals for treatment.

     One rainy, cold night, I received report from the emergency department on my new client, Gene S. I was told he was
     a "frequent flier" who came in "all the time" with the same complaint. He was a fifty-eight-year-old White male with
     a history of schizophrenia and type 2 diabetes. He had been admitted with a complaint of chest pain, but all testing
     was negative so far. I went to Gene's room to find him sitting in bed, with his wife at the bedside. They were both
     disheveled in appearance but very pleasant. Both of them immediately requested juice, crackers, and some
     sandwiches.

     Upon assessment, Gene was alert and oriented, but slow to answer some questions. He and his wife had moved to
     the area two months ago and were unhoused; they had been staying in the encampment underneath the freeway. I
     noticed in his chart that he had presented to the emergency room five times in that two-month time period with
     complaints of "chest pain," but that his test results were always negative and he was always discharged from the
     emergency room. Gene told me that he was taking metformin and aripiprazole, which he got through his previous
     doctor in another state. But he had no local doctor, had lost his previous Medicaid card, and only had two weeks'
     worth of medication left. He and his wife were getting food from a charity that would bring supplies to the
     encampment, but they had no cell phone and no transportation, and public transportation did not serve the area.
     Gene stated to me, "It's so nice to come here to the hospital. It's warm and they give me a bed and food for the
     night, and everyone is so nice to me even though I'm not sick."

     I realized that Gene and his wife might be making frequent visits to the hospital because their basic physical needs
     were not being met outside of the hospital, and this was the only way to access some of them. I notified the on-call
     case manager of my concerns. Prior to discharge, a social worker helped Gene and his wife complete their Medicaid
     application and connected them with the local community services office. The community service office would help

Gene and his wife apply for assistance with food (SNAP benefits), housing, and to receive access to low or no-cost
medical and mental health care. They arranged for a free transportation service to take Gene and his wife across
town to a homeless shelter. Gene was discharged with these resources and no longer made frequent visits to our
emergency department.

Work Accommodations and Transportation
Clients with mental health disorders may also need employment or work accommodations. These clients need to be
informed of their rights regarding discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act and/or the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973. Under these laws, clients who qualify may request an extended leave of absence, flexible work/break
schedules or start times, work/break environment with reduced distractions or noise, telework, regular feedback,
written directions and/or task lists, and/or use of a job coach. While these accommodations can be requested and
granted, stigma remains a significant concern in the workplace, and it often prevents employers from considering
options and exceptions that assist individuals to maintain employment.

There are several community resources for workers with mental health-related disabilities. Disability-specific
nonprofit organizations specialize in supporting individuals with job placement services, support groups, and
training programs. Job training programs can provide training in skills that are in demand in the job market, such as
computer skills or customer service skills. Disability employment services are often offered through state or local
government agencies and can provide job placement services, vocational training, and other types of support for
individuals with disabilities. Additionally, there are disability-friendly employers who specifically seek out individuals
with disabilities for employment opportunities. These employers are committed to expanding their applicant pool
toward a diverse workplace and have accommodations in place for individuals with mental health-related
disabilities.

Transportation, or the lack thereof, can be a significant barrier to mental health treatment or services. Clients with
mental health illnesses may require the support of another person to drive them to appointments or to pick up
medications, while others may be too anxious to drive themselves. Sometimes, a client cannot get to the treatment
location or to the pharmacy for medications. Depending on where the client lives, public transportation may or may
not be an option. Even when public transportation is an option, the client may not be able to afford the
transportation. Being familiar with other options within the community allows the nurse to help clients resolve
transportation barriers.

Social and Emotional Needs of Mental Health Clients in the Community

When seeking mental health care in the community, clients will have a range of social and emotional needs. Social
and emotional support is a crucial aspect of mental health care, particularly for clients in the community. Mental
health-care clients can face stigma, discrimination, and isolation, which contribute to feelings of loneliness, anxiety,
and depression. Social and emotional support help to alleviate these negative emotions and improve the client's
mental well-being.

The purpose of emotional support is to help clients to feel less isolated and stigmatized, and provide them with a
sense of belonging and connectedness (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2022c). Emotional support
helps clients to feel valued and appreciated, which can boost their self-esteem and self-confidence. It can also help
clients to stay motivated and engaged in their treatment, which can reduce their risk of relapse (SAMHSA, 2013).
Local and online peer support groups can offer emotional support to clients, as can public or private counseling
services. Family and friends can be an important source of emotional support for individuals with mental health
issues. They can provide a listening ear, offer encouragement and support, and help individuals access resources
and services that can support their mental health.

Clients may require support in developing coping skills to deal with some of the emotional challenges of their
mental health condition. Meditation and mindfulness workshops and seminars can provide clients with techniques
to help manage emotional distress. Therapists or support groups can offer other relaxation techniques, problem-
solving strategies, or communication skills. Participating in community activities, such as volunteer work, sports, or
hobbies, can help clients feel more connected, reduce stress, and provide a sense of purpose.

Some clients may need additional emotional support in the form of developing specific skills to regulate their
862  25 · Community Mental Health Treatment

     emotions. Emotional regulation skills are important for mental health clients because they can help reduce stress
     and improve overall function in the community. The ability to recognize, understand, and regulate one's emotions in
     a healthy and adaptive way is considered emotional regulation. Good emotional regulation leads to increased self-
     awareness, improved coping skills, better decision-making, improved relationships, and reduced risk of relapse. In
     addition to therapy and support groups, clients can also self-educate by finding resources on emotional regulation
     online or at their local library.

     The concept of empowerment is central to good mental health. Empowerment can motivate clients to take an active
     role in their treatment and recovery. The World Health Organization considers empowerment to refer to "the level of
     choice, influence and control that users of mental health services can exercise over events in their lives" (Baumann,
     2011, para 1). Empowerment means giving individuals the tools, resources, and support they need to make
     decisions, take action, and create positive change in their lives. Empowerment is essential for mental health clients
     in the community because it allows them to take control of their lives and regain a sense of agency and self-
     determination. Here are a few reasons why empowerment is important for mental health clients:

         · Increased self-efficacy: This can help them feel more confident and capable of managing their mental health
             challenges, and can lead to improved mental health outcomes.

         · Increased engagement: When people feel empowered, they are more likely to engage in their treatment and
             take an active role in managing their mental health.

         · Increased sense of control: Empowerment can help people regain a sense of control and agency, which can
             lead to increased feelings of autonomy, independence, and self-esteem.

         · Reduced stigma: Empowerment can help reduce the stigma surrounding mental health by encouraging people
             to speak up and advocate for themselves. This can lead to increased awareness, understanding, and
             acceptance of mental health issues in the community.

     For mental health-care clients, it can also be critical in supporting recovery and wellness for them to feel a sense of
     social belonging, which is the feeling of being connected to and valued by others. This connection can come from a
     variety of sources, including family, friends, peers, and community groups. When individuals feel like they belong,
     they are more likely to experience positive emotions, have a sense of purpose, and feel supported in times of stress
     or challenge. A sense of social belonging can help combat isolation and loneliness, improve self-esteem, and
     increase motivation. A sense of social belonging can also provide emotional support, practical assistance, and
     advice or guidance from others in the community who have shared similar experiences (U.S. Department of Health
     and Human Services, 2021a). Community resources, such as social clubs, art classes, sports teams, or other
     activities, can provide opportunities for clients to connect with others and engage in activities they enjoy. By
     providing a supportive, nonjudgmental, and empowering environment, mental health professionals can help clients
     develop the skills and resources they need to manage their condition and lead fulfilling lives.

safety. Whether community or treatment setting, a projected outcome of care for all community-based programs is
for clients to maintain that important social bond with others that is so important to good mental health.

Community Services: Community Programs

Community services programs include support groups, home visiting services, and school-based programs.
Diagnosis and age of the client can determine which program or programs are right for the client and their family.
See 5.3 Community Support Systems for an in-depth discussion of community-based support groups.

Home Visiting Services
A nursing-related home visiting service represents a valuable approach to providing mental health care that is
personalized, convenient, and tailored to the client's needs within the comfort of their own home environment.
Home visiting nurses offer a range of specialized services to individuals with mental health concerns, promoting
early intervention, treatment adherence, and overall well-being.

Home visiting nurses play a vital role in assessing clients' mental health status, identifying potential risks, and
developing personalized care plans. They collaborate with other health-care professionals to ensure a holistic
approach, addressing both the physical and emotional aspects of client care needs. These nurses provide education
on coping strategies, medication management, and lifestyle modifications that can positively impact mental health.
Importantly, home visiting services offer a level of convenience that traditional clinical settings may not, facilitating
consistent engagement and reducing barriers that might stop clients from seeking care.

By providing care in a safe and familiar environment, nurses establish a foundation of trust that can lead to more
open and honest discussions about mental health concerns. This approach is particularly valuable for vulnerable
populations, such as older adults, new parents, and individuals with chronic illnesses, who may be at greater risk for
mental health challenges.

Home visiting nurses also offer vital support for family members and caregivers, providing education and guidance
on how to effectively assist and support individuals with mental health conditions. This collaborative approach
fosters a comprehensive support network that extends beyond the individual, enhancing their overall quality of life.

Home visiting services can be particularly helpful in identifying and assisting with behavioral health issues in young
children (Child Welfare Information Gateway, 2021). Home visiting programs focus on building social and emotional
competence in young children and their parents. These programs typically provide early intervention services in
family homes and prevention efforts to improve overall mental health outcomes for children and their families.

School-Based Programs
Youth and adolescents receive much of their mental health support in schools. Studies have shown that the
availability of comprehensive school mental health programs has a positive effect on students' academic success as
well as their social skills, leadership, and self-awareness. By helping to create a favorable learning environment that
enables students to be successful in school and in the community, schools with collaborative, community-based
partnerships also demonstrate improved attendance and graduation rates (Youth.gov, n.d.-a). Depending on the
school, resources can include early interventions, counseling, nursing, educational workshops for students, teacher
education, and referrals to outside professionals.

Some students may need an individualized education program (IEP) to support their learning. IEPs are created by
a multidisciplinary team for any public school student aged three to twenty-one with a qualifying disability, including
emotional or behavioral disorders or developmental delays. The team includes the student's parent or legal
guardian, general and special education teachers, a school system representative, and often other specialists, such
as social workers, nurses, physicians, or others. IEPs are tailored to the individual students' needs and are designed
to provide them with the appropriate resources to obtain a free public education. The plan is evaluated and updated
regularly and the student usually joins the IEP team at age fourteen to give their own input. Services provided for a
student with an IEP include specially designed or modified instruction, supplementary aids and services, parental or
professional involvement, or classroom accommodations.

     QSEN Competency: Client-Centered Care

     Definition: The nurse will recognize the importance of treating clients as partners in their health-care journey,
     promoting their autonomy, and ensuring their values and needs are at the center of decision-making.

     Knowledge: The nurse will be able to utilize evidence-based screening tools to identify adolescents at risk for
     suicide. The nurse will understand the epidemiology, risk, and protective factors associated with suicide in the
     adolescent population.

     Skill: The nurse will administer a validated suicide screening tool in the school setting to identify adolescents at risk
     for suicide. The nurse will establish rapport and trust with the adolescents to engage and participate in the
     screening. The nurse will collaborate with team members to conduct appropriate assessment and interventions for
     adolescents who screen at risk.

     Attitude: The nurse will demonstrate empathy and compassion for adolescents who may be at risk for suicide. The
     nurse will provide for privacy and maintain confidentiality at all times, respect diversity and support cultural
     differences in a professional manner, and focus on the adolescent and incorporate them in the decision-making.

     (QSEN Institute, n.d.)

     Community Services: Treatment Setting Programs

     Treatment setting programs in mental health care refer to stays in acute hospital or residential settings where
     clients receive intensive mental health treatment and support within their community. These programs are designed
     to provide a safe and supportive environment for individuals experiencing acute mental health symptoms or crises
     while allowing them to benefit from remaining in their own community. See Therapeutic Settings for additional
     details.

     Identifying the Appropriate Services

     There are several factors to consider when determining if community or treatment setting mental health care is
     more appropriate for a client. Safety is the key determining factor, as is using the least restrictive setting to maintain
     the client's safety. Clients at risk for self-harm or harm to others would likely be admitted to a hospital treatment
     setting until stabilized.

     As always, the first step is a thorough assessment that will help identify the client's current mood, symptoms, and
     level of functioning, as well as their goals and preferences for care. Nurses should try to familiarize themselves with
     the various mental health resources available in the client's community, and encourage the client to research
     options as well. Consider reaching out to case management, or contact the public health services in the client's
     community for assistance in locating information on crisis lines, support groups, treatment settings, private therapy,
     and more. Information should also be available online, or at the local public library.

     When developing the plan of care for the client and determining the appropriate services, it is always important to
     collaborate with the client on their own preferences and advocate for them to receive timely, appropriate care. The
     focus should be client-family centered and include the interprofessional team to provide the most realistic,
     attainable, and appropriate treatment plan.

Workforce reentry programs are critical in the realm of rehabilitation and individual empowerment. These programs
span the gaps between periods of absence--be it due to mental health treatment, substance misuse recovery,
incarceration, or some combination of these--and successful integration back into the workforce. Each type of
program, whether focused on vocational training, counseling, education, or other specialized approaches, addresses
the unique challenges faced by individuals in their journey toward reentry. By recognizing the diverse needs and
circumstances of these clients, these programs offer tailored pathways that lead not only to financial stability but
also to personal growth, restored dignity, and a renewed sense of purpose. This intricate network of programs brings
reintegration to life, enabling individuals to regain control and contributing to a safer, more supportive community
for all.

Workforce Reentry Programs Defined

A workforce reentry program is a structured initiative designed to support individuals as they transition back into
the workforce after a period of absence, often due to circumstances, such as mental health treatment, substance
misuse recovery, or incarceration. These programs aim to address the unique challenges faced by participants
during reintegration, which can include gaps in job skills, stigma associated with their absence, and the need for
specialized support.

According to NAMI (2024), the incarcerated population in the United States has a significantly higher rate of
individuals with a history of mental illness and/or substance use disorders, making this group especially vulnerable
after their release. Nearly two in five members of the incarcerated population has a history of mental illness, twice
the average rate in the United States (NAMI, 2024). The vast majority of the incarcerated population will be released
and face reentry into society, a period that is often stressful and filled with risk for these clients who may experience
loss of resources, stigma, and relapse. Most workforce reentry programs are designed with the post-incarceration
population in mind.

Workforce reentry programs provide a range of services, including vocational counseling, skills training, job
placement assistance, workplace accommodations, and ongoing support. The goal is to empower participants to
regain financial independence, build self-esteem, develop job-related skills, and overcome the stigma often
associated with mental health conditions. By promoting recovery, improving overall well-being, and fostering a
supportive work environment, these programs play a crucial role in enhancing the quality of life for mental health
clients while contributing to their successful reentry into the workforce and society.

Purpose of Workforce Reentry Programs
Workforce reentry programs aim to address the complex challenges individuals face as they strive to reintegrate into
society, rebuild their lives, and secure stable employment. These programs serve as a crucial bridge to successful
reintegration, recognizing that the path to recovery, rehabilitation, and reentry is intertwined with gaining
meaningful employment.

The primary purpose of these programs is to break the cycle of recidivism by providing participants with the
necessary tools, skills, and support to overcome the unique barriers they encounter. Mental health and substance
misuse diagnoses often contribute to a range of challenges, including low self-esteem, lack of employable skills,
social stigma, and a history of criminal activity. Workforce reentry programs aim to mitigate these obstacles by
offering counseling, therapy, skill-building workshops, vocational training, and more, tailored to the individual needs
of participants.

By providing participants with access to education, training, and job placement opportunities, these programs foster
a sense of self-worth and dignity, allowing participants to redefine themselves beyond their past mistakes or
struggles. Additionally, workforce reentry programs enhance public safety by assisting reintegration into society
where gainful employment provides a positive and productive alternative to criminal activity.

Furthermore, employment is not only a means of financial stability, but also a source of purpose, routine, and social
connection. By addressing mental health and substance use issues alongside vocational goals, workforce reentry
programs aim to holistically heal and empower participants, allowing them to reenter society as productive, capable
individuals with the potential to lead fulfilling lives.

The overall purpose of workforce reentry programs for individuals with a mental health or substance misuse
diagnosis post-incarceration is to break down barriers, promote rehabilitation, and provide a structured pathway to
866  25 · Community Mental Health Treatment

     sustainable employment. By addressing the complex interplay of factors that contribute to reintegration challenges,
     these programs play a vital role in fostering personal transformation, reducing recidivism, and supporting the overall
     well-being of participants.

     Types of Workforce Reentry Programs
     Workforce reentry programs come in various forms, each tailored to address different needs and challenges
     individuals may face when reintegrating into the workforce. Here are some common types of workforce reentry
     programs:

         · Vocational rehabilitation programs: These programs provide comprehensive support to individuals with
             mental health conditions to help them develop job-related skills, identify suitable career paths, and secure
             employment. Vocational rehabilitation services may include vocational assessments, job training, résumé
             building, interview coaching, and job placement assistance. Job Corps is an example of this type of program; it
             is for young people, ages sixteen to twenty-four, who want to participate in no-cost vocational training (U.S.
             Department of Labor, n.d.-a).

         · Supported employment programs: Supported employment programs offer ongoing assistance and guidance
             for individuals with mental health challenges as they search for and maintain employment. These programs
             provide job coaches or employment specialists who work closely with participants and employers to ensure a
             smooth transition and successful integration into the workplace. Examples of such programs include the
             Mental Health and Addiction Services Supported Employment Project and Division of Substance Abuse and
             Mental Health Supported Employment Transformation Project (SETP) (SAMHSA, 2022c).

         · Transitional employment programs: Transitional employment programs offer temporary work placements with
             the goal of helping individuals build confidence, work habits, and skills. These placements can serve as
             stepping stones to more permanent employment and provide valuable experience to enhance participants'
             résumés.

         · Peer support programs: Peer support programs connect individuals with peers who have successfully
             navigated their own mental health or substance use challenges and returned to the workforce. Peer mentors
             provide guidance, share their experiences, and offer emotional support, fostering a sense of hope and
             connection.

         · Education and training programs: Some workforce reentry programs focus on education and skill
             enhancement through workshops, classes, and training sessions. These programs equip participants with the
             necessary skills for a particular field or trade, increasing their employability and confidence.

         · Job placement services: Job placement services assist participants in identifying job opportunities that align
             with their skills, interests, and limitations. These programs may have established partnerships with employers
             who are open to hiring individuals with mental health conditions.

         · Customized employment programs: Customized employment programs create tailored job positions to match
             the strengths and preferences of individuals with mental health or substance use challenges. These programs
             work closely with employers to design roles that accommodate participants' abilities and support their
             success.

         · Entrepreneurship and self-employment programs: Some individuals may choose to explore entrepreneurship
             or self-employment opportunities. These programs offer training and support for starting and managing small
             businesses, allowing participants to work at their own pace and on their terms.

         · Mental health integration programs: These programs incorporate mental health support into the workplace
             environment. They provide resources for employees and employers to foster understanding, reduce stigma,
             and promote a supportive atmosphere for individuals with mental health conditions.

         · Continuing education and lifelong learning programs: For individuals who want to further their education or
             explore new interests, these programs offer access to adult education, higher education, and lifelong learning
             opportunities to enhance career prospects and personal growth.

     The types of programs available can vary in their focus, intensity, and duration, ensuring that individuals can find the
     support that best suits their needs and goals.

These programs require a combination of financial support, personnel, and access to specialized services to
effectively address the complex needs of this population. Funding and resources for these programs typically come
from a combination of government and private sources.

    · Government grants: Federal, state, and local government agencies often provide grants to support workforce
        development initiatives, including those targeting individuals with mental health or substance misuse
        diagnoses post-incarceration. The U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Justice Assistance, Office of Justice
        Programs, and U.S. Department of Justice are common sources of such grants.

    · Nonprofit organizations: Nonprofits that focus on criminal justice reform, mental health advocacy, and
        substance misuse treatment may offer funding and resources to support workforce reentry programs. These
        organizations often prioritize initiatives that promote rehabilitation, reduce recidivism, and enhance
        community reintegration.

    · Community foundations: Local community foundations and charitable organizations may allocate funds to
        support workforce reentry programs that directly benefit the community by providing employment
        opportunities and addressing mental health or substance use issues. The Salvation Army and Goodwill
        Industries International are examples of such foundations.

    · Corporate partnerships: Some companies are committed to social responsibility and invest in workforce
        development initiatives. Partnerships with such companies can provide financial support, job placement
        opportunities, and mentorship programs for program participants.

    · Vocational training providers: Vocational schools, community colleges, and training institutions may

        records, mental health conditions, or substance misuse histories may offer support in the form of funding,
        resources, and expertise.

    · Social service agencies: Collaborating with local social service agencies can create access to housing
        assistance, childcare services, and other resources that support participants' stability and successful reentry.

Benefits and Challenges to Workforce Reentry Programs

Workforce reentry programs offer a range of advantages for individuals seeking to rejoin the workforce after periods
of absence. These programs provide valuable skills training, reduce the likelihood of relapse into criminal activities,
and contribute to community reintegration. By helping participants secure stable employment, workforce reentry
programs promote financial independence and reduce the strain on public assistance programs. Challenges, such as
addressing skill gaps, combating stigma, coordinating comprehensive support services, ensuring sustainable
funding, and aligning job opportunities with participants' backgrounds and aspirations are important considerations
868  25 · Community Mental Health Treatment

     in ensuring the overall effectiveness and impact of these programs.

     Benefits
     Workforce reentry programs encompass a spectrum of benefits that profoundly impact individuals navigating their
     reintegration into the workforce. Beyond the immediate goal of employment, these programs offer a holistic support
     system that addresses multifaceted challenges. Skill development and educational initiatives equip participants
     with tangible knowledge, augmenting their employability and cultivating a renewed sense of achievement.
     Importantly, workforce reentry programs play a pivotal role in bolstering self-esteem and confidence, catalyzing
     personal empowerment, and enhancing self-worth.

     By integrating mental health support services, these programs empower participants with adaptive coping
     mechanisms, bolstered resilience, and effective strategies for managing underlying mental health challenges.
     Participants in reentry programs benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy to change antisocial thinking and
     increase problem-solving ability.

     The reentering individual learns to examine attitudes related to previous antisocial behavior and develop respect for
     the rights of others. The experience of successful workforce reentry fosters a sense of belonging and renewed social
     connections within their communities. These programs also serve as catalysts for reducing recidivism rates among
     individuals who are recently released from incarceration. They help provide stability and guidance through a time of
     stress and transition for these clients.

     Challenges
     Implementing workforce reentry programs can come with a range of challenges. These hurdles can significantly
     impact both clients and program administrators and require comprehensive strategies to mitigate their effects. One
     central challenge involves addressing skill gaps, as participants' time away from the workforce can result in a
     misalignment of their abilities with contemporary job requirements.

     Combating the stigma and discrimination faced by individuals with histories of mental illness, substance misuse, or
     incarceration is another significant obstacle, demanding strategies to educate employers and reshape perceptions.
     Integrating mental health and substance misuse support alongside employment objectives requires a well-
     coordinated and holistic approach. The availability of job opportunities that accommodate participants' unique
     circumstances can be limited, further highlighting the need for creative solutions to enhance their employability and
     broaden their career prospects.

     Truly comprehensive workforce reentry programs include support services, such as counseling, housing assistance,
     childcare, and transportation. These support services are essential to clients' overall stability and wellness but are
     resource intensive. Sustainability remains an ongoing challenge, necessitating continued funding, community
     engagement, and adaptation to dynamic job market trends. A customized approach to accommodate the individual
     challenges and goals of each client is best and requires a personalized and flexible program framework. Addressing
     the practical aspects of reentry, from obtaining identification documents to reconnecting with social networks,
     poses further complexities. Effectively addressing all of these multifaceted challenges demands a collaborative
     effort among clients, nurses, governmental bodies, nonprofit organizations, mental health professionals, employers,
     and community stakeholders to ensure the success and lasting impact of workforce reentry programs.

     Engaging employers within the framework of workforce reentry programs presents a particularly complex set of
     challenges. These challenges stem from a range of factors that influence employers' perceptions, decisions, and
     willingness to participate in such initiatives. One of the most significant obstacles is the persistent stigma and biases
     associated with hiring individuals with nontraditional backgrounds.

     Additionally, employers often conduct risk assessments, considering potential liabilities and disruptions that
     individuals with complex histories might bring. This caution can impede their readiness to collaborate with
     workforce reentry programs (U.S. Department of Labor, n.d.-b). Limited awareness among employers about the
     benefits and achievements of these programs also contributes to their reluctance. The absence of adequate
     resources within certain businesses, especially smaller ones, for accommodating unique needs like mental health
     support or reentry coaching further compounds the challenge.

     Communication gaps between workforce reentry programs and employers can create problems with successful
     placements because misunderstandings about participants' skill sets, strengths, and potential arise. Employers

might question whether the acquired skills align with their industry needs or whether clients will be able to
seamlessly integrate into their work environments. Concerns about long-term retention and the stability of
individuals with complex histories can also impact employers' decisions, due to preconceived negative ideas about
persons with criminal convictions.

Overcoming these challenges requires multifaceted strategies, including ongoing employer education about the
benefits of hiring individuals from diverse backgrounds. Highlighting success stories to demonstrate the positive
outcomes of workforce reentry programs can further sway employers toward active engagement. Additionally,
tailored outreach efforts, incentives for hiring program participants, and consistent support for both employers and
participants can foster collaboration. The U.S. Department of Labor offers grants and programs, such as the Federal
Bonding Program, to encourage employers to embrace reentry. The Federal Bonding Program assists employers in
purchasing liability insurance to help remove the risks of hiring previously incarcerated or other challenged job
seekers whose backgrounds may pose significant barriers to securing or retaining employment.

Nursing Involvement with Workforce Reentry Programs

Nursing plays a pivotal role in workforce reentry programs, contributing a unique blend of clinical expertise and
compassionate support to individuals navigating the challenges of returning to employment after periods of
absence. As advocates for holistic well-being, nurses offer vital contributions to these programs by addressing
participants' physical and mental health needs, ensuring seamless coordination of care, and fostering an
environment of understanding and encouragement. Through their skills in health assessment, counseling, and
collaboration with interdisciplinary teams, nurses play a vital role in enhancing participants' overall success and
well-being during their reintegration journey.

Interventions and Needs
Nursing interventions play a pivotal role in the success of workplace reentry programs for individuals with mental
health conditions. Here is a list of potential nursing interventions for nurses working with clients involved in these
programs:

    · Health assessment: Conduct comprehensive health assessments to identify any physical or mental health
        issues that might impact clients' ability to engage in employment. Address any immediate health concerns,
        and develop strategies for ongoing health management.

    · Medication management: Collaborate with health-care providers to ensure proper medication management,
        monitor potential side effects, and address any medication-related concerns that might affect participants'
        work performance.

    · Counseling and support: Provide individual and group counseling sessions to address participants' emotional
        and psychological needs. Offer coping strategies, stress management techniques, and emotional support to
        enhance their readiness for employment.

    · Wellness education: Offer education on various aspects of wellness, including stress reduction, nutrition,
        exercise, and sleep hygiene, to promote participants' overall well-being. Educate participants on self-care
        practices to maintain their mental and physical well-being while managing the demands of work and reentry.

    · Substance misuse education: Deliver education on substance misuse prevention, relapse prevention
        strategies, and resources available for clients struggling with substance misuse issues.

    · Crisis intervention: Be prepared to provide immediate crisis intervention and support in case participants
        experience setbacks or relapses during their reentry process.

    · Collaboration with mental health professionals: Collaborate with other mental health professionals to ensure
        a comprehensive approach to clients' mental health needs.

    · Stigma reduction: Educate clients and employers about mental health and substance use challenges, working
        to reduce stigma and misconceptions that might affect clients' employment prospects.

    · Referrals and resource navigation: Assist participants in accessing community resources, such as housing
        assistance, childcare services, and support groups, to address various barriers to reentry.

    · Workplace accommodations: Collaborate with employers to recommend workplace accommodations, if
        necessary, to support participants' mental health needs and ensure a successful work experience.

    · Health monitoring and follow-up: Provide ongoing health monitoring and follow-up appointments to assess
        participants' progress, address any emerging health concerns, and offer continued support.

    · Conflict resolution skills: Offer training in conflict resolution and communication skills, helping participants
870  25 · Community Mental Health Treatment

             effectively navigate workplace interactions and challenges.

     Community Collaboration
     Nursing and community collaboration within the context of workforce reentry programs helps reintegration efforts.
     Nurses act as liaisons, connecting participants with community-based services, such as mental health counseling,
     substance misuse support groups, housing assistance, and vocational training opportunities. Their clinical insights
     enable them to identify participants' unique needs and provide holistic care that addresses both physical and
     mental health concerns.

     Community organizations offer a range of supplementary resources that reinforce the efforts of workforce reentry
     programs, such as job placement agencies, legal assistance, and financial counseling. This teamwork enables
     clients to receive a comprehensive support system that extends beyond health care to encompass social, economic,
     and emotional aspects crucial for successful reintegration. The collaboration also contributes to destigmatizing
     mental health problems, fostering a more inclusive environment that encourages participation and acceptance.
     Ultimately, nursing and community collaboration in workforce reentry programs facilitates a holistic approach that
     empowers individuals to overcome barriers, enhance their well-being, and secure a meaningful place in both the
     workforce and society.

Summary

25.1 Identifying Varying Types of Care

Community-based mental health services help to improve the overall mental health and well-being of communities.
Community mental health offers services that vary according to the needs of the individual client. These needs can
be affected by such factors as age, socioeconomic status, or severity of illness and include counseling, therapy,
medication management, day programs, residential services, crisis programs, and more. Nurses should assess their
clients thoroughly to determine their needs and preferences and develop a treatment plan that best integrates the
two.

25.2 Community Needs

The mental health client in a community environment will have both physical and social-emotional needs that have
to be addressed in a holistic manner. Physical needs include secure housing, health care, food, transportation, and
potential work accommodations. Social-emotional needs are important as well and include emotional support,
social belonging, empowerment, and coping and emotional regulation skills. The nurse should help the client
develop a care plan that takes into account their own particular physical and social-emotional needs and available
community resources in order to achieve the best results possible.

25.3 Programming in Community and Treatment Settings

The goal of community-based programs is to offer a safe, nonjudgmental space for individuals to share their
experiences, connect with others who have similar experiences, and receive emotional support within their own
communities. The goal of treatment setting programs is to provide a safe and supportive environment for individuals
experiencing acute or severe mental health symptoms. Evaluating the appropriateness of using either a community-
based program or a more secure treatment setting program entails a thorough nursing assessment and a treatment
plan that respects the client's individual needs and preferences and prioritizes safety.

25.4 Workforce Reentry Programs

A workforce reentry program is a structured initiative designed to support individuals as they transition back into the
workforce after a period of absence. Some of the challenges faced by workforce reentry programs include
overcoming stigma and bias, navigating participants' skill gaps and the fast-changing job market, coordinating
comprehensive support services, such as mental health care and housing assistance, securing sustainable funding,
and fostering collaboration with employers. Benefits of these programs include providing individuals with the
opportunity to acquire new skills, secure stable employment, reduce recidivism rates, and achieve financial
independence, ultimately fostering community reintegration and economic growth. The psychiatric-mental health
nurse can support workforce reentry programs to benefit clients by conducting thorough mental health
assessments, implementing evidence-based interventions, collaborating with community resources to provide
holistic support, and offering tailored coping strategies and skills development.

Ryan, a forty-five-year-old male, presents to the community health clinic with complaints of persistent sadness,
sleep disturbances, and a decline in social interactions. His medical history reveals a past diagnosis of major
depressive disorder, managed with intermittent community therapy. Vital signs are blood pressure of 115/80
mmHg, heart rate of 93 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and temperature of 98.4°F (37°C). Ryan
reports a recent exacerbation of depressive symptoms, including difficulty concentrating and a sense of
hopelessness. He describes challenges in maintaining employment and strained relationships with family and
friends. He mentions intermittent suicidal thoughts but denies any current intent. Ryan has a history of limited
success with traditional community therapy and expresses openness to exploring alternative mental health-care
options.

CHAPTER OUTLINE
26.1 Barriers to Recovery
26.2 The Anti-psychiatry Movement
26.3 Users Groups
INTRODUCTION Recovery from mental illness is often a prolonged and complex journey, significantly challenged
by access and adherence to treatment. These obstacles include stigma and discrimination, limited geographic
access to services, a shortage of health-care professionals, financial constraints, insufficient support, and
nonadherence to treatment protocols. Despite these complications, the integration of adjunctive treatments
alongside conventional methods can enhance recovery outcomes and foster greater treatment compliance.
Nurses play a crucial role in this integrative approach to care. Nurses in collaboration with other health-care
professionals contribute to the implementation of adjunctive treatments. Their responsibilities in this context
encompass a range of activities, including client education, monitoring treatment adherence, providing emotional
support, and facilitating access to various therapeutic interventions. Nurses are often the primary point of contact
for clients, which positions them uniquely to assess client needs, offer guidance on managing side effects, and
advocate for individualized care plans that incorporate adjunctive therapies. These therapies might include
psychotherapy, lifestyle modifications, and complementary therapies, all of which can be instrumental in addressing
the holistic needs of individuals with mental illness. By actively participating in the delivery of adjunctive treatments,
nurses can help reduce the barriers to recovery and promote a more comprehensive, client-centered approach to
mental health care that improves overall client outcomes and quality of life (Mongelli et al., 2020).

     26.1 Barriers to Recovery

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Recognize barriers to recovery from mental illness
         · Discuss adjunctive treatments for recovery
         · Explain the nurse's role in adjunctive treatment

     Many factors can hinder the recovery process for individuals with mental illness. One significant barrier is stigma,
     which refers to the negative attitudes, beliefs, and stereotypes associated with mental health conditions. Stigma can
     lead to discrimination, social isolation, and reduced access to health-care services, impeding individuals from
     seeking help and adhering to treatment. Lack of access to quality mental health care, including shortages of mental
     health professionals, particularly in certain geographic regions, limited availability of specialized services, and
     financial constraints pose additional barriers. Systemic barriers also exist, such as inadequate insurance coverage,
     fragmented health-care systems, and long waiting periods for treatment that can further slow the recovery journey.
     Personal factors like low self-esteem, poor self-efficacy, and lack of social support likewise can impede recovery.
     Nurses must remain aware of the influence of culture and religion on health-care decisions. Recognizing and
     addressing these barriers and factors is crucial for promoting recovery and improving the overall well-being of
     individuals with mental illness.

     Challenges in Recovery

     Primary care is often the initial access to mental health treatment and therefore plays a pivotal role in the provision
     of mental health services. Several challenges exist that complicate the effective and efficient delivery of these
     services. One of the main challenges is the underdiagnosis of mental health issues in primary care settings. Primary
     care practitioners may not have the necessary knowledge and skills to recognize and treat complex mental health
     issues. Additionally, time constraints and high client load can lead to mental health concerns being overlooked or
     minimized (Ng et al., 2020).

     Another challenge lies within the referral system to secondary mental health services, which means specialist care
     or hospital admission. Fragmented health-care systems can complicate the process of referring clients, with often
     long waiting times for specialized services and gaps in communication between primary and secondary care
     providers (Evans-Lacko et al., 2018). This fragmentation creates access issues for clients in need of the services. It
     is the responsibility of the primary care practitioner to understand and properly refer the client with mental health
     concerns to the appropriate provider.

     The stigma associated with mental illness also poses a barrier to care and can lead to clients not seeking or
     adhering to mental health treatments. Despite significant progress, many clients may still feel uncomfortable
     discussing mental health issues in a primary care setting or may fear the potential implications of a mental health
     referral (Thornicroft et al., 2016).

     Lack of Compliance
     Client compliance, also called adherence, is a critical factor in mental health-care treatment success, yet it presents
     a significant challenge in the management of mental illnesses. Nonadherence to psychiatric treatment has been
     estimated to be as high as 50 percent (Malik et al., 2020). Various factors can contribute to this issue, including the
     complexity of treatment regimes, medication side effects, lack of client insight into their illness, and poor
     therapeutic relationships with care providers (Malik et al., 2020).

     The negative impact of nonadherence on treatment outcomes, including relapses and hospitalizations, adds to the
     complexity and costs of managing mental health conditions (Velligan et al., 2017). Strategies to improve adherence
     can be multifaceted, encompassing client education, treatment simplification, side effects management,
     therapeutic collaboration enhancement, and stigma reduction programs (Velligan et al., 2017).

     Residual Symptoms, Side Effects, and Stigma
     Psychiatric medications are pivotal in managing mental illnesses but may not entirely alleviate symptoms. Some
     individuals may experience residual symptoms while adhering to their medication regimen. Such residual
     symptoms, including persistent depressive mood, anxiety, cognitive deficits, and insomnia, can severely affect an

26.1 · Barriers to Recovery                                                                                              881

individual's quality of life and functionality (Semahegn et al., 2020) and can lead to clients discontinuing treatment.

Medication side effects are another significant concern in psychiatric treatment, often contributing to residual
symptomatology. These side effects may include metabolic changes, sexual dysfunction, or neurological effects,
which can compound individuals' challenges with mental health conditions (Montejo et al., 2018).

The stigma associated with taking psychiatric medications can exacerbate these challenges. Many individuals feel
societal pressure and self-stigma associated with the need for psychiatric medication, which can lead to feelings of
inadequacy, shame, and isolation. This stigma can have far-reaching consequences, impacting adherence to
medication, social relationships, self-esteem, and overall treatment outcomes (Malik et al., 2020). Stigma
associated with mental illness is a pervasive issue that has manifested in various ways across societies. Historically,
mental illness has been misunderstood, leading to fear, misconceptions, and negative attitudes toward those
experiencing mental health challenges. This stigma manifests in society through discrimination, social exclusion,
and harmful stereotypes, which can impede individuals' willingness to seek help and receive appropriate care.
Stigma exists due to a combination of factors, including lack of education, cultural beliefs, and media portrayals that
often depict mental illness inaccurately or negatively (Subu et al., 2021).

In a cultural context, the perception and impact of stigma vary widely. Different cultures have unique beliefs and
attitudes toward mental health, which influence how individuals perceive and respond to mental illness.
Understanding these cultural considerations is essential for health-care providers, particularly nurses, who are often
at the forefront of client care and advocacy. Nurses must be aware of the cultural nuances that influence their
clients' experiences of stigma and tailor their approach to care accordingly. Culturally sensitive care involves
acknowledging and respecting clients' beliefs, values, and experiences, and engaging in open, nonjudgmental
communication to build trust and rapport (Ahad et al., 2023).

A more holistic approach to mental health care can help mitigate symptoms and stigma. Such an approach includes
medication management, psychoeducation, psychotherapy, addressing lifestyle factors, and reducing perceived
shame in securing treatment for mental health conditions. It also involves close collaboration between clients,
health-care providers, and caregivers in shared decision-making processes (Laranjeira et al., 2023).

        CULTURAL CONTEXT

Cultural Considerations in Mental Health Recovery and Adjunct Treatment

Cultural factors play a significant role in shaping the experiences and perceptions of individuals in mental health
recovery and receiving adjunct treatments. Understanding these cultural nuances is crucial for health-care providers
to deliver effective and compassionate care:

    · Beliefs and attitudes toward mental illness: Different cultures have distinct beliefs about mental illness,
        influencing how individuals perceive and respond to mental health challenges. For example, some cultures
        may view mental illness as a spiritual or moral issue, while others might see it as a medical condition.
        Recognizing and respecting these beliefs is essential in providing culturally sensitive care.

    · Stigma and discrimination: Stigma surrounding mental illness varies across cultures and can significantly
        impact a person's willingness to seek help and adhere to treatment. In some cultures, mental illness may be
        heavily stigmatized, leading to social exclusion and discrimination. Health-care providers need to be aware of
        these cultural dynamics and work to reduce stigma in their interactions with clients.

    · Communication styles: Cultural differences in communication styles can affect how clients express their
        symptoms and concerns. Providers should be attentive to nonverbal cues and understand the cultural context
        of verbal communication. Open, empathetic, and nonjudgmental communication is crucial in building trust
        with clients from diverse cultural backgrounds.

    · Family and community involvement: In many cultures, family and community play a central role in supporting
        individuals with mental illness. Understanding the client's family dynamics and community resources can
        enhance treatment plans and recovery outcomes. Involving family members in care planning and education
        can also improve treatment adherence and support.

    · Holistic and integrative approaches: Different cultures may have unique approaches to health and healing that
882  26 · Adjuncts to Treatments

             can complement conventional mental health treatments. Traditional healing practices, herbal remedies, and
             spiritual interventions may be integral to the client's belief system and can be considered in adjunctive
             treatment plans, where appropriate.
         · Language and interpretation services: Language barriers can impede effective communication and
             understanding between health-care providers and clients. Providing access to interpretation services and
             culturally appropriate educational materials is crucial for ensuring that clients fully comprehend their
             treatment options and can make informed decisions.

     Health-care providers must continually strive to develop culturally sensitive care, which involves understanding and
     respecting cultural differences, engaging in continuous learning about diverse cultures, and applying this knowledge
     in clinical practice (Stubbe, 2020).

     Access to Care and Need for Support
     Despite the high prevalence and profound impact of mental health disorders, access to mental health care remains
     a significant challenge globally. Barriers to accessing care can be multifaceted, encompassing systemic issues, such
     as insufficient mental health resources, geographical distance from services, long wait times, and high costs,
     especially in regions with limited public health coverage (Werlen et al., 2020). Marginalized groups, including racial
     and ethnic minorities, low-income populations, and individuals in rural areas, face additional challenges in accessing
     mental health care due to systemic disparities (Subu et al., 2021).

     Client support is integral to overcoming these barriers and improving mental health outcomes. Support can take
     many forms, such as providing client education, promoting mental health literacy, fostering a supportive therapeutic
     alliance, and engaging in shared decision-making (Aoki et al., 2022). Peer support groups can also be beneficial,
     cost-effective, and accessible, providing an environment of mutual understanding and empathy, sharing personal
     experiences and coping strategies, and reducing feelings of isolation (Bellamy et al., 2020).

     Nurses play a crucial role in addressing systemic barriers to mental health care by advocating for policy reform,
     access to affordable services, and the reduction of stigma and discrimination associated with mental illness
     (Thornicroft et al., 2016). Nurses can influence mental health policy by participating in professional organizations,
     engaging with policymakers, and contributing to public discourse on mental health issues. For example, they can
     advocate for increased funding for mental health services, integration of mental health care into primary care
     settings, and policies that support evidence-based practices (Anders, 2021). Nurses can advocate for policies that
     ensure access to affordable mental health care for all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status. This
     includes supporting the expansion of insurance coverage for mental health services and advocating for enhanced
     mental health services in health-care coverage (Flaubert et al., 2021). Nurses can also help combat stigma
     associated with mental illness through education, community outreach, and by modeling compassionate,
     nonjudgmental care. They can also participate in public awareness campaigns and collaborate with advocacy groups
     to challenge myths and misconceptions about mental illness (Borenstein, 2020).

     Ease of access to mental health care is a crucial factor in ensuring effective treatment and recovery. Several services
     and resources have been developed to address physical barriers to accessing mental health care. Telehealth
     services have emerged as a vital tool in providing mental health care, especially in areas with limited access to
     mental health professionals. Telehealth involves the use of telecommunications technologies to deliver health-
     related services and information. It allows clients to receive therapy, counseling, and psychiatric services remotely,
     which can be particularly beneficial for those living in rural or underserved areas (Gajarawala & Pelkowski, 2021).
     Moreover, community-based mental health services are designed to be more accessible and less stigmatizing than
     traditional psychiatric settings. These services often include community clinics, day treatment programs, peer
     support groups, and crisis intervention teams. Community-based services focus on providing comprehensive care
     tailored to the individual's needs within their community, promoting recovery and integration into society (Singh et
     al., 2022). The internet also offers a wealth of online resources for mental health support, including informational
     websites, online support groups, and mental health apps. These resources can provide education, self-help tools,
     and peer support, making mental health information and support more accessible to a broader audience. Online
     resources can be particularly useful for individuals who are hesitant to seek face-to-face therapy or who prefer
     anonymity (Wong et al., 2018).

Adjunctive Modalities

Traditional treatment modalities for mental health conditions include psychotherapy and medication. Psychotherapy
is a cornerstone in the treatment of mental illness, often used in conjunction with pharmacological interventions for
optimal outcomes (Cook et al., 2017). This therapeutic approach involves talking with a mental health professional
to understand and manage mental health conditions, with various types of psychotherapy suited to different mental
disorders (American Psychological Association [APA], 2021). In mental health care, adjunctive treatments
comprise a range of alternative treatments designed to enhance the impact of primary treatments, improving overall
mental health outcomes (Lake, 2022). Some of these modalities include mindfulness-based therapies, biofeedback,
art therapy, music therapy, animal-assisted therapy, and yoga (de Bruin et al., 2016).

For instance, mindfulness-based therapies have been shown to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety and
improve quality of life (Bhattacharya & Hofmann, 2023). Similarly, studies have found biofeedback to be effective in
managing stress and anxiety disorders by giving clients a greater awareness of their physiological functions (Yu et
al., 2018). Biofeedback is a therapeutic technique used in mental health care that involves training individuals to
improve their health by controlling certain physiological processes that are typically involuntary, such as heart rate,
muscle tension, blood pressure, skin temperature, and brain wave activity. In mental health care, biofeedback is
used to help clients learn how to regulate their body's responses to stress, anxiety, and other emotional states. By
becoming aware of their physiological responses and learning techniques to control them, clients can develop better
coping mechanisms for managing symptoms of various mental health conditions (Mayo Clinic, 2019).

Creative therapies, such as art and music therapy, can offer a nonverbal outlet for emotions and aid in expressing
and exploring feelings. Engaging in music and art therapy can provide emotional expression, stress relief, and
cognitive benefits. These therapies are used to help individuals cope with trauma and improve mental health
(Shukla et al., 2022). Research has demonstrated that combining these adjunctive modalities with standard
treatment approaches can result in more effective and holistic care, potentially leading to better client satisfaction,
increased compliance, and improved therapeutic outcomes (Lake, 2022).

Nutrition and Activity
Nutrition and physical activity play significant roles in the treatment of mental illnesses and are often incorporated
into comprehensive treatment plans. Certain nutritional supplements, including omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, and
B vitamins, have been found to have positive effects on mood and cognitive function. A balanced diet rich in fruits,
vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can also contribute to better mental health (Firth et al., 2020).

Physical activity likewise is a well-established adjunctive treatment for mental illnesses. Regular exercise has been
shown to reduce symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress and improve cognitive function (Mahindru et al.,
2023). For instance, aerobic exercises, such as jogging, cycling, or swimming, have been found to stimulate the
release of endorphins, serotonin, and norepinephrine, which can enhance mood and overall well-being (Basso &
Suzuki, 2017). Yoga, which combines physical postures, breathing exercises, and meditation, has been shown to
reduce symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It promotes relaxation,
mindfulness, and overall well-being (Laplaud et al., 2023).

Integrating nutritional counseling and physical activity interventions into mental health treatment plans can benefit
clients and improve outcomes. These approaches should be personalized to each individual's needs and abilities
and should be used as additions to standard mental health treatments (Grajek et al., 2022). Quality sleep is also
essential for mental health. Poor sleep can exacerbate mental health conditions, while good sleep hygiene can
improve mood and cognitive function (Scott et al., 2021).

Behavioral, Peer, and Group Therapy
Behavioral therapy is a general term for treatment wherein the client partners with helping others to raise personal
awareness of problematic behaviors. The goal of behavioral therapy, such as CBT, is to work toward further
understanding and, ultimately, to modify the thoughts and feelings that drive the unwanted actions. Overall, the use
of behavioral therapy in mental health treatment can be highly effective, but the specific modality and approach
should be tailored to the individual's needs and specific mental health condition (APA, 2021).

Peer therapy is a valuable adjunct treatment for mental illness, offering unique benefits that complement individual
therapy and medication. Peer therapy involves support from individuals who have lived experience with mental
884  26 · Adjuncts to Treatments

     illness, providing empathy, understanding, and practical advice based on personal experience. Peer therapy has
     been shown to enhance self-efficacy, empowerment, and engagement in the recovery process. It provides an
     opportunity for individuals to share coping strategies and learn from others' experiences in a nonjudgmental setting
     (Shalaby & Agyapong, 2020).

     Group therapy, on the other hand, typically involves a trained therapist leading a group of individuals who share
     similar mental health challenges. Group therapy offers the benefits of shared experiences, peer support, and the
     opportunity to develop social skills in a safe environment. It can be particularly effective for conditions such as
     depression, anxiety disorders, and substance misuse because it allows individuals to see how others deal with
     similar challenges and to receive feedback on their own experiences. Both forms of therapy foster a sense of
     community and support, helping individuals feel less isolated in their experiences (Malhotra & Baker, 2022).

             CLINICAL SAFETY AND PROCEDURES (QSEN)

     QSEN in Adjunctive Treatments for Mental Illness

     Quality and Safety Education for Nurses (QSEN) underscores the importance of providing safe, effective, client-
     centered, timely, efficient, and equitable care. In the context of adjunctive treatments for mental illness, the
     following considerations should be taken into account:

         · Client-centered care: It is crucial to respect the clients' unique experiences, values, and preferences.
             Collaborate with clients in developing their treatment plans, including adjunctive therapies, such as
             psychoeducation, cognitive behavioral techniques, or nutritional and physical interventions.

         · Teamwork and collaboration: Nurses should actively communicate and collaborate with the multidisciplinary
             team. This collaboration ensures comprehensive care, incorporating the perspectives of psychiatrists,
             psychologists, occupational therapists, social workers, and dietitians.

         · Evidence-based practice: Decisions about adjunctive treatments should be based on the best available
             evidence, clinical expertise, and client preferences. Stay informed about the latest research on the efficacy
             and safety of adjunctive therapies.

         · Quality improvement: Regularly evaluate client outcomes and processes to identify areas of improvement.
             Use this information to refine treatment plans and protocols, aiming to enhance the safety and effectiveness
             of adjunctive treatments.

         · Safety: Regularly assess clients for any risks or adverse effects related to adjunctive treatments. Monitor for
             any worsening symptoms, suicidal ideations, or adverse reactions to treatments. Maintain a safe and
             therapeutic environment.

         · Informatics: Leverage health information technology to support client care, decision-making, and
             communication among the health-care team. Electronic health records can provide timely access to
             comprehensive client information, enhance coordination of care, and support monitoring client progress.

     The Nurse's Role in Adjunctive Treatments

     The nurse's role in mental health treatment, particularly adjunctive modalities, is multifaceted and integral to
     comprehensive care. As trained health professionals, with respect to adjunctive treatments, nurses can provide
     psychosocial interventions, client education, and care coordination (Hurley et al., 2022). For instance, nurses can
     facilitate treatment delivery during CBT by reinforcing the skills taught in therapy sessions, providing support, and
     encouraging adherence to homework assignments (Tanoue et al., 2018). Nurses may also lead psychoeducational
     sessions, providing clients and families with crucial information about the nature of mental illness, medication
     management, and coping strategies (Matsuda & Kohno, 2021). Additionally, nurses may teach about the risks
     associated with nonadherence to treatments, and how to manage crises.

     Nurses assist with complementary interventions, such as mindfulness-based therapies, physical activity programs,
     and nutritional counseling. They may guide clients through relaxation exercises, assist in developing an exercise
     regimen, or provide dietary advice to improve overall wellness. Through these roles, nurses enhance the
     effectiveness of adjunctive treatments for mental illness, contributing to better client outcomes (Ee et al., 2020).
     Nurses also play a critical role in risk avoidance during adjunctive treatments for mental illness, ensuring that clients

26.2 · The Anti-psychiatry Movement                                                                                     885

are safe and well cared for. One of the key responsibilities of nurses is the ongoing assessment and monitoring of
clients. Nurses must be vigilant in detecting any signs of adverse reactions to adjunctive treatments or changes in a
client's mental status and promptly reporting these to the treating physician. They also monitor for suicidal or self-
harm ideations, which could be exacerbated by certain mental health conditions, ensuring that preventive measures
are taken, and the treatment team is promptly notified (Nawaz et al., 2021).

26.2 The Anti-psychiatry Movement

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Discuss controversy about the practice of psychiatry and the DSM
    · Identify calls for treatment/medical diagnostic framework reform
    · Explain the nursing implications of the anti-psychiatry movement

The anti-psychiatry movement is a political/social movement and intellectual phenomenon that emerged in the
1960s as a public response to perceived injustices and inadequacies within the traditional psychiatric system. The
movement, heavily influenced by figures such as R.D. Laing, Thomas Szasz, Franco Basaglia, Theodore Lidz, and
Michel Foucault, questions the legitimacy of psychiatric diagnoses, the effectiveness of psychiatric medications and
treatments, and the overall influence of psychiatry on society (Desai, 2005). It raises ethical concerns around
involuntary commitment, restraints, and forced medication, asserting that these practices can infringe upon
individuals' basic human rights (Benning, 2016). While the anti-psychiatry movement has faced criticism for its
radical perspectives, it has also inspired meaningful changes, such as enhanced client rights and the shift toward
more humane, client-centered care in psychiatric practice (Kritsotaki, 2021).

Controversy Over Standard Psychiatry/Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)

The anti-psychiatry movement has been a significant critic of standard psychiatry, particularly as embodied in the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). The DSM, the authoritative guide for diagnosing
mental disorders used by clinicians and researchers, has faced extensive criticism and calls for reform. Critics argue
that the manual's categorical approach, which classifies mental disorders based on symptom clusters, inadequately
represents the complexities and nuances of mental health. There are concerns about the reliability of diagnoses, the
validity of diagnostic categories, and the potential for overdiagnosis and pathologizing of normal human behaviors
(Fritscher, 2023). The movement has leveled criticism regarding the influence of the pharmaceutical industry on the
development of the manual. In light of these concerns, there is a growing advocacy for a multidimensional model of
mental disorders. This model proposes viewing mental health conditions on a continuum, rather than as distinct
categories, to capture the range and severity of symptoms better. Additionally, proponents of this model suggest
greater transparency in the DSM development process, ensuring that diagnoses are based more on empirical
evidence and less on external influences (Bredström, 2017).

Critique of Standard Psychiatry from the Anti-Psychiatry Movement
Anti-psychiatry critics like Thomas Szasz argue that the medical model of mental illness, which conceptualizes
these conditions as diseases to be diagnosed and treated, is fundamentally flawed (Benning, 2016). The movement
asserts that this perspective oversimplifies complex human experiences and emotions by categorizing them into
symptom-based diagnoses. Further, critics like R.D. Laing suggest that such an approach can invalidate clients'
experiences and may neglect the sociocultural contexts contributing to mental distress (Cooper, 2017). Anti-
psychiatry also critiques the emphasis on pharmacological treatments, arguing that they can potentially result in
overmedication and neglect alternative therapeutic options (Desai, 2005). Critics express concerns over the
potential for coercive practices in psychiatry, such as forced medication or involuntary commitment, which they
perceive as infringing on individual freedoms (Chieze et al., 2021).

     Consumer/Social Scientist Perspective
     The critique of traditional psychiatry has also been taken on by a consumer/social scientist perspective. These
     groups advocate for increased client rights, consideration of sociocultural factors, and individualized, holistic
     treatment approaches (Murray, 2014). Consumers often emphasize lived experience as a vital aspect of
     understanding and treating mental illness, something that the anti-psychiatry movement champions (Sunkel &
     Sartor, 2022). Social scientists, particularly sociologists, view the movement as highlighting the sociocultural
     construction of mental illness, underscoring the importance of understanding mental health within the context of
     social norms, power dynamics, and societal structures. They argue that constructing behaviors as illness
     emphasizes the potential negative impacts of labeling and stigmatization (Borelle, 2017). Although these
     perspectives affirm the importance of the issues raised by the anti-psychiatry movement, they also recognize the
     need for a balanced approach that appreciates the value of medical interventions when appropriate (Desai, 2005).

     Social Control/Cultural Aspects
     Mental health diagnoses and treatments are deeply intertwined with societal norms, cultural beliefs, and power
     dynamics in a given context (Ahad et al., 2023). The process of psychiatric diagnosis can act as a form of social
     control by medicalizing behaviors and experiences that deviate from societal norms, thereby reinforcing those
     norms (Telles-Correia et al., 2018). This is especially apparent in the historical inclusion of certain behaviors and
     identities as diseases. For example, homosexuality was once classified as a mental disorder in the DSM; it was
     removed in 1973 in response to evolving societal norms and scientific understanding (Drescher, 2015).

     Cultural factors shape perception, diagnosis, and treatment of mental illnesses as well. Different cultures and
     societal groups have varying concepts of mental illness and how it should be treated. The Church of Scientology, for
     instance, has been a prominent and controversial force in the anti-psychiatry movement. The Church's founder, L.
     Ron Hubbard, was a vocal critic of psychiatry, viewing it as a corrupt, coercive, and harmful institution (Kent &
     Manca, 2014). The Church developed initiatives like the Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR), a
     Scientology-affiliated organization that campaigns against perceived abuses in psychiatric practice (CCHR, 2023).
     The Church's criticisms echo broader anti-psychiatry sentiments about the medicalization of human distress,
     coercive treatments, and the dehumanization of clients (Kent & Manca, 2014). Nevertheless, the Church's
     involvement in the anti-psychiatry movement is contentious. Some argue that it reflects the Church's self-interest,
     given that Hubbard also founded Dianetics, a system that presents an alternative to psychiatry (Kent & Manca,
     2014). The Church's role in the anti-psychiatry movement illustrates how diverse groups can take up the critique of
     psychiatry for various motives (Benning, 2016).

     Relationship with the Pharmaceutical Industry
     The relationship between the anti-psychiatry movement and the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by deep
     tension. A significant concern within the anti-psychiatry movement is the medicalization--the process by which
     mental health issues are framed and treated primarily as medical conditions--of mental health and the consequent
     emphasis on pharmacological treatments. Many critics argue that medicalization benefits the pharmaceutical
     industry at the expense of client rights and freedoms (Ivanov & Schwartz, 2021). This perspective emphasizes
     biological and physiological explanations for mental disorders and often prioritizes pharmacological treatments over
     other forms of therapy. Medicalization can include categorizing various behaviors, emotions, and psychological
     states as medical problems that require treatment, often with medication (Fergusson et al., 2023).

     Critics point to the close ties between the pharmaceutical industry and psychiatry, including financial relationships,
     which they argue may lead to conflicts of interest and potentially biased research outcomes. The anti-psychiatry
     movement also emphasizes the potential harms of psychiatric medications, such as side effects and withdrawal
     symptoms, arguing that the industry, with its pharmaceutical-focus approach, downplays or overlooks them
     (Cosgrove et al., 2014).

     While the anti-psychiatry movement raises important critiques, it is important to note that pharmacological
     treatment can be beneficial and even lifesaving for many individuals. Balancing these critiques with the real needs
     of clients represents a critical challenge within mental health care (Stein et al., 2022).

        PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Key Positions Embraced by the Anti-psychiatry Movement

The anti-psychiatry movement follows several specific beliefs regarding mental health treatment:

    · Individual autonomy: The anti-psychiatry movement places great importance on respecting the autonomy of
        individuals diagnosed with mental health disorders. It critiques the paternalistic tendencies of some
        psychiatric approaches, where the clinician's authority may overshadow the client's voice and self-
        determination.

    · De-medicalization of human experiences: Advocates point out that some experiences labeled as pathological
        by psychiatry may instead be natural responses to stressors or social injustices. They question the boundary
        between normal and pathological, suggesting that psychiatry can medicalize human experiences and
        emotions.

    · Stigma and identity: Anti-psychiatry proponents assert that psychiatric labels can contribute to stigma,
        affecting a person's self-perception and societal identity. They argue that these labels may lead to internalized
        shame and societal discrimination.

    · Role of societal power dynamics: The movement often underscores how prevailing societal norms and power
        structures can influence psychiatry. For instance, it has critiqued how certain behaviors are pathologized due
        to cultural bias or social control rather than evidence of dysfunction.

    · Trauma-informed perspectives: Anti-psychiatry advocates emphasize the importance of acknowledging and
        addressing trauma's impact on mental health, often overlooked in traditional psychiatric models.

Potential impacts of the movement:

    · Clinical practice and policies: The anti-psychiatry critique has led to a shift in some areas of mental health
        practice and policy, promoting greater client involvement, a focus on recovery-oriented models, and increased
        trauma-informed care.

    · Consumer/survivor movement: Anti-psychiatry has inspired a broader consumer/survivor/ex-client
        movement, advocating for the rights and voices of people diagnosed with mental health conditions.

    · Paradigm shift: Some professionals advocate for a paradigm shift in mental health care from the disease
        model to a psychosocial model that recognizes the complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social
        factors in mental health.

Challenges of the movement:

    · Potential neglect of biological factors: Some argue that the anti-psychiatry movement's emphasis on social
        and psychological factors might lead to an underappreciation of biological aspects of mental health disorders.

    · Risk of discrediting psychiatry: Some worry that anti-psychiatry sentiments may discourage individuals from
        seeking necessary psychiatric care or erode public trust in mental health professionals.

    · Absolutism: There is a risk of adopting an overly dogmatic stance. The medical and psychosocial models can
        provide valuable insights into mental health, and a balance of perspectives may be necessary.

Calls for Treatment/Medical Diagnostic Framework Reform

The DSM-5-TR is the latest edition of what has been the primary diagnostic guide for mental health professionals
since its first edition in 1952. Criticisms of the manual have prompted significant calls for reform in the medical
diagnostic framework for mental illness. Critics assert that the manual's approach is too categorical, neglecting the
often complex and nuanced presentation of mental illness (Stein et al., 2022).

The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) introduced the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework,
marking a shift toward a multidimensional approach in understanding mental health. This framework recognizes the
complex interaction of genetic, neurobiological, and environmental factors in the development of mental disorders.
Unlike traditional diagnostic systems that categorize mental illnesses, RDoC focuses on identifying disrupted brain
processes and behaviors as the basis for understanding mental illness. According to Böttger et al. (2023), this
approach is considered by some to provide a more accurate representation of the underlying pathophysiology of
888  26 · Adjuncts to Treatments

     mental health conditions, offering a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of these disorders.

     Nonetheless, this model also faces criticism. This highlights the need for a balanced, biopsychosocial approach in
     the future development of the medical diagnostic framework. It is clear from the critics, however, that the time has
     arrived for treatment reform in mental health care. Implementation of a more comprehensive and inclusive
     diagnostic model could lead to improved client outcomes, increased understanding of mental illnesses, and reduced
     stigma (Stein et al., 2022).

     Nursing Implications of the Anti-Psychiatry Movement

     The anti-psychiatry movement has influenced nursing practice considerably, particularly in the mental health field.
     This movement fundamentally questions the legitimacy of psychiatric diagnosis and treatment, advocating instead
     for understanding mental health issues as human experiences rather than pathological disorders (Benning, 2016).
     This perspective has significantly influenced the nursing profession in several ways. It has promoted a more holistic
     and client-centered approach to care. Instead of solely focusing on symptoms and diagnoses, nurses are now
     encouraged to consider their clients' lived experiences, personal narratives, and sociocultural contexts (Flaubert et
     al., 2021). This shift has been instrumental in developing therapeutic communication skills and fostering empathy in
     nurse-client relationships.

     The anti-psychiatry movement also promoted a shift toward deinstitutionalization and community-based care. This
     impacts nursing practice as nurses increasingly deliver care in outpatient settings and in the community, requiring
     them to adapt their skills to diverse environments and work more closely with clients' social networks (Fulone et al.,
     2021).

     While the movement has contributed to positive changes, it also presents challenges. Nurses must grapple with the
     tension between medical models of mental illness, which emphasize biological factors and medication, and anti-
     psychiatry perspectives, which reject these models. This balancing act requires continual professional development
     and reflection on practice. The anti-psychiatry movement encourages a holistic, empathetic, and community-
     focused approach to care, but it also presents ongoing challenges as nurses collaborate with other professionals
     and navigate the complexities of mental health care.

     The anti-psychiatry movement emphasizes the importance of addressing the holistic needs of clients, including their
     psychological, social, and spiritual well-being. Nurses should be aware of the broader context of clients' lives and
     the various factors that contribute to their mental health.

             REAL RN STORIES

     Nurse: Zander, RN
     Years in Practice: Eight years
     Clinical Setting: Private psychiatric hospital
     Geographic Location: New York City

     When I first started working as a psych nurse, I was assigned to a great unit with a strong educational focus. I
     became good friends with Ruth, a nurse many years my senior, and some of her stories made me laugh, and some
     almost made me cry. One time in particular, we had just admitted a young adult from the streets who was fiercely
     opposed to being hospitalized and definitely opposed to taking any of the medication ordered for schizophrenia. I
     was annoyed when the client refused the meds especially after I did such a good job teaching. Ruth invited me to
     lunch, and we had a conversation about the differences between Ruth's time and mine. Ruth told me that in "her
     day" the nurses were never told the client's diagnosis and were just expected to keep them occupied and attend to
     their needs on the unit. She said that even though the nurses never knew what was "wrong" with the clients, nursing
     care was focused on the relationship, which Ruth looks back on as a good thing. This was one of those times when
     Ruth's story almost made me cry.

     Validation as an Approach in Nursing Care
     An empathetic and holistic approach to care, validation therapy emphasizes understanding and respect for the
     client's subjective experiences, particularly effective when working with individuals with neurocognitive disorders.

     Access for free at openstax.org
26.2 · The Anti-psychiatry Movement                                                                                     889

This client-centered therapy uses validation, empathy, and active listening to connect with people in the late stages
of life, often those living with cognitive impairments, to enhance their well-being and dignity (Fertalova & Ondriova,
2019).

In nursing practice, validation therapy guides nurses to view behaviors not as symptoms to be controlled, but rather
as a form of communication. A client experiencing a mental health issue may be trying to communicate an unmet
need or express discomfort. Instead of correcting or reorienting the client to reality, the validation approach
suggests understanding the person's perspective and validating their feelings (Scales et al., 2018).

The impact of this approach is twofold: it can help reduce stress and anxiety in the client and it builds stronger
connections between the client and the nurse. It encourages nurses to become less judgmental, to listen deeply,
and to respond to context and emotions rather than the literal statements made by the client (Hartley et al., 2020).
Research indicates that validation therapy can improve the quality of life for people with dementia, decreasing
negative behaviors and increasing positive emotions (Scales et al., 2018).

Safety and Crisis Intervention
The anti-psychiatry movement has led to a reevaluation of crisis intervention strategies, emphasizing the need for
consent and autonomy in care. Proponents argue for the reduction of involuntary treatments and the
implementation of alternatives, such as peer support, community-based services, and crisis intervention teams that
prioritize de-escalation and voluntary cooperation (Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, 2024). These approaches
align with the principles of trauma-informed care, which acknowledge the impact of trauma on mental health and
strive to create services that are compassionate and non-retraumatizing (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment,
2019).

The movement has underscored the importance of considering the social determinants of mental health, such as
poverty, discrimination, and social isolation, in crisis intervention. This broader perspective encourages
interventions that not only address immediate mental health crises, but also work toward systemic changes to
prevent such crises from occurring (Kirkbride et al., 2024). The anti-psychiatry movement has significantly
influenced safety and crisis intervention strategies in mental health care. By advocating for client autonomy, less
coercive practices, and a holistic view of mental health, it has contributed to the development of more ethical and
effective approaches to crisis intervention. It also presents challenges in balancing client rights with the need for
safety in situations of acute risk, however. Future research and policy development must continue to navigate these
complexities to improve mental health-care outcomes (Johnson et al., 2022).

Client Education and Advocacy
The anti-psychiatry movement has played a significant role in advancing client education and advocacy within
mental health care. Central to the movement is the belief in the autonomy and rights of individuals experiencing
mental health challenges. This perspective has led to an emphasis on informed consent, the democratization of the
therapeutic relationship, and the empowerment of clients through education and self-advocacy (Dalal, 2020).
Education is essential for dispelling the myths and stereotypes about mental health disorders that often fuel stigma
and discrimination (Ahad et al., 2023). Client education, from the anti-psychiatry viewpoint, involves providing
individuals with comprehensive information about their diagnoses, treatment options (including potential risks and
benefits), and the sociopolitical context of mental health care. This approach supports individuals in making
informed decisions about their care, fostering a sense of agency and participation in their treatment process. The
movement advocates for transparency and honesty in the psychiatric system, encouraging practices that inform
clients about the nonmedical aspects of their conditions, such as the impact of social determinants on mental
health and the potential for recovery outside traditional psychiatric interventions (Paterick et al., 2017).

Advocacy involves championing the rights and interests of individuals with mental health conditions. It seeks to
foster societal change, ensuring fair treatment and equal opportunities for this group. Both education and advocacy
facilitate the transformation of mental health care toward a more holistic, compassionate approach that respects
the autonomy and dignity of individuals. As integral parts of the anti-psychiatry movement, they empower
individuals to actively participate in mental health care, understanding all their options, rather than be passive
treatment recipients (Saha, 2021).

Staff Education on the Perspective of the Client
Educating staff on the perspective of mentally ill clients is crucial to enhancing the quality of care provided. This
890  26 · Adjuncts to Treatments

     involves adopting a client-centered approach that focuses on understanding individuals' lived experiences and
     perspectives (Flaubert et al., 2021). Understanding the client's perspective is vital in promoting empathy and
     reducing stigma among mental health professionals. Such understanding can also help professionals better
     comprehend clients' needs and preferences, thus guiding the development of individualized treatment plans
     (Phelan et al., 2023).

     Self-examination of bias by staff in mental health care is a critical aspect of providing equitable and effective
     treatment to diverse client populations. Bias, whether conscious or unconscious, can significantly impact the quality
     of care provided, affecting diagnosis, treatment decisions, client interaction, and overall client outcomes.
     Recognizing and addressing these biases is essential for improving mental health services and ensuring that all
     individuals receive compassionate and appropriate care, regardless of their background, identity, or circumstances
     (Gopal et al., 2021).

       CLINICAL JUDGMENT MEASUREMENT MODEL

       Generating Solutions: Understanding the Client's Perspective

       The client is reluctant to attend groups on the unit or accept any medications. The client's background and
       culture are very different from those of the nurse.

       Nursing knowledge is required to appreciate the client's perspective and generate a solution. The nurse takes a
       client-centered approach, focused on empathy. The nurse engages in self-reflection to identify personal bias
       that may influence the nurse-client relationship. The nurse uses these approaches to contextualize the client's
       avoidance of treatments and to consider interventions that may align more with the client's belief system.

     Training programs like Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) and peer-support models aim to create a more
     compassionate and empathetic approach toward mental illness by fostering an understanding of the client's
     perspective (Edgar & Connaughton, 2021). Educating staff on the perspective of the mentally ill client through
     programs such as MHFA is a cornerstone of effective, compassionate, and person-centered care in mental health
     services. Other areas of education opportunities may be during annual skills training sessions and in-service
     opportunities within health-care facilities.

     26.3 Users Groups

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the development of user groups
         · List online communities and support groups for clients and families
         · Select credible databases from nursing forums and professional organizations
         · Understand the use of informatics and technology innovation in nursing practice

     In mental health care, user groups refer to structured gatherings of individuals who share common experiences
     related to mental health issues. Such groups are often organized around specific conditions, such as depression,
     anxiety, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia. These groups commonly include people living with mental health
     conditions, their families, and sometimes mental health professionals.

     User groups are vital in providing peer support, a critical component of comprehensive mental health care. They
     offer an environment where individuals can share personal experiences and coping strategies and offer mutual
     encouragement. The peer-led approach can help destigmatize mental health and empower individuals to participate
     in their care actively. Moreover, users can contribute to service design and policy formulation within each given
     group. Including user perspectives helps ensure that mental health services are responsive to the needs of the
     people they serve (Fortuna et al., 2022).

     The Development of User Groups

     The development of user groups in mental health care has evolved over several decades, with roots in the broader
     mental health recovery movement. Beginning in the 1970s and 1980s, a time of deinstitutionalization, those with
     lived experience of mental illness began to challenge the dominant medical model of mental health care, advocating

26.3 · Users Groups                                                                                                       891

for greater control and participation in their treatment (Davidson, 2016). By the 1990s, these advocacy efforts
crystallized into the formation of organized user groups. These groups, typically composed of individuals living with
mental health conditions, began to play a more active role in care and in development of mental health policy. They
demanded a shift from paternalistic models of care to more collaborative, person-centered approaches (Davidson,
2016).

Over time, user groups have significantly influenced the shape and content of mental health-care services. Their
advocacy has led to increased recognition of the value of peer support and the incorporation of recovery-oriented
practices into mainstream mental health care. These practices emphasize individual strengths, self-determination,
and the potential for recovery, even in serious mental illness (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration [SAMHSA], 2021).

Anti-psychiatry sentiment has likely been instrumental in the development and proliferation of advocacy groups and
peer support networks. These organizations work to protect the rights of mental health clients, challenge stigma,
and promote alternatives to conventional psychiatric treatments. They provide platforms for individuals to share
their experiences, offer mutual support, and collectively advocate for changes in mental health policy and practice
(Castillo et al., 2019). An example of a platform is the Hearing Voices Network, which emphasizes self-
determination and critiques the overreliance on medication and involuntary treatments in mental health care (Higgs,
2020).

In the twenty-first century, user groups have significantly evolved, adapting to the digital age with innovative
approaches to gathering, sharing, and utilizing health information. This transformation is largely attributed to
advancements in technology, which have expanded the reach of these groups and enhanced their ability to access
digital health information. User groups, including clients, health-care professionals, and students, now rely on a
wide array of digital tools, such as health apps, online forums, social media platforms, and electronic health records
(EHRs), to facilitate communication, support, education, and the management of health information (Vos et al.,
2020). These digital platforms have fostered an environment of collaboration and peer support, enabling individuals
to share experiences, seek advice, and gain insights into various health issues. Online platforms and forms of social
media have further facilitated the creation of virtual user groups, allowing individuals from diverse locations to share
experiences, provide mutual support, and advocate for change in mental health care (Naslund et al., 2016). The
rapid adoption of digital health information technologies does, however, raise concerns regarding data privacy,
security, quality and reliability, and the digital divide, indicating a need for ongoing evaluation and regulation to
ensure equitable access and protection of user data (Mumtaz et al., 2023).

The Need for User Groups
User groups in mental health care play a crucial role in supporting individuals experiencing mental health issues and
shaping the direction of mental health services. These groups are important from various perspectives. From an
individual perspective, user groups provide an essential platform for peer support, allowing individuals to share
personal experiences, coping strategies, and receive mutual and empathetic understanding from others who have
similar experiences (Naslund et al., 2016). Studies have shown that participation in user groups can lead to
improved self-esteem, enhanced coping skills, and reduced symptoms of mental distress (Shalaby & Agyapong,
2020).

From a community perspective, user groups can play a crucial role in reducing the stigma associated with mental
health disorders by promoting awareness and understanding. They offer a collective voice that can challenge
misconceptions and discriminatory practices (Naslund et al., 2016).

From a systems perspective, user groups can contribute to service design and policy development. They provide
invaluable insights based on lived experiences that can help tailor services better to meet the needs of those with
mental health conditions. User groups have driven a more recovery-oriented approach to mental health care,
prioritizing individual strengths and self-determination (Fortuna et al., 2022).

The International Dimension of Users Groups
The importance and impact of user groups in mental health care extends beyond national borders. Globally, the
recovery and peer support movements have influenced mental health-care systems, emphasizing the importance of
lived experience in developing effective treatments and policies (Sunkel & Sartor, 2022). These groups contribute to
mental health policy development, often supported by international organizations, such as the World Health
892  26 · Adjuncts to Treatments

     Organization (WHO) (Semrau et al., 2019). The World Federation for Mental Health (https://openstax.org/r/
     77WrldFedMtlHlt) has advocated for and facilitated the formation of user groups, emphasizing their importance in
     achieving human rights-based approaches to mental health.

     The advent of digital technology has further internationalized user groups, enabling the formation of online
     communities that cross geographic boundaries. This development has been particularly valuable for individuals in
     regions where mental health services are limited or stigmatized (Naslund et al., 2017). In many low- and middle-
     income countries, user groups have played a crucial role in filling these mental health service provision gaps,
     offering peer support and advocacy in environments often plagued by limited resources and stigma.

     Despite this progress, challenges remain. Ensuring that diverse voices within user groups are heard, combating
     stigma, and securing sustainable funding are ongoing international concerns (Semrau et al., 2019).

     Online Resources for Users

     Digital technology has facilitated the emergence of many online resources for user groups in mental health care.
     These platforms provide virtual spaces for individuals to connect with others, share experiences, and access
     support, often overcoming geographical boundaries and time constraints inherent in traditional, face-to-face groups
     (Strand et al., 2020). For example, the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) offers numerous online
     community resources, including discussion groups and educational programs, catering to individuals with mental
     health conditions and their families (NAMI, 2023). Similarly, Mental Health America (MHA) has developed online
     resources, including screening tools, information about mental health conditions, and a platform connecting
     individuals to peer communities and professional assistance (MHA, 2023).

     Local support groups can also be found on these sites:

         · Mental Health America (https://openstax.org/r/77MentalHlthAm)
         · Anxiety and Depression Association of America (https://openstax.org/r/77AnxDepAssoc)
         · Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance (https://openstax.org/r/77DepBipolSupp)

     Online therapy platforms allow users to connect with licensed mental health professionals and provide the option to
     join group therapy sessions online (Markowitz et al., 2020). Mobile applications facilitate peer support and may
     provide self-help guides on various mental health topics (Alqahtani et al., 2021). The application of chatbots, or
     artificial intelligence (AI)-powered conversational agents in mental health care, has rapidly increased in recent
     years. These digital tools have the potential to provide widespread, cost-effective, and personalized mental health
     support. Chatbots can be programmed to deliver CBT techniques, which are recognized as effective for treating
     various mental health conditions, including anxiety and depression (Haque & Rubya, 2023). For example, a chatbot
     developed by researchers at Stanford University utilizes CBT strategies to help users manage their mental health
     (Fitzpatrick et al., 2017). Chatbots can be available 24/7, reducing barriers related to therapists' availability, wait
     times, and cost. This makes mental health care more accessible to those who may not otherwise seek or be able to
     afford traditional therapy services (Vaidyam et al., 2019). It is essential to recognize the limitations and potential
     risks of using chatbots in mental health care though. For instance, they may lack the ability to understand complex
     human emotions fully, fail to detect a crisis, or misinterpret the user's input. Therefore, these services should be
     viewed as a supplement to, not a replacement for, professional mental health services (Haque & Rubya, 2023). And
     while all of these online resources increase accessibility, it is important to be mindful of their challenges, such as
     concerns about privacy, variable quality of treatment and information, and the lack of in-person interaction (Naslund
     et al., 2017).

             LIFE-STAGE CONTEXT

     Digital Resources for Mental Health Care

     Different life stages can significantly differ in their use and effectiveness of digital resources for mental health care:

         · Children and adolescents: Younger individuals may be more comfortable with technology, given their digital
             nativity. Resources for this group should be designed with age-appropriate language and features. Parental
             consent, monitoring, and adherence to child data protection regulations are crucial considerations (Hollis et

     Access for free at openstax.org

        al., 2017).
    · Adults: Adults may have varying degrees of comfort with technology depending on their exposure and

        experience. Digital resources providing internet interventions (therapies delivered via web-based services)
        can be flexible and adapted to suit their lifestyles and responsibilities (Andersson et al., 2019).
    · Older adults: Seniors may face challenges using digital resources due to less familiarity with technology or
        physical limitations (e.g., visual impairment). Extra support in learning to use digital resources or adaptations
        to make them more accessible can help (Dong et al., 2023).

Credible Databases

Several credible databases offer valuable information for clinicians, researchers, clients, and caregivers concerning
mental illness:

    · PubMed (https://openstax.org/r/77PubMed), a U.S. National Library of Medicine service, contains more than
        thirty million citations for biomedical literature from MEDLINE, life science journals, and online books. It is a
        crucial resource for clinical research in all areas of medicine, including mental health (National Library of
        Medicine, 2021).

    · The Cochrane Library (https://openstax.org/r/77CochraneLibry) is a reputable database that provides high-

        CULTURAL CONTEXT

Cultural Considerations in Digital Resources

Cultural considerations are essential to ensure digital mental health resources are accessible, relevant, and effective
across diverse populations.

    · Language: Digital resources should be available in the languages spoken by the target population. Additionally,
        the content should be sensitive to cultural nuances in language use (Maar et al., 2017).

    · Cultural relevance: Consider cultural beliefs and practices regarding mental health when designing,
        recommending, and delivering digital resources. This might involve integrating culturally specific coping
        strategies or acknowledging cultural stigma around mental health.

    · Socioeconomic factors: The availability of reliable internet and technological devices can vary across cultures
        and economic contexts. Digital resource strategies must consider these disparities to avoid exacerbating
        health inequities (Maar et al., 2017).

Nursing Informatics

The integration of nursing science, computer science, and information science to manage and communicate data, or
nursing informatics, has an increasing role in mental health care. Digital tools can streamline client information,
track treatment outcomes, enhance communication among health-care professionals, and improve client care
(Edgcomb et al., 2022). Electronic health records (EHRs) are a prime example, enabling more coordinated and
client-centered care by making comprehensive health information available to all health-care professionals involved
in a client's care. For mental health nursing, EHRs can facilitate monitoring symptom progression and treatment
response over time, helping to tailor interventions to individual client needs (Kariotis et al., 2022).

Health informatics is a professional specialty in nursing (American Nurses Association [ANA], 2022) and in medicine
(Edgcomb, 2021). Use of health informatics can support analysis of population health and health risks and, due to
894  26 · Adjuncts to Treatments

     capture of real-time data along with reimbursement information, can assist development of practice guidelines
     (Edgcomb, 2021). From a psychiatric-mental health (PMH) nursing perspective, health informatics can reduce
     communication errors, systematize nursing tasks to free nurses for more client contact, and provide ready access to
     research evidence for best practice. Equally relevant to PMH nursing, informatics can help create learning systems
     for clients and communities, and optimize technology for all users (ANA, 2022).

     The nursing profession must adapt to the digital future through a multifaceted approach that encompasses
     education, practice, and policy to effectively meet the evolving demands of health-care delivery and client care.
     Nursing education should integrate digital literacy and informatics competencies into curricula to prepare nurses for
     the proficient use of EHRs, telehealth technologies, and digital health applications. This includes training in data
     management, cybersecurity, and the ethical implications of digital health to ensure that nurses are equipped to
     protect client privacy and data integrity (Booth et al., 2021).

     In clinical practice, nurses should embrace and advocate for the use of digital tools that enhance client care, such as
     remote monitoring devices, mobile health apps, and virtual care platforms, to improve access to care, client
     engagement, and health outcomes. Mobile health (mHealth) applications offer the potential for remote client
     monitoring, facilitating medication adherence, and providing psychoeducational materials (Firth et al., 2017).
     Furthermore, nurses should play an active role in the development and evaluation of digital health technologies to
     ensure they meet clinical needs and enhance the quality of care (Booth et al., 2021).

     Nursing leadership should advocate for policies that support the integration of digital health technologies in health-
     care settings, address the digital divide, and ensure equitable access to digital health resources for all clients (Booth
     et al., 2021). Additionally, ongoing professional development opportunities in digital health should be made
     available to nurses to keep pace with technological advancements and evolving health-care practices (Altmiller &
     Pepe, 2022).

     Integrating nursing informatics in mental health care comes with challenges despite its potential. Data privacy, the
     need for training among health-care professionals, and the digital divide among clients need focus in order to
     effectively leverage the benefits of nursing informatics in mental health care (Kariotis et al., 2022). The digital divide
     in health care refers to the gap between individuals who have access to digital health technologies and the internet,
     and those who do not, due to various socioeconomic, geographic, demographic, or cultural factors. This divide not
     only encompasses access to hardware, such as computers and smartphones, but also includes differences in the
     ability to use these technologies effectively to manage health information, communicate with health-care providers,
     and make informed health decisions (Saeed & Masters, 2021).

     Several factors contribute to the digital divide in health care. Economic disparities play a significant role, as
     individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds may not be able to afford the cost of digital devices or internet
     services. Geographic location is another critical factor, with rural and remote areas often facing limited access to
     high-speed internet and digital health services. Age and education also influence digital literacy, with older adults
     and those with lower levels of education less likely to engage with digital health technologies (Saeed & Masters,
     2021).

     The digital divide has significant implications for health equity, as it can exacerbate disparities in health access and
     outcomes. Individuals who are digitally disenfranchised may have less access to timely health information, online
     appointment scheduling, telehealth services, and electronic health records, potentially leading to delays in care,
     reduced client engagement, and poorer health outcomes (Turcios, 2023).

     Efforts to bridge the digital divide in health care focus on improving access to affordable high-speed internet and
     digital devices, enhancing digital literacy through education and training programs, and developing inclusive
     technologies and services that are accessible and usable by diverse populations. The introduction of the Affordable
     Connectivity Program (ACP) reflects a growing recognition of the internet as a vital utility, akin to water and
     electricity, and an essential step toward digital equity. ACP is a federal initiative designed to help ensure that
     households can afford the broadband they need for work, school, health care, and other essential services. It
     represents a continuation and expansion of the temporary Emergency Broadband Benefit (EBB) program that was
     established to provide internet access to low-income families during the COVID-19 pandemic. Under ACP, eligible
     households can receive a discount on broadband service and connected devices. This includes a monthly discount
     on broadband service and a one-time discount for the purchase of a laptop, desktop computer, or tablet from

participating providers. Eligibility for the program is based on household income or participation in other
government assistance programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicaid, Federal
Public Housing Assistance, SSI, WIC, or Lifeline, among others (Federal Communications Commission [FCC], 2021).
The ACP aims to not only provide immediate financial relief to help cover the cost of broadband services, but to also
foster long-term solutions for bridging the digital divide. By making internet access more affordable, the program
seeks to enhance opportunities for education, health-care access, employment, and social inclusion for
underserved and marginalized communities (FCC, 2021).

        PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Telehealth in Mental Health Care

Telehealth has emerged as a pivotal modality in delivering mental health care, offering an accessible, cost-effective,
and flexible solution for both providers and clients. The integration of telehealth into mental health services
facilitates timely access to care, reduces barriers related to geographical distance, and enhances client privacy and
comfort by allowing care to be received in the client's own environment (SAMHSA, 2021).

Telehealth applications in mental health care include synchronous videoconferencing for therapy sessions,
asynchronous communication for client monitoring and follow-up, and mobile health apps for self-management of
mental health conditions. These technologies support a wide range of psychiatric services, from diagnosis and
treatment to crisis intervention and long-term care management, addressing the needs of diverse client populations
including those in rural or underserved areas (Witteveen et al., 2022).

Evidence suggests that telehealth interventions can be as effective as traditional in-person therapy for many mental
health conditions, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), thereby underscoring
its potential to significantly enhance mental health-care delivery (Morland et al., 2023). Successful implementation
requires addressing challenges, such as ensuring digital literacy among clients and providers, maintaining privacy
and security of health information, and navigating varying state regulations and reimbursement policies for
telehealth services (Saeed & Masters, 2021).

Assisting clients in accessing user groups and digital resources for mental health care can significantly enhance their
care and recovery. Health-care providers, including mental health professionals and nurses, are key in this process.
Nurses can identify and recommend relevant user groups and digital resources tailored to clients' needs. By
regularly compiling and updating information on local and online user groups, professionals can provide current and
relevant resources to clients (Naslund et al., 2017).

In addition, clinicians can support clients in using these resources. For instance, they can provide guidance on how
to navigate online platforms, discern reliable information, and engage safely and effectively with online
communities. Clinicians can also help clients integrate the support and strategies they gain from these resources
into their overall treatment plan (Firth et al., 2017). Health-care systems can also facilitate access by offering clients
digital literacy training and integrating user groups and digital resources into standard care. This could involve
workshops, individual training sessions, or regularly providing clients with informational materials, such as
brochures or website tutorials (Campanozzi et al., 2023). Collaboration with user groups can further enhance
access. Regular communication between mental health professionals and user groups can help maintain a
reciprocal relationship where both parties learn from each other, ultimately benefiting the client's care (Kwame &
Petrucka, 2021).

Summary

26.1 Barriers to Recovery

Recovery from mental illness is often hindered by several barriers, including stigma and discrimination, lack of
access to care, financial constraints, and limited social support. Stigma can lead to shame and reluctance to seek
help, while financial and geographical barriers can prevent access to necessary treatments. Additionally, a lack of
understanding and support from family and community can impede recovery efforts. Adjunctive treatments are
complementary therapies used alongside traditional mental health treatments to enhance recovery outcomes.
These include lifestyle interventions (e.g., exercise, diet), holistic approaches (e.g., yoga), and peer support
programs. These treatments address various aspects of mental health and contribute to a more comprehensive
approach to recovery.

Nurses play a vital role in the implementation of adjunctive treatments for mental illness. Their responsibilities
include assessing client needs, providing education about treatment options, monitoring treatment adherence, and
offering emotional support. Nurses also act as advocates for clients, ensuring they receive comprehensive,
personalized care. By integrating adjunctive treatments into care plans, nurses can address the holistic needs of
individuals with mental illness and promote better health outcomes (Kealeboga et al., 2023).

26.2 The Anti-psychiatry Movement

The anti-psychiatry movement emerged in the 1960s as a radical critique of mainstream psychiatric practice. Its
proponents argue against the medical model of mental illness, critiquing the validity of psychiatric diagnoses, the
effectiveness and ethics of treatments, and the role of societal power dynamics in defining and treating mental
health issues. While views within the movement vary widely, common concerns involve medicalizing normal human
experiences, coercion, stigma, and dehumanization within psychiatric practice. While the anti-psychiatry movement
has sparked crucial conversations and reforms, its relationship with mainstream psychiatry remains complex.
Nurses, as frontline providers of care, play a critical role in the mental health treatment process and are therefore
uniquely positioned to integrate some of the values and perspectives of the anti-psychiatry movement into their
practice. This integration can enhance client care, promote recovery-oriented approaches, and contribute to the
transformation of mental health services to be more person-centered and less coercive. Understanding the
psychosocial considerations associated with the movement can support more nuanced conversations about mental
health, emphasizing the necessity for a comprehensive, client-centered approach (Kwame & Petrucka, 2021).

26.3 Users Groups

User groups and digital resources have become integral components of mental health care, offering numerous
benefits and potential for improving the mental health landscape. User groups can provide invaluable peer support
for individuals with mental health issues. These groups can be conducted in-person or online and offer a sense of
community, mutual understanding, and practical advice based on lived experiences. Furthermore, they can help
combat the feelings of isolation and stigma often associated with mental illness. User groups can be broadly
categorized or focused on specific mental health conditions, allowing individuals to find communities that align with
their needs.

Digital resources for mental health care include various tools and platforms, such as online databases, therapy apps,
teletherapy services, and mental health chatbots. These resources allow for greater accessibility and flexibility in
accessing mental health care and information. They can be particularly beneficial for those who face barriers to
traditional mental health services, such as geographical distance, physical disabilities, cultural stigma, or time
constraints.

User groups and digital resources provide valuable avenues of support and treatment for individuals with mental
illness. It is essential, however, that clinicians ensure that these resources are reliable, safe, and tailored to the
specific needs of the individuals using them. Integrating these resources into mental health care can complement
traditional therapy methods, promote self-management strategies, and contribute significantly to comprehensive
mental health care.

     27.1 Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Discuss the impact of the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health-care services and
             innovation

         · Describe nursing strategies for client care in a postpandemic context
         · Review nurses' mental health and self-care postpandemic

     The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the landscape of mental health care, ushering in a surge of
     mental health challenges, such as heightened anxiety, depression, and trauma-related symptoms. It has
     underscored the vital role of mental health practitioners, including psychiatric-mental health nurses, in providing
     essential support and interventions to individuals grappling with pandemic-induced mental health tribulations.
     Moreover, the pandemic has prompted a rapid transformation in mental health service delivery, with the widespread
     adoption of telehealth and innovative technological approaches to therapy. This section explores the multifaceted
     ways in which the pandemic has reshaped mental health care and highlights the resilience and adaptability of
     nurses in responding to the evolving needs of their clients amidst a global health crisis.

     Stressors and Innovation

     According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of January 21, 2024, more than 770 million COVID-19 cases
     had been reported worldwide, with more than 7 million deaths (WHO, 2024).

     As of September 2023, COVID-19 had resulted in more than 6 million hospitalizations and more than a million
     deaths in the United States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2023a). It has exacerbated
     preexisting mental health issues and introduced new ones. The isolation, fear, uncertainty, and grief associated with
     the pandemic have led to a surge in anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in individuals of
     all ages (Mortazavi et al, 2020).

     Fighting the COVID-19 pandemic required a strategy known as flattening the curve, which refers to a public health
     strategy aimed at slowing the spread of a contagious disease, like COVID-19, to ensure that the health-care system
     can manage the capacity of clients. By implementing measures, such as social distancing, mask-wearing, and
     lockdowns, the goal was to reduce the peak number of cases that intensified in a short period of time to spread
     cases out in order to protect vulnerable populations and provide appropriate health-care access. This helped keep
     hospitals from being overwhelmed and allowed them to provide adequate care to those in need, ultimately saving
     lives. Social distancing and lockdowns took a toll on the mental health of millions of people, however. In fact, the
     COVID-19 pandemic intensified feelings of fear and isolation in many people. Fear has been a pervasive emotion;
     fear of the virus itself and fear of the vaccine when it was introduced affected huge portions of the American
     population. Social isolation stemming from lockdowns, social distancing measures, and limited in-person
     interactions exacerbated feelings of loneliness and depression among mental health clients who rely on social
     support networks for their well-being.

     The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA, 2020) called attention to the potential
     for increased domestic violence due to stay-at-home orders.

     Access to care became a significant challenge as many mental health services were disrupted or shifted to virtual
     platforms, creating barriers for those without reliable internet access or suitable privacy for telehealth sessions
     (SAMHSA, 2020). SAMHSA called for health care, schools, businesses, and law enforcement to work together to
     help families and communities (2020).

     Nurses and other frontline health-care workers likewise experienced stress and burnout due to the demands of
     caring for COVID-19 clients, often witnessing high mortality rates. The COVID-19 pandemic placed immense
     pressure on nurse staffing, resulting in a surge in demand for health-care services and a shortage of qualified
     nurses. This led to extended work hours and a need for innovative strategies to recruit and retain nursing staff in
     health-care facilities (Chan et al., 2021). Access to mental health services became more critical than ever, with
     many people struggling to cope with the emotional toll of the pandemic. This prompted the rapid shift toward
     telehealth and virtual mental health services, which have played a crucial role in ensuring continued access to care
     while reducing the risk of virus transmission.

The pandemic highlighted the importance of addressing mental health as an integral part of public health.
Governments and health-care systems worldwide have recognized the significance of mental well-being during
crises and have begun to allocate more resources and funding to mental health services. Additionally, the pandemic
brought discussions surrounding mental health out of the shadows and reduced stigma. People have become more
open about their struggles, which may lead to lasting changes in how society views and supports mental health. The
pandemic has also accelerated research and innovation in mental health care, with a focus on developing new
treatments, interventions, and support systems to meet the growing demand for mental health services. While the
negative impact of COVID-19 on mental health has been significant and challenging, the pandemic has also spurred
positive changes and increased awareness about the importance of mental health care in communities.

The COVID-19 pandemic compelled psychiatric-mental health nurses to expand their skill set and adapt to new
realities in health-care delivery. The pandemic accelerated the adoption of telehealth and digital mental health
services and highlighted the need for the mental health-care providers to be prepared with alternative ways of
providing care to their clients in case of widespread emergencies. Preparedness now encompasses a broader range
of competencies, including telehealth proficiency, crisis management in a virtual context, technological literacy, and
a heightened focus on client education and support.

Since the pandemic, psychiatric-mental health nurses have increasingly utilized videoconferencing, phone calls, and
online platforms to provide remote care to clients. This innovation has expanded access to mental health services,
reaching individuals who may have previously faced barriers to in-person care, such as those in remote areas or with
transportation challenges. It has also enabled nurses to conduct assessments, provide therapy, and offer support in
a safe and socially distanced manner. Additionally, some nurses have integrated digital tools and apps into their
practice to monitor client progress, provide psychoeducation, and engage in therapeutic interventions. These
technological advancements represent a lasting transformation in mental health service delivery, but also require
certain skills in order to implement and deliver effectively.

Preparedness now includes a greater emphasis on technological literacy. Nurses became more comfortable with
digital mental health tools, apps, and online resources, and they incorporated these into their practice to support
client self-management. Nurses also played a pivotal role in educating clients about the availability and benefits of
telehealth services, helping them navigate digital platforms, and ensuring they had the necessary resources to
participate in remote sessions.

Nurses have developed new protocols for remote crisis intervention and assessing clients for signs of distress during
telehealth sessions. They have adapted their crisis management strategies to the virtual environment, ensuring that
clients in crisis continued to receive timely support. Nurses also incorporated preparedness for public health
emergencies into their practice. They learned to adapt quickly to changing circumstances, including potential
lockdowns and quarantine measures, and to ensure continuity of care for clients under challenging conditions.

        PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

National Suicide Hotline

The creation of 988 as the National Suicide Hotline of the United States officially began with The National Suicide
Hotline Designation Act of 2020. The decision to create a three-digit hotline, similar to 911 for emergencies, was
driven by the need to improve access to mental health services and crisis intervention. In July 2022, 988 was
established as the dialing code for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

By having a dedicated and easily accessible number, the hope is to reduce the stigma associated with mental health
issues and encourage people to seek help when needed. Additionally, a dedicated number can help streamline the
process of connecting individuals in crisis with appropriate mental health professionals, improving response times.

(National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors, 2021)

Nursing Actions and Strategies for Client Care

Amid the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, psychiatric-mental health nursing has to ensure effective
client care while promoting self-help and community services and supporting recovery. One crucial strategy involves
910  27 · Current Trends and Growing Needs

     emphasizing self-help resources and techniques tailored to the unique circumstances of the pandemic. Psychiatric-
     mental health nurses have been at the forefront of providing clients with tools to manage their mental health
     independently. Encouraging clients to tap into available community resources and support networks is another
     aspect of this approach, fostering resilience and reducing feelings of isolation.

     In addition to promoting self-help and community resources, psychiatric-mental health nurses played a central role
     in supporting the recovery journey of clients during the pandemic. They ensured continuity of care through
     telehealth platforms, offering regular check-ins and therapy sessions to maintain therapeutic relationships and
     monitor progress. Nurses also adapted treatment plans to address pandemic-related stressors and traumas,
     fostering a recovery-oriented approach that acknowledges the unique challenges of these times. By implementing
     trauma-informed care and tailoring interventions to individual needs, psychiatric-mental health nurses strive to
     facilitate not only symptom management but also the broader process of healing and recovery.

     Some people experience a post-acute sequelae, known as "long COVID." See this report (https://openstax.org/r/
     77longCovid) from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA, 2023) describing this
     lingering public health and mental health crisis

     Promote Self-Help and Community Services
     Psychiatric-mental health nurses played a vital role in promoting self-help and community services for clients during
     the COVID-19 pandemic, recognizing the importance of resilience, coping, and access to support systems. Here are
     some ways in which they have contributed and continue to contribute to these efforts:

         · Empowering clients with self-help strategies: Psychiatric nurses can actively educate their clients about self-
             help strategies for managing stress, anxiety, and other mental health challenges related to the pandemic.
             They can provide guidance on techniques, such as mindfulness, deep breathing exercises, and grounding
             exercises that clients can practice on their own to alleviate symptoms.

         · Promoting psychoeducation: Nurses can be instrumental in providing psychoeducation about the
             psychological impact of the pandemic, emphasizing that feelings of fear, isolation, and uncertainty are normal
             responses. By helping clients understand the link between their emotions and the pandemic, nurses empower
             them to take control of their mental health.

         · Referring to community resources: Psychiatric-mental health nurses connect clients to community resources
             and services that provide additional support. They facilitate referrals to local mental health agencies, crisis
             helplines, support groups, and teletherapy services, ensuring that clients have access to a broader network of
             assistance.

         · Supporting telehealth and online communities: Recognizing the importance of virtual support during
             lockdowns and social distancing measures, nurses have encouraged clients to engage in online mental health
             communities, peer support groups, and virtual therapy sessions. They help clients navigate these resources,
             ensuring they can access assistance even when in-person options are limited.

         · Strengthening coping skills: Nurses have worked with clients to enhance their coping skills, including
             problem-solving, goal-setting, and building resilience. They assist clients in developing personalized coping
             plans tailored to their unique circumstances.

         · Providing a listening ear: Perhaps one of the most critical roles of psychiatric-mental health nurses has been
             providing a compassionate and empathetic listening ear. They create a safe and nonjudgmental space for
             clients to express their fears and concerns, offering emotional support and validation.

         · Advocating for client needs: Psychiatric nurses often advocate for their clients' mental health needs within the
             health-care system and the community, helping to reduce stigma and improve access to care.

        LIFE-STAGE CONTEXT

Social Media and Adolescents during the Pandemic

Adolescents increasingly belong to a media culture. A survey of ninety-three teen girls was conducted during the
COVID-19 lockdown on their connections between peer relationships, social media use, and emotional well-being.
The survey found that social technologies created acceptable contact and provided emotional benefit when actual
face-to-face interactions were restricted.

Limitations of the study included a high percentage of girls in socioeconomically secure groups and data collection
through self-report. Most study participants identified as White, non-Hispanic. The researchers acknowledge that
the pandemic had disproportionate effect on families in minoritized communities, and that their study may not be
generalizable to broader, more diverse samples.

(James et al., 2023)

Support Recovery
Psychiatric-mental health nurses have assumed a pivotal role in supporting clients' recovery in the wake of the
COVID-19 pandemic. Anxiety and depression increased in the adult population during the pandemic, as did the
rates of substance misuse and drug overdose deaths (Panchal et al., 2023). With a specialized focus on the mental
health challenges stemming from the pandemic, nursing responsibilities encompass a range of functions.

Nurses assess the unique psychological impacts of COVID-19 on individual clients, considering factors such as
isolation, grief, anxiety, and trauma. Based on these assessments, nurses collaboratively develop tailored care plans
to address specific pandemic-related stressors and mental health symptoms. Medication management remains a
crucial aspect of their role, ensuring that clients who require psychiatric medications for mental health challenges
receive appropriate treatment and monitoring. Additionally, nurses play an active role in educating clients about the
importance of mental well-being during trying times, focusing on strategies to manage stress, sleep, and overall
health. Monitoring and follow-up care are integral, allowing nurses to track progress and adjust interventions as
necessary, while stigma reduction efforts work to encourage clients to seek help without fear or judgment.

Nurses' Mental Health and Self-Care

The COVID-19 pandemic has exerted a profound impact on the mental health of psychiatric-mental health nurses
themselves, exacerbating existing challenges in their profession. Psychiatric nurses have faced increased stress and
emotional strain while providing care during the pandemic. The isolation and social distancing measures have
disrupted the therapeutic relationships they build with their clients, and the restrictions on visitations heightened
the feelings of loneliness and despair among those receiving psychiatric care. Policy changes and uncertainty
surrounding the pandemic response added to the stress, making it challenging for nurses to plan and provide
consistent care. Additionally, controversy surrounding COVID-19 vaccines became a source of tension and stress
among health-care workers, including nurses (Peterson et al., 2022). While vaccines have proven effective in
preventing severe illness, some nurses expressed vaccine hesitancy, leading to concerns about workplace safety
and potential conflicts with colleagues who hold differing views. This has contributed to the overall emotional
burden experienced by psychiatric-mental health nurses during the pandemic.

The mental health toll on psychiatric nurses has been substantial, with many reporting higher rates of depression,
anxiety, and sleep disturbances (Aloweni et al., 2022). The constant exposure to the emotional distress of their
clients and the additional anxieties related to COVID-19 transmission took a toll. Moreover, changing personal
priorities emerged as a significant issue. The pandemic forced many nurses to grapple with difficult decisions about
their own health and the health of their families, leading to internal conflicts and guilt. Balancing the demands of
work with their personal lives, including caring for children or vulnerable family members, became increasingly
challenging. In sum, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for comprehensive mental health support for
psychiatric-mental health nurses, addressing not only the unique stressors of their profession, but also the broader
societal challenges that emerged during this global crisis.

     Nurses Organization. It contains helpful, healthy suggestions that encourage nurses to care for their own mind,
     body, and spirit.

     Frontline Experience
     During the COVID-19 pandemic, psychiatric-mental health nurses faced a myriad of challenges that significantly
     affected their mental health (Kameg et al., 2021). Issues related to the supply of personal protective equipment
     (PPE) added an extra layer of stress and anxiety, as they often worked in environments requiring adequate
     protection. The intensity of their workloads also skyrocketed as they faced the emotional burden of caring for clients
     who were grappling with the mental health effects of the pandemic, all while adapting to new safety protocols and
     an influx of COVID-19 cases. The work led to burnout among many nurses. The integration of new nurses, while
     essential to meet the surging demand for health-care professionals, added to the pressure of the experienced
     psychiatric-mental health nurses who had to train and supervise them.

     Tragically, the pandemic also brought an increase in client deaths, further contributing to the psychological toll on
     these nurses. Witnessing the loss of clients, particularly when in-person support from families was limited or
     prohibited due to COVID-19 restrictions, added to their grief and emotional distress. Many nurses developed
     compassion fatigue, the emotional and physical exhaustion that results from providing empathetic care to those
     experiencing trauma or suffering. The cumulative effect of these challenges led some nurses to leave the profession,
     worsening staffing shortages in an already strained mental health-care system.

             REAL RN STORIES

     Nurse: Janis, BSN
     Geographic Location: Missouri

     Working as a behavioral health nurse during the pandemic was both challenging and eye-opening. While the world
     was dealing with the physical health crisis, my clients were fighting their own silent battles against the pandemic's
     toll on mental health. The isolation, fear, and uncertainty magnified their struggles, and it was heart-wrenching to
     witness. The loneliness was one of the worst things for most people, I think. We had to stop allowing visitors for our
     clients and that was really hard for them. Our staff had to adapt quickly to using PPE and educated all of the clients
     on hygiene and distancing. Yet, there were moments of triumph, too, as I saw the resilience in my clients and the
     incredible strength they possessed. The pandemic taught me the vital importance of mental health support and
     solidified my dedication to this field, knowing that my role in helping others navigate their darkest moments during
     an especially stressful time was more crucial than ever.

     Sustaining Nursing Workforce
     Sustaining the psychiatric-mental health nursing workforce during and after the COVID-19 pandemic has been
     crucial, given the increased demand for mental health services and the unique challenges faced by these
     professionals. Several key strategies and considerations have come into play:

         · Practice environment: Ensuring a supportive and safe practice environment is paramount. Adequate staffing
             levels, access to personal protective equipment (PPE), and infection control measures are crucial for nurses'
             physical safety and well-being. Additionally, promoting a culture of respect, support, and recognition within
             health-care settings can help lessen the emotional toll of the pandemic on psychiatric-mental health nurses.

         · Academy Health Interdisciplinary Research Group on Nursing Issues (IRGNI): Organizations like IRGNI have

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Define human trafficking
    · Identify resources for prevention and awareness
    · Discuss nursing responsibilities related to human trafficking

Human trafficking is a serious public health emergency affecting an estimated twelve to thirty million people every
year in the United States, including more than five million children (Byrne, Parsh, & Parsh, 2019). It is a grave and
disturbing global crisis, transcending borders and affecting countless lives. For nurses and clients, understanding
and addressing human trafficking is of paramount importance.

This section will explore the facets of human trafficking, from its underlying causes to the psychological and physical
trauma it inflicts on its victims. It will also offer insights into how psychiatric-mental health nurses can actively
engage in preventing and combating this crime. By delving into the interconnectedness of mental health and human
trafficking, future nurses will be able to recognize signs, provide compassionate care, and collaborate with
multidisciplinary teams to support survivors on their path to recovery. Understanding this issue is not only essential
for delivering holistic health care, but also for advocating for the vulnerable and marginalized individuals who often
bear the brunt of human trafficking's devastating consequences.

Human Trafficking Defined: Force, Exploitation, and Vulnerability

Human trafficking involves the illegal trade of people, typically for forced labor or commercial sexual exploitation,
using coercion, fraud, or force. This grave violation of human rights involves the recruitment, transportation,
harboring, or receipt of victims for the purpose of exploitation. It is a global criminal enterprise that thrives on the
vulnerability of its victims, exploiting their socioeconomic, personal, or psychological vulnerabilities to maintain
control and profit from their suffering. Human trafficking is a complex and multifaceted issue that demands
attention from health-care workers, law enforcement, policymakers, and organizations dedicated to combating this
form of exploitation.

Force, exploitation, and vulnerability are interconnected elements that characterize human trafficking. The physical
or psychological violence used to control victims, including threats, abuse, or confinement is called force.
Perpetrators employ force to instill fear and compliance, making it difficult for victims to escape their situations. The
numerous different ways in which traffickers financially benefit from their victims' labor or sexual services is called
exploitation. For example, this can involve coercing victims into prostitution, pornography, or other forms of
commercial sex work and then taking the majority of their earnings. A person's vulnerability, or ability to be harmed
or influenced, plays a critical role in the recruitment and control of victims. Those who are vulnerable due to poverty,
homelessness, substance addiction, or a history of abuse are often targeted by traffickers who exploit these
vulnerabilities to manipulate and control their victims.

Table 27.1 provides examples of different types of human trafficking.
914  27 · Current Trends and Growing Needs

     Type                                   Definition

     Child        Child soldiering refers to the practice of recruiting and using children, typically under the age of
     soldiering   eighteen, for armed conflict or warfare. These children are often forcibly abducted or coerced into
                  joining armed groups, where they are subjected to combat roles, including fighting, spying, or
                  serving as support personnel.

     Debt         Debt bondage is a form of forced labor in which individuals are trapped in a cycle of debt, often due
     bondage      to borrowing money or receiving advances from employers, and are subsequently compelled to
                  work for low or no wages to repay the debt. Victims of debt bondage are often subjected to
                  exploitative working conditions and find it challenging to escape the cycle of debt and exploitation.

     Labor        Labor trafficking refers to the illegal practice of recruiting, harboring, transporting, or obtaining
     trafficking  individuals through force, fraud, or coercion to engage in various forms of labor, often in degrading
                  or exploitative conditions. Victims of labor trafficking are typically subjected to involuntary
                  servitude, forced labor, or other forms of labor exploitation, and they may be trapped in situations
                  where their freedom and basic rights are severely restricted.

     Sex          Sex trafficking is the illegal act of recruiting, harboring, transporting, or obtaining individuals
     trafficking  through force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of engaging them in commercial sexual
                  exploitation, including prostitution or pornography. Victims of sex trafficking are often subjected to
                  violence, manipulation, and severe exploitation, and they are denied their basic human rights and
                  autonomy.

     TABLE 27.1 Types of Human Trafficking

     Educating Those Affected
     Providing education to survivors of human trafficking is a crucial component of holistic recovery and empowerment.
     Survivors often face physical and psychological health challenges resulting from their traumatic experiences, and
     nursing education can play a pivotal role in helping them regain control over their lives.

     First and foremost, nursing education for survivors involves a trauma-informed approach. Understanding the impact
     of trauma on survivors' mental and physical health is essential. Nurses should create a safe and nonjudgmental
     environment that fosters trust, allowing survivors to disclose their experiences at their own pace. Education should
     encompass knowledge about common health issues associated with trafficking, including sexually transmitted
     infections, substance misuse, and mental health disorders.

     Empowering survivors with health-care knowledge is also crucial. This includes teaching basic self-care skills,
     recognizing signs of illness, and accessing health-care services. Many survivors have limited access to health care
     during their exploitation, and providing them with the tools to navigate the health-care system empowers them to
     seek care when needed. Additionally, addressing the long-term effects of trauma and promoting self-care
     strategies, such as mindfulness and stress management, can aid in their emotional healing.

     Nursing education should extend beyond just health care. It should also encompass life skills, such as financial
     literacy, job readiness, and social support networks, to help survivors reintegrate into society successfully. By
     equipping survivors with education and resources, nurses play a vital role in helping them reclaim their lives, regain
     independence, and break the cycle of exploitation. Ultimately, nursing education for survivors of human trafficking is
     a step toward restoring their dignity and enabling them to lead healthier, more fulfilling lives.

     Nursing Care: Assessment and Intervention

     The identification of and intervention for potential victims of human trafficking represent critical aspects of a nurse's
     role. Table 27.2 serves as a comprehensive guide for nurses engaged in the assessment and intervention process
     when encountering clients suspected of being victims of human trafficking. Acknowledging the complex nature of
     this issue, the table outlines key indicators for identification, such as physical and behavioral signs, and provides
     information that is crucial for initiating a trauma-informed conversation. Furthermore, it offers insights that are
     helpful with collaborating with multidisciplinary teams, reporting mechanisms, and culturally sensitive approaches.
     By equipping nurses with signs and evidence of trafficking, the aim is to enhance their ability to recognize, respond,
     and advocate for the well-being of individuals subjected to this form of abuse.

     Signs of          Evidence of Trafficking

TABLE 27.2 Identifying Victims

Registered nurses with two or more years of clinical experience (especially in emergency nursing, maternal/child
health, or critical care) may become certified as a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE). The International
Association of Forensic Nurses (https://openstax.org/r/77forensicnurse) provides more information on this
certification.

CLINICAL JUDGMENT MEASUREMENT MODEL

Recognize Cues: Possible Signs of Human Trafficking

Recognizing cues involves identifying that which is abnormal with the client. For example, the nurse might notice
that their client is fearful in the presence of their partner, has multiple bruises, and seems reluctant to answer
questions. These abnormal findings require action. To learn more, the nurse may ask the client questions such
as:

    · Have you experienced harm or received threats when attempting to leave your current situation?
    · Have threats been made against your family members?
    · Is your place of residence the same as your workplace?
    · Could you please describe your living and dining arrangements?
    · Are you indebted to your employer in any way?
    · Do you possess your passport or identification, and if not, who is in possession of it?

The client's responses can guide the nurse on what actions to take next. For urgent cases, the nurse should
contact emergency services at 911. The National Human Trafficking Hotline is 1-888-373-7888 and can be
contacted to report a tip, connect with antitrafficking services, for training, general information, or antitrafficking
resources.

Mandated Reporting and Trauma-Informed Care
Mandated reporting and trauma-informed care are two crucial aspects of nursing practice when it comes to
918  27 · Current Trends and Growing Needs

     addressing human trafficking. These concepts are intertwined and play a significant role in identifying and assisting
     trafficking victims while minimizing further trauma.

     Nurses, like many other health-care professionals, are mandated reporters. This means they are legally obligated to
     report suspected cases of abuse, neglect, or exploitation of children or vulnerable adults, which includes human
     trafficking. When a nurse encounters a client who exhibits signs or discloses information suggesting involvement in
     trafficking, they have a legal and ethical duty to report their suspicions to the appropriate authorities, such as Child
     Protective Services or law enforcement. The agency to which the professional must report the suspected abuse
     differs by state; nurses must be familiar with the law where they are practicing. Mandated reporting is essential for
     several reasons:

         · It helps protect vulnerable individuals, especially minors, from further harm.
         · It allows law enforcement and social services agencies to investigate and intervene in trafficking cases.
         · It holds traffickers accountable for their actions.
         · It contributes to a broader effort to combat human trafficking and bring perpetrators to justice.

     Recognizing the trauma that survivors of human trafficking have experienced is essential for health-care
     professionals, including nurses. The approach that acknowledges the prevalence of trauma and its effects on an
     individual's mental, emotional, and physical well-being is trauma-informed care. Key principles of trauma-informed
     care include:

         · understanding the potential triggers and emotional responses that trauma survivors may exhibit
         · creating a safe and nonjudgmental environment that fosters trust and open communication
         · prioritizing the survivor's autonomy and choice in their care and treatment
         · being aware of the potential retraumatization that can occur if care is not delivered with sensitivity to a

             survivor's history
         · collaborating with trauma-informed mental health professionals to provide appropriate psychological support

     When working with victims of human sex trafficking, trauma-informed care is essential because many survivors have
     experienced severe physical and psychological abuse. When nurses provide care that is sensitive to the trauma, they
     can better establish rapport, gain the survivor's trust, and facilitate disclosure of their experiences. Additionally, this
     approach helps survivors feel more comfortable accessing health-care services, which is often their first step toward
     recovery.

     Client Referral and Support
     Client referral and support are fundamental aspects of nursing care when addressing human trafficking. Nurses play
     a crucial role in connecting trafficking survivors with the necessary resources and services while providing ongoing
     support to facilitate their healing and recovery.

     In the realm of client referral, nurses play a pivotal role in ensuring that survivors of human trafficking receive the
     comprehensive care they need. This includes immediate attention to their physical well-being, where nurses may
     provide referrals to medical specialists, facilitate forensic examinations when necessary, and address sexual and
     reproductive health concerns. Given the often-profound mental health challenges faced by survivors, nurses also
     connect them with mental health professionals and therapists specializing in trauma-informed care. Moreover,
     nurses collaborate with social workers to provide referrals to social services agencies, enabling survivors to access
     housing assistance, financial support, food, and other resources. Nurses can also guide survivors toward legal aid
     organizations or attorneys specializing in human trafficking cases, offering assistance with restraining orders,
     immigration matters, or pursuing restitution from traffickers. Lastly, for survivors grappling with substance misuse
     issues, nurses facilitate referrals to addiction treatment programs and support groups to address these specific
     challenges comprehensively.

     Client support requires a multifaceted approach in nursing care for trafficking survivors, encompassing trauma-
     informed care to establish trust, emotional support involving active listening and empathy, safety planning to
     prevent revictimization, education about rights and resources, crisis intervention for acute distress, advocacy within
     the health-care system, and empowerment to regain control over their lives, participate in their recovery decisions,
     and promote autonomy and self-efficacy.

Nurses' Reactions and Care for the Caregiver
Nurses who care for survivors of human trafficking often face unique challenges and emotional reactions due to the
nature of the work. Providing care for survivors of such traumatic experiences can take a toll on the mental and
emotional well-being of health-care professionals. Nurses who care for survivors of human trafficking may
experience compassion fatigue or vicarious trauma. Compassion fatigue occurs when nurses become emotionally
exhausted due to their empathetic responses to survivors' suffering, and vicarious trauma refers to the emotional
toll that exposure to the trauma of others can have on health-care providers. These reactions can lead to symptoms,
such as anxiety, depression, and burnout. Likewise, nurses may experience a range of emotional responses when
caring for trafficking survivors, including sadness, anger, frustration, and helplessness. It is crucial for nurses to
acknowledge and manage these emotions effectively to prevent them from negatively impacting their care. Nurses
also may have preconceived notions or biases about human trafficking, which can affect the care they provide.
Recognizing and addressing these biases are essential to ensure that survivors receive nonjudgmental and
compassionate care. Caring for survivors can also lead to secondary trauma, where health-care providers
experience symptoms similar to those of trauma survivors. This can include intrusive thoughts, nightmares, and
hypervigilance. Recognizing these symptoms and seeking support is essential for nurses' well-being. To address
these challenges and ensure that nurses are equipped to provide the best care possible, "care for the caregiver" is
crucial:

    · Self-care: Nurses must prioritize self-care, which includes practices like exercise, mindfulness, seeking
        support from colleagues or therapists, and setting boundaries to prevent burnout.

    · Supervision and support: Health-care organizations should provide supervision and support for nurses caring
        for trafficking survivors. Regular debriefing sessions and access to mental health professionals can help
        nurses process their emotions and manage vicarious trauma.

    · Education and training: Ongoing education and training on trauma-informed care and the unique needs of
        trafficking survivors can help nurses feel more prepared and confident in their roles.

    · Peer support: Encouraging peer support and creating a culture where nurses can openly discuss their
        experiences and challenges can be highly beneficial.

    · Supervision and team collaboration: Nurses should collaborate with other health-care professionals, social
        workers, and organizations specializing in trafficking to provide holistic care to survivors and share the
        emotional burden of their work.

27.3 PTSD and Veteran Trauma

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Define post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
    · Identify referrals and resources for a client with PTSD
    · Describe the nurse's role in assisting trauma clients

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a pervasive and challenging mental health condition that affects not only
the general population but also presents as a particularly serious issue within the military veteran population.
Characterized by debilitating symptoms stemming from exposure to trauma, PTSD poses complex clinical
challenges. In the realm of psychiatric-mental health nursing, there is an urgency to address the unique
psychological and emotional burdens faced by military veterans, who often grapple with the enduring effects of
combat-related traumas. Psychiatric-mental health nurses, as frontline health-care providers, are tasked with the
mission of delivering specialized care, employing trauma-informed approaches, and advocating for evidence-based
treatments to foster recovery and improve the overall mental well-being of veterans.

PTSD Defined

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can develop after a person experiences or witnesses a traumatic event. These
events can include military combat exposure, natural disasters, accidents, physical or sexual assault, and other life-
threatening incidents. PTSD can manifest through a range of symptoms, such as flashbacks, nightmares, intrusive
thoughts, avoidance of triggers, emotional numbness, and heightened anxiety. It can significantly impact an
individual's daily life, relationships, and overall well-being. Treatment options, including therapy and medication, are
available to help individuals manage and overcome PTSD, enabling them to regain a sense of control and improve
920  27 · Current Trends and Growing Needs

     their quality of life. PTSD is a complex and deeply distressing condition, but with appropriate support and care, many
     individuals can make significant progress in their recovery.

     According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (2023b), PTSD is a particularly prevalent and complex issue
     within the military community, where service members often face intense and traumatic experiences during their
     deployments. Combat exposure, witnessing injuries or death, and the constant threat of danger can lead to the
     development of PTSD symptoms. These symptoms may include recurrent flashbacks, hypervigilance, nightmares,
     irritability, and emotional numbness. PTSD in the military can be especially challenging due to the stigma associated
     with seeking mental health support and the fear of potential career consequences. There is a growing recognition of
     the importance of addressing PTSD within the military, however, and various support mechanisms, including
     specialized therapy programs and peer support networks, have developed to assist service members in their journey
     toward healing and recovery.

     The DSM-5-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2022) outlines the criteria for diagnosing PTSD, which includes
     exposure to trauma, intrusive symptoms, avoidance of triggers, negative changes to cognitions and mood, arousal
     and activity, duration of more than a month, and functional impairment.

     Treatment for PTSD typically involves a combination of therapies and, in some cases, medication (Hoeft et al., 2019;
     American Psychological Association, 2020). The choice of treatment depends on the individual's specific symptoms,
     preferences, and the recommendations of their health-care provider. It can include CBT, exposure therapy, or
     EMDR. Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) is an evidence-based therapy specifically designed
     for children and adolescents with PTSD. It incorporates CBT techniques to address trauma-related symptoms.

     Potential medications used to treat PTSD include antidepressants and, off-label, Prazosin. The only medications
     that are FDA-approved for the specific treatment of PTSD are the SSRIs sertraline (Zoloft) and paroxetine (Paxil)
     (American Psychological Association, 2017). SNRIs, such as venlafaxine (Effexor), are also frequently used to
     manage symptoms of depression and anxiety in PTSD. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (2023a)
     recommends that, of the antidepressants available, the SSRIs sertraline and paroxetine and the SNRI venlafaxine
     are found to be most effective for PTSD. Prazosin may be used off-label to alleviate nightmares and sleep
     disturbances associated with PTSD. Some other techniques used with PTSD clients include:

         · Group therapy: Group therapy sessions provide a supportive and nonjudgmental environment where
             individuals with PTSD can share their experiences, learn coping strategies, and receive validation from peers
             who have faced similar challenges.

         · Family therapy: Involving family members in therapy can help improve communication and relationships.
         · Mindfulness and relaxation techniques: Techniques, such as mindfulness meditation, deep breathing

             exercises, and progressive muscle relaxation, can help individuals manage stress and anxiety.
         · Complementary therapies: Some individuals find relief through adjunctive, complementary therapies like

             acupuncture, yoga, or art therapy.
         · Self-help strategies: Encouraging individuals to engage in self-help strategies like journaling and maintaining a

             healthy lifestyle can complement formal treatment.

     Referrals and Resources

     Referrals and resources for clients with PTSD, including military veterans with PTSD, are crucial in ensuring that
     individuals receive comprehensive care and support. Here are specific examples of organizations and resources that
     provide assistance:

         · Veterans Affairs (VA): The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs is a primary resource for veterans with PTSD.
             VA medical centers and clinics across the country offer specialized PTSD treatment programs, including
             evidence-based therapies, such as CBT and EMDR. Veterans can access mental health services, medication
             management, and peer support through the VA.

         · Wounded Warrior Project (WWP): WWP is a nonprofit organization that provides a wide range of programs and
             services to support veterans and service members who have experienced physical or mental health
             challenges, including PTSD.

        PTSD Coach app and the Military OneSource website.

Nurse's Role

The nursing process in care of clients with post-traumatic stress conditions includes specific assessment items to
help focus the interventions. The therapeutic relationship, specifically the working phase, builds trust, assures
safety, and establishes boundaries. The nurse functions as educator regarding medication, if indicated, coach for
coping skills, and advocate for the client's self-management.

Assessment
Assessment is a critical component of nursing care for clients with PTSD. It involves gathering comprehensive
information about the client's condition, including their physical and mental health, trauma history, and the impact
of PTSD on their daily life. Key aspects of the assessment process for clients with PTSD include:

    · Trauma history: Ask about the type of traumatic event(s) the client experienced, the timing and duration of the
        trauma, and any past or ongoing exposure to traumatic stressors.

    · Symptom assessment: Assess the symptoms the client experiences, such as intrusion symptoms like
        recurrent distressing memories, nightmares, flashbacks, and intense psychological or physiological reactions
        that represent triggers to the trauma; avoidance symptoms, such as thoughts, feelings, conversations, places,
        people, or activities that remind them of the trauma; and arousal/reactivity symptoms, such as irritability,
        anger outbursts, reckless behavior, hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, sleep disturbances, and
        problems with concentration.

    · Functional ability assessment: Assess how PTSD symptoms impact the client's daily functioning, including
        their ability to work, maintain relationships, engage in self-care, and participate in activities of daily living.

    · Safety assessment: Evaluate any potential self-harm, harm to others, or suicidal thoughts and ensure the
        client has a safe environment.

    · Co-occurring conditions: Assess for co-occurring mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety
        disorders, or substance use disorders, as these often accompany PTSD and may require integrated treatment.

    · Cultural sensitivity: Recognize that cultural factors can influence how individuals experience and express their
        PTSD symptoms (Health Care Toolbox, n.d.).

    · Client preferences and goals: Ask about the client's treatment preferences, goals, and concerns, because this
        information can guide care planning.

QSEN Competency: Client-Centered Care, Trauma-Informed Care

Definition: Recognize the client as a full partner in control of all decisions when providing compassionate and
coordinated care based on respect for the client's preferences, values, and needs.

Knowledge: Understand how trauma-informed care is an approach that acknowledges the prevalence of trauma
and its effects on an individual's mental, emotional, and physical well-being. It is essential to provide care that is
922  27 · Current Trends and Growing Needs

     sensitive to the trauma in order to establish rapport, gain the survivor's trust, and facilitate disclosure of their
     experiences.

     Skill: Provide compassionate, trauma-informed care to victims or suspected victims of trauma while incorporating
     client values, preferences, and expressed needs in the treatment plan.

     Attitude: Respect and encourage individual expression of client values, preferences, and needs in a nonjudgmental
     manner.

     Medication Management, Monitoring, and Education
     Medication management, monitoring, and client education are crucial aspects of nursing care for clients with PTSD.
     In terms of medication management, nurses play a key role in assisting clients in understanding their prescribed
     medications, including potential side effects, and how to take them correctly and reporting concerns to the health-
     care provider for prompt adjustments. For many individuals with PTSD, medications may help manage symptoms of
     depression, anxiety, and intrusive thoughts.

     Monitoring is a continuous process in PTSD care, involving regular assessment of the client's response to treatment,
     changes in symptoms, and any potential side effects of medications. Nurses collaborate with the health-care team
     to track the client's progress and communicate any necessary adjustments to the treatment plan. Monitoring also
     extends to assessing the client's safety, particularly with respect to medication changes or when there's a risk of
     self-harm or worsening symptoms.

     Client education is essential for promoting self-management and understanding the condition. Nurses educate
     clients about the nature of PTSD, coping techniques, and the importance of engaging in psychotherapy or counseling
     alongside medication for holistic treatment. Client education empowers individuals with PTSD to participate in their
     recovery and make informed decisions about their care.

     Collaborating with the client to set achievable goals related to their mental and emotional well-being is considered
     wellness coaching. Nurses help clients identify strategies for managing their symptoms and improving their overall
     quality of life. This can include developing healthy routines, encouraging physical activity, and addressing sleep
     disturbances, all of which play a role in PTSD recovery.

     Stress management is essential for clients with PTSD who often experience heightened stress levels and anxiety.
     Nurses teach stress-reduction techniques, such as mindfulness, deep breathing exercises, and progressive muscle
     relaxation. These strategies empower clients to cope with stress more effectively and reduce the intensity of PTSD
     symptoms. Assessing coping mechanisms is vital to understand how clients are managing their condition. The
     inability to employ personal strategies to manage psychological distress is considered ineffective coping. Some
     individuals with PTSD may resort to ineffective coping strategies, such as substance misuse or self-harm. Nurses
     work with clients to identify healthier coping mechanisms, fostering resilience and adaptability.

     Client safety is a paramount concern, especially in cases where individuals with PTSD are at risk of self-harm or
     have a history of suicidal ideation. Nurses conduct ongoing safety assessments, ensuring that clients have access to
     crisis intervention resources and appropriate support systems.

     Therapeutic Relationship/Trauma-Informed Care
     Trauma-informed care is an approach to health care that recognizes and responds to the impact of trauma on
     individuals. Every client receives trauma-informed care regardless of known trauma history (Fleishman et al., 2019).
     This approach emphasizes creating a safe and supportive environment for those who have experienced trauma by
     integrating an understanding of the prevalence and effects of trauma into all aspects of care. The key principles of
     trauma-informed care include promoting safety, trustworthiness, collaboration, choice, and empowerment. It
     involves recognizing the signs and symptoms of trauma, avoiding retraumatization, and offering support that is
     sensitive to the unique needs of individuals who have faced traumatic experiences. Trauma-informed care is applied
     across various settings, including health care, social services, and education, to ensure a compassionate and healing
     approach that considers the complex effects of trauma on an individual's physical and mental well-being.

27.4 Mental Health in the LGBTQIA+ Community

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Define sexual orientation and gender identity
    · Identify mental health concerns of persons within LGBTQIA+ communities
    · Discuss nurses' role in mental health care of LGBTQIA+ clients

Understanding the intersection of mental health and members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, Transgender, Queer,
Intersex, and questioning LGBTQIA+ community is essential for any health-care professional, particularly in the field
of psychiatric-mental health nursing. The LGBTQIA+ community, composed of individuals with diverse sexual
orientations, gender identities, and gender expressions, has long experienced unique mental health challenges,
often stemming from societal discrimination, stigma, and a lack of acceptance. By recognizing the distinct
challenges faced by LGBTQIA+ individuals and offering evidence-based strategies for support, future nurses will be
empowered to deliver compassionate, inclusive, and culturally competent care that promotes mental well-being and
resilience among LGBTQIA+ individuals.

Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity

Sexual orientation and gender identity are two distinct aspects of a person's being, often related to their
understanding of self and their experiences in the world. An individual's emotional, romantic, and sexual attraction
to others is their sexual orientation. It encompasses a range of orientations, including heterosexual (attracted to
the opposite sex or gender), lesbian or gay (attracted to the same sex or gender), and bisexual/pansexual
(attracted to more than one gender or any gender). People can also identify as asexual, which means they
experience little to no sexual attraction to any gender. Sexual orientation is innate and not a choice; it is an integral
part of a person's identity, independent of their gender identity (Human Rights Campaign, n.d.).

The sex category, typically male or female, that is assigned to an individual at birth based on physical and biological
characteristics, such as genitalia and chromosomes is their assigned sex. An individual's deeply held sense of their
sex, which may or may not align with the sex assigned to them at birth, is their gender identity. Individuals who have
a gender identity that matches their assigned sex at birth (e.g., a person assigned female at birth identifies as a
woman) are considered cisgender. Individuals who have a gender identity that differs from their assigned sex (e.g., a
person assigned male at birth identifies as a woman) are considered Transgender. People who do not exclusively
identify as male or female and may have a gender identity that falls outside the traditional binary understanding of
gender are considered nonbinary, also known as genderqueer, genderfluid, or agender. The umbrella term, queer,
can encompass various nonheteronormative sexual orientations and gender identities, often used as a self-identifier
by individuals who don't fall within traditional categories. Other terms may include androgyny, meaning no
distinction between male and female, third gender, meaning a separate gender apart from male or female, and two
spirit, meaning incorporating qualities of both binary genders, sometimes used by Indigenous people.

Intersex is a general term used to describe people whose sex traits, reproductive anatomy, hormones, or
chromosomes are different from the usual two ways human bodies develop. Some intersex traits are recognized at
birth, while others are not recognizable until puberty or later in life. Intersex people and transgender people are not
the same (and they are not interchangeable terms); many transgender people have no intersex traits, and many
intersex people do not consider themselves transgender. Furthermore, most recent literature refers to the atypical
conditions themselves as "differences of sex development," (DSD); nurses may find relevant guidance and evidence
with that terminology, even though many intersex people do not use it to refer to themselves and some reject the
terminology (Sandberg, 2022; Davis, 2013).

        LINK TO LEARNING

There are many lists of recommended terminology, which evolves over time. Review the glossary of terms
(https://openstax.org/r/77glossary) from the Human Rights Campaign for some recommendations.

Wellness and aspects of being through the life span are critical considerations in understanding mental health
924  27 · Current Trends and Growing Needs

     within the LGBTQIA+ community. LGBTQIA+ individuals often face unique challenges and experiences related to
     sexual orientation, gender identity, and societal attitudes, which can have a significant impact on their mental well-
     being.

     Coming Out and Identity Formation
     Coming out, or the process of disclosing one's LGBTQIA+ identity, can be a pivotal moment in an individual's life. It
     can lead to feelings of self-acceptance and liberation, but it can also be a source of stress and anxiety, particularly
     when faced with potential rejection from family and friends. Therefore, support during this period is crucial for
     positive mental health outcomes.

     Adolescence and Young Adulthood
     LGBTQIA+ youth are at a higher risk of experiencing bullying, discrimination, and rejection, which can lead to mental
     health challenges like depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts (CDC, 2023b). Providing safe spaces, inclusive sex
     education, and access to mental health services is essential during this critical developmental stage (CDC, 2023b).

     Relationships and Community
     As LGBTQIA+ individuals form relationships and seek community, they may face discrimination, exclusion, or a lack
     of legal recognition, which can impact their mental well-being. Supportive relationships and involvement in
     LGBTQIA+ organizations or communities can be protective factors for mental health (Ceatha et al., 2021).

     Older Adults and Identity
     LGBTQIA+ individuals may face unique challenges in older age, including potential social isolation, lack of culturally
     competent health care, and discrimination in long-term care facilities. Addressing these issues is vital for the mental
     health of older LGBTQIA+ adults (Masa et al., 2024).

     Intersectionality
     Many LGBTQIA+ individuals belong to multiple marginalized groups, such as people of color, immigrants, or
     individuals with disabilities. Intersectionality adds layers of complexity to their experiences because they may face
     discrimination based on multiple aspects of their identity, which can contribute to mental health disparities (Funer,
     2023).

     Resilience and Empowerment
     Despite the challenges, many LGBTQIA+ individuals demonstrate resilience and empowerment by embracing their
     identities, advocating for their rights, and seeking support when needed. Building on these strengths is a vital aspect
     of promoting mental health and well-being.

     Culturally Appropriate Care
     Mental health professionals and health-care providers must be sensitive to the unique culture and experiences of
     LGBTQIA+ individuals. This includes understanding the impact of discrimination, addressing concerns related to
     gender identity or sexual orientation, and offering affirming and inclusive care.

     Mental Health Issues and Stigma Against People in LGBTQIA+ Communities

     People within the LGBTQIA+ communities frequently grapple with elevated rates of mental health issues, often
     stemming from the pervasive discrimination, stigma, minority stress, and social rejection they may encounter.
     LGBTQIA+ individuals are not a homogenous group, and mental health experiences are shaped by intersecting
     identities, such as race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and disability. Intersectional factors can compound the
     challenges faced by LGBTQIA+ individuals. These stressors and unique obstacles can lead to heightened rates of
     anxiety, depression, and even suicidality among LGBTQIA+ individuals (Funer, 2023).

     Higher Rates of Mental Health Conditions
     Research consistently indicates that LGBTQIA+ individuals experience higher rates of mental health conditions
     compared with the general population (Medina-Martínez et al., 2021). Common mental health issues include
     depression, anxiety, substance misuse, and suicidal ideation. These disparities are often attributed to the stressors
     associated with societal discrimination and minority stress.

     Some individuals experience gender dysphoria, a psychiatric disorder where the individual feels significant distress
     or discomfort due to the incongruence between their assigned gender at birth and the gender with which they

27.4 · Mental Health in the LGBTQIA+ Community                                                                              925

identify (Turban, 2022). The distress associated with gender dysphoria can impact various aspects of an individual's
life, including emotional well-being, mental health, and social functioning. It's important to note that gender
dysphoria is a recognized medical condition, and not every Transgender or gender diverse individual experiences
gender dysphoria.

Social Isolation and Internalized Stigma
Some LGBTQIA+ individuals experience social isolation due to a lack of acceptance from their families,
communities, or cultures (Firk et al., 2023). This isolation can contribute to feelings of loneliness and depression.
Moreover, internalized stigma occurs when LGBTQIA+ individuals internalize negative beliefs and stereotypes about
their own sexual orientation or gender identity. This self-stigmatization can lead to feelings of shame, low self-
esteem, and poor mental health.

Finding supportive LGBTQIA+ communities and networks can be crucial for combating social isolation and
internalized stigma.

Barriers to Accessing Care
Barriers to mental health care can include a lack of culturally competent providers, concerns about stigma and
discrimination from health-care professionals, and financial barriers. These obstacles can prevent LGBTQIA+
individuals from seeking and receiving the care they need.

Marginalization and Stereotyping
Marginalization and stereotyping exert a profound impact on the mental health of individuals within LGBTQIA+
communities, erecting significant barriers to accessing mental health care and contributing to mental health
disparities. Exclusion, discrimination, and the denial of rights, or marginalization, often leads to feelings of isolation
and low self-esteem. It can contribute to mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety (Green et al., 2021).
Individuals may refrain from seeking mental health care due to fears of encountering further discrimination from
health-care providers. Stereotyping, involving generalized assumptions based on LGBTQIA+ identity, likewise
perpetuates stigma and bias, dissuading individuals from seeking mental health support out of concern for
judgment or prejudice (Anzani et al., 2024).

Marginalization and stereotyping collectively obstruct access to care, resulting in delayed interventions and
exacerbated mental health conditions. Addressing these issues necessitates promoting LGBTQIA+ inclusivity,
educating society on acceptance, providing cultural competency training for health-care providers, and creating
safe, affirming spaces for mental health care within LGBTQIA+ communities to reduce mental health disparities and
ensure equitable access to care.

Minority Stress
The unique stressors and adverse mental health outcomes experienced by individuals in marginalized and
stigmatized groups is called minority stress (Goldbach, 2021). LGBTQIA+ individuals may face minority stress due
to their sexual orientation or gender identity. It encompasses stress-inducing experiences like coming out,
experiencing discrimination and microaggressions, and fearing rejection. Minority stress can lead to adverse mental
health issues and contribute to disparities in health-care access and outcomes.

suicide prevention among LGBTQIA+ youth. It provides a crisis hotline number at 866-488-7386 and a text number
and chat service for assistance, which are available 24/7, as well as a social networking community.

The Nurse's Role

Client-centered care is of paramount importance for LGBTQIA+ clients in mental health settings because it
acknowledges and respects their unique experiences and needs (American Nurses Association [ANA], 2018).
Providing care that is client-centered means actively listening to clients, understanding their specific concerns
related to sexual orientation and gender identity, and tailoring treatment plans accordingly. It fosters a trusting and
affirming therapeutic relationship, which is essential for individuals to feel safe discussing their mental health
926  27 · Current Trends and Growing Needs

     challenges, coming out experiences, or questions or concerns about their gender. By prioritizing the client's voice
     and perspective, health-care providers can offer more effective and compassionate care, ultimately improving
     mental health outcomes and reducing disparities for LGBTQIA+ individuals (ANA, 2022).

             LINK TO LEARNING

     The American Nurses Association (ANA, 2022) published a news release (https://openstax.org/r/77genderaffcare)
     that expresses the ANA's opposition to restrictions on gender-affirming care.

     Diverse and Culturally Competent Interventions
     Providing inclusive and culturally competent nursing care is imperative when supporting individuals within the
     LGBTQIA+ community. Nurses play a pivotal role in ensuring that the care they deliver is respectful, affirming, and
     responsive to the diverse needs of LGBTQIA+ clients. This involves adopting a multifaceted approach that
     acknowledges the unique experiences and challenges faced by individuals across various gender identities and
     sexual orientations. From fostering open communication to understanding the nuances of gender-affirming care, the
     nurse's toolkit encompasses a myriad of specific, diverse, and culturally appropriate interventions. There are many
     specific, diverse, and culturally competent interventions for the nurse to implement when assisting LGBTQIA+
     clients (National LGBT Health Education Center, n.d.), such as:

         · Affirming language and pronouns: Use respectful and gender-affirming language. Always ask for and use the
             client's preferred name and pronouns. This simple gesture helps build trust and respect.

         · Cultural sensitivity training: Health-care providers should undergo training on LGBTQIA+ cultural competency
             to understand the unique challenges, experiences, and health disparities faced by this community. This
             training should include awareness of intersectionality, or the overlapping identities that affect individuals'
             experiences.

         · Safe and inclusive spaces: Create an environment that is visibly LGBTQIA+-friendly. Display inclusive signage,
             pamphlets, or materials that signal acceptance and provide privacy for sensitive discussions.

         · Inclusive assessment: Ask open-ended questions about the client's experiences, including coming out, family
             support, and discrimination. Understanding their lived experiences is crucial for tailoring interventions
             effectively.

         · Mental health support groups: Offer LGBTQIA+-specific mental health support groups or therapy options
             where clients can connect with others who share similar experiences. This can reduce isolation and provide a
             sense of community.

         · Education and resources: Provide educational materials and resources about LGBTQIA+ mental health,
             including information about coming out, gender dysphoria, and the unique stressors faced by LGBTQIA+
             individuals.

         · Crisis intervention: Be prepared to provide crisis intervention with sensitivity to LGBTQIA+ issues. LGBTQIA+
             individuals may face unique stressors, such as rejection from family or a lack of social support.

         · Transgender health care: For Transgender clients, ensure access to gender-affirming care, including hormone
             therapy and surgical referrals when appropriate. Understand the importance of gender-affirming care in
             mental health outcomes.

         · Family support and education: Offer family therapy or support groups to help families better understand and
             accept their LGBTQIA+ loved ones. A supportive family can have a significant impact on an individual's mental
             health.

         · Advocacy: Advocate for LGBTQIA+ clients within the health-care system to ensure they receive equitable and
             respectful care. Address any discriminatory practices or barriers to care.

         · Crisis helplines: Provide information about LGBTQIA+ crisis helplines and support services for individuals who
             may be facing immediate mental health challenges (Bass & Nagy, 2023).

     LGBTQIA+ Nurses
     LGBTQIA+ nurses may encounter several challenges within the health-care profession. Discrimination and bias,
     whether from colleagues or clients, can create a hostile work environment. The decision to disclose one's LGBTQIA+

care institutions may lack inclusive culture, making it difficult for LGBTQIA+ nurses to feel accepted and respected.
Additionally, experiencing discrimination or bias can take a toll on mental health, leading to stress, anxiety, or
depression.

To address these challenges, LGBTQIA+ nurses can tap into various resources. Joining LGBTQIA+ support groups,
both within and outside the workplace, can provide a safe space for networking, sharing experiences, and seeking
guidance. Professional associations like the National LGBTQIA+ Health Education Center (https://openstax.org/r/

including nurses. Seeking out employers with LGBTQIA+-friendly policies and practices, such as nondiscrimination
policies and diversity training, can contribute to a more inclusive work experience. Utilizing mental health services
or counseling can help address the emotional toll of discrimination, while continuous education on LGBTQIA+ health
issues and cultural competency empowers nurses to advocate for their clients and themselves.

27.5 Mental Health in the Homeless and Displaced Population

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Discuss risks for housing instability and mental health needs of unhoused and displaced persons
    · Give examples of barriers to mental health care
    · Develop collaborative nursing strategies to promote health

The intersection of mental health and homelessness or displacement has emerged as an important focal point
within the realm of psychiatric-mental health nursing. Unhoused and displaced populations face a variety of unique
mental health challenges, stemming from a complex web of factors, such as poverty, trauma, and social isolation.
For individuals grappling with homelessness or displacement, access to mental health care is often fraught with
barriers, ranging from stigmatization to the lack of resources and support networks. In response to these
challenges, psychiatric-mental health nurses are often at the forefront of developing innovative strategies aimed at
promoting mental well-being and holistic health within these marginalized communities. Nurses explore their
distinct mental health needs, the hurdles to care, and the development of nursing strategies designed to bridge the
gap, restore dignity, and facilitate recovery within these often-overlooked communities.

Risks for Housing Instability and Accompanying Mental Health Needs

Loss of home or housing stability can result from various risks and causes, often a combination of factors (Table
27.3). Being homeless generally means lacking a stable, safe, and adequate place to live, or living without a fixed
residence. The term unsheltered generally refers to individuals experiencing homelessness who lack any form of
shelter, such as those living on the streets, in cars, or in other places not meant for human habitation, without
access to conventional housing or shelter facilities. Orenstein (2020) writes that people living in certain situations
should be the ones to guide the language used to describe them. For example, some people (and some
organizations and advocates) use the term "houseless" or "unhoused" to refer to their specific living situation; a
person who lives in a tent may consider themselves "unhoused" but not "homeless," because they do have a home.
Nurses should consider the stigma and assumptions that arrive with all terminology.

Mental Illness
Mental illness is a significant contributing factor to homelessness, and the relationship between mental health and
homelessness is complex. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI, 2023), as of 2020, 21.1
percent of the unhoused population in the United States had a serious mental illness (SMI), which means an illness
that causes diminished capacity or ability to participate in and function in daily life endeavors. Several key factors
illustrate how mental illness can play a role in homelessness and how homelessness can cause or exacerbate
mental illness:

    · Preexisting mental health conditions: Many individuals experiencing homelessness have preexisting mental
        health conditions, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, or PTSD. These conditions can make it
        challenging to maintain stable employment, housing, and social relationships.

    · Lack of access to mental health care: Homeless individuals often struggle to access mental health services
        due to financial constraints, lack of insurance, or limited availability of services. This can result in untreated or
        undertreated mental illness, exacerbating their challenges.

    · Self-medication: Some individuals with mental health issues may turn to self-medication through substance
        abuse as a way to cope with their symptoms. This can further complicate their ability to secure stable housing
        and employment.

    · Crisis events: Mental health crises, such as severe episodes of psychosis or severe depression, can lead to
        disruptions in employment and housing. Without adequate support and treatment, these crises can result in
        homelessness.

    · Stigma and discrimination: Stigmatization and discrimination against people with mental health issues can
        lead to social isolation and exclusion, making it more difficult for them to maintain relationships, find housing,
        or secure employment.

    · Cycling in and out of homelessness: Some individuals with mental illness may experience cycles of
        homelessness, where they briefly obtain housing but lose it due to difficulties related to their mental health.
        They encounter housing instability, generally a state of uncertainty or vulnerability in one's housing situation,
        characterized by frequent moves, risk of eviction, difficulty paying rent or mortgage, or a lack of stable, secure
        housing. It can increase stress, and the cycle can perpetuate homelessness and mental health issues.

    · Trauma and PTSD: Homelessness itself can be a traumatic experience, leading to the development or
        worsening of mental health conditions like PTSD. Trauma from experiences, such as domestic violence,
        childhood abuse, or military service can also contribute to mental illness and homelessness.

Substance Use Disorder
The relationship between substance use disorder (SUD) and homelessness is also complex, with several key factors
highlighting how SUD can contribute to homelessness. For many individuals experiencing homelessness,
substances like alcohol or drugs serve as coping mechanisms to manage the immense stress, trauma, and
hardships associated with life on the streets. These substances can temporarily numb emotional pain or provide a
brief respite from the harsh realities of homelessness. The misuse of substances often leads to addiction and
physical dependency. As the addiction progresses, individuals may prioritize obtaining and using drugs or alcohol
over maintaining stable housing, employment, or relationships. Maintaining a substance use disorder can be
financially draining, as the costs of obtaining drugs or alcohol can deplete financial resources. Consequently,
individuals may struggle to afford housing, rent, or utilities, leading to eviction or housing loss.

Additionally, substance use frequently brings legal issues, including arrests for drug-related offenses. Legal
problems can result in incarceration, probation, or parole, making it challenging to secure stable housing or
employment upon release.

Social isolation is also a consequence of substance use, as it can lead to the isolation of individuals from their
support networks and families. This social isolation can result in strained or severed relationships, reducing the
likelihood of receiving help from friends or family when faced with housing instability.

Moreover, substance use can exacerbate or co-occur with mental health disorders, further complicating efforts to
secure stable housing and employment. These co-occurring disorders often require integrated treatment
approaches for effective management.

Further, individuals experiencing homelessness and substance use disorders may encounter barriers to accessing
930  27 · Current Trends and Growing Needs

     addiction treatment services. These barriers can include lack of insurance, transportation, or access to
     detoxification and rehabilitation programs, which hinder their path to recovery and housing stability.

     Mental Health Needs of Individuals with SUD Housing Instability
     Understanding these complex interconnections between housing and mental illness and housing and substance
     misuse is crucial for health-care professionals. By comprehending a holistic picture, nurses are able to provide
     better, comprehensive care and support to individuals facing homelessness and SUD.

     Motivational Therapies
     Motivational therapies have proven to be effective tools in addressing substance use disorders among homeless
     individuals. One that is particularly effective is motivational interviewing (MI), a client-centered approach that
     aims to enhance an individual's intrinsic motivation to change their behavior (Psychology Today, 2022). In the
     context of homelessness and substance use, MI can be a powerful technique for engaging individuals who may be
     ambivalent about seeking treatment. By empathetically exploring their concerns and values, MI helps homeless
     individuals recognize the impact of substance use on their lives, fostering a genuine desire for change. It
     acknowledges the complex challenges faced by this population and works collaboratively to set achievable goals for
     recovery. It is a valuable approach to providing tailored support for those struggling with substance use within the
     homeless community.

     Recovery Housing
     The concept of recovery housing, supportive and structured environments that offer a safe and stable place for
     individuals in recovery, creates a conducive setting for healing and sobriety. It represents a crucial component in
     addressing substance use disorder among individuals without housing. Recovery housing typically promotes
     abstinence, provides access to counseling and support services, and encourages residents to actively engage in
     their recovery journey. For unhoused individuals grappling with substance use disorders, such housing can be a
     lifeline, offering not only a physical place to stay but also a community of peers who understand their struggles. It
     helps break the cycle of homelessness and substance misuse, fostering an environment where individuals can
     rebuild their lives and work toward sustained recovery.

             LINK TO LEARNING

     The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) created their Best Practices for
     Recovery Housing (https://openstax.org/r/77recoveryhousg) in recognition of its crucial role in positive outcomes. It
     contains evidence-based practice guidelines for creating successful recovery housing.

     Barriers to Stability and Results of Instability

     Homelessness is compounded by a multitude of barriers for individuals striving to regain housing and financial
     security. As discussed, living with a mental illness can exacerbate these situations. Barriers include the absence of a
     credit or rental history, which can deter landlords from renting to those without proven financial reliability. Lack of
     insurance can hinder access to vital health care, perpetuating health-related issues, while limited transportation
     options impede access to employment, social services, and medical care. Unemployment remains a central hurdle,
     as income is crucial for maintaining housing, and the cyclical nature of homelessness often hampers job-seeking
     efforts. Addressing these multifaceted barriers and fostering stability requires a comprehensive approach, including
     affordable housing initiatives, employment support, health-care access, and financial literacy programs.

     Psychosocial Barriers
     Psychosocial barriers play a pivotal role in perpetuating homelessness, encompassing a range of factors that affect
     an individual's ability to regain stability. Trust issues, often stemming from past traumas or exploitation, can hinder
     engagement with support services and housing programs. Stigma associated with homelessness can lead to social
     isolation and keep individuals from seeking assistance, particularly among young and older adults who may face
     unique challenges due to their age. Limited access to education or lack of skills can constrain employment
     opportunities, while the cycle of homelessness itself can disrupt education for youth. Overcoming these
     psychosocial barriers necessitates a holistic approach, including trauma-informed care, anti-stigma campaigns,
     targeted interventions for vulnerable age groups, and educational support to empower individuals on their journey

toward housing stability (SAMHSA, 2015).

Societal Impact of Instability
The societal impact of barriers to housing stability is far-reaching and multifaceted. Persons living with mental
illness and homelessness may be overrepresented among defendants entering the criminal justice system and have
higher rates of arrest and victimization (Sipes, 2022). Some life-sustaining activities, such as sleeping, camping, or
asking for money in public places can be subject to arrest (National Coalition for the Homeless, 2023). The lack of
stable housing can also contribute to increased utilization of emergency medical care; unhoused individuals may
rely on emergency rooms for primary health-care needs, straining health-care resources and increasing costs. To
mitigate these societal impacts, it is crucial to invest in comprehensive homelessness prevention and support
programs that address the root causes of homelessness, ultimately benefiting both individuals and society as a
whole.

Special Populations: Veterans, Families, Rural Areas
Homelessness unevenly affects various special populations, each facing unique challenges of which nurses should
be aware. Mental health concerns complicate these scenarios. One Veterans Affairs study in 2017 found that out of
300,000 veterans who had been referred for anxiety or PTSD, 5.6 percent experienced homelessness within one
year (Tsai et al., 2017). The overall Veteran population shows homelessness of approximately 3.7 percent over a
five-year period (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 2021).

Families and children impacted by mental health concerns also constitute a particularly vulnerable group, with
homelessness adding to detrimental effects on children's development and well-being. In rural areas,
homelessness can be especially hidden and persistent due to a lack of infrastructure and resources, resulting in
limited access to shelters and support services. Limited, also, are community mental health centers and resources
specifically for the care of a diverse rural population (Morales et al., 2020). Addressing homelessness in these
special populations requires tailored interventions, such as veteran-specific housing programs, family-oriented
shelters, and outreach efforts in rural communities.

Nursing Collaboration

Collaboration between nursing professionals, other disciplines, and government agencies is essential to improving
access to mental health care for unhoused clients (Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2021). Nurses often serve as
the first point of contact in health-care settings, making them crucial in identifying mental health needs among
homeless individuals. To enhance accessibility, nurses can collaborate with social workers, psychologists, and
outreach workers to conduct intake assessments in easily accessible locations, such as homeless shelters, drop-in
centers, or mobile clinics. This collaborative effort ensures that individuals experiencing homelessness receive
timely mental health assessments and referrals to appropriate services. Additionally, partnerships with government
agencies at the local, state, and federal levels can help secure funding for mental health programs and increase the
availability of resources, including affordable housing and substance misuse treatment, which are vital components
of comprehensive care for unhoused individuals with mental health needs. By working together across disciplines
and with government support, nurses can help bridge the gap in mental health-care accessibility for unhoused
clients and improve their overall well-being.

        LINK TO LEARNING

The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation framework (https://openstax.org/r/77robertwoodfnd) can assist nurses who
must coordinate with other disciplines and organizations when providing care to clients.

Advocacy for Support
Advocacy for support is a crucial component of psychiatric-mental health nursing. Psychiatric-mental health nurses
often witness firsthand the challenges faced by individuals with mental illness who lack stable housing.
Communities with supportive housing can not only provide a safe and stable environment, but can also offer
essential services like counseling, medication management, and social support that are integral to mental health
recovery. Psychiatric-mental health nurses can advocate for increased funding and policy changes to expand
supportive programs and services, ensuring that vulnerable populations, such as those experiencing homelessness
932  27 · Current Trends and Growing Needs

     or severe mental illness, have access to these vital resources. Individuals living without secure housing also benefit
     from practical assistance where they are.

             LINK TO LEARNING

     Nurses can find resources from the American Nurses Association (https://openstax.org/r/77nurseadvocacy) for
     legislative advocacy.

     Homeless Health Nursing/Street Nursing
     Homeless health nursing, often referred to as street nursing, is a specialized field that focuses on providing health-
     care services to individuals experiencing homelessness in nontraditional settings, such as shelters, encampments,
     or on the streets (Cavazos, 2022). These dedicated nurses play a vital role in addressing the complex health needs
     of this marginalized population, including mental health and substance use issues, infectious diseases, and chronic
     illnesses. Street nurses build trusting relationships with their clients, offering not only essential medical care but
     also support, referrals to social services, and advocacy for improved living conditions. Their work is essential in
     addressing health disparities and improving the overall well-being of those who are unhoused, often acting as a link
     between the health-care system and this vulnerable population.

     27.6 Objectives for the Future

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Discuss consensus studies for PMH nursing's future
         · Identify inclusive strategies for nursing education
         · Create a personal future career/service plan

     Nurses have a unique opportunity to influence health equity among the clients they support. They can help ensure
     nursing education uses inclusive strategies for training future nurses, and they can incorporate the components of
     the consensus studies and create their own service plan to ensure the best possible outcomes for their clients.

     Consensus Studies on the Future of Nursing in PMH

     The Future of Nursing 2020-2030: Charting a Path to Achieve Health Equity (National Academies of Sciences,
     Engineering, and Medicine, 2021) is a report that outlines a vision for the nursing profession and its role in
     advancing health equity over the next decade. The report emphasizes the importance of nurses in addressing health
     disparities and improving health-care access for underserved populations. It calls for nurses to be leaders,
     advocates, and collaborators in health-care delivery, policy development, and education. Key themes include
     promoting diversity and inclusion within the nursing workforce, advancing nursing education and practice, and
     enhancing the role of nurses in health-care leadership. The report underscores the critical role nurses play in
     achieving health equity and recommends actions to empower and support nurses in this mission.

     The American Academy of Nursing (AAN) is dedicated to promoting organizational excellence, nursing leadership,
     and evidence-based policy. To enhance nurse well-being, in 2023 the organization released American Academy of
     Nursing Consensus Recommendations to Advance System Level Change for Nurse Well-being. This paper
     recommends actions by key organizations to drive systemic changes in workplace safety, increase professional
     mobility, and advocate for policies that improve access to health-care resources. These recommendations stem
     from the expertise of AAN's Expert Panels on Building Health Care System Excellence, Psychiatric Mental Health and
     Substance Use, and Global Health. Achieving transformative improvements in health-care work environments and
     advancing nurse well-being and equity will require innovative policy changes and collaborative efforts involving
     associations, organizations, nonprofits, the public, and the media within government and health-care sectors.

     Determinants of Mental Health
     The determinants of mental health are integral to the objectives for the future of mental health nursing. For
     instance, mental health nurses could actively engage in addressing the social determinant of access to stable
     housing. In practical terms, this might involve collaborating with community organizations to provide housing
     support and advocating for affordable housing initiatives to reduce homelessness, a factor closely linked to mental

health challenges. Furthermore, mental health nurses can work toward improving educational opportunities,
recognizing that a lack of education can be a barrier to both employment and mental health. They may collaborate
with schools and provide support to at-risk youth to ensure access to education and enhance resilience against
mental health issues.

Another key focus of mental health nursing objectives is the integration of care across the biological, psychological,
and social determinants of mental health (Naegle et al., 2023; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and
Medicine, 2021). For instance, nurses may take a holistic approach in the care of individuals with a family history of
mental illness (biological determinant) by providing education on coping strategies and resilience-building
techniques (psychological determinant) and connecting them with community resources that offer social support.
This personalized care approach aligns with the future objectives, aiming to provide tailored interventions that
consider an individual's unique circumstances, ultimately improving mental health outcomes. By addressing specific
determinants with targeted actions and interventions, mental health nurses contribute to a more equitable and
comprehensive mental health-care system.

Care Coordination/Changing Populations
Care coordination in nursing is evolving in response to changing populations and health-care landscapes. Salmond
and Echevarria (2017) identified a newly expanding role for the registered nurse as coordinator of care. Specific
areas of health care to address include improved client satisfaction, improved population health, and reduced
health-care costs (Salmond & Echevarria, 2017). Several key trends and developments reflect this evolution:

    · Focus on population health: Nursing care coordination shifted from primarily addressing individual client
        needs to incorporating a population health approach. Nurses now work to manage the health of entire
        populations, identifying common health issues and implementing strategies for prevention and early
        intervention. This approach helps health-care systems manage chronic conditions, reduce hospital
        readmissions, and promote overall community well-being.

    · Technological advancements: Health-care technology, including electronic health records (EHRs) and
        telehealth platforms, has transformed care coordination. Nurses use digital tools to access client information,
        communicate with health-care teams, and remotely monitor clients. Telehealth, in particular, has become a
        vital tool for reaching underserved populations and providing ongoing care management.

    · Interprofessional collaboration: Care coordination has become increasingly interprofessional, involving
        collaboration among nurses, physicians, pharmacists, social workers, and other health-care professionals.
        This team-based approach ensures that clients receive comprehensive care that addresses their physical,
        mental, and social needs.

    · Community-based care: With the recognition that many health-care needs extend beyond the hospital,
        nursing care coordination will expand into the community. Nurses work in various settings, including home
        health care, schools, and outpatient clinics, to provide preventive care and support clients in managing
        chronic conditions.

    · Cultural competency: As populations become more diverse, cultural competency gains greater importance in
        care coordination. Nurses are called to understand and respect the cultural beliefs and values of their clients,
        ensuring that care plans are culturally sensitive and appropriate.

    · Aging population: With the aging of the population, care coordination must adapt to address the unique needs
        of older adults, including complex medical conditions, polypharmacy, and geriatric syndromes. This involves a
        focus on holistic, person-centered care.

    · Health-care policy changes: Health-care policy reforms have emphasized care coordination as a means to
        improve quality, reduce costs, and enhance client outcomes (Salmond & Echevarria, 2017). These policies
        have encouraged health-care organizations to implement care coordination models and programs.

    · Client engagement: There is a growing emphasis on client engagement and shared decision-making in care
        coordination. Nurses work to empower clients to actively participate in their care planning, making informed
        decisions about their health.

Care Delivery Models/Treatment Settings
The evolving landscape of nursing care encompasses both changes in care delivery models and shifts in treatment
settings to adapt to current health-care trends. Care delivery models are increasingly emphasizing a client-centered
and holistic approach. Nurses are playing pivotal roles in interprofessional teams that collaborate to provide
934  27 · Current Trends and Growing Needs

     comprehensive care, acknowledging that clients often have multifaceted health-care needs. These care models are
     being applied across various treatment settings, from hospitals to community clinics, ensuring that clients receive
     well-rounded care that addresses their physical, mental, and social health.

     In tandem with these care models, treatment settings are undergoing transformation to better align with
     contemporary health-care demands. A notable trend is the growing emphasis on community-based care settings.
     Health-care services are extending beyond traditional hospital confines, with the goal of enhancing accessibility and
     client-centeredness. This encompasses a diverse range of treatment settings, including home health care,
     outpatient clinics, and telehealth services. Home health care, for example, allows clients to receive care in the
     familiar surroundings of their homes, benefiting those with chronic conditions or mobility limitations.

     Emerging Technologies
     Telehealth services, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, provide a means for remote consultations, monitoring,
     and education, effectively breaking down geographical barriers and expanding access to care. Automated medical
     equipment for both clients and nurses include wearable and portable devices. Electronic centralized command
     centers broaden safe, efficient practice. Clients can monitor and report their own health status and access self-care
     support through apps for mental health and other medical concerns. By embracing technology, innovative care
     delivery models, and a variety of treatment settings, nursing is poised to offer more accessible, holistic, and
     effective health-care services in response to the evolving needs of diverse client populations.

     Inclusive Strategies for Nursing Education

     One of the most pressing issues in education, including psychiatric-mental health nursing education, is the ongoing
     faculty shortage. According to Kaas (2019), the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) states that
     there is a continuing shortage of qualified faculty for undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate students. This
     shortage continues to worsen as current faculty members retire and others are kept away by higher-paying
     positions.

     Another one of the most important issues in current educational trends is diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)
     (Jolley & Peck, 2022), which represents the commitment to recognizing and embracing differences, ensuring
     fairness, and fostering a sense of belonging for all individuals in order to create a more equitable and enriched
     nursing profession and health-care system. This can enhance nursing education by exposing students to various
     perspectives and experiences, enabling nurses to provide holistic and client-centered care that respects and meets
     the unique needs of diverse populations. Additionally, by fostering DEI in nursing education, programs can attract
     students from underrepresented backgrounds and create a more diverse nursing workforce. This diversity helps
     improve access to care, client satisfaction, and client outcomes, as individuals tend to feel more comfortable and
     understood when cared for by health-care professionals who share their cultural or linguistic background.

     Another important purpose of emphasizing DEI is to address health disparities caused by social determinants of
     health (see Holistic Health and Interventions) and systemic inequalities and biases (Bradford et al., 2022).
     Underrepresented populations, such as Black and Hispanic people, are especially at risk for experiencing greater
     obstacles to health (Ndugga & Artiga, 2023). Nursing education can equip students with the knowledge and skills to
     identify and challenge these disparities.

     Digital Platforms/Simulation
     Digital platforms and simulation techniques, such as the use of artificial intelligence (AI), are increasingly central to
     current and future trends in psychiatric-mental health education. These technologies offer immersive and
     interactive learning experiences for students, enabling them to practice clinical skills, decision-making, and
     communication in a safe and controlled environment. Simulation scenarios can replicate complex mental health
     situations, allowing students to develop critical thinking skills and gain exposure to a wide range of client
     presentations. Moreover, digital platforms provide access to a wealth of educational resources, including online
     lectures, interactive case studies, and virtual client assessments, which complement traditional classroom teaching.

     Clinical Specialization/Preceptorships
     Clinical specialization and preceptorships play pivotal roles in both current and future psychiatric-mental health
     education trends. These experiences offer students the opportunity to delve deeply into specific areas of psychiatric
     nursing, such as child and adolescent mental health or substance use disorders. By working closely with

experienced preceptors in real clinical settings, students gain invaluable hands-on experience, enhance their clinical
skills, and develop a deeper understanding of client populations and treatment modalities. These specialized
clinical experiences provide the practical knowledge and expertise necessary for delivering high-quality, client-
centered care in a rapidly evolving field.

Creating a Personal Future Career/Service Plan

Nashwan (2023) advocates for nurses to create a personal future career or service plan as a professional in the
field. Such a plan involves setting clear goals, such as further education or specialization, and defining the
populations or mental health issues they are passionate about serving. It also entails identifying opportunities for
professional development and staying current with evolving best practices and research. A service plan can include
a commitment to promoting mental health awareness, reducing stigma, and advocating for equitable access to
mental health care. By outlining their aspirations and strategies for growth, psychiatric-mental health nurses can
ensure meaningful and purpose-driven careers dedicated to improving the mental well-being of individuals and
communities.

Professional/Educational Development
Nurses are encouraged to assume a deliberate focus on professional and educational development. In this process,
nurses take proactive steps to enhance their skills, knowledge, and expertise to advance in their careers and
contribute effectively to health care. This development may encompass pursuing advanced certifications, such as
registered nurse board certification, or specialized training to gain specialized expertise in areas, such as
psychiatric-mental health nursing. Additionally, nurses can engage in continuous learning through workshops,
seminars, and conferences to stay updated on the latest research and best practices in the field. They may also seek
mentorship or preceptorship opportunities to learn from experienced professionals. This dedication to professional
and educational growth not only helps nurses provide better care but also positions them for leadership roles and
opportunities to influence the future of psychiatric-mental health nursing through research, policy advocacy, and
innovation.

Advocacy/Networking
Advocacy and networking are important aspects of creating a personal career or service plan in nursing. Advocacy
entails actively speaking out for the needs of clients, the nursing profession, and health care in general, spanning
individual client advocacy to influencing health-care policies. Nurses can develop advocacy skills to become
effective change agents, improving client outcomes and shaping the future of health care. Concurrently, networking
involves building relationships within the nursing profession and the broader health-care community. It opens doors
to opportunities like mentorship, research collaboration, and access to resources. Nurses can expand their networks
through conferences, professional organizations, online forums, and community involvement, providing valuable
insights and collaborative prospects that advance their careers and amplify their impact in health care.

Well-Being: Self and Others
In the formulation of a personal future career or service plan in nursing, it is crucial to emphasize the well-being of
both oneself and others. This holistic approach encompasses various facets. First and foremost, nurses must
prioritize self-care to maintain their physical and mental health. This involves setting boundaries, practicing stress-
reduction techniques, and seeking support when necessary to prevent burnout, ensuring they can consistently
provide high-quality care to their clients. Central to this plan is a steadfast commitment to the well-being of clients,
entailing a dedication to continually improving the quality of care delivered, staying updated on evidence-based
practices, and advocating for client rights and safety. Moreover, fostering a supportive network among colleagues is
pivotal, as nurses can collaborate, share experiences, and offer emotional support to create a positive work
environment. Beyond clinical settings, nurses can extend their impact by promoting community health through
education, outreach, and advocacy for health-care policy changes, particularly in underserved populations. In
essence, a well-rounded personal career or service plan in nursing recognizes the interconnectedness of self-care,
client well-being, and community impact, ensuring that nurses are equipped to provide exceptional care while
contributing positively to health care at large.

Summary

27.1 Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound and lasting effect on mental health and care delivery. Many people
reported increased anxiety and depression during the pandemic, but had problems accessing services due to
lockdowns and other issues causing problems with access to care. Nurses became crucial in assisting clients with
accessing care by providing education and services to connect them with providers, including therapists, nurse
practitioners, and physicians. Much of mental health care shifted to the virtual environment, and nurses helped
connect clients to virtual care. Nurses also found themselves facing their own mental health issues exacerbated by
the pandemic and client care. These stressors require nurses to pay special attention to their own mental health,
emphasizing self-care and fighting the results of burnout and compassion fatigue.

27.2 Human and Sex Trafficking

Human trafficking is the illegal trade of vulnerable people, typically for forced labor or commercial sexual
exploitation, using coercion, fraud, or force. It includes child soldiering, debt bondage, labor trafficking, and sex
trafficking. There are numerous resources for prevention and awareness, both government and nonprofit, of which
nurses should be aware. Nurses have a responsibility to adequately assess clients and be aware of potential signs of
human trafficking, and to report suspected cases of human trafficking to the appropriate authorities.

27.3 PTSD and Veteran Trauma

Post-traumatic stress disorder is a mental health condition that can develop after a person experiences or witnesses
a traumatic event. These events can include combat exposure, natural disasters, accidents, physical or sexual
assault, and other life-threatening incidents. PTSD can be helped by a combination of psychotherapy, medication,
and complementary therapies. When working with clients with PTSD, nurses must gather a thorough history,
including a history of symptoms, provide education on therapies, evaluate for treatment responses, and tailor the
treatment plan accordingly. Interventions include education, wellness coaching, stress management, and
monitoring client safety. Trauma-informed care is especially important to the therapeutic relationship between the
nurse and the client with PTSD. It creates a relationship of trust with an emphasis on safety, collaboration, choice,
empowerment, and avoiding revictimization.

27.4 Mental Health in the LGBTQIA+ Community

Sexual orientation refers to an individual's emotional, romantic, and sexual attraction to others. Gender identity
refers to an individual's deeply held sense of their gender, which may or may not align with the sex assigned to them
at birth. Mental health concerns within LGBTQIA+ communities often include higher rates of depression, anxiety,
and suicidal ideation due to the discrimination, stigma, and minority stress they may experience. Additionally, issues
related to coming out, family acceptance, and societal pressures can contribute to these mental health disparities.
Nurses play a crucial role in the mental health care of LGBTQIA+ clients by providing culturally competent,
nonjudgmental, and inclusive support, addressing the unique mental health challenges they may face due to
discrimination or identity-related stressors, and connecting them with appropriate resources and therapy that
affirms their gender identity and sexual orientation.

27.5 Mental Health in the Homeless and Displaced Population

Unhoused and displaced persons often experience a range of complex mental health needs, including depression,
anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance use disorders, stemming from the trauma of
homelessness, social isolation, and exposure to violence or harsh living conditions. Addressing these mental health
needs is essential for facilitating their stability, reintegration into society, and access to long-term housing solutions.
Nurses can provide invaluable assistance to unhoused clients with mental health issues by offering compassionate
care, mental health assessments, and connecting them to appropriate resources, including shelters, mental health
services, and substance misuse treatment. Advocating for supportive housing initiatives and engaging in street
nursing programs allows nurses to reach vulnerable populations directly.

27.6 Objectives for the Future

Objectives for the future of the nursing profession can be defined by nurses themselves. There are two major report/

Charting a Path to Achieve Health Equity from the National Academy of Medicine (2021) and the American Academy
of Nursing Consensus Recommendations to advance system level change for nurse well-being (2023).

The first emphasizes the importance of nurses in addressing health disparities and improving health-care access for
underserved populations. The second recommends actions by key organizations to drive systemic changes in
workplace safety, increase professional mobility, and advocate for policies that improve access to health-care
resources. Inclusive strategies for nursing education involve creating culturally sensitive curricula and fostering
diversity, equity, and inclusion. Creating a personal future career or service plan as a psychiatric-mental health
nurse is essential for any professional in the field. Such a plan involves setting clear goals, such as further education
or specialization, and defining the populations or mental health issues they are passionate about serving.

CHAPTER OUTLINE
28.1 Nursing Process
28.2 Measurement of Clinical Judgment
28.3 Applying Clinical Judgment to Client Care through Unfolding Case Study Dissection
INTRODUCTION When nurses analyze research evidence for client care, it entails critical thinking. Critical thinking
is problem-solving using the nurse's reasoning ability. In the context of the client's identified needs, the nurse
selects the most appropriate information from analysis of the evidence. The nurse's application of the selected
information to client care is clinical judgment. Clinical judgment directs the nurse's decisions for client care and
nursing practice. Because clients have individual needs, and nursing care evolves over time with the client, critical
thinking and clinical judgment are ongoing in nursing practice.
To illustrate, the psychiatric-mental health (PMH) nurse is working with a young adult client who experiences
anxiety. The client is struggling to manage this condition. The nurse researches anxiety-reduction strategies (critical
thinking), selects mindfulness to teach the client as a self-care technique (clinical judgment), provides the client
education, and evaluates the outcome (nursing practice).
Nursing interventions are unique to the client's situation and are based on analysis of cues recognized in nursing
assessment. Some concepts are universal in the treatment setting, such as safety and collaboration, though
interventions are developed specific to the client's expressed and identified needs guided by standards of care.
946  28 · Critical Thinking in Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing

     Nursing judgments avoid labeling and seek to plan actions that will promote mental health.

     Nurses may use various models for clinical judgment to provide a structure to their reasoning in practice. Some
     available models include the Clinical Judgment Measurement Model (National Council of State Boards of Nursing
     [NCSBN], 2019a), Tanner's Model (Tanner, 2006), and Lasater's Clinical Judgment Rubric (Lasater, 2011).
     Terminology may differ in these models while the concepts remain the same:

         · data collection by nursing assessment
         · data analysis for meaning and interpretation specific to the client
         · care planning involving the client
         · nursing action (nursing interventions)
         · effect of nursing action determined through evaluation, leading to revision of the plan or addressing additional

             problems

     Sample care plans are provided in this chapter to assist in application of clinical judgment based on these concepts.

     28.1 Nursing Process

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define the nursing process in psychiatric-mental health care
         · Use the nursing process to plan nursing care for a client with a mental health problem

     Psychiatric-mental health nurse theorist and educator Ida Jean Orlando is credited with development of the nursing
     process in 1958 (Toney-Butler & Thayer, 2023); the nursing process is a decision-making method based in science
     and, just as importantly, in the art of psychiatric-mental health nursing. Specific to mental health care, nurses bring
     factual data and research evidence to clinical reasoning developed within the therapeutic relationship with
     recipients of nursing care.

     The nursing process incorporates deliberate measures and actions to resolve health-care problems identified in
     partnership with the client. The client's need for support determines the level of nursing involvement. The nursing
     process is dynamic, continues through all of the phases of the therapeutic relationship, and strives for client
     stability, remission, recovery, and self-care.

     The Nursing Process in Psychiatric-Mental Health Care

     The nursing process is a decision-making model for client care in every setting. Nurses make assessments:
     recognizing and prioritizing cues from the client interview and examination and from the client's medical record, and
     utilizing critical thinking, a cognitive process that is learned academically and experientially on the continuum of
     nursing practice. Nurses then formulate hypotheses about the causes of the client's health problem/need with
     proposed solutions in order of priority. Nurses then take action to resolve the identified problems and evaluate these
     actions for effectiveness. Actions partially effective or not effective require revision.

     The therapeutic relationship, also known as nurse-client relationship, helping relationship, or therapeutic alliance,
     establishes nursing practice within the therapeutic environment. The therapeutic environment comprises the safe
     physical location, such as a hospital, clinic, or home, and the supportive conditions within that location. Within the
     therapeutic environment, practitioners define mental health problems and begin the process toward resolution. The
     therapeutic relationship is structured by the nurse to benefit the client and is time-limited, meaning that the nurse
     owes a duty to the client during the time they are working together. This duty comprises the promotion of health and
     safety.

     The relationship is not a social one; it is conducted within professional guidelines and is continually evaluated by the
     nurse through reflection upon their practice (Figure 28.2). Reflection utilizes feedback from peers and mentors, and
     includes personal examination of one's own actions and experience. Level of client participation in the relationship
     varies with the client's health state.

The science in the process includes analysis of data collected by assessment and observation, which means leading
the nurse to hypothesize causes, priorities, and solutions. Considering risks and benefits of available resources, the
client's ability to participate, and the nurse's own skill and experience, the team formulates a plan of care. Decision-
making from use of critical thinking in the nursing process is described as clinical judgment (Hughes, 2008).
Clinical judgment utilizes five repeating components of the nursing process:

    · assessment, recognizing cues
    · analysis, interpreting cues, setting client-specific priorities
    · planning, generating solutions/goals with client's input
    · implementation, taking action, nursing interventions
    · evaluation, determining outcomes as effective or revising the plan

The process is ongoing and flexible throughout the therapeutic relationship, adapting to client needs and focused on
outcomes of care. It is important to recognize risks early in the process and to evaluate plans of care continually for
effectiveness. The plan of care is shared with other professionals who collaborate in the interdisciplinary team care
planning process, which is a meeting of the client and those involved in the client's care, and may include the family
members.

     Access "Clinical reasoning: What do nurses, physicians, and students reason about?" (https://openstax.org/r/
     77nursereasong) to read insights into interprofessional collaboration in practice through interviews with nurses and
     nursing students, physicians, and medical students.

     Assessment in Mental Health Nursing
     The first step, assessment, is the collection of available data to inform care planning. Assessment in nursing is
     important to identify problems and develop a plan of care. Nursing Assessment and Clinical Tools addresses
     physical assessment for the PMH client, and Nursing Assessment and Care Plans covers use of the mental status
     exam.

     Psychiatric-mental health nurses specifically assess clients by observing behaviors, interviewing and interacting
     with the client, and reviewing the health record. This process of gathering data is important in determining what the
     priority problems are and being able to move to the next step in the nursing process. The nurse might observe the
     client pacing in the hallway and ask about anxiety. They might ask about thoughts of self-harm and also look for any
     physical injuries. The data they collect during the assessment drives their analyses and implementation of their
     plans. Basic observation means taking notice of information or events, reporting them, and synthesizing the
     information to identify priority problems. The professional nurse recognizes cues found in observation to determine
     actual and potential problems. The nurse analyzes these cues to actively formulate the nursing plan of care.

     Data and cues collected during assessment fall into different categories: objective, subjective, primary, and
     secondary. Objective data is what the nurse obtains through their abilities and senses. Nurses may see the client's
     attire, listen to the client's lung sounds, or detect a client's hand tremor by touch during physical assessment.
     Sources of objective data include use of screening tools or checklists, visual observation and monitoring, or
     measuring vital signs. Statistical reports, such as laboratory and diagnostic testing results, constitute objective data.

     Subjective data is what the client shows or says. Subjective data is obtained from the client's expressions, whether
     verbal or nonverbal. Nurses may listen to client comments or notice that the client has been crying. When eliciting
     subjective information, the nurse must be culturally sensitive (see Cultural Considerations). Expressions, body
     language, and emotions should not be interpreted through a lens of the nurse's own experience or beliefs. In order
     to interpret subjective data, the nurse should ask open-ended questions that do not lead the client, such as, "How
     can we best help you while you are here?" or "Are there customs you would like to keep or members of your family
     you would like involved in your care?" Sources of subjective data include use of appropriate questionnaires,
     interviews, or screening tools; therapeutic groups; clients' written expressions, compositions, or artwork; and the
     interaction between nurse and client during one-on-one time.

     Primary data is collected directly from the client by the nurse. Any information shared with, or witnessed by, the
     nurse from the client is primary data, so this information may be objective or subjective in nature. When clients
     answer the nurse's questions or are withdrawn from interaction, these are both sources of primary data. During
     transfer of care, the offgoing nurse provides primary data.

     Secondary data is collected or expressed by another and reviewed by the nurse. Information about the client is
     secondary data, such as family reports, medical records, and clinical documentation by other professionals.
     Secondary data may be objective or subjective in nature, for example, a discharge summary from another facility or
     a family member's opinion. During transfer of care, the oncoming nurse receives secondary data and will go on to
     collect their own primary data.

     All data collection in nursing assessment is to be done without bias and this may be a learned skill for some nurses.
     Without personal reflection, the nurse may draw automatic conclusions from client data that may be inaccurate.
     Some client behaviors, perspectives, or histories may provoke emotional responses in the nurse, which can
     influence the therapeutic relationship. Collaboration with colleagues of diverse backgrounds may be helpful, as may
     the guidance of a mentor. Every nurse should continually work to increase their self-awareness in client care.

Analysis in Mental Health Nursing
After completing the assessment and data collection, the nurse analyzes the information to partner with the client
to make a determination of what the client's problem or level of risk may be. Together, they identify the client's
strengths, such as motivation, physical health, or family support. As mentioned, the nurse approaches all client
interaction and assessment with cultural sensitivity.

This type of analysis entails critically examining the meaning of identified cues that inform the nurse on necessary
levels of support for the client. For example, if the nurse assesses the client's mood as sad and observes they are
tearful and the client verbalizes suicidal thoughts, the nurse would analyze this information to determine the client
is at risk for suicide. This problem, or risk, will then focus the care planning and interventions. Analysis also requires
prioritizing client problems and needs and creating nursing hypotheses. Partnership with the client is essential to
the process because this therapeutic alliance enhances outcomes for the client.

The nurse prioritizes the urgency of identified problems and needs. For example, a client with suicidal ideation who
has lost their employment has a safety need at a higher level than the social/economic need to be reemployed
(though this need is to be acknowledged). To prioritize client needs, the nurse utilizes clinical judgment. This
requires the nurse to construct clinical questions and create answers by analyzing assessment data. Again,
partnership with the client is part of this process, which means that the nurse establishes trust with the client (and
family, as indicated) and invites their participation in prioritizing the challenges presented. The nurse shares
information that is relevant to the client's care or status, and the nurse acknowledges the client as the expert on
self.

Nurses may use established models to prioritize care, such as Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, wherein a client with
panic due to an asthma attack would need respiratory support first. This is an example of prioritizing physiological
needs over safety needs, though the client's feeling of anxiety would be addressed immediately upon physical
stabilization. Another consideration in prioritization is the concept of life-saving, health-saving, and health-
promoting, which would prioritize interventions for blood loss, for instance, over intent for self-injury, over long-term
recovery. Nurses must nevertheless remain aware of the importance to the client of all problems and needs.

Nurses should also remain self-aware for potentially inappropriate focus on tasks to complete quickly and
successfully, at the expense of missing the need for more complex interventions. For example, the nurse may be
more likely to first obtain and document vital signs because these tasks are easy to complete. If the client has
stated a clear intent for self-harm, however, exploring the existence of a self-harm plan would take priority over
obtaining the vital signs. Ultimate outcomes of care must address all aspects of clients' well-being.

Identifying client strengths helps to build a relationship where the nurse shares the power with the client.
Identification of client strengths, abilities, and available resources also extends the helping relationship toward the
client's independence. Further, this action informs nursing interventions, for example, providing printed material for
clients at their reading literacy level and in their primary language, encouraging connection with community
supports, or verbalizing positive feedback for a client's efforts.

Planning in Mental Health Nursing
The next step, planning, is the cognitive process of generating solutions to identified problems, setting goals of
treatment, and developing nursing interventions to accomplish these objectives. Health-care knowledge and
research changes and evolves rapidly.

One part of planning is developing a nursing diagnosis. The North American Nursing Diagnosis Association
developed a classification system for nursing diagnosis terminology. The organization still exists as NANDA
International (NANDA-I). Rodríguez-Suárez et al. (2023) acknowledge some uncertainty of the effectiveness of this
taxonomy, asserting that further research is indicated to determine current relevance to population health and
health promotion.

     Medicine website.

     Another part of planning is remaining up to date on current best evidence for client care and using that evidence to
     inform interventions. The American Nurses Association (ANA) (2023) emphasizes nurses' use of current scientific
     knowledge over tradition or nurses' preference for client care. This approach permits the inclusion of evolving
     health-care knowledge (ANA, 2023). The term evidence-based practice (EBP) refers to the intersection of formal
     research findings, nursing competency, and the preferences of the client and family (Figure 28.3). These factors are
     all considered when planning client care.

     FIGURE 28.3 Formal research findings, nursing competency, and the preferences of the client and family intersect to form evidence-based

     In addition to evidence-based practice, health-care organizations have policies to guide procedures. These policies
     may be based on scientific information from pharmaceutical companies and medical research, legal aspects of data
     management, government safety regulations, and the organization's mission and code of ethics. When nurses plan
     client care, such policies can be a source of information. Kelly et al. (2021) found little evidence to support nurses'
     routine use of organizational policies, despite the policies' proposed intent of safe practice. Over 200 direct care
     nurses were surveyed as to their use of policies for clinical guidance in the study. The time away from client care to
     review policies was cited as one reason nurses did not consult policies more frequently. The authors recommend
     organizational efforts to streamline and update policies to address these barriers (Kelly et al., 2021).

     Nursing competency refers to the skill level of the nurse and to the skill level of any others to whom the nurse may
     delegate. Competency also includes consulting available mentors, preceptors, and other professionals. This
     consideration will enable the nurse to plan care that is safe and effective and utilize appropriate resources, such as
     making referrals or requesting assistance with procedures or decision-making.

     Respect for client preferences is key and includes cultural considerations. The client's engagement in treatment
     enhances success of the plan of care. The nurse encourages the client to express their values and beliefs and
     participate in goal-setting throughout the care planning process. The nurse can pose relevant queries such as, "How
     can we assist you from a spiritual or cultural perspective?" or "How do you see your family's involvement in your
     care?"

     Goal-Setting and Implementation in Mental Health Nursing
     Goal-setting is a collaborative process with the client that entails formulating interventions customized to
     accomplish specific goals of treatment, or to avoid risks (NCSBN, 2019a). The step of implementation is the nursing
     action of putting the items from the plan of care into effect. Implementation may be through delegation, as

appropriate, and may involve other members of the client's treatment team. The nurse takes therapeutic action to
implement solutions addressing the highest priority needs/problems first. These actions are interventions based on
nursing knowledge, with goals planned to promote, maintain, or restore a client's health. All aspects of the
implementation phase involve team collaboration and nursing documentation.

A client may be working with the nurse on stress management, for example. In partnership with the client, the nurse
develops stress-reduction strategies that include prescribed short-term use of anxiolytic medication, mindfulness
exercises, and dietary modifications. The nurse must establish rationales for the interventions to provide a scientific
basis and support the plan. During implementation, the nurse conducts health teaching and monitoring, and the
client reports their experiences. For example, the nurse sets goals for care as: the client will teach back information
about prescribed medication by (date); client will practice mindfulness exercises daily by (date); and client will
verbalize a diet plan by (date). The client approves the plan, or suggests changes, and the nurse and client work
together to accomplish the goals within the time frame.

        REAL RN STORIES

Nurse: Maria P, RN ADN
Years in Practice: One
Clinical Setting: Mental health unit of a general hospital
Facility Location: Virginia

In my first year of RN practice, I was twenty-six years old and I worked on the mental health unit of a general
hospital in Virginia. During a busy shift, I allowed a young adult assigned to me to go out into the unit courtyard,
unescorted, "to work off some energy" by playing basketball. The client eloped over the courtyard wall.

The unit manager and the unit educator spent time with me to notify the doctor, fill out the incident report, and
process the event. I was tearful as they talked to me and I felt like resigning from my job. Though the client was
safely returned by the family later that day, I was so embarrassed and extremely disappointed in myself.

The manager and educator helped me to explore my accountability and my decision-making throughout the
situation. With their support, I reviewed my actions and realized that I had missed earlier signs that day of
impulsivity in the client's behavior (grabbing food from another's tray at breakfast, and refusing a PRN medication
offered by the med nurse). I had skipped a significant portion of clinical reasoning by taking an action without
thorough assessment.

Evaluation in Mental Health Nursing
Measurable responses to interventions utilized during the implementation phase of nursing care planning are called
outcomes of care. The next step in the nursing process, evaluation, is the process of reviewing these outcomes of
care for effectiveness, as defined by the nurse and the client together. Goals may be described as met, partially met,
or unmet.

Met goals result in the client's stability, improved functional capacity, safety and recovery, and client satisfaction
with the outcome. Evaluations where goals are met include, for example, intended effects of medication,
management of medication side effects, or client's report of reduced anxiety.

Partially met goals may include client sleeps four hours each night with goal of six hours or client is able to speak
with family member on the telephone with goal of client and family member face-to-face therapy session. If goals
are partially met, the nurse and client should review the plan to determine if interventions need to be altered.

Unmet goals may include client being uncomfortable due to side effects of newly prescribed medication or client
reporting inability to sleep. Unmet goals call for modification or revision of the plan. Goals may be considered
partially met or unmet if not reached within the established time frame.

Use of the Nursing Process throughout the Therapeutic Relationship

The process of nursing care may occur over acute or extended-time situations, but no matter the situation, the
nurse must continually apply clinical judgment. The therapeutic relationship has no mandated time frame. It covers
952  28 · Critical Thinking in Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing

     the time nurses and clients work together, whether over moments or months. To review the phases of the
     therapeutic relationship, in the preorientation phase, the nurse learns about the client and prepares for the
     interaction. During orientation, the nurse establishes rapport with the client and sets the expected time frame
     ("During your stay here," or "As long as you are seen in this clinic") so the client knows what to expect. Working is
     the active phase where the nurse and client implement the plan of care. Termination brings the relationship to an
     end; the nurse and client mutually review their work together.

     As nurses develop expertise and are exposed to more client care situations, they refine the cognitive components of
     care planning, enabling them to adapt the plans to client needs and available resources. Planning should always be
     individualized, include all steps of the process, and not become mechanical or habitual. This is the meaning of
     person-centered care, when the client is the focused recipient of nursing care.

     Expert nurses who manage client care situations are not resorting to default actions. They are using clinical
     judgment that incorporates learned pattern recognition, rapid response abilities, and wisdom. Consider these two
     examples. In a crisis with a client experiencing psychosis, the nurse manages the situation within an hour. By
     contrast, a nurse and client working together in a community setting may review the client's employment prospects
     and discuss strategies for success over scheduled weekly interactions. The similarity in these two scenarios is that
     the nurse uses clinical judgment to plan problem-based care. The difference is that this planning can occur in
     moments or over time.

Referring to the two care plan scenarios just described, the nurse-client relationship may terminate when the
nurse's assignment ends or when the client is discharged from care. The nursing process is ongoing through the
point at which other professionals assume care or the client is no longer utilizing the service.

Continuous monitoring is a concept in nursing care in general, such as vital signs or physical assessments every four
hours or hourly rounding. This is because clients' conditions can change and then the nurse's plan of care will
change. This real-life complexity is now portrayed in questions on the next generation style testing on the National
Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX), which began in 2023. These questions offer scenarios and unfolding case
studies to better replicate actual nursing practice.

     28.2 Measurement of Clinical Judgment

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define how the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) utilizes the Clinical Judgment
             Measurement Model (CJMM)

         · Discuss assessment of nursing knowledge by the NCLEX
         · Apply clinical judgment to client care

     Nursing judgment is a learned skill. The ability to think critically develops more fully over time in nursing practice.
     Basic understanding of the process is evaluated pre-licensure during the nurse's academic preparation and on the
     licensure examination for nursing graduates.

     Every two years, the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) investigates nursing education and
     aspects of the nursing workforce via survey in the United States. These surveys provide information on the type of
     practice required and the availability of working nurses. This information is utilized for curriculum development in
     schools of nursing and workforce planning in health-care settings as well as in the development of questions for
     NCLEX. This section addresses the measurement of nursing judgment, specifically on the licensure examination,
     and in nursing practice.

     National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) and the Clinical Judgment
     Measurement Model

     American states and territories establish what constitutes legal nursing practice through their own Nurse Practice
     Acts to safeguard recipients of nursing care and to protect nurses within the profession. These acts specify
     requirements of nursing education programs, requirements to be licensed as a nurse, scopes of practice at the
     levels of professional, practical, assistant, and advanced nursing, and disciplinary action for violations in practice.
     These are regulatory functions of state boards of nursing. The National Council of State Boards of Nursing
     (NCSBN) is the agency that coordinates these regulatory functions in the United States.

     Boards of nursing also have research functions, as described in the preceding paragraph regarding surveys.
     Evidence-based research informs regulatory criteria and contributes to the overall nursing and health-care
     database. In 2023, this research action resulted in changes to the National Council Licensure Examination for
     Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN).

             LINK TO LEARNING

     This brief video introduces the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (https://openstax.org/r/77NCSBNHistory)
     to provide information about the work and scope of NCSBN, the history of the organization, its work, and its role in
     protecting the public.

     Presentation of the Clinical Judgment Measurement Model (CJMM)
     Utilizing research data, the NCSBN identified a need to measure nursing judgment and knowledge of clinical skills
     more realistically. Because the NCLEX-RN measures graduate nurses' understanding of safe practice at the entry
     level, this was a critical public health and professional competency initiative. The Clinical Judgment Measurement
     Model (CJMM) was developed for this purpose. It is a decision-making model for answering questions on the
     NCLEX-RN, though it is valuable in nursing practice as well.

             LINK TO LEARNING

     The NCSBN created the Clinical Judgment Measurement Model (CJMM) (https://openstax.org/r/77CJMM2) based on
     the organization's research regarding nurses' real-life use of clinical judgment. The CJMM was developed to enable
     testing of nurses' clinical learning by the licensure examination.

Nurses may be familiar with other decision-making models. One is a simple visual flowchart or algorithm called a
decision tree, which graphs predictions or consequences of actions (Figure 28.4).

FIGURE 28.4 A decision tree is one type of decision-making model that can be used by nurses in practice. (attribution: Copyright Rice
University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

Another model is the scientific PICOT format that nurses may have used in academic research courses. A clinical
inquiry is proposed by the researcher and formatted to streamline a literature search process. Figure 28.5 shows an
example.

FIGURE 28.5 This format is a model of inquiry. P=Population or Problem being studied, I=Intervention/nursing action, C=Comparison to

Decision-making models serve as frameworks for analysis of possible solutions to identified problems. Decision-
making models assist with clarifying collected data toward a conclusion for best action. The CJMM presents a
decision-making process specifically designed for nursing practice.

Levels of Clinical Decision-Making/Reasoning
The CJMM has layers, which represent levels of decision-making. The nurse applies critical-thinking skills to discern
what clients need at any given time.

Layers 0 and 1 represent a continual loop between client needs, application of nursing judgment to clinical
956  28 · Critical Thinking in Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing

     decisions, and back to more assessment of client needs. Expert nursing practice was defined by Benner's classic
     work (1982) as the length of practice at five years or more wherein the client's needs are identified and addressed
     by clinical decisions using clinical judgment. Notice the word satisfied is shown at Level 1, meaning goals of
     treatment were met. The expert nurse goes on to the next client need from here, or supports the client's recovery,
     repeating Layers 0 and 1 through termination of the therapeutic relationship. The process is grasped intuitively by
     the nurse at this level of practice and nursing interventions are efficiently focused (Ozdemir, 2019).

     Layers 2, 3, and 4 depict the actions nurses can take, and the concepts to consider, if the client's needs are not
     satisfied (meaning goals are unmet or partially met). These words are shown in the middle of the graphic at Level 2,
     showing that evaluation leads back to more review of the data. Layers 2, 3, and 4 are guidelines that can result in
     outcomes of care, which will again be evaluated for effectiveness. The entire process is learned over time as nurses
     increase in practice proficiency.

     Layer 4 includes the environment, which is everything surrounding the nurse-client relationship that will influence
     outcomes. The term individual refers to nurses themselves and to nurses' abilities (Table 28.1). All of these
     considerations factor in to determine if the client's need can be met in this environment by this individual. Keep in
     mind that the CJMM was developed to evaluate cognitive skill of the test-taker. Therefore, on Layer 4 under
     Individual Factor Examples, "Candidate Characteristics" refers to the nursing graduate taking the NCLEX-RN. In
     licensed practice, this would be "Nurse Characteristics."

Assessment of Nursing Knowledge by the NCLEX-RN

As stated, the NCLEX-RN changed in 2023 due to research evidence of the need for nursing graduates to show
increased understanding of safe practice at the entry level. Focus and format of the questions on the licensure
examination changed to meet this goal. Time frame for completion of the NCLEX-RN examination is five hours after
the candidate opens the test on the computer. The examination presents the test-taker with items (questions) that
pose problem-solving scenarios, in short form as specific questions, or in longer form as client need categories.
Candidates can expect items to address categories as depicted in Figure 28.6.

FIGURE 28.6 This graph shows the approximate breakdown in categories of questions on the NCLEX, but distributions may vary slightly
based on individual examinations. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

To guide the candidate's study, meaning of the categories depicted left-to-right on the graph are as follows:

    · Management of care means the nurse observes scope of practice guidelines, incorporates all available
        supports, delegates and directs others, and conserves resources.

    · Pharmacological and parenteral therapies mean the nurse safely administers or supervises safe
        administration of prescribed medications, fluids, and blood products by all routes and teaches and monitors
        indication, intended effect, side effects, and adverse reactions.

    · Physiologic adaptation means the nurse manages and promotes clients' adjustment to emergency, corrective
        or supportive care, interventions, and treatments.

    · Reduction of risk potential means the nurse monitors for complications of clients' diagnoses and educates and
        intervenes to mitigate potential harms and adverse outcomes to care and treatment.

    · Safety and infection control means the nurse recognizes and mitigates harm and risks, observes practice
        standards, monitors client acuity, and educates others.

    · Health promotion and maintenance means the nurse brings preventative care and wellness care at all stages
        of human development, detects potential problems, and conducts health screening.

    · Psychosocial integrity means the nurse promotes clients' adaptation and stress management, teaches others,
        integrates nursing interventions, advocates for emotional, social, and spiritual wellness, and delivers
958  28 · Critical Thinking in Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing

             psychiatric nursing care in therapeutic settings.
         · Basic care and comfort mean the nurse provides and directs physical care for basic needs, such as nutrition,

             hydration, comfort, elimination, activity, and rest.

     The essence of nursing practice is the identification of client needs, which are then addressed through the nursing
     process. By successful completion of the NCLEX-RN, nursing graduates show their competence at the entry level of
     practice. Nursing graduates must think about how all these categories apply in psychiatric-mental health (PMH)
     nursing.

     Computerized Interactive Questions
     The NCLEX-RN items measure clinical judgment by case study and stand-alone questions. Case studies present
     multiple questions about a realistic nursing care scenario. Stand-alone items ask for application of the six elements
     in Layer 3 of the CJMM, which are steps of the nursing process, and, as discussed, depict the actions the nurse can
     take. Answers may be entered by "click to specify" or "click to highlight" chosen responses. Test item formats
     include bow-tie, drag and drop, drop-down, extended multiple response, and matrix. Visualizing questions on a split
     screen is another new feature of the exam.

         · Bow tie: Move provided answers to provided categories.
         · Drag and drop: Move provided answers to the correct target.
         · Drop down: Select an option from text, chart, or table.
         · Extended multiple response: Select all applicable responses; partial credit is awarded for items with more

             than one key.
         · Matrix: Select from a table of options in columns or rows.

     Presented in the next section will be examples of these question types used in an evolving case study.

     Available Resources
     Knowledge base and examination preparation together are essential for NCLEX success.

     Schools of nursing provide preparation for the NCLEX throughout the nursing program, many utilizing a software
     package. Near graduation, programs offer more specific preparation in the forms of exit exams, capstone projects,
     clinical preceptorship/field placements, or wrap-up components of the school's software product. In addition, final
     semester students frequently present a project that is designed to bring together multiple concepts of nursing
     practice.

     There are numerous NCLEX preparation offerings. Nursing graduates may personally decide how to customize the
     process. What is important to the test-taker? Graduates should consider their own learning style. Printed materials,
     online formats, mobile applications, videos on demand, practice questions, recorded mini-lectures, question
     libraries, and real-time study groups, coaches, and tutors are all available.

     Graduates may want to consider whether the study resource contains access to customized study help and access
     to user reviews. Cost is another factor, whether purchase or subscription. The testing programs selected by the
     graduate's school of nursing can serve as a guide for NCLEX prep or prompt investigation into what other schools
     use. Important to consider is practice with simulated adaptive NCLEX-style test items. The graduate's selection of
     preparation packages should include those that provide a focus on Next Gen type questions.

     Application of Clinical Judgment to Client Care

     Nursing graduates can think of the NCLEX-RN as a safety test. The test evaluates candidates' ability to decide how
     to proceed in client care situations, not memorization of answers to standard questions. Expect scenarios posing
     complex decisions that require cultural competence and use of available resources. NCLEX-RN seeks to present
     situations that occur in real health-care settings. There is an increased focus on client acuity and nursing

management of change in condition. The goal is improvement in care that avoids medical errors by emphasizing
clinical judgment.

Specific to PMH nursing, the licensure exam will address nursing process in care of clients experiencing disorders
covered in this textbook, recognition of signs and symptoms, risk factors, aspects of recovery, legal and ethical
concerns, and nurses' self-care. Psychopharmacology, therapies, theories, client behaviors, and clients' experience
will also be topics for test items.

Collaboration for Client Care Approaches
As presented in this chapter, evidence-based practice is a combination of science, nursing expertise, and client
preferences. Quality and Safety Education for Nurses (QSEN) concepts call for multiple health-care professionals to
practice in partnership with the client and family. Interprofessional collaboration is endorsed by multiple
professional organizations (University of North Carolina, n.d.). NCLEX-RN test items will present problem-solving
scenarios to evaluate skills in these domains.

     Developing Clinical Judgment
     According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN):

     As one of the key attributes of professional nursing, clinical judgment refers to the process by which nurses
     make decisions based on nursing knowledge (evidence, theories, ways/patterns of knowing), other
     disciplinary knowledge, critical thinking, and clinical reasoning (n.d., para 1).

     Clinical judgment, involving critical thinking and clinical reasoning as applied to nursing care scenarios, is an
     essential skill for the nurse to provide quality care. Clinical judgment develops over time in clinical practice through
     exposure to various client care situations with application of these thought processes to nursing practice.

     Prior to licensure, schools reinforce learning of clinical judgment using the Clinical Judgment Measurement Model.
     NCLEX test items are intended to reflect the atmosphere of the clinical setting where actions, including errors, have
     consequences. Safety and effectiveness of all nursing care depends upon accurate application of the nursing
     process.

     Nurses can develop clinical judgment through both independent and collaborative actions, such as:

     · Ask coworkers for tips and suggestions; observe and assist others.
     · Receive feedback professionally and request review of work.

28.3 · Applying Clinical Judgment to Client Care through Unfolding Case Study Dissection                                    961

    · Review the medical record and learn to make connections to care, for example, medications to lab values, vital
        signs, or client experience.

    · Become familiar with screening tools and assessment resource material.
    · Ask questions about the rationale for procedures.
    · Review unit-based data for fall rates, infections, or readmissions.
    · Read research abstracts, follow up on those of interest.

Collaborative action:

    · Engage with clients, families, and other professionals in care planning.
    · Seek supportive relationships with educators and mentors in the workplace.
    · Discuss research evidence with other nurses.
    · Participate in unit-based or facility-wide activities for education, community involvement, or employee

        morale.
    · Accompany clients off-unit to imaging or diagnostic procedures, to support the client and interact with other

        professionals in those departments.
    · As appropriate, be present when consultants, therapists, and medical providers interact with clients to

        support the client and learn how services interface.
    · Request a "shadow shift," especially in areas connected to your unit, for example, emergency department and

        medical-surgical floor, intensive care unit and step-down unit.

28.3 Applying Clinical Judgment to Client Care through Unfolding Case Study
Dissection

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Interpret information given in NCLEX question types that promotes critical thinking and the use of clinical
        judgment in PMH nursing

    · Examine an unfolding case study in mental health as an exemplar of the type of NCLEX questions

A nursing skill for success on NCLEX, and in practice, is the ability to divide a clinical picture into its elements. This
skill is useful in all areas of nursing practice and enables nurses to understand the complexities of client care. This
understanding not only leads to planning of person-centered nursing care, it also enhances nurses' personal
satisfaction in their work.

Interpret Information Given in NCLEX Question Types

This section offers guidelines to interpret information presented in NCLEX question types. Nurses use critical
thinking to interpret data, which leads them to apply clinical judgment. NCLEX question formats seek to measure
knowledge necessary for safe practice at the entry level of nursing. The exam offers partial credit for select
questions.

Drag and Drop
These question types pertain to a client care scenario. Answers are chosen by identifying the steps in a procedure or
components of a process, such as prioritizing the client's room placement or staff assignment or filling in blanks in a
description. Taking the licensure exam, the computer screen shows information on the right and left sides. Answers
are moved to appropriate spaces by dragging or by highlighting and clicking arrow keys. All options may or may not
be used.

Multiple Choice/Multiple Response
Multiple choice questions have traditionally required application of knowledge and analysis of data, demonstrated
by selecting one correct answer for one question. Multiple choice test questions still make up most of NCLEX items,
providing statements that are answered from a list of options.

NCLEX-RN seeks to present higher-order multiple choice questions. This means answers come not from the
candidate's memory but from learning and problem-solving ability. Test-takers are asked to interpret data and apply
clinical reasoning to address client situations. Questions may have more than one answer.
962  28 · Critical Thinking in Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing

     Highlight--Text or Table
     This question type requires highlighting or removing highlighting by use of the computer mouse or keyboard. A case
     study provides client care information wherein the candidate highlights the cues prompting a nurse to plan
     interventions (take action). Questions of this type call for clinical decision-making and may have as many as ten
     possible answers. Partial credit is given for these questions.

     Bow Tie/Trend
     The bow tie question is identified by the visual design it forms on the computer screen. A client care situation is
     presented with data and the test-taker is to discern whether it requires or does not require nursing intervention. The
     scenario may offer cues to a potential complication of the client's condition if interventions are not taken.

     On the computer screen, tabs are located at the top of an image containing client information, for example, vital
     signs, nurses' notes, or other data from the medical record. These test items are created to test all aspects of the
     CJMM: recognizing and analyzing cues, formulating and prioritizing hypotheses, generating possible solutions,
     taking actions, and evaluating outcomes of care as effective or not effective.

     A trend test item prompts the nurse to forecast future client needs over time. Trend questions may utilize computer
     screen images similar to the bow tie to test candidates' ability to predict and prepare for what may be needed next.

     Examining a Case Study with NCLEX Style Questions

     In order to make clinical judgments and decisions, nurses are called to reflect on what is known (from formal
     education or from life experience) and apply this to clinical scenarios. Nurses can practice these skills using case
     studies. An unfolding case study is an example of a client care scenario where the situation changes. This seeks to
     replicate a real-life situation and to call upon decision-making skills of the nurse to respond as client needs present
     or change.

     Generating an action based on gathered cues is likely a cognitive process nurses have previously utilized. Other
     types of decision-making nurses use include predetermining success or selecting different actions based on
     changes in the situation. In the case study presented here, the nurse, Jan, prepares for the therapeutic relationship
     with the client, Dylan, in the emergency department.

     Unfolding Case Study: Therapeutic Relationship
     Dylan, a young adult, is referred to the emergency department from an appointment at the local mental health clinic
     for elevated vital signs and change in condition. Dylan was transported by a family member who remains in the

     Before meeting with Dylan, the nurse, Jan, reviews accompanying information, which reveals the following:

Upon interview, Dylan does not return Jan's greeting, avoids eye contact, answers questions slowly, and appears to
struggle with concentration.

Jan explains care and says, "I'll be working with you while you're here in the emergency department. How can we
help you today? I understand you came from your clinic appointment."

Dylan states, "They sent me here because of my blood pressure," and correctly identifies the environment as the
"hospital ER." His clothing is soaked with perspiration. Dylan flexes fingers, shakes hands, swallows repeatedly, and
states, "My neck feels tight."

Vital signs: oral temp 38°C, pulse 116 irregular, respirations 28 irregular, BP 156/104, repeat BP 148/96.

At this stage, Jan recognizes cues, analyzes cues (identifies problems), and prioritizes (identifies the priority
problem).

     Assessment and Analysis
     In this scenario, assessment information consists of secondary data in the form of a printed report from the
     community clinic. During this preorientation phase, Jan recognizes the following cues from this data:

           Clinically significant: BP, prescribed medications and dosages and last dose; diagnosis history and
           experience with psychotropic medications; change in social history

     Jan analyzes this information and continues to the orientation phase of the therapeutic relationship. Jan collects
     primary assessment data by interacting with Dylan, observing Dylan's behavior, and taking the vital signs. Jan
     analyzes the combined data as:

           Client responses: oriented to reality, social aspects blunted; diaphoresis, muscle rigidity, fever, elevated
           vital signs, moderate anxiety

           Priority: potential life-threatening medication reaction, symptom cluster for neuroleptic malignant
           syndrome

     Planning and Implementation
     During analysis, Jan forms hypotheses about what could be causing the presenting problems. Jan determines
     problems of fever, elevated vital signs, and moderate anxiety may be due to medication reaction. Jan identifies the
     priority problem and begins to plan additional care and collaboration by generating solutions, considering: What can
     be done? Jan sets goals of treatment and reassures the client.

           Comfort measures, build trust, assure as to safety, monitor condition

           Psychosocial stability and advanced medical care are goals

     Jan implements the plan, moving into the working phase of the therapeutic relationship.

     Jan is working within a shortened time frame due to the severity of the client's condition, which has the potential to
     worsen. Regarding delegation, though a licensed practical nurse or nursing assistant could provide some of the
     basic care, Jan will not delegate any tasks. Dylan's condition is unstable and requires continual assessment by the
     professional nurse. Jan factors all this data into the decision-making. Jan takes action to implement the plan,
     considering: What nursing interventions are indicated? What medical orders can be anticipated?

           Manage moderate anxiety, offer relaxation technique, coordinate care

     Evaluation (and Revision/Continuation of Care)
     As Jan is coordinating care with the prescriber, Dylan's psychosocial status changes. Dylan becomes unable to
     cooperate with the ordered laboratory specimen collection due to confusion and anxiety escalating from moderate
     to severe. Jan evaluates the goal of psychosocial stability as unmet. Jan recognizes these cues of a change in
     condition, which necessitate a change in nursing approach.

Jan revises the plan of care and implements these nursing interventions. They are effective for psychosocial
stability, though medical condition is worsening.

      Manage severe anxiety, repeat directions, reality orientation, assure as to safety

Diagnostic test results come back, and the prescriber arranges a transfer to a higher level of care for intensive
treatment.

      Medical condition worsening; psychosocial condition improving--anxiety reduced due to nursing
      interventions

      Nursing action: Transfer of care--accompany client to ICU, give bedside handoff report to receiving nurse

Dylan is now receptive to interaction with Jan and the prescriber, as they explain the transfer procedure and
rationale. Dylan's family member is brought into the conversation. This is the termination phase of the therapeutic
relationship, and nursing care has been effective for goals of psychosocial stability and advanced medical care.

        REAL RN STORIES

Nurse: Donna K, RN-BC, MSN
Years in Practice: Twelve
Clinical Setting: State hospital
Geographic Location: Florida

Something happened when I worked at the state hospital in Florida that made person-centered care very real to me.
Walter was a fifty-six-year-old who had history of conflict with law enforcement in the local community and,
consequently, was repeatedly admitted to the state hospital. Walter had shown a pattern of stabilizing during
hospital stays, then stopping medication soon after discharge, inevitably becoming paranoid and aggressive and
often being arrested. Social services had investigated issues of finances, transportation, and access, and had been
unable to identify a specific factor to explain Walter's nonadherence to prescribed medication. Some people believe
that clients in state hospitals stay there for life, but we discharged many back to their communities.

Walter's discharge day came due. During discharge teaching, I gave honest praise for Walter's progress during the
stay and mentioned that with medication and follow-up visits, there was every reason for continued success. Walter
looked at me very seriously and said, "Nurse, I can't take that medicine once I get home." I almost said, "Why not?"
out of surprise, but I managed to answer therapeutically and say, "Tell me about that." Walter looked away from me
and said, "It messes with my nature." I have never thought of myself as naïve, but I did not know what Walter was
talking about. We sat in silence for a moment, and I said, "Help me understand that." Walter went on to describe
what I then understood as sexual function side effects. I telephoned the prescriber who joined us for a teaching
session and then worked with Walter to formulate a medication management plan. Walter was discharged as
planned, and I never saw him again, though I will always remember what I learned from our relationship.

Summary

28.1 Nursing Process

This section addresses the nursing process in PMH nursing and the critical thinking involved. Nursing judgment is
applied throughout the nurse-client relationship. The nurse engages in personal reflection as the plan of care
unfolds. The nurse utilizes data collection from available sources, and interprets the data for its meaning in client
care. The nurse and client collaborate to set goals and formulate a plan. Nurses provide competent practice that is
evidence-based. The plan of care is adapted to stated outcomes of care and client needs. The nurse's clinical
judgment guides the process through all phases of the therapeutic relationship.

28.2 Measurement of Clinical Judgment

This section addressed measuring nursing judgment, specifically on the licensure examination, and in nursing
practice. Critical thinking and clinical judgment develop in nursing practice over time and through models like the
CJMM. Schools of nursing evaluate these skills for successful completion of academic courses. The NCLEX evaluates
these skills prior to licensure as a professional nurse. Nurses must act efficiently and safely, while identifying and
seeking to meet client care goals.

28.3 Applying Clinical Judgment to Client Care through Unfolding Case Study Dissection

This section has presented concepts for critical thinking in clinical decision-making in PMH nursing. Recognizing that
client care is complex, NCLEX presents test items to evaluate nurses' ability to manage these variations. Clinical
judgment skills continue in licensed practice. Successfully stabilizing a client's anxiety, pain, or fear will enhance
outcomes of care. In addition, nurses are likely to feel personally rewarded in their careers.

Check Your Understanding Questions

    1. During the admission process, vital signs, lab work, the intake interview, demographic data screens, and
        signature forms need to be completed. The client is tremulous, crying, and rocking in their seat with fists
        clenched. State what action to take first and explain why.

    2. You delegate hygiene and nutrition care to a practical nurse who is newly employed. The client has stabilized
        recently after showing some resistance to care. Identify how this delegation might go.

        medication?

    2. To demonstrate the QSEN competency of informatics, describe how you can use the medical record to create
        a fall prevention plan for a client.

    3. The offgoing RN tells you in report that client, Jorrie, has "settled down" after the nurse provided the unit
        rules guidebook about telephone hours. Do you believe this nursing action was effective? What would you do
        differently?

What Should the Nurse Do?

    1. Kim is the RN working with an eighty-year-old male, Asim, recently widowed and admitted from the primary
        care office after family members took him there out of concern for his mental state. Asim has been reclusive,
        refusing medication, and is not eating. Kim reviews the medical record and learns that Asim is Muslim with
        stated religious preference for the Islamic faith. Kim wants to use evidence-based decision making to
        formulate a plan of care. Combining the three components of EBP, what information should Kim access to
        plan care for Asim?

    2. An adolescent client has been admitted for self-harm behaviors. The client has been diagnosed with type 1
        diabetes and has been refusing insulin, dietary modifications, and medical care. As you approach this client,
        and plan person-centered care, what psychosocial nursing knowledge can guide your interaction?

    3. An older adult client complains of vague pain symptoms without specific signs. Diagnostic imaging has been
        negative. There is no history of injuries. For person-centered care, you consider there may be cultural aspects
        and you plan to open a therapeutic conversation with the client. How might you approach this topic?

Competency-Based Assessments

    1. Compose a plan of care for an adult client who showed a change in condition resulting in revision of the plan
        of care.

    2. Compose an end-of-shift/transfer of care report describing rationale for a revised care plan.

    3. Survey your classmates asking what method or strategy they would use to prioritize a client's needs as a
        guide to care planning. Summarize the results and present your findings to the class through face-to-face
        discussion or posting on your learning management system.

    4. Read this research article about inpatient nurses (https://openstax.org/r/77inpatintnurse) in mental health
        facilities. In a group discussion or short essay, summarize one of the three themes found in this analysis and
        offer one strategy to address the concept.

    5. What are the cues in this client's presentation? Discuss in small groups face-to-face and compare with the
        class. Or, if online, post to the discussion thread on your learning management system and respond to two
        other posts.

APPENDIX A

Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale

The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is an assessment tool to be administered by a mental health professional
who has been trained in its application. It is used in clinical treatment and in research. The scale ranks symptoms
such as depression, anxiety, or psychosis on a scale of 1, if symptoms are not present, to 7, if symptoms are severe.
The BPRS can be useful to determine baseline symptoms or treatment effect. There are different formats of the
instrument; some with ranking by numbers and some with terms, such as mild, moderate, and severe. Items on the
scale indicate interview as the assessment technique, though some are answered through rater observation. Family
report may also provide assessment data.

APPENDIX B

Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale

The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) is an assessment tool used to document presence of tardive
dyskinesia (TD), as well as to follow progression or remission of TD over time (Figure B1). TD can develop within
three months of initial treatment with psychotropic medication; the AIMS is usually administered two to three times
per year. There are different formats of the instrument (including fillable online), some with ranking by numbers and
some with terms, such as mild, moderate, or severe. The scale is generally 12 questions with rating 0 (none) to 4
(severe). The items may be addressed by interview or observation. The client is observed standing, walking, and
sitting. The presence of dentures is noted. The client is asked to extend the arms, move the legs and feet, open the
mouth, and move the tongue while the examiner observes for abnormal movements, contractions, and grimaces.
Lower scores in fewer categories are interpreted as requiring close monitoring, while higher scores in more
categories indicate presence of TD. There are FDA-approved drugs to help stop the progression of TD.

1. a, b, d, f, h

    Rationale: The client has cues that could indicate electrolyte imbalance, head trauma, substance use or

    mental health disorder, such as confusion, delirium, pacing and muttering, agitation, and suspicion. Also, the

    client has exhibited a change in personality and is exhibiting abnormal behavior with reported audio

    hallucinations. The client's blood pressure and heart rate, while still within normal limits, are considered high

    for this client given the circumstances.

    The client is oriented to time, place, and person, which is a normal finding. Likewise, respirations,

    temperature, and oxygen are all within normal limits.

    Rationale: Electrolyte imbalance manifests with confusion, agitation, and altered vital signs.

    Head trauma manifests with confusion, agitation, altered personality, and altered vital signs.

    Mental illness manifests with confusion, agitation, hallucinations of some form, altered personality, and

    suspicion.

    Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)                X

    Rationale: The diagnosis has not been confirmed yet; therefore, haloperidol would not be administered.

    Urodynamic study (UDS) would be conducted to help ascertain a diagnosis. Following release from restraints,

    the client would be under close observation to prevent further outbursts of aggression. There is no need to

    administer insulin or bandage the head of the client. It would not be recommended to allow the mother to sit

    with the client as this might trigger the client to be aggressive again. A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)

    would be conducted to help ascertain a diagnosis.

5. The nurse knows that the client will be prescribed risperidone (Risperdal) that may result in side effects such

    as blurred vision, constipation, and dry mouth. The client will be evaluated for improvement in his condition

    as evidenced by the client engaging in therapeutic modalities and complying with his medication.

    Rationale: Given his symptoms and behavior, the client will be prescribed an antipsychotic medication such

    as risperidone (Risperdal), which may have side effects such as blurred vision, constipation, and dry mouth.

    The client will demonstrate improvement in their condition when they engage in therapeutic modalities and

    comply with medication.

        Rationale: The client has cues that could indicate depression and also has passive suicidal ideation. He is
        recently widowed, isolated, and lonely. The things that used to bring him purpose are not in his daily life
        (church, work). His blood pressure is high, which could indicate anxiety, pain, or hypertension. The client is
        oriented to person, place, time, and situation, which is a normal finding. Likewise, respirations, temperature,
        and oxygen are all within normal limits.

    Rationale: The chronic health conditions, a family history of depression, and the isolation he is experiencing in

    the living facility have all contributed to his depression. He is orientated; therefore, this has not contributed to

    his depression and he does not drink or report any hallucinations so these are not contributing to his

    depression as they could for other clients. His oxygenation level is normal and not a relevant factor.

    Rationale: Depression presents with low mood, sadness, low energy, anhedonia, and can include anxiety and
    insomnia.
    Anxiety manifests with anxiety, insomnia, and can be a warning sign for suicide.
    Insomnia can manifest with anxiety, depression, and can be a warning sign for suicide.
4. a
    Rationale: Safety of the client is always the first priority in planning nursing care.
5. a, b, d, f, g, i
    Rationale: The client is in danger and needs to be placed under observation to ensure his safety (a). The nurse
    should communicate with him therapeutically (b), give him emotional support (f), and validate his
    experiences and feelings (g). To encourage his recovery, he should be encouraged to come out of his room (d)
    and participate in activities that he enjoys (i). He avoids social interaction where he lives, so it would be
    inappropriate for someone from the assisted living community to visit (c) and his medications would not be
    withheld (e). His intake needs to be monitored and encouraged so he would not be eating his meals in private
    in his room (h).

Eats meals in private                                  

        Rationale: Following his stay in the unit, the client should no longer have suicidal ideation, should take his
        medication as prescribed, and join in the activities expected of him when he returns to the assisted living
        community. Having recovered from his depressed state, he should no longer be wishing to isolate himself in
        his room and continue losing weight; also his desire to socialize with others, such as his son, should improve.

Unfolding Case Study

    1. Irritability and anxiety, mild tremors, and headache; last drink was the previous evening at 1900; anxiety 10/
        10; visibly fidgeting; consumes at least one bottle to a bottle and a half of wine every night; taking her
        prescribed benzodiazepine and alprazolam throughout the day rather than just before bedtime; unable to
        participate in family activities; symptoms of insomnia, anxiety; BP, 145/92 mmHg; heart rate, 109 bpm; pain,
        3/10
        Rationale: The client has cues that could indicate alcohol and possibly, benzodiazepine, withdrawal, anxiety,
        irritability, tremors, and headache. Also, the client has exhibited a change in functioning and ability to
        participate in daily life. The client's blood pressure and heart rate are considered high and are indicative of a
        possible withdrawal.
        The client is oriented to person, place, time, and situation, which is a normal finding. Likewise, respirations,
        temperature, and oxygen are all within normal limits.

    2. The nurse will initiate the CIWA scale and medicate the client according to the observations and the client's
        answers to this clinical scale. The client's vitals will be closely monitored throughout the shift to decrease the
        chance that her BP becomes seriously high, increasing her risk for withdrawal seizures. The plan of care will
        include making sure that medication is available in the evening to decrease the client's anxiety and help her
        sleep.

    3. Delirium tremens; 2. Increased BP and HR
        Rationale: The client exhibits signs of anxiety and is at highest risk for withdrawal and DTs.
        Altered physiological signs (vital signs, sweating, tremors) and affect and increased anxiety are signs that are
        currently being exhibited so this is the risk.

    4. 1. Administer lorazepam per CIWA protocol; 2. Monitor for seizures and loss of consciousness.
        Rationale: Lorazepam is indicated to help with withdrawal symptoms and prevent seizures in ETOH
        withdrawal.
        ETOH withdrawal can cause seizures and DTs, which can lead to loss of consciousness.

    5. Nursing action includes comfort measures, hydration, and continued monitoring.
        Rationale: The client reports feeling less anxious and is now lying on her bed ready to take a nap. Her BP and
        pain score are decreased. Nurse has administered lorazepam per CIWA protocol.

    6. Client's BP, pain score, and anxiety are decreased.
        1. Continue to follow the CIWA protocol and repeat based on the scores received.
        2. Encourage the client to drink plenty of water.

3. Monitor for seizures and loss of consciousness.
Rationale: Close monitoring is imperative when a person is withdrawing from ETOH. Medicate as indicated by
the CIWA protocol. Encouraging the client to drink water helps the medications to work better and cleanse
the alcohol from her system. ETOH withdrawal can cause seizures and DTs, which can lead to loss of
consciousness.
