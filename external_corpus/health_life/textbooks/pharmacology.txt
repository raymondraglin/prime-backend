About Pharmacology for Nurses
Summary
Pharmacology for Nurses aims to provide a fundamental understanding of the therapeutic use of drugs so the nurse
can provide safe and effective care to the client. It is important for nursing students to comprehend not only the
mechanisms by which drugs impact the human body, but also how the individual's physiological factors influence
drug responses. Along with a discussion of each body system, the text also reviews the pathophysiology of various
disease processes and medications used in treatment. The textbook is intended for nursing students in an
introductory program. Pharmacology for Nurses helps students prepare for the licensing exam by offering
applicable, real-life content in short, manageable sections; it focuses on common client conditions that nurses will
encounter throughout their career and embraces a skills orientation (what does a nurse do). Most importantly,
Pharmacology for Nurses will give students the confidence to safely administer medications to clients as well as
2  Preface

   provide medication education to clients and their caregivers.

   Pharmacology is often considered one of the more challenging courses in nursing school; however, this book
   presents the information in a holistic manner that ties the disease process to its pharmacological treatment. This
   approach will assist students in connecting the pathophysiology of the disease process to the nursing care of the
   client. Being an effective caregiver requires the nurse to have a solid understanding of the disease process, allowing
   for the proper assessment and treatment of the client. Due to the number of drugs that are used in clinical practice,
   one drug is used for each class of medication as a representative drug prototype to help facilitate student learning.

   Pedagogical Foundation
   Organizational Framework
   The table of contents presents 40 chapter topics organized into 11 units. The first unit, consisting of 3 chapters,
   provides a broad overview of pharmacology, with the following 10 units focused on specific body systems. In each
   unit, after a review of the body system anatomy, the following chapters discuss pathological conditions and how
   they are managed and treated with medications.

   One of the primary reasons for nurses to learn about pharmacology is to provide safe, effective care of the client;
   however, it is also important for nurses to be able to educate the client and family about the drugs that have been
   prescribed. Each chapter has integrated nursing implications and client teaching as features of each class of drugs.

   Although the chapters in Pharmacology for Nurses are written to be mostly independent, they do generally build on
   the understanding gained in the previous chapters, including occasional cross-references, particularly within a body
   system unit. (Please bear this in mind when considering alternate sequence coverage.) Instructors may pair the
   chapters from this pharmacology textbook with similar body system topics in a disease course.

   A working knowledge of basic microbiology, chemistry, and anatomy and physiology will be helpful to students
   reading this book. To develop sound clinical judgement, students will also need an understanding of the nursing
   process to link the disease process to the recommended pharmacological treatment.

       · Unit 1 (Chapters 1-3) introduces an overview of pharmacology, drug administration, and quality and safety.
           Unit 1 also emphasizes the crucial role of ethics in medication administration with a focus on safety, informed
           consent, and the prevention of medication errors. These ethical considerations are vital in today's health care
           context, especially given the current legal implications and potential consequences of drug administration
           errors.

       · Unit 2 (Chapters 4-5) discusses homeostasis within the body and the importance of fluids, electrolytes,
           vitamins, and minerals in the maintenance of homeostasis. Unit 2 also covers alternative/complementary
           therapies.

       · Unit 3 (Chapters 6-8) discusses inflammatory response within the body. Unit 3 includes coverage of drugs to
           treat certain alterations within the immune system, such as infections, cancer, HIV and AIDS, and organ
           transplants.

       · Unit 4 (Chapters 9-15) discusses the nervous system and provides comprehensive coverage of medications
           for pain management, substance abuse, and psychotropics for mental health (including anxiety, depression,
           insomnia, mood stabilization, and psychosis).

       · Units 5-11 (Chapters 16-40) cover medications for system disorders for the cardiovascular, respiratory,
           endocrine, digestive, renal and urinary, reproductive, sensory, and dermatologic systems. This section of the
           book also features the topics of weight management, treatment of transgender and nonbinary individuals, and
           sexually transmitted infections.

   Pharmacology Features
   To further enhance learning, key in-chapter, medication-related features of Pharmacology for Nurses may include:

       · Drug Emphasis Tables: These tables list common medications in a drug class with typical administration
           routes and adult dosing. When relevant, pediatric dosing is listed (as an exception). Both generic and brand
           names of medications are provided, when applicable, to facilitate nurse communication with clients.

       · Drug Prototype Tables: These tables feature a single representative medication from the preceding drug
           emphasis table, listing drug class, mechanism of action, adult dosage, indications, therapeutic effects, drug
           and food interactions, adverse effects, and contraindications. (When there is only one relevant drug in a class,

   Access for free at openstax.org
Preface                                                                                                                 3

        only a drug prototype table is provided.)
    · FDA Black Box Warnings: These feature boxes summarize the boxed warning (https://openstax.org/r/

        ncbinlm) required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for medications with serious, permanent, or
        fatal side effects.
    · Safety Alerts: These feature boxes summarize additional safety considerations in drug administration and
        client care, supporting Quality and Safety Education for Nurses (QSEN) (https://openstax.org/r/qsenorgcoa)
        standards.

Nursing Features
Key in-chapter nursing-related features of Pharmacology for Nurses, depending on chapter content, may include:

    · Nursing Implications Sections: These sections, found throughout the book, emphasize client care
        considerations, such as which vital signs, medication interactions, and adverse effects to monitor.

    · Client Education Boxes: These feature boxes list points the nurse should emphasize in client education, such
        as foods and medications to avoid, symptoms to report, and when to notify the health care provider.

    · Clinical Tips: These brief feature boxes are practical tips that an experienced nurse might share with a less
        experienced colleague--for example, the necessity of monitoring a client's blood pressure to evaluate the
        effectiveness and safety of a drug or assisting clients in making lifestyle adjustments to enhance their blood
        pressure.

    · Special Considerations Boxes: These feature boxes highlight differing drug administration and client teaching
        considerations related to certain client categories, including age/life stage, race/ethnicity/culture, or sex/
        gender. This feature may serve as an in-class discussion prompt.

    · Case Studies: These feature boxes present a hypothetical client scenario, listing the client's medical history,
        current medications, vital signs, and physical examination results. Each scenario is followed by two multiple-
        choice questions for students to apply their knowledge of evidence-based client care. Some case studies
        unfold in several parts throughout the chapter, with new information presented on the same client. Case
        studies can be used as an in-class discussion prompt. The question answers, with explanations, are included
        in the Answer Key for students at the end of the book.

    · Link to Learning: These feature boxes provide online resources, videos, and podcasts that are pertinent to
        students' deeper exploration of the topics. The resources improve nursing students' understanding of how to
        educate clients about pertinent diseases and medications.

    · Trending Today: These feature boxes present general health care trends and news from a variety of sources.
        Boxes may contain online resources and videos. This feature may serve as an in-class discussion prompt.

    · Off-Label Uses: In some instances, if an "off-label (https://openstax.org/r/fdagovpatie)" use (using an FDA-
        approved drug for an unapproved indication) is common for a certain medication (such as the prescription of
        beta blockers for anxiety), the text may mention this so nurses can be aware of the practice.

Pedagogical Features
To support student learning, Pharmacology for Nurses includes these standard elements:

    · Learning Outcomes: Every chapter section begins with a set of clear and concise student learning outcomes.
        These outcomes are designed to help the instructor decide what content to include or assign and can guide
        students on what they can expect to learn and be assessed on.

    · Review Questions: This end-of-chapter feature presents at least 10 multiple-choice questions for students to
        apply their learned knowledge and integrate the chapter (and unit) concepts. The questions focus on client
        scenarios, body system and pharmacological concept review, and medication dosing calculations, as relevant
        to the chapter material. The question answers, with explanations, are included in the Answer Key for students
        at the end of the book.

    · Chapter Summary: Chapter summaries assist both students and instructors by outlining the primary
        subtopics addressed within the chapter.

    · Key Terms: Key terms are presented in bold text and are followed by an explanation in context. Definitions of
        key terms are also listed in the end-of-chapter glossary.

History of Pharmacology

The word pharmacology (from two Greek words, pharmakon, which means "drug" or "medicine," and logos, which
8  1 · Introduction to Pharmacology

   means "study") essentially means the study of medicine; it could also be described as the study of the biological
   effects of chemicals on the body. The history of pharmacology dates back thousands of years, most likely beginning
   with the use of medicinal plants and herbs to relieve symptoms of various diseases. Herbal medications have been
   used in medicine in most civilizations around the globe dating back to ancient times. One generation passed its
   knowledge to the next through oral tradition. Individuals might not know how a treatment worked, but they were
   able to observe its effects.

   The word drug may originate from an old Dutch word, droog, which means dry, or an old French term, drogue. This
   may have referred to "dry barrels," the method for preserving medicinal plants as dry matter or any substance, such
   as animal products or inorganic materials, used in the composition of medicines. The words drug and medication are
   used interchangeably throughout this text.

   More than 2,000 years ago in China, Greece, and Egypt, poultices composed of moldy bread were used to treat open
   wounds. (Was it possible that this had antimicrobial effects?) This treatment was documented in the Ebers papyrus
   (see Figure 1.2), one of the world's oldest preserved medical documents, in 1550 BCE. Medicinal soils were used at
   that time as well. An Anglo-Saxon recipe has been found that dates back 1,000 years ago, and it was recently
   discovered that it is helpful in the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (Hutchings et al., 2019).

   It is true that although many treatments or remedies were simply ineffective, others unfortunately were poisonous.
   However, some treatments did contain substances that worked. Opium, from the poppy plant, has been used for
   centuries to relieve pain and for sedation by the Sumerians and the Greeks. However, the first authentic use was
   recorded by the Greek philosopher Theophrastus in the 3rd century BCE (Stefano et al., 2017).

   The London Pharmacopoeia, first published in 1618, contained over 1,000 simple drugs and over 900 preparations
   and compounds. Progress in the use of pharmacological treatments continued to develop worldwide at differing
   rates, but in the late 1700s, several advances in Europe were made that remain significant today. William Withering
   in England developed digitalis, a derivative from the foxglove plant, which was and still is used in treating heart
   disease and rhythm disorders. Foxglove had been used for centuries in folk medicine, but Withering was able to use
   small amounts of the foxglove leaves for the treatment of dropsy (now known as heart failure). Another
   advancement occurred in 1796 when Edward Jenner developed the first vaccine against smallpox. His work
   established that infectious diseases could be controlled with the deliberate use of vaccination.

   The era of modern pharmacology began approximately 200 years ago. Even in the early 1800s, chemists could
   isolate various chemicals from substances and mixtures. In 1804 or 1805, Fredrich Serturner isolated morphine

from opium, which is still used for treating severe pain (Kumar, 2022). Once scientists could isolate the drugs from
plants and other natural resources, they could better study their actions on the body. Most often, these experiments
were conducted on animals, but occasionally the chemists would test the drug on themselves or on friends and
family, sometimes with disastrous results. The first school of pharmacy was established in 1847 in the country of
Estonia. The oldest pharmacology journal, Naunyn-Schmeideberg's Archives of Pharmacology, was first published in
1873 and is still being published today (Hattori & Seifert, 2023).

Scientists in the 1890s developed aspirin from the bark of the willow tree, using it to treat fevers and mild
discomfort. The link between diabetes mellitus and the pancreas was established in 1889 through the work of
Joseph von Mering and Oskar Minkowski. Approximately 30 years later, in 1921, Frederick Banting and Charles Best
formulated the first insulin preparation (Karamanou et al., 2016; Lee & Yoon, 2021). Paul Ehrlich introduced the first
treatment for syphilis in 1909 by isolating a chemical compound that could be used against a microorganism
(arsphenamine, or compound 606). Arsphenamine is a derivative of arsenic, and although it could successfully treat
syphilis, it did have potentially fatal side effects, which caused it to fall out of use quickly. Shortly after that, in 1928,
Alexander Fleming discovered that Penicillium notatum mold prevented the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and
ushered in the era of antibiotic use. Millions of lives have been saved since then by using antibiotics to treat
infectious diseases such as pneumonia, sepsis, gangrene, scarlet fever, syphilis, gonorrhea, meningitis, and
tuberculosis.

Although plants and natural resources are still used today, they can be a finite resource. The development of new
medicines has continued to evolve with the synthesis of drugs in the laboratory and the use of biomolecules or
biologics. (Biologics will be discussed in further detail later in this chapter.) There have been tremendous strides in
the development of medications that have revolutionized (and will continue to revolutionize) the treatment of
disease and our understanding of the human body.

Interdisciplinary Nature of Pharmacology

The nurse administers medication as part of a team that includes other professions. The health care provider
(physician, physician's assistant, or nurse practitioner) orders the drug indicated to treat the client. (The term client
is interchangeable with patient in some settings.) The pharmacist evaluates the client and their situation and verifies
the appropriateness of the requested medication and its dose for the client. Then, the pharmacist may dispense the
medication, recommend the appropriate time for administration, and complete teaching to the client. In the hospital
setting, the nurse assesses the client and the potential effects of the medication and then administers the drug after
determining the safety to the client. A social worker may become involved if issues of non-adherence to the
medication regimen are found or if the client cannot afford the drug once discharged from the hospital. These are
just a few of the health care roles involved in the pharmacological care of the client, and often these roles overlap in
practice. Communication between professions is crucial in delivering the best care to the client. The concept of
collaborative practice, also known as interprofessional (IP) collaboration, within health care professions is viewed as
"best practice" because inadequate collaboration may adversely affect the delivery of health care and the safety of
the client. More efficient use of resources also results from IP teamwork.

Health care providers should understand each other's roles to prevent mistakes. Competence in interprofessional
collaboration is crucial for effective teamwork among physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and others. Interprofessional
teamwork improves the efficiency of client care, helps lower costs to the client and the institution, improves client
outcomes, and enhances the delivery of holistic care. It also boosts job satisfaction and reduces staff burnout.
Maintaining competency includes understanding team goals, having a shared identity, and committing to safe client
care while relying on mutual respect and trust. Effective communication and decision-making involves active
listening and embracing each discipline's roles in client care.

Pharmacology and Clinical Nursing Practice

Knowledge about pharmacology and the various drugs prescribed and administered to clients is a major part of the
nurse's role. Even when not administering the medications directly to the client, it is crucial to the client's care.
Nurses must understand the pharmacotherapeutic effects of the drugs in their clinical practice. Drugs have intended
or therapeutic effects--these are effects that are expected and desired from that particular medication. However,
drugs may also have undesirable adverse effects or side effects.
10  1 · Introduction to Pharmacology

    There are thousands of drugs on the market. Although the nurse is usually responsible for a much smaller number of
    medications in a specialty area, it is still a significant task to be responsible for the consequences of administering
    several drugs to various clients with an assortment of diseases. A few of the nurse's responsibilities as they relate to
    medication administration are listed here (also see Drug Administration for additional information):

        · Incorporating the nursing process (assessment, nursing diagnoses, planning, implementation, and evaluation)
            and clinical judgment into medication administration

        · Knowledge of the client and their disease process (or the prevention of disease)
        · Knowledge of the drug's name (both generic and brand [trade] names)
        · Understanding the indication for the drug (why the client has been prescribed this drug)
        · Appropriateness of the drug ordered by the provider
        · Assessment of the client prior to administering the drug
        · Determining which focused assessments show that the drug is safe for each client
        · Understanding which abnormal lab values would prohibit this drug from being given to a specific client
        · Special considerations:

              Life phase (e.g., pediatric, pregnancy, or geriatric populations)
              Body weight
              Nutritional status
              Pathophysiology of the disease process
              Race and ethnicity

        · Determining the safety of the drug in the client
        · Contraindications to the use of a drug in a particular client
        · Administering the drug(s) using the seven "rights," which are as follows:

              Right client
              Right medication
              Right indication
              Right dosage range and rate of administration (if appropriate)
              Right route
              Right time
              Right documentation

        · Monitoring for potential drug interactions
        · Assessment of the therapeutic and adverse effects of the drug
        · Education of the client and family (or caregivers) about the disease process, drugs prescribed, and therapeutic

            and adverse effects

    Follow-up with the client is critical to their safety and well-being. The nursing care plan will need to be modified if
    goals are not reached, and this may need to be done in collaboration with other health care team members.
    Communication between interprofessional team members is key to preventing adverse drug events. The nurse
    should allow plenty of time to counsel the client about the prescribed drugs and speak clearly, using simple
    language that avoids medical jargon. It is helpful to have the client repeat the instructions back to the nurse to
    assess understanding.

Drug Sources and Forms

Drugs are substances or compounds that prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure various conditions or diseases. As
mentioned previously, drugs come from a variety of resources--plants, animal products, and inorganic substances.
Ideally, these chemicals have desirable therapeutic effects without harmful properties, although many derivatives
may have poisonous effects, depending upon the dosage used. Some plant-based products in use today include
digitalis from the foxglove plant, vincristine from the periwinkle, and morphine from the poppy plant. The Amazon
Basin is home to countless numbers of plants with medicinal properties. Though not in use today, one of the first
paralytic agents used in anesthesia was curare, made from a vine known as Chondrodendron tomentosum, found
near the Amazon River in South America. The Indigenous population in the area placed a curare mixture on the tip of
blow darts and used it for hunting (see Figure 1.3). The prey is paralyzed once curare enters the bloodstream;
however, the meat is safe to eat because it is not toxic when eaten and digested.

FIGURE 1.3 One of the first paralytics used in anesthesia was curare, which Central American, South American, and Caribbean hunters
used to coat blow darts. (credit: "Blow gun darts tipped wih curare from South America"/Wellcome Collection, CC BY 4.0 International)

Some medications come from animals and animal products, including the human body. This list includes a few
common medications derived from animals or animal products, though it is not all-inclusive. Heparin and
enoxaparin, anticoagulants used to prevent or treat blood clots, are made from pig intestines, and some thyroid
medications and pancrelipase are also porcine derivatives. Conjugated estrogens, used to treat menopausal hot
flashes, are made from the urine of female horses. Exenatide, used to treat type 2 diabetes, can be made from the
saliva or venom of the Gila monster, which is a venomous lizard native to the southwestern United States and
northern Mexico. Other drugs come from chicken eggs or yeast.

Several medications, such as vaccines, antivenins and antitoxins, hormones, and monoclonal antibodies, are known
as biologics. Biologics are medications that come from a living source and are developed through a combination of
biomolecular science, immunology, and genetic engineering. Gene-based therapies are another example of cutting-
edge research in the world of biologics. They show great promise in treating some cancers and other conditions that
currently have no available treatments. They are produced through biotechnological processes, some of which may
have unique drug-delivery systems (Atkinson, 2022). Biologics offer the advantage of more targeted therapy for
specific diseases, such as autoimmune disorders and cancer, with the potential for fewer side effects, but they are
uniquely formulated with complex pharmacotherapy and may require administration through infusions or injections,
which adds to the cost of treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, exemplified by etanercept (Enbrel), a biologic, have
12  1 · Introduction to Pharmacology

    revolutionized the treatment of diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Formerly managed with drugs like
    methotrexate and corticosteroids, known for their severe adverse effects, monoclonal antibodies now offer a more
    favorable and less toxic treatment option for RA.

    One of the primary drawbacks to the use of biologics is their expense. These drugs take more work to purify,
    process, and produce, and many are given through infusions or injections. As their patents expire, however,
    biosimilars may be produced. Biosimilars are synthetically produced drugs with similar properties, including
    mechanism of action and dosing, to those of a biologic. Generally, this allows a biosimilar drug to be produced at a
    reduced cost than the equivalent biologic drug. Biosimilars are effectively a means to improve the access to
    biologics while decreasing the cost of therapy.

    Biosimilars differ somewhat from generic drugs. The development of biosimilars may take as long as 10 years and
    cost close to $100 million (Pfizer, 2021). Generic medications are much less costly ($1-2 million) and may be
    developed over only a couple of years. However, the essential difference between a biosimilar and a generic
    medication is in the drug's molecular structure. Biosimilar drugs have a larger and more complex molecular
    structure than generic drugs and are made from a living organism such as yeast or bacteria (U.S. Food and Drug
    Administration [FDA], 2022c). They are not bioequivalent, however, because of the complex manufacturing
    processes involved. A brand biologic may be produced using a specific cell line or protein to yield the molecule,
    which is not available to the maker of the biosimilar. They must come up with their own manufacturing process to
    create a molecule that is very similar. A company manufacturing a generic drug has to demonstrate that the drug is
    bioequivalent to the brand-name drug, whereas a company developing and producing a biosimilar drug must
    demonstrate that it is similar to the biologic it is patterned after (called the reference drug). (See more about generic
    drugs a little later in this chapter.)

    Chemical compounds produced in a laboratory either commercially by a drug manufacturer or illegally by individuals
    producing drugs for illicit reasons are called synthetic drugs. The first synthetic drug, a sedative-hypnotic drug
    known as chloral hydrate, was first used in medicine in 1869. Sometimes scientists will genetically engineer
    bacteria or slightly alter the chemical structure of substances to produce chemicals that are therapeutic. A small
    change in the chemical structure of some medications may make them more helpful than they previously
    were--they may become more potent or have fewer side effects--making the new compound much more desirable.
    Often individuals have fewer allergic reactions to synthetic drugs.

    Many drugs come from inorganic compounds. Inorganic compounds are often salts from chemical components that
    have been found to have therapeutic effects. Aluminum and magnesium compounds are helpful in the treatment of
    indigestion, constipation, or diarrhea. Fluoride and iodide strengthen the enamel on teeth and prevent cavities. Iron
    helps treat iron-deficiency anemia.

    Drugs come in many forms, but there are three primary categories for their routes of administration:

      1. Percutaneous administration: The application of medications to the skin or mucous membranes
      2. Enteral administration: The administration of medications into the gastrointestinal (GI) tract
      3. Parenteral administration: The administration of drugs somewhere other than the GI tract (usually this

            means by subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal, or intravenous injection)

    Drug forms in the percutaneous category include creams, topical ointments, powders, dressings (such as those used
    for wound care), and transdermal patches or disks. Other drugs in this category include eye, nose, or ear drops;
    vaginal medications; and aerosolized liquids that are inhaled and can be absorbed in the lungs. Some drugs in this
    category are able to deliver the medication in a constant amount over a specific time frame. The therapeutic effects
    may last longer depending upon the delivery method.

    Enteral medications are drugs administered into the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This can be done orally, rectally, or
    through a tube in the GI tract. The most common forms for these routes are through capsules and tablets (both may
    be sustained release), caplets, elixirs, emulsions, lozenges, suspensions, and syrups. The onset of action of these
    preparations will vary depending upon the form of the drug. Time-release capsules or tablets and enteric-coated
    tablets should not be crushed or chewed. Generally, these capsules should also not be opened and emptied onto
    food because this will alter how quickly the drug is absorbed. Note that some formulations can be opened in this
    manner, but it is best to ask before attempting this. An overdose of medication could result, although a

1.2 · Drug Sources, Forms, and Names                                                                                  13

subtherapeutic dose could also result from opening the capsule.

The parenteral route commonly refers to drugs given by injection, though parenteral literally means "outside the GI
tract." The onset of action is often more rapid than with oral administration; however, the duration of action is
usually shorter. Because these drugs do not have to travel through the stomach and be metabolized in the liver, the
dose is usually smaller than with oral dosing. This route is often prescribed when it is necessary to deliver a drug
quickly. It is also helpful when the client is experiencing nausea or vomiting. The drug form for parenteral
medications is that of a liquid. There are no barriers to absorption for intravenous medications because these drugs
are injected directly into the bloodstream--absorption is immediate and complete. Intramuscular injections and
subcutaneous injections may be absorbed rapidly or slowly, depending upon the solubility of the drug and blood
flow to the injection area. Drugs that are highly soluble in water are absorbed very quickly (10-30 minutes);
however, poorly soluble drugs will be absorbed at a much slower rate.

Drug Names

One of the biggest challenges when learning pharmacology is that all drugs have multiple names and ways to be
identified. There are three basic methods for identifying a drug--the chemical name, the generic name, and the
brand name, or trade name. If more than one drug company supplies a drug to the market, then that drug will have
more than one brand name. To further confuse things, these names may vary in different countries.

Chemical names are built around the drug's specific chemical structure or composition. This name usually has little
meaning for the nurse, though it does have meaning for the chemist or pharmacist. The chemical names are usually
complex and quite hard to pronounce; for example, the chemical name for ibuprofen is 2-(4-Isobutylphenyl)
propanoic acid. Most nurses will not use chemical names, though a few, like sodium chloride, which is easy to
remember and pronounce, have made it into the nurse's lexicon.

Generic names, also known as common names, are given by the U.S. Adopted Names Council. Often generic names
are part of the chemical name's structure, which helps identify and classify the drug. Though these names are
usually easier to remember than chemical ones, they can still be difficult to pronounce. There is only one generic
name for each drug, and many organizations worldwide use the generic name for identification, so students are
encouraged to learn the generic names when learning about drugs. Though brand names are frequently used in the
clinical setting, generic names are preferred for safety reasons. Generic names are also incorporated into the
National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX); therefore, it is helpful to learn the generic names of medications
before sitting for a licensure exam.

A brand name (or trade name) is created by the drug company and marketed to providers and consumers. Usually,
these names are much easier to pronounce and remember, so they are frequently used in the clinical setting. More
than one drug company may produce the same drug. The generic name will be the same, but the brand name will
differ. For example, ibuprofen is the generic name for a common nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Johnson &
Johnson manufactures and sells ibuprofen under the brand name Motrin; however, Haleon produces and sells
ibuprofen under the brand name Advil. Note that the drug's brand name begins with a capital letter, but the generic
name does not (see Figure 1.4).

    medication. (credit: modification of work "STRIBILD- elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablet, film
    coated" by National Library of Medicine/DAILYMED, Public Domain. Drug Company Logo All Rights Reserved.)

    Generic and Brand Name Drug Equivalents
    When a pharmaceutical company first creates a drug, it is developed as a specific chemical substance. This
    substance is subject to approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) once it has undergone rigorous
    testing with both animal and human subjects. Once approved by the FDA, the pharmaceutical company is given a
    patent for the drug for several years and it is sold under a brand name chosen by that company.

    It is common for drug companies to have entire teams dedicated to the naming of drugs, and that process can be
    quite lengthy, even as long as four years. Pharmaceutical companies want names that are easily recognizable by
    both the public and the prescriber. Unfortunately, many drug errors occur each year due to the similarity of the
    names of drugs (e.g., dopamine and dobutamine or prednisone and prednisolone).

    Because there is no market competition for a new drug initially, the cost of it is usually relatively high. Once the
    patent expires, however, any pharmaceutical company can then make the same drug for sale. Some companies exist
    to manufacture only generic medications, and they, too, are subject to FDA approval; however, they usually do not
    have the research and development protocols that the original company did. That is why generic drugs are less
    expensive than brand-name preparations. Most generic drugs today are formulated in a way that makes them
    almost identical in effectiveness to their brand name equivalent. According to the FDA (2021a), a generic drug is
    manufactured with the intent that it is identical in the active chemical ingredients, safety, strength, quality, dosage
    form, and intended use as its brand name counterpart. Drug formulations are sometimes different because some of
    the inert substances within the drug may differ between companies, which may affect absorption. It is unclear
    whether all generics match the brand name drugs they are to represent--the answer is probably not. The thing to
    remember is that rigorous testing must be performed to show that the generic drug form behaves in the human
    body in a similar manner to the brand name that it is patterned after--if it does not, it will not be approved by the
    FDA. Companies that manufacture generic drugs must test to ensure equivalency, but they do not have to redo the
    efficacy trials. This is where the cost savings of a generic drug occur.

    Prescription and Over-the-Counter Drugs

    Prescription medications are drugs available to the client only by an order (commonly known as a prescription) from
    a health care provider. The health care provider must have the training and license to prescribe the drug. The
    prescription communicates the provider's plan for the client and drug to the nurse or the pharmacist. Originally
    prescriptions were written using Latin terminology. RX is an abbreviation of a 14th-century Latin term for recipe that
    meant "take." Some of the Latin terms continue today, though the use of apothecary terms, such as grains, minims,
    and drams, is discouraged in practice for safety reasons. (See Drug Administration for more about the various
    systems of measurement.) Although prescription laws vary slightly from state to state, most require the following

information (see Figure 1.5):

    · Client identification (name and date of birth)
    · Client address

    · Number of refills
    · Prescriber's signature

Over-the-counter (OTC) drugs are available without a prescription to the public. They usually are safer than
prescription products and are available for self-medication for various ailments. As long as the consumer follows the
directions on the label, OTC drugs are usually safe and effective if used for a short time (FDA, 2018b). Some
prescribers believe that allowing consumers to buy OTC drugs to treat minor illnesses permits individuals with more
serious problems to be seen by the health care provider. However, it is also possible that by taking an OTC drug, the
symptoms of a serious disease might be hidden or treatment delayed.

There are over 80 classes of OTC drugs, including pain and fever reducers, laxatives, antidiarrheals, and cold, cough,
and allergy medications. Occasionally drugs are originally developed and sold only under prescriptive authority;
however, after a period of time and with many clients using the drug, it is determined that it is safe for
nonprescription use as an OTC. All OTC drugs are regulated and evaluated under the supervision of the FDA.

Over-the-counter drugs may still carry risks to the client. They are safe only if taken as recommended on the drug
label. At times, consumers may inadvertently take more than the prescribed dose of an OTC due to taking more than
one drug with the same product in it. The prescription medication Norco, for example, contains hydrocodone and
acetaminophen. If taken with Tylenol (which also contains acetaminophen), the client may ingest more than the
recommended dose of acetaminophen. The use of OTC drugs can be harmful in clients with some chronic diseases,
such as diabetes, and those with liver or kidney problems. For example, acetaminophen is only safe when taken
16  1 · Introduction to Pharmacology

    within the prescribed dose of fewer than 4 grams (4000 milligrams) per day--less should be taken if the client is
    older, malnourished, or has liver problems.

    Many clients do not consider OTC drugs as medication and will not always report the use of these drugs. When
    taking a drug history, listing all dietary supplements and OTC drugs is crucial to prevent interactions.

    Even though the cost of OTC medications is usually lower than those of prescription drugs, the cost of the OTC drugs
    is often incurred directly by the client. Insurance companies do not usually cover the cost of OTC medications.

    This section would not be complete without a mention of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).
    Medications are often used to treat clients in the Western world; however, other approaches are used outside the
    conventional treatment seen in Western medicine. Several of these were first developed in the Far East. Alternative
    medicine refers to using a treatment instead of mainstream conventional medicine, whereas complementary
    therapy refers to using both alternative medicine and conventional medicine together. These treatments may
    include massage, acupuncture, acupressure, mind-body interventions, or dietary supplements such as herbs or
    vitamins. One common use of CAM is in the treatment of cancer. Many drugs used to treat cancer have side effects
    of severe nausea and extreme fatigue. CAM may help clients cope with these symptoms through the use of
    acupuncture or the use of ginger or peppermint. Herbal therapy is also quite popular, but various herbals can
    interact with mainstream medications such as digitalis and blood thinners. St. John's wort is an herbal supplement
    that interacts with drugs in the class of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and has the potential to cause a
    potentially fatal condition known as serotonin syndrome. Obtaining a list of herbals and supplements is vital when
    assessing a client's medications. Herbals and supplements are not subject to FDA approval, and the supporting
    evidence for the use of these substances is low to nonexistent.

Drug Standards

The FDA is the government agency responsible for the regulation of the development, production, and sale of drugs.
The FDA was given much closer control over the production of drugs after the drug thalidomide was prescribed to
pregnant clients for the treatment of morning sickness and for sedation in the 1950s and 1960s. This drug was
found to be highly teratogenic to fetuses and caused many fetal malformations, especially limb defects. The
Kefauver-Harris Amendments in 1962 required drug manufacturers to establish the efficacy of drugs and gave the
FDA more control over the testing of drugs before they were placed on the market.

The United States Pharmacopeia National Formulary (USP-NF) has a rich history, dating back to the inaugural
publication of the United States Pharmacopeia in 1820. In 1888, the National Formulary (NF) joined its ranks. Then,
in 1975, these two entities merged to form the formidable USP-NF. This institution operates as an independent,
nonprofit organization dedicated to establishing vital standards for compounding medications, biologics, drug
development, and manufacturing, both within the United States and globally. It produces the only official book of
drug standards in the United States annually, and drugs referenced in this book have met very high standards for
quality, strength or potency, and purity (U.S. Pharmacopeia, n.d.). The USP-NF is a nongovernment organization and
is not associated with the FDA; however, the standards that the USP-NF puts forth are enforced by the FDA as the
official standards for the production and quality control of drugs and dietary supplements in the United States.
Complementary medications and supplements are not required to meet these same standards, though some do,
and they carry a USP seal guaranteeing safe manufacturing and quality. The Canadian Food and Drugs Act also
recognizes the USP-NF as a reliable authority of drug standards in Canada for health care providers.

There are many reliable sources of drug information for health care providers, including the American Society of
Health System Pharmacists' AHFS Drug Information book and Drug Facts and Comparisons. Many online resources
are available to nurses, such as Medscape (https://openstax.org/r/medscapeorg), Skyscape (https://openstax.org/r/
education), DailyMed (https://openstax.org/r/dailymeda), and UpToDate (https://openstax.org/r/wolterskluwer).
Applications can be downloaded to personal electronic devices or devices in the clinical setting (though not all are
free). Often hospitals/health care systems and clinics have institutional access to these resources. It is helpful for
the nurse to be able to access a wide variety of resources. A useful and free app for herbal supplements is About
Herbs (https://openstax.org/r/mskcc), which is produced by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute. It is
particularly helpful in the discussion of the mechanisms of action, herb-drug interactions, and adverse effects.

    Drug Approval Process

    The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) is a branch of the FDA that evaluates new drugs before they
    can be sold in the United States. It provides health care providers and consumers with the information needed to
    use drugs appropriately. One of the tasks of CDER is to ensure that both brand-name and generic drugs work as they
    should (FDA, 2022b). Before any drug is sold in the United States, it must be tested. Once a chemical that may have
    therapeutic effects is isolated, it will undergo scientific tests and clinical trials to prove its efficacy and safety. Drugs
    must pass through several stages of development before receiving approval from the FDA to be marketed to
    consumers. Table 1.2 briefly describes the process of obtaining FDA approval for a new drug.

    Stage of Development Description

    Preclinical trials                Drugs are tested on animal subjects to evaluate the compound in living tissues and
                                      to evaluate for adverse effects.

    Phase I studies                   A very small sample of human volunteers is used to test the drugs. Usually, the
                                      individuals are healthy subjects.

    Phase II studies                  Clinical investigators test the drug on clients with the disease that the drug has
                                      been developed to treat. Subjects are monitored very closely to evaluate the
                                      intended effects and for adverse reactions.

    Phase III studies                 This is a large-scale clinical trial. Prescribers assist in observing the client taking the
                                      drug. The goal of this phase is to gather data about the effectiveness and safety of
                                      the drug.

    FDA approval                      Once drugs make it through Phase III studies, they are evaluated by the FDA
                                      following the submission of a New Drug Application. If the FDA approves the drug, it
                                      can then be marketed.

    Phase IV studies                  Continual evaluations of drugs following approval by the FDA

    (post-marketing

    surveillance)

    TABLE 1.2 Summary of the Phases of Drug Development

    Some estimate the cost of developing just one new drug as ranging from less than $1 billion to over $2 billion
    (Wouters et al., 2020). The development of new drugs requires 10-15 years before the testing and drug studies are
    complete. Thousands of compounds are tested yearly, but only a few make it to clinical trials. Once a drug enters
    clinical trials, only a few are approved. CDER does not perform the clinical trials--this is up to the drug company;
    however, CDER reviews the pharmaceutical company's data and the proposed drug labeling. At the heart of the
    approval process is establishing the health benefits of the drug and its safety profile. Does the benefit of the drug
    outweigh its risk?

    There also are limitations to testing new drugs. Historically, there has been limited testing of drugs in the
    populations of females (particularly those of childbearing age), children (anyone under the age of 18 years old), and
    people of color (POC). This has recently changed, but before 2000, minimal testing was performed on females. No
    clinical trials were allowed for females of childbearing age, even if they were not pregnant and were taking effective
    birth control. This greatly limited knowledge about how females would respond to many drugs. This also means that
    there is limited data about drug safety during pregnancy.

    Children were also excluded from clinical trials in the past, though some exceptions have been made more recently.
    According to the FDA (2016), only about 20% of drugs are approved for pediatric use. For that reason, physicians
    have had to prescribe drugs "off-label" for children. The problem is that well-controlled clinical trials for pediatric
    dosing have not been established for many drugs, meaning there is no safety data for most drugs. The reasons for
    this lack of data are somewhat surprising. Some believe that pharmaceutical companies saw little profit in
    medications for children. Finding adequate numbers of children for robust testing could be more of a challenge than
    with adults, especially in trials where blood would need to be drawn.

    There are also ethical reasons to exclude children from trials, especially because children are unable to give
    consent. According to the FDA (2016, para. 7), "Parents are involved in the decision to enroll children in a study, and

children ages 7 or older can `assent' or `dissent,' meaning they can agree or disagree to participate in a study." For
more information about children's assent and parental permission, review this article by the National Cancer
Institute (https://openstax.org/r/cancera). More testing has been conducted in the last decade, and the information
coming out of those studies has shown much more accurate methods for dosing and prescribing. The FDA web page
on drug research and children (https://openstax.org/r/fda) has more information.

 Clinical Trials for Children

  Access multimedia content (https://openstax.org/books/pharmacology/pages/1-2-drug-sources-forms-and-
  names)
  In this video from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, pediatric researchers, doctors, and nurses
  explain why children should be included in clinical drug trials and answer common questions from parents and
  caregivers.

Even as late as 2019, only 15%-19% of participants in U.S. clinical drug trials were Black. When broken down
further, only 3% of participants in clinical trials for cardiovascular disease were Black males (6% were Black
females), and less than 5% of oncology trial participants were Black males (2% were Black females) (Whyte, 2022).
When specific populations are under-represented in a clinical trial, the efficacy and safety are unknown for that
particular subset. The efficacy and safety of some drugs may differ for various ethnicities and genetic backgrounds
(Clark et al., 2019). Due to a variety of barriers, racial and ethnic minorities are often underrepresented in clinical
trials (FDA, 2022a). When clinical trials test therapies only within a homogenous group, the findings are likely to be
skewed. One of the problems with this is that minority groups may have less benefit from those therapies. Some of
the barriers to increasing minority involvement in clinical trials include a lack of understanding of the value of the
process; mistrust of research; lack of information, time, and resources; and a lack of knowledge about the existence
of various trials (Clark et al., 2019). Many differences in health outcomes have been documented based on race and
ethnicity, underscoring the importance of including a variety of racial and ethnic groups in clinical trials.

 Off-Label Prescription Drug Use

  Access multimedia content (https://openstax.org/books/pharmacology/pages/1-2-drug-sources-forms-and-
  names)
  Off-label prescription drug use pertains to the utilization of a medication in ways that deviate from the
  specifications provided on the drug's label or within its FDA-approved package insert. Such usage encompasses
  employing the medication for divergent medical conditions, adjusting dosages, targeting varying client groups, or
  employing alternative routes of administration, all of which may contrast with the medication's initial FDA
  approval. For example, after the COVID-19 pandemic started, a research institute focused its efforts on
  repurposing existing drugs (see the Wyss Institute website (https://openstax.org/r/harvard) and the video above).

  Access multimedia content (https://openstax.org/books/pharmacology/pages/1-2-drug-sources-forms-and-
  names)
  The safety of off-label drug use varies based on factors such as the specific medication and condition, the health
  care provider's judgment and knowledge, and the available evidence. Providers should weigh potential benefits
 against risks (as discussed in the Wall Street Journal video above) because off-label use may be valuable when
  approved alternatives are lacking. This article provides 2023 statistics on the drug classes (https://openstax.org/
  r/ncbia) in which off-label use is typical.

  When administering off-label drugs, nurses should ensure informed consent from the client or their
  representative, discussing potential risks and benefits of the proposed medication. The nurse should also
  collaborate with the health care team for guidance and to determine the appropriateness of the drug. Other
  duties of the nurse include documenting the rationale for the use of the drug, educating the client on its proper
  use, monitoring the client closely for unexpected effects, and staying updated on the latest research. Above all, it
20  1 · Introduction to Pharmacology

      is important for the nurse to uphold ethical principles and keep the client's well-being at the forefront.

    Canadian Drug Regulation

    The United States' and Canada's drug laws have evolved in a similar manner. Any drug manufacturer must provide
    scientific evidence of the drug's safety, efficacy, and quality to Health Canada before the sale of that product is
    authorized. The federal review process by Health Canada was empowered by the Food and Drugs Act of 1927 as
    well as additional regulations (in 1953, 1954, and 1979) intended to protect consumers from risks associated with
    the production and sale of drugs, cosmetics, food, and medical devices (Health Canada, n.d.). It regulates the
    manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage, and sale of food and drugs in Canada. It also determines whether a
    drug is a prescription or nonprescription medication. Canada requires prescriptions for narcotics and strict
    guidelines for record-keeping for prescribing and dispensing those drugs. Drug use in Canada is regulated and
    enforced by many different agencies, including Health Canada, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and agencies
    within various provinces.

    Although the schedule of drugs is different from that of the United States (see Drug Classifications and Prototypes
    for U.S. drug schedules), Canada has tried to align the schedules throughout each province so that the sale of
    medications is consistent throughout the country. The governing body for Canadian national drug schedules is the
    National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities (NAPRA), though each province does regulate how drugs
    are sold or dispensed. In Canada, drugs are assigned to one of four categories (Drug & Alcohol Testing Association
    of Canada [DATAC], 2017; National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities, 2023):

        · Schedule I: All prescription drugs. These drugs must be provided to the consumer by a pharmacist through a
            controlled, regulated environment. Drugs in this category include heroin, cocaine, morphine, and methadone.

        · Schedule II: Restricted-access nonprescription drugs. These drugs may require professional intervention from
            a pharmacist when sold to the consumer. Must be stored with no public access or chance for the public to
            choose or select the drug (in other words, "behind the counter"). Schedule II drugs include insulin,
            pseudoephedrine, and sublingual nitroglycerin.

        · Schedule III: Available without a prescription and sold on store shelves under the supervision of a pharmacist.
            Examples in this category are ibuprofen or naproxen.

        · Unscheduled: Can be sold without supervision from any retail outlet. Emergency contraception, such as
            norgestrel, is considered an unscheduled drug.

    Drug Counterfeiting

    The United States has one of the world's safest drug supplies, partly due to the FDA and USP-NF. Unfortunately,
    counterfeit drugs threaten that safety. Counterfeit drugs are products that are illegally manufactured or mislabeled
    with regard to their identity or source so that they appear to be a genuine product. They are fake drugs and may
    harm the recipient's health. Illegal online sales expose consumers to potential counterfeit drugs. Counterfeit drugs
    are not the same thing as generic medications. As mentioned earlier in this chapter, a generic drug is manufactured
    with the intent that it is identical in the active chemical ingredients, safety, strength, quality, dosage form, and
    intended use as its brand name counterpart (FDA, 2021a). These are drugs approved by the FDA. Counterfeit drugs
    are not.

    Consumers can protect themselves by buying medications from state-licensed pharmacies in the United States. If
    using an online pharmacy, the consumer should check for the online pharmacy's license through the state Board of
    Pharmacy. If it is not listed, that pharmacy should not be used. Reputable online pharmacies should have a seal of
    approval from the Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Site (VIPPS). An online pharmacy should always require a
    health care provider's prescription and have a physical address and phone number in the United States. Another
    strategy for the consumer is to be alert to changes or variations in the packaging of medications--for example, the
    color or lettering might be different. Consumers should be alert to any unusual taste or side effects from the drug
    and report it immediately. Concerns about potential counterfeit drugs should be reported to the FDA through its
    MedWatch website (https://openstax.org/r/fdag) or by calling 1-800-FDA-1088. The 2013 Drug Supply Chain
    Security Act was passed as an initiative to combat the production and use of counterfeit drugs. The FDA's Office of
    Criminal Investigations investigates counterfeit drugs, their producers, and their sellers and attempts to bring them
    to justice.

1.3 Drug Classifications and Prototypes

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 1.3.1 Explain the basis for placing drugs into therapeutic and pharmacologic classes.
    · 1.3.2 Discuss the prototype approach to drug classification.
    · 1.3.3 Define federal controls on drugs that have abuse potential.

Drug Classifications

One helpful method for sorting out the sheer number of drugs on the market is by organizing them into different
classifications. Most drugs are classified in two ways--therapeutic classification and pharmacologic classification.

    · Therapeutic classification refers to a drug's therapeutic use or clinical indication (the diagnosis or disease
        being treated). When using a therapeutic classification, one describes the therapeutic effect, or the clinical
        result that occurs after the client takes a drug. For example, in Antihypertensive and Antianginal Drugs, the
        drug metoprolol is discussed. Its therapeutic classification is antianginal because it relieves the chest
        discomfort associated with coronary artery disease. It also reduces blood pressure, so it has a second
        therapeutic classification and is also known as an antihypertensive.

    · Pharmacologic classification refers to how the drug works in the body--its mechanism of action. Metoprolol's
        pharmacologic classification is beta-adrenergic blocker--it works by blocking the stimulation of the body's
        beta-adrenergic receptors, which inhibits the heart's response to sympathetic nerve stimulation. Sometimes a
        drug is classified by the body system it affects, such as the autonomic nervous or upper respiratory systems.

Important note: Even though a drug may have more than one therapeutic classification, such as the previous
example of metoprolol being both an antianginal and an antihypertensive, it will essentially have the same
mechanism of action (though its targeted effect may be different), side effects, and safety parameters. Knowledge
of a drug's classification helps the nurse understand its intended effects and its adverse effects. The primary
difference is in the client's reason for taking the drug.

Drug Prototypes

Once drugs are sorted into classifications, it is customary to utilize one drug within the class to compare to all the
other drugs within that class. It becomes the "class representative," known as the drug prototype. Using a drug
prototype is helpful for an individual learning pharmacology because it makes learning much more manageable. It is
also helpful in the clinical setting. Consider the situation of a nurse who has administered the beta-adrenergic
blocker metoprolol multiple times in the clinical setting and is quite familiar with its actions and side effects. When a
health care provider orders the beta-adrenergic blocker atenolol, that nurse knows it will have a similar mechanism
of action, side effects, and safety parameters as metoprolol. This is much easier for the student to learn than
attempting to identify and learn every single drug made in the class.

Pharmacology books often use drug prototypes to simplify explanations of drug classes and assist students in their
learning. Table 1.3 provides an example of a drug prototype table used throughout this text.

    TABLE 1.3 Sample Drug Prototype Table

    Drug Schedules

    Many different chemicals, substances, and drugs come under U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) oversight
    (U.S. DEA, n.d.). In 1970, Congress passed the Controlled Substances Act, which led to the establishment of the
    DEA in 1973 and described the controls for manufacturing, distributing, and prescribing habit-forming drugs. This
    legislation not only categorized controlled substances based on their potential for abuse but also established drug
    schedules and provided drug treatment programs for those with addictions. All hospitals and pharmacies must keep
    records of drugs purchased and sold. Any health care provider with prescriptive authority must be registered with
    the DEA and given a unique DEA identifier that they must place on any controlled substance prescription.

    As noted in Table 1.4, Schedule I drugs have no medical use and a very high potential for abuse and physical/
    psychological dependency; therefore, most health care providers cannot issue prescriptions for those drugs, and
    pharmacies cannot fill those prescriptions. If research is being conducted with a Schedule I drug, applications and
    supporting documents have to be sent to the DEA for special permission. Schedule II, III, and IV drugs must have a
    medically sound reason for a prescription. Schedule V drugs are those with the lowest potential for misuse and
    dependency (U.S. DEA, n.d.).

    Cannabis has been classified as a Schedule 1 drug since the 1970 Controlled Substances Act. However, more than
    half of the states in the nation have decriminalized the substance, with some permitting medical usage and others
    both medical and recreational usage. As of May 2024, the Drug Enforcement Agency has recommended that
    cannabis be reclassified as a Schedule III drug, which would support wider medical usage and scientific research
    but not permit recreational usage on a national level. Formal reclassification will require additional steps.

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 1.4.1 Discuss the impact of socioeconomic factors on pharmacology.

Pharmacology and Socioeconomic Factors

Without question, medication costs have been escalating for many years. Many factors encompass total health care
costs: the up-front costs of prescription drugs, visits to providers and health care institutions, morbidity and
mortality, diagnostic and interventional medicine, and suboptimal medical therapy, to name only a few. Increased
drug utilization and increased price factor into this increased health care cost. A larger share of health care costs has
been passed on to the consumer in the form of out-of-pocket expenses as health care costs have risen. The field of
pharmacoeconomics probes into the analysis of the costs of drug therapy to health care systems and society as a
whole, and it examines the consequences of providing pharmacological products and services to clients.

The prevalence of chronic conditions in the United States continues to rise and accounts for the majority of health
24  1 · Introduction to Pharmacology

    care costs (Wilder et al., 2021). Although there are many medications that can treat these conditions, half of all
    clients do not take their medications as prescribed. A lack of insurance coverage does impact the likelihood of
    medication non-adherence. So, not only do more chronic medical conditions occur in individuals living in reduced
    circumstances, but those same circumstances prevent them from managing their care appropriately. The United
    States has a system of voluntary insurance that does not guarantee the same coverage for all individuals in the
    country. This is because coverage is expensive and sometimes difficult to purchase. A primary objective of the
    Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law under President Barack Obama in 2010, was to make it easier for
    people in the United States to obtain voluntary insurance. Even though it is thought that approximately 92% of
    individuals in the United States have some type of health coverage, over 27 million individuals are still without
    coverage (Statista, 2023; Tolbert et al., 2022).

    Often an insurance company or a medical institution will have a drug formulary. This is a list of prescription drugs
    that are covered by that plan. The purpose of the formulary is to provide good care while using the most cost-
    effective medications. Not all drugs will be included on an insurance plan's formulary, meaning the client may be
    responsible for the cost of specific drugs or switch to an alternative agent. Some insurance plans also have a
    deductible, which means that the client must pay a certain amount of money "out-of-pocket" before the insurance
    begins to pay for medications.

         TRENDING TODAY

     The World's Most Expensive Drug...For Now!

      The FDA approved the first gene-therapy drug for hemophilia, a blood-clotting disorder, in November 2022.
      Hemgenix was developed by the drug company CSL Behring. This particular drug is helpful in treating clients with
      a factor IX deficiency. Even though only a single dose of the drug is needed to provide protection from severe
      bleeding for up to 8 years, this drug does not protect those with the most common forms of hemophilia. The cost
      of a single dose: $3.5 million (Naddaf, 2022).

    Costs are calculated based on how much it costs for a pharmaceutical product to be developed and manufactured.
    Medical visits, treatments, and hospitalizations might be considered a direct medical cost to the client. A direct
    nonmedical cost could be the cost associated with out-of-town office visits, such as food and lodging. These are
    costs associated with medical treatment, but they are not medical in nature. An indirect cost involves costs to the
    client that are associated with the loss of income or productivity because of an illness. Intangible costs are due to an
    illness but are difficult to measure, such as the cost of loss, pain, or suffering.

    Medical outcomes also have to be measured. Is the outcome the preservation of life or a cure for the disease? Is the
    client able to be a productive member of society again? Should a drug company invest in a drug that will cure a rare
    disease but costs billions of dollars? Who pays for the treatment? Should the drug company invest in a much
    cheaper drug and help millions of people? That may seem like a simple answer unless you or a loved one are the
    ones with the rare disease.

      SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

      Socioeconomic Factors

      There are many potential reasons for nonadherence to a drug regimen. Socioeconomic factors can prevent the
      client from receiving the care necessary to prevent disease or restore health. The nurse should identify and
      investigate barriers to any health care provider or clinic visits, treatments, or needed medication. Use simple,
      nonjudgmental language to discuss the client's financial concerns. Explore whether the client has health
      insurance. Collaborate with other disciplines, such as pharmacy or social work, to develop a plan that best
      meets the client's needs. Many pharmaceutical companies have programs to assist clients who cannot afford
      their medications.

    Drugs as They Relate to Specific Populations

    The very young and the very old are predisposed to be the most sensitive to drugs. One factor causing this is the

1.4 · Special Considerations                                                                                            25

differences in pharmacokinetics in these individuals. Pharmacokinetics is the movement of a drug through the
body. It is easiest to think of it as "what the body does to the drug." Drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and
excretion vary with age. The liver and kidneys are immature in very young clients, which significantly impacts
metabolism and excretion; however, absorption and distribution of drugs are also impacted by their age and body
size. Older adults also experience differences in pharmacokinetics; these are discussed in a separate section later in
this chapter. Pharmacokinetics are discussed in more detail in Drug Administration.

Many drugs' absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion differ among infants, children, and adults. Most
drugs are either metabolized by the liver or excreted by the kidneys, and the rate and level of organ functioning vary
between age groups.

Pediatric Population
Developmentally, infants and children have a much smaller body mass; therefore, accurate pediatric dosing is
crucial. Pediatric dosing is sometimes calculated by milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) of body weight or by body
surface area (BSA). It is essential to be very accurate when calculating pediatric doses. Math should be double-
checked to reduce the incidence of medication errors or inadvertently giving a higher-than-desired dose. The
Pediatric Pharmacy Association commissioned several individuals to develop a KIDs List of drugs
(https://openstax.org/r/aafp) that identifies potentially harmful or inappropriate drugs in the pediatric population.
The KIDs List includes two recommendation levels (avoid and use with caution).

     CLINICAL TIP

 Pediatric Dose

  One safety measure is to give medication to pediatric clients using the smallest syringe available for a specific
  dose, allowing for a more precise measurement of the drug.

One of the challenges with drugs in pediatric clients is the limited testing when researching the drug. Almost all
information about drugs, in general, is related to dosing in the adult client. The risk of performing research in this
population and obtaining informed consent makes researching drugs a problem.

Body Size
Another factor that impacts an individual's sensitivity to a drug is body size. The body's response to a drug is often
determined by the concentration of the drug at the site of action. The higher the concentration at the site, the
stronger the response to the drug; the lower the concentration at the site, the less intense the response. A client
with overweight or obesity may require a larger dose to obtain the intended effect, whereas an undernourished
client may need a smaller dose. This is one reason that accurate height and weight are so important in the
physician's office or clinical setting. Many drugs are calculated by milligrams per kilogram of body weight to obtain
the correct dosing for the intended therapeutic effect.

Sex
More research needs to be done regarding how biological differences between the sexes impact the use and
metabolism of medication. Male versus female clients may experience a difference in symptomology with certain
diseases. There is often a difference in body size, percentage of body fat, and muscle mass. These factors may
impact the response to drugs and their effectiveness based on sex. There also is often a difference in how male
versus female clients experience the adverse effects of the same drug. In 1977, most individuals assigned as
females at birth were banned from many trials. This policy was reversed when Congress passed into law the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) Revitalization Act of 1993 (FDA, 2018a). However, although inclusion has
increased, the rate of inclusion has been slow, and there is not adequate knowledge about many drugs in regard to
how they affect this population.

Pregnancy and Lactation
Pregnancy and lactation are other areas of medicine where researchers exercise greater caution due to the risk of
adverse effects of a drug or substance on the fetus. When giving a drug to someone who is pregnant, the provider
must consider both the pregnant client and the fetus. In many cases, it is safest to postpone treatment with drug
therapy until after the birth of the infant. However, there are times when drug therapy is unavoidable, such as for a
26  1 · Introduction to Pharmacology

    preexisting condition, upper respiratory or urinary tract infections, or the development of a condition such as
    hypertension or gestational diabetes that may necessitate treatment. In fact, according to Haas et al. (2018),
    approximately 97% of those who were pregnant took at least one drug during pregnancy. The benefit to the
    pregnant client and fetus should always be weighed against the risk of treatment. This can be very challenging in
    clinical practice.

    Many physiological changes occur during pregnancy. Pregnancy alters the pharmacodynamics and
    pharmacokinetics of each drug and impacts the pregnant body's response to the drug. The pregnant client has
    changes in bowel function, often slowing the time it takes for digestion. Gastric motility decreases, which causes
    decreased transit time, allowing more of the drug to be absorbed. This, in turn, causes the effects of the drug to be
    prolonged, and the client may be at an increased risk of toxicity. Cardiac output and uterine blood flow increase. The
    kidneys, breasts, and skin also have increased blood flow. Renal blood flow is essentially doubled during the third
    trimester of pregnancy. This results in an increased glomerular filtration rate that causes many drugs to clear the
    body much more rapidly.

    The placenta allows the transmission of substances between the pregnant client and the fetus. Some drugs pass
    through the placenta to the fetus, though others are blocked. Several factors determine drug passage across the
    placenta (e.g., lipid-soluble drugs will pass more easily than those bound to proteins). The nurse should always
    assume that any medication taken during pregnancy can reach the fetus.

    The primary concern with any drug during any pregnancy is its risk to the developing fetus. If a drug is known to
    cause fetal harm through embryonic or fetal development, it is said to be teratogenic. Only a few drugs have been
    proven to be teratogenic, and even though a drug might be a known teratogen, it does not mean that it will always
    cause harm to every fetus. It is also important to know that having no data on a drug's safety does not mean that the
    drug may not cause harm--just that there is no proof. Even drugs that are generally considered "safe" during
    pregnancy may carry some risk--no drug can be considered 100% safe to use during pregnancy.

    Before 2014, the FDA used an ABCDX system to classify drugs for pregnancy and fetal risk. Drugs in Category A
    were considered safest for the fetus during pregnancy, with each successive class increasingly more dangerous.
    Category X drugs were known to be harmful to the fetus. Often these categories were confusing and not helpful to
    providers and consumers. Many of the limitations of the system came from a lack of data from clinical trials. When
    there was a lack of data, many of the drugs were placed into Category C. This meant that no clinical trials had been
    performed in humans, and animal studies either had not been done or showed a risk of fetal harm. Drugs placed
    under Category C may have been given to pregnant clients for years with few adverse effects. In 2014, the FDA
    released the Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule (https://openstax.org/r/fdab) and provided new narrative
    guidance for the labeling of drugs. The rule took effect in June 2015, and all medications currently approved by the
    FDA should have the new labeling (FDA, 2021b).

    These general guidelines should direct the nurse in caring for clients who may be pregnant or lactating:

        · Complete a thorough history of illnesses and diseases that might impact the client.
        · Complete a thorough history of all drugs (prescribed and/or recreational), herbal and dietary supplements,

            vitamins, and over-the-counter medications taken by the client.
        · Ask the client of childbearing age about signs or symptoms of possible pregnancy.
        · Discuss the potentially harmful effects of taking any drug during pregnancy and during lactation.
        · Recommend that the client avoid alcohol or smoking during pregnancy and lactation.
        · Inform the client that some herbal or complementary and alternative therapies may help with symptoms of

            pregnancy, but to discuss any treatments with a provider because not all are safe.

    (For additional resources about caring for clients who may be pregnant or lactating, see this CDC website
    (https://openstax.org/r/cdca), which includes information on the NIH LactMed (https://openstax.org/r/ncbib)
    database.)

    Genetics
    One of the newest areas of research in pharmacology is pharmacogenetics. This area of pharmacology studies the
    response to drugs based on a client's individual genetics, including therapeutic responses to drugs and the
    predisposition individuals might have to the adverse effects of a medication. With the identification of the human

genome through the Human Genome Project, much fundamental information about the human body has improved
the practice of medicine. This international collaborative project began in 1990 and was finally completed in 2003.
However, it was not until 2022 that the Telomere-to-Telomere consortium finally announced that it had filled in the
gaps from the original project and produced the first complete human genome sequence (National Institutes of
Health, 2022).

We now know more about heredity and the disease process, and there is growing evidence about the influence of
genetic variations on drug response. Often two clients will respond differently to the same drug. This research may
help identify genetic variants in the response to drugs that may be unique to a race or ancestral group. Genetic
variations can change the structure of drug receptors and target molecules, which can then influence an individual's
response to a specific drug. At some point in the near future, clients will benefit from customized drug therapy
specific to their genetics. It will predict the best drug for use in a particular situation and allow the dose to be
prescribed that best limits side effects or toxicity.

  SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

  Cultural Concerns

  There are cultural considerations that the nurse must integrate into the care of the client:

      · Acknowledge individual differences.
      · Reflect on one's own potential inherent biases.
      · Practice cultural humility.
      · Embrace and respect diversity.

  Accommodating the culturally diverse:

      · Assess their ability to communicate.
      · Engage an interpreter if the client's use of English is limited.

             Avoid using a family member to translate when possible.
      · Provide health information to the client and family members in their primary language, when possible.
      · Assess the client's current health practices.
      · Determine whether cultural healers are important to the client.
      · Obtain a complete history of the client's medications and use of herbals, OTCs, vitamins, and CAM.
      · Determine the client's views about touch, eye contact, and modesty.
      · Recognize that various cultural and biological responses may occur within different groups.

             Black clients may not respond to some antihypertensive drugs (e.g., beta-adrenergic blockers and
                angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors).

             Asian clients may require a smaller dose of many medications.
      · Obtain a cultural history.
      · Consult with someone knowledgeable about the client's cultural history and practices, but always verify

          beliefs with the client.
      · Obtain an understanding of what the client perceives as "good health."
      · Inquire about their beliefs regarding health, wellness, and illness.

The Aging Client and Pharmacology

There is an increasing number of older adults around the world. One of the terms used to describe the aging
population is "silver tsunami." This somewhat negative term refers to the combination of the large number of baby
boomers who are reaching retirement age, the improved life expectancy for older adults, and a reduced birth rate
among younger adults. The U.S. Census Bureau projects that the nation's 65 and older age group will grow to almost
95 million individuals by 2060 (Vespa et al., 2020). This will impact the Social Security system, and there will most
likely be greater demand for health care and long-term care. There is also concern that there will be a shortage of
workers in many professions across the United States, including in health care.

The aging adult presents a challenge to the health care provider as health declines. As society ages, individuals have
more comorbid conditions, often leading to the use of multiple medications (Pazan & Wehling, 2021). According to
28  1 · Introduction to Pharmacology

    the Kaiser Family Foundation (Kirzinger et al., 2019), approximately 90% of adults over the age of 65 take at least
    one prescription drug. They go on to report that this population also is more likely to take multiple prescriptions.
    Although drugs can alleviate or even cure many diseases, these same drugs can cause many drug-related problems.
    The nurse must be aware of these potential drug-related problems when caring for the older client.

    Older adults have changes in organ function that affect their response to most drugs, from the standpoint of both
    pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. These changes can result in an increase in sensitivity to drugs due to
    declining liver and kidney function. Diminished kidney function may impact the individual's ability to filter and
    excrete the drug. A drug's absorption rate may also be affected because transit time through the gut usually slows
    with age. Gastric acidity also decreases, which may impact absorption because some drugs require high acidity to
    dissolve. If the individual has diminished liver function, that may affect the metabolism of some medications, which
    may prolong the drug's effects and lead to toxicity.

    Often older adults are excluded from clinical trials, just as pregnant people and children have been. When
    compounded by the fact that many older adults regularly take multiple medications, it can have a detrimental effect
    on the client. Adverse drug reactions occur more frequently in the older population and frequently cause hospital
    admissions and readmissions. Some of the factors that cause this increase are polypharmacy (taking many drugs),
    treatment with drugs that have a narrow safety margin, and multiple chronic conditions. The American Geriatrics
    Society (AGS) publishes a reference list of drugs called the Beers Criteria® for Potentially Inappropriate Medication
    Use in Older Adults (https://openstax.org/r/geriatricscareonline).

    The following are some of the pharmacologic considerations when providing nursing care for an older adult:

        · Take a complete drug history at each encounter, including how the drug was prescribed.
              Verify that the client is taking the medication as prescribed.

        · Ask about new prescriptions from other providers.
        · Assess the older adult's age-related sensory issues (mental awareness, hearing or visual acuity).
        · Ask about any history of liver or kidney problems.
        · Encourage the client to use aids such as a pillbox, especially if taking multiple drugs.
        · Check the drugs for potential interactions, especially if the client sees multiple providers.
        · Monitor for both expected therapeutic effects and potential adverse effects.
        · Ensure the client understands the purpose of each drug, expected effects, and potential adverse effects.
        · Review the drug list to determine if any drugs could be discontinued.
        · Identify any potentially inappropriate drugs (e.g., drugs that cause sedation may cause a client to fall).
        · Question the client about drugs they may be crushing or cutting in half. (Some capsules and extended-release

            pills should remain intact.)
        · Encourage clients to dispose of old or expired medications.
        · Determine whether the client can afford the drugs (especially new prescriptions).
        · Encourage the health care provider to order the least complicated drug regimen possible.

34  2 · Drug Administration

    seven rights of medication administration and the clinical judgment required for safe administration. The nursing
    process is a client-centered process and focuses on outcomes through a partnership relationship with the client and
    other health care providers.

    Nursing Process

    The nursing process is a method of critical thinking consisting of five steps that occur continuously while the client is
    in the nurse's care. (The client may be an individual, a family, a group, or a community.) It is purposeful and
    systematic in its progression, designed to achieve optimal client outcomes. It is a framework for the nurse to apply
    scientific reasoning to client care. The steps to the nursing process are linear but overlap each other in their
    progression:

      1. Assessment of the client
      2. Diagnosis of actual or potential problems
      3. Planning nursing interventions
      4. Implementation of nursing interventions
      5. Evaluation of outcomes of nursing interventions as they relate to achieving the client's goals

    The client (not the nurse) is at the center of the nursing process, which encompasses health, wellness, and illness in
    a holistic sense, incorporating all aspects of the client--physical, psychological, social, emotional, cultural, and
    spiritual. The nurse is uniquely positioned to assess the whole client, administer therapies (including medications),
    evaluate their effectiveness, and teach the client about how to maintain optimal wellness. The following discussion
    will focus on the nursing process as it relates to the administration of medications.

    Assessment
    Assessment is the process of data collection using a systematic method for collecting information and recognizing
    various clues as they relate to the client's status. Assessment should relate to both actual and potential health
    problems. All other steps in the nursing process are based on an accurate assessment. This information can be
    obtained from a physical assessment of the client, a health record review, or a health history from other providers,
    the client, or family members. Before administering any medications to a client, it is important to be thorough in
    assessing the client to prevent harm and deliver optimal care.

    Present Illness and Chief Complaint
    The nurse must understand why the client is under their care, the medical diagnosis, and the presenting and current
    symptoms that the client is experiencing. What is the aim of treatment? Medications can affect disease processes
    and symptoms, and the disease process may affect the medications. Disease processes such as liver or kidney
    failure can affect the way drugs are metabolized and excreted. At times, dosage adjustments may need to be made
    due to these problems. It is essential to know how the medications will work to improve symptoms (or how they
    could worsen them).

    Current Medications, Substance Use, and Allergies
    The nurse should assess the client's medication regime. Start by reviewing a list of the client's current drugs. If
    possible, encourage the client or family member to bring the actual medications. This includes prescription drugs,
    over-the-counter (OTC) medications, herbal supplements, illicit drugs, alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine. The nurse
    should ask specific questions. Some clients do not consider OTC drugs or herbal supplements to be important, but
    they do have the potential to interact with prescription medications. For example, the OTC drug ibuprofen can
    interact with certain medications for high blood pressure, causing the antihypertensive drugs to be less effective.
    Assessment of illicit drugs and alcohol use is also important. Alcohol may interact with benzodiazepines or opioids,
    causing respiratory and central nervous system depression. A client who recently used a street drug such as heroin,
    cocaine, or ketamine may also be at risk for dysrhythmias or respiratory depression. Unfortunately, these drugs may
    be laced with fentanyl, causing a client to be at risk for severe respiratory depression.

    No medication should be given without first asking the client about allergies and reactions to medications. If a client
    has been previously exposed to a drug and had a mild reaction, the reaction could be more severe when they are
    exposed again. Some clients may reveal a reaction that is not an allergy but, instead, the result of a side effect. An
    example of this is a client who reports that they have an allergic reaction to diphenhydramine (Benadryl) that causes
    them to be very drowsy. This is a common and expected effect of this drug rather than an allergy. Once the nurse

obtains the information about both the allergy and the reaction(s), it is important to document this clearly in the
client record for future providers.

Past Medical History
Similar to ascertaining a client's present symptoms and medical diagnoses, the past medical history is also
important because it may impact the client's current condition and response to medications. For example, liver and
kidney dysfunction may affect the way drugs are metabolized and excreted. Some drugs may be contraindicated in
some chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Is
the client visually challenged, or do they lack manual dexterity? A visually impaired client with diabetes, for
example, will have challenges in drawing up and administering insulin that another client with healthy vision will not.
A client with Parkinson's disease or one who has had a stroke may also have difficulty with these psychomotor skills.

Psychosocial Factors
The use of alcohol, tobacco, or street drugs may affect the body's response to some medications, so obtaining a
psychosocial assessment is helpful. It is also important for the nurse to know the support systems in place for the
client. Are there family members or friends who are able to assist with the medications at home? Does the client
have insurance? Is the client able to afford the medications? For some individuals, even paying $4 for a prescription
is difficult. There are prescription drug programs that may be able to assist, and collaborating with the pharmacist or
a social worker may help the client adhere to the medication regimen. A pharmacist may also be able to suggest
alternative therapies that might be cheaper for the client.

Health Literacy and Education
Another important piece of this assessment is evaluating an individual's health literacy and determining a client's
understanding of their disease process and the recommended treatment (including medications). Health literacy is
a general term used to describe an individual's ability to obtain, understand, and make appropriate decisions based
on information to promote their health and wellness (Taylor et al., 2023). A client who is new to their disease
process may require more explanation than someone who has managed a chronic disease for years. It is crucial for
a client to know why a drug is important to their health and well-being so that they will adhere to a medication
regimen. It is also vital that the client understands both the therapeutic effects and side effects of the drug. Once
side effects are discussed, the nurse must explain which side effects are not harmful and when to notify the health
care provider of problems. Assessing the client's level of education is helpful in presenting the information in a way
that will be most easily understood by the client and family.

Physical Findings and Laboratory Values
When administering medications, the nurse should complete a focused assessment as it relates to the medication
to be given. For example, if giving a medication to lower blood pressure, blood pressure should be assessed before
giving the drug. If that specific drug lowers blood pressure and heart rate, then both should be measured before
giving the medication.

Laboratory values should also be assessed prior to giving medication. One diuretic may cause potassium to be
excreted from the body, requiring the nurse to withhold the diuretic if the client is hypokalemic, but another may
cause potassium to be conserved and should not be given to a client who is already hyperkalemic. Some drugs
should not be given if liver enzymes are elevated; others should not be given if the kidney values of blood urea
nitrogen (BUN) and creatine are elevated.

Weight and Age
A client's weight should be obtained prior to administering some drugs, especially in the pediatric population. An
accurate weight will assist the nurse in determining if the dosage is appropriate.

Children and older adults may require medication dosage adjustments due to issues such as kidney or liver function
changes. A child may be unable to metabolize some medications well due to an immature hepatic system or to
excrete drugs through an immature renal system; however, the older adult may have a decline in kidney and liver
function due to age and chronic disease conditions. Medication delivery may also need to be altered in these age
groups. For example, an infant or child may need a liquid dosage form because they may be unable to swallow
tablets or capsules; older adults with Alzheimer's disease or stroke may also be unable to swallow those medication
forms.
36  2 · Drug Administration

    Nursing Diagnosis and Problem List
    In the diagnosis phase of the nursing process, the nurse uses the information from the assessment to identify and
    prioritize problems. Whereas the health care provider's medical diagnosis focuses on disease process or
    pathophysiology, the nursing diagnosis focuses holistically on any physical, psychosocial, sociocultural, or spiritual
    changes or problems in the client's health, wellness, or illness. Part of the assessment the nurse completes before
    drug administration is determining if the drug is appropriate for the client (right diagnosis or indication) and
    identifying any potential problems that might arise if the drug is given (adverse effects). Will the proposed treatment
    be safe and effective? In the case of the client taking an antihypertensive drug, for example, what are the potential
    adverse effects of the drug? Will the drug lower the blood pressure to an unsafe level? What is the client's ability to
    adhere to the medication regimen at home?

    When considering these questions, it is important to analyze what is known about the client--the medical diagnosis;
    whether or not the client has taken the drug in the past; potential adverse reactions, contraindications, and
    allergies; comorbidities that might affect the response to the drug; potential drug-drug interactions; and current
    laboratory data. There are many potential nursing diagnoses or health problems related to drug administration.
    Consider utilizing the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association (NANDA) (https://openstax.org/r/nanda)
    website for more information regarding nursing diagnoses and problems.

    Planning
    Once the nurse has completed the assessment and has identified the actual or potential nursing diagnoses or
    problems, they must develop the plan. This is done by formulating client goals that address the client's problems (or
    nursing diagnoses) that have been identified. When possible, the client, family, and nurse should work together in
    the planning process to better understand the desired outcomes. Goals are written in such a way that it is clear what
    type of observable response should be seen (Callahan, 2023). Part of this process is prioritizing the information that
    was gathered in the assessment, integrating this into the nursing diagnosis, and then setting the goals with the
    client. Collaboration with the client and family also allows the nurse to become aware of unidentified problems that
    might prevent the outcome from being realized.

    Consider the client with severe postoperative pain (problem) secondary to a recent right knee replacement (etiology
    of the problem) who has an order for an opioid agent. The goal is defined as the result that the nurse and client wish
    to see due to the nursing interventions (Callahan, 2023). A potential goal for the hospitalized client with
    postoperative knee pain could read, "The client will rate their knee pain as 4 or less on a 0 to 10 scale during this
    shift." Remember to include the client in this process. Is a pain level of 4 or less acceptable to the client?

    The planned interventions are developed specific to the goal and are explicit actions that relate to that goal. In the
    previous example, the interventions might read like this:

        · Assess the pain level every hour using the pain scale of 0 to 10.
        · Administer hydrocodone 5/325 mg 30 minutes prior to physical therapy and every 6 hours PRN as ordered.

           (PRN stands for pro re nata, a Latin term meaning "as the circumstances arise." This medication is not a
            scheduled drug; it will be taken as needed.)
        · Apply ice packs to the right knee for 20 minutes four to six times each day.
        · Demonstrate the use of a walker to assist the client with ambulation.

    It is important for goals and interventions to be client-centered and very specific. Be sure that the interventions are
    related to the individual goal and are realistic for the client.

    Implementation of Nursing Interventions
    The fourth phase of the nursing process is the implementation phase. During this phase, the interventions are
    performed in order to reach the client's goal(s). At the heart of the implementation phase is the concern for client
    safety. No goal or intervention should be planned without consideration of the client's safety in the nursing process.
    The nurse should assess for any potential complications during this process. Interventions or goals may need to be
    modified depending on the client's circumstances. In the example of the client with postoperative pain following a
    right knee replacement, the nurse evaluates the client's pain before a physical therapy visit. If it is not time for the
    pain medication to be given, it is possible that the physical therapy visit will need to be postponed.

    Some potential interventions related to medication administration for this client might include:

    · Assess safety prior to administering the medication (check vital signs and laboratory values). (See Appendix B:
        Common Abbreviations and Lab Values for typical lab values.)

    · Verify the rights to medication administration (right client, right medication, right indication, right dosage
        range and rate of administration [if appropriate], right route, right time, and right documentation).

    · Verify allergies and reactions.
    · Assess for adverse effects of the medication (both before, if the drug was administered previously, and after).
    · Teach the client about the medication, indications, expected effects, and potential side effects. The nurse

        should also explain the drug names (brand and generic), dose, route, and frequency.
    · Document medication administration and any pertinent data related to that.

Evaluation
This phase of the nursing process assesses and evaluates the outcomes of the nursing goals and interventions. For
example, has the client's pain been controlled during this shift? Did the client rate the pain as 4 or less on the pain
scale? Did the client have any adverse reactions to the medication? This ongoing process evaluates the client's
response to the drug--for the therapeutic effect, the development of adverse effects, and teaching needs--and
anticipates discharge needs. Therapeutic effectiveness refers to whether the drug did what it was supposed to do.
Did the pain medication relieve the pain? One intervention may assist the client in meeting the goal, but another
intervention does not. In this case, the intervention may need to be modified. For example, in the case of the
postoperative client who had a knee operation, if the client had developed a rash following the last dose of
hydrocodone, the nurse must notify the provider to order an alternative drug to control the pain. Alternatively, if the
client's pain remained an 8 on a 0 to 10 scale even after hydrocodone, the nurse will notify the provider to order an
alternative drug to meet the goal of a pain level of less than 4.

The evaluation phase of the nursing process is ongoing until the client outcomes are met or the client reaches an
optimal state of well-being. The client's goals and interventions may need to be modified according to the ever-
changing status of the client.

Nursing Clinical Judgment

The National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) has "developed the NCSBN Clinical Judgment
Measurement Model (NCJMM) as a framework for the valid measurement of clinical judgment and decision making
within the context of a standardized, high-stakes examination" (NCSBN, 2023, para. 1). Nursing students across the
United States are now being tested using the Next Generation National Council Licensure Examination (NGN) model,
which was first administered in April 2023. This exam helps to protect the public and measures the minimum
competence of a new graduate in regard to safety. Why is this information presented in this text? The nurse must be
able to problem-solve and critically think, and the clinical judgment model was developed as a way to test clinical
judgment in nursing. Much of a nurse's clinical judgment revolves around medications and whether a drug is safe to
give or recognizing problems.

Clinical judgment is defined by the NCSBN as "the observed outcome of critical thinking and decision making. It is
an iterative process that uses nursing knowledge to observe and assess presenting situations, identify a prioritized
client concern, and generate the best possible evidence-based solutions in order to deliver safe client care"
(NCSBN, 2018). An iterative process is one that builds, refines, and improves the process for the best possible
outcome.

Safe, efficient care of the client and improved clinical outcomes rely on sound decision-making, clinical reasoning,
and clinical nursing judgment. Errors in clinical decision-making often lead to poor outcomes (Nibbelink & Brewer,
2018). According to Sherrill (2020), there are two common errors that novice nurses make that cause them to
undergo disciplinary action against their license--a failure to notice and a failure to act. Failure to notice refers to
failure on the part of the nurse to see a change in the condition or status of the client. Once a change in the client is
observed, it is the nurse's duty to act in some way to prevent a negative outcome for the client.

The nurse must possess many skills to take care of the client: interpersonal, cognitive, technical, and ethical/legal
knowledge (Taylor et al., 2023). The nurse needs to have the technical skill to administer an intravenous push (IVP)
medication and subsequently document it in the electronic medical record (eMAR) as well as the ability to
determine cognitively that the medication is safe to give. Interpersonal skills are necessary for the interaction
between the nurse and the client during the administration of the medication or with the pharmacist and provider
38  2 · Drug Administration

    when discussing potential problems that might arise from an adverse drug event. Ethical and legal responsibilities
    are a part of the nurse's workday each time they chart or encounter an ethical dilemma when deliberating over the
    risk versus the benefit of a drug. Often this can be seen in the nurse's role of advocate for the client.

    Critical thinking is an essential piece of the nurse's clinical judgment and is absolutely crucial to the process of
    administering medications safely. The nurse must think through every decision and action before administering a
    drug. According to the NCJMM, the nurse must first recognize cues (Dickison et al., 2019). Where is the client
    located, and how do they present? For example, the client may have presented to a health care clinic in mild distress
    due to a cough and sinus congestion, or they may have presented to the emergency department with severe
    shortness of breath and chest pain. What is their history? The nurse should recognize the various signs and
    symptoms of a disease process and recognize abnormal vital signs and laboratory work, then hypothesize what may
    be occurring with the client. What is the most important thing for the nurse to assess? Analyzing the cues is
    important. What is the priority in this situation? How acute are the symptoms? Does immediate action need to
    occur? The nurse needs to have the underlying knowledge to recognize relationships between signs and symptoms
    and potential disease processes and likely treatments (including medications). However, the ability to recall nursing
    knowledge is only part of the nurse's thinking; the nurse then needs to make the clinical judgments suitable to the
    situation (Silvestri et al., 2023). What interventions will be most helpful in this situation? Once the nurse intervenes,
    the question then becomes whether those actions and decisions helped the client.

    The nursing process is an integral piece of nursing clinical judgment and embraces the critical thinking process. The
    nursing process was discussed earlier in this chapter in relation to medication administration. The nursing process
    can be integrated into the clinical judgment model.

    Recognizing cues is the nurse's skill of observing cues or signs and symptoms of a client's problem (Dickison et al.,
    2019). This is accomplished through assessing (the first part of the nursing process). A nurse collects information
    from many different resources. An example of this might be the nurse who is caring for a client who experienced a
    myocardial infarction 3 days ago and is to administer metoprolol, a medication that decreases blood pressure and
    heart rate. The nurse recognizes that those parameters should be assessed prior to giving the drug. Other data will
    be collected that the nurse then needs to sort through and determine which information is expected and which is
    unexpected or concerning. The nurse should assess and recognize that the blood pressure of 84/60 mm Hg and the
    heart rate of 48 beats per minute with the symptoms of dizziness are abnormal.

    Analyzing cues is the skill of organizing the information obtained and linking it to the situation (Dickison et al., 2019).
    Continuing with the previous example, the nurse interprets the data and recognizes that the blood pressure and
    heart rate are too low to give the metoprolol. A nursing diagnosis or problem list can be formed during this phase
    based on the assessment data. The nurse requires a knowledge of the pathophysiology of myocardial infarction and
    knowledge of the therapeutic and adverse effects of metoprolol. The clinical reasoning model uses critical thinking
    to understand that the nurse recognizes the problem and knows what to do in response to the findings.

    The next phase of the process is to prioritize hypotheses (Dickison et al., 2019). This means the nurse will attempt
    to focus on the meaning of the information that has been obtained and prioritize the client's problems (Silvestri et
    al., 2023). What is the priority problem for the client on metoprolol mentioned above? In this example, the client has
    three problems:

      1. Low blood pressure, which may be due to the myocardial infarction or a previous dose of metoprolol
      2. Low heart rate due to a previous dose of metoprolol
      3. Dizziness due to the abnormal blood pressure and heart rate

    The next phase of the process is to generate solutions (Dickison et al., 2019). In this phase, the nurse wants to
    consider all possible actions that might be utilized to resolve the problem(s). Many times, this includes actions that
    will be implemented to achieve the desired outcome, but sometimes this will include withholding a medication or
    recognizing which actions should be avoided (Silvestri et al., 2023). In this instance, the nurse may predict
    complications of further lowering of the blood pressure and heart rate if the metoprolol is administered. The
    consequences of administering metoprolol to the client might mean a critical drop in the blood pressure or heart
    rate, potentially even causing shock.

    Dickison et al. (2019) then state that the next phase of this model is taking action. In the example given, the actions

the nurse takes during this phase are to withhold the medication, metoprolol, and notify the provider of the
problem. This aligns with the implementation phase of the nursing process.

Evaluating outcomes is the last clinical judgment thinking skill in the clinical reasoning model and aligns with
evaluating the interventions that the nurse implemented (Silvestri et al., 2023). The nurse must evaluate the
outcome of whether the client meets the goal of improved blood pressure and heart rate when the metoprolol is
withheld.

These processes are not linear; they are cyclical. The nurse will continue to assess, recognize, analyze, generate
solutions, respond by taking action, and reflect on the outcomes. The nurse expects the outcome of the blood
pressure and heart rate to return to baseline after holding the metoprolol; however, the nurse must continue to
reassess the client to ensure that this occurs and act accordingly. If the blood pressure and/or heart rate do not
increase, the nurse must then implement other interventions and evaluate whether they were successful.

This example of clinical judgment actually occurs before administering the drug. A similar process would occur even
if the blood pressure and heart rate were normal. Then the process would occur again when the nurse assesses the
client for adverse effects.

Principles of Safe Drug Administration

Safety is a fundamental element in the process of medication administration. It is important to demonstrate good
clinical decision-making skills throughout the procedure. The focus of the nurse's clinical judgment during
medication administration begins with first knowing the client and assessing the relevant information according to
the medications that need to be delivered. Medication reconciliation is performed to ensure that the medications
that the provider has ordered are accurate and appropriate for the client. Medication reconciliation is the process of
identifying and verifying the most accurate list of medications that a client is taking. This should include the drug
name, dosage, frequency, and route for the client. This process should also determine why the client is taking the
medication. It should include all over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and supplements. This list is then
compared to the provider(s) list. This process should occur at any transition in care (admission, transfer to another
unit, discharge, and clinic visit). The nurse should scrutinize the list for duplications, incorrect dosages, and
omissions (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ], 2019). Once a focused physical assessment and
laboratory assessment have been completed, the client should be informed about the drugs that have been
prescribed. If the nurse is unfamiliar with a drug, it is crucial that they learn about it before administering it. Many
resources are available to the nurse for that purpose--drug guides, the pharmacist, drug insert labels, or drug apps
on the phone or computer, to name a few.

When planning drug administration, the nurse needs to keep safety foremost in mind. Medication errors are
common, preventable errors with far-reaching consequences for the client, the institution, and the nurse. The U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) receives more than 100,000 reports of potential drug errors each year (not all
errors are reported to the FDA) (FDA, 2019). Tariq et al. (2023) reported that the cost of caring for individuals who
had been the victim of drug errors is over $40 billion each year. A meta-analysis by Panagioti (2019) reported that 1
out of 20 clients may be impacted by a preventable medical error and that as much as 12% of this preventable harm
results in death or disability. Of these errors, medication-related errors accounted for the majority. Ethics, Legal
Considerations, and Safety discusses medication safety in further depth and emphasizes additional strategies to
prevent errors.

Medication safety means ensuring that the right dosage of the right drug is administered to the right client at the
right time by the right route or the right reason, and it is documented correctly (the seven rights of medication
administration; see Figure 2.2). Nursing practice has expanded the original five rights of medication administration
to seven. These rights have been identified as basic standards of care in medication administration in order to
preserve client safety. Most institutions require nurses to review these rights at least three times before
administering medications. An example of what can happen if all seven rights are not followed might look like this:
the nurse has the right dose of the right drug via the right route at the right time for the right reason, but if the nurse
walks into the wrong room and fails to identify the right client, a medication error (and potential harm) occurs.

    The seven rights are:

        · Right client (person): The Joint Commission recommends using at least two identifiers to ensure that the
            nurse administers drugs to the right client. Name, date of birth, and/or medical record number are standard
            client identification methods. Confirming two identifiers safeguards the client from harm. When possible,
            request that the client verbalize their name and date of birth while verifying this information by comparing it to
            the wrist ID band and the client's chart.

        · Right medication: Most institutions have policies in place to ensure that the right client receives the right
            medication. Medication dispensing systems and barcode scanning are additional processes that many
            institutions use to assist the nurse during administration. The nurse must compare the medication label or
            container three separate times--once when obtaining the medication, again when preparing the medication,
            and finally, and most importantly, when at the bedside. The nurse should also check the expiration date and
            verify that the medication was stored properly. The nurse should know the action of the medication and how it
            is to be administered so that all materials can be obtained when drawing up the drug. Allergies and reactions
            should also be verified to prevent a client from getting a drug to which they are allergic.
              Barcode scanning: For institutions that use barcode scanning, each drug container (usually a unit dose
                  package such as a blister pack, vial, or prefilled syringe) is labeled with a unique barcode. The information
                  in the barcode allows for the comparison of the medication being administered with what the health care
                  provider ordered for the client before administration. The nurse first signs into the computer or uses the
                  barcode scanner, a handheld device, to scan the barcode on the clinician's badge. The nurse then uses the
                  scanner to scan the barcode on the client's unique client identification wristband and the drug. The
                  system then verifies the drug to be given with the order in the system. The clinician is given a warning if
                  the information does not match. Strudwick et al. (2018) report in an integrative review that barcode
                  technology significantly decreases medication errors when proper scanning is completed consistently
                 before administration.

        · Right dose: The nurse must validate the right dose and any drug calculations that were performed. They can

2.1 · Drug Administration and the Nursing Process                                                                           41

        ask another nurse to validate doses of high-alert (more dangerous) drugs, such as heparin or insulin. The
        nurse needs to know the usual safe dosage ranges and maximum doses to ensure safe administration and
        question doses that are outside the usual range or seem unsafe.
    · Right time: Each institution has its own policy regarding acceptable time frames for medication administration.
        Most institutions allow a drug to be given within a time frame of 30-60 minutes before or after the scheduled
        dose. Drug schedules are important to keep drug concentrations steady. If a drug is given too early, this might
        result in a drug overdose; however, if it is given too late or omitted, then the client may be undertreated.
    · Right route: The nurse must administer the drug via the correct route and verify that the route is safe for that
        particular client. They should never assume the route of administration--it must be confirmed with the
        provider if it was omitted from the order.
    · Right indication for use (reason): The nurse confirms why the client has been ordered the medication; for
        example, beta-adrenergic blockers may be administered for angina, hypertension, myocardial infarction,
        dysrhythmias, or heart failure. Knowing why the medication has been ordered will assist the nurse in
        assessing the drug's therapeutic effect. They should clarify orders that do not seem appropriate for the client.
    · Right documentation: The nurse needs to ensure that documentation is completed after the drug has been
        administered. They should not document medication administration prior to giving the drug. If there was any
        variance in the drug administered, the nurse needs to ensure that the reason is documented. The nurse also
        should document if the client refuses the drug and why, as well as if a medication was withheld and the
        explanation for holding it.

 The Seven Rights of Medication Administration

  Access multimedia content (https://openstax.org/books/pharmacology/pages/2-1-drug-administration-and-the-
  nursing-process)
  This video provides more information about the rights of medication administration in nursing. A BSN/RN
  explains the rights of medication administration and gives examples and anecdotes from their own experiences.

Nurses should encourage clients to participate in their care by questioning the nurse about the medications being
delivered. Collaboration with other health care providers will also assist in keeping the client safe during medication
administration. In the inpatient setting, the verified medications are withdrawn from the medication dispensing
machine, the materials needed to administer the drugs are obtained, and all are taken to the client. The medication
should remain in the original container until the nurse is at the bedside, ready to administer the medication. The
nurse identifies the client, using two unique client identifiers, and the drug is reverified as the correct drug before
giving to the client. The medication can be reverified by checking the drug label with the medication administration
record or through the use of barcode scanning, where available, at the bedside prior to administering the
medication. The nurse follows medication administration by planning on when to reevaluate the client for
therapeutic response and adverse effects.

Client Education and Drug Administration

One important responsibility that a nurse has is client education. According to the American Nurses Association
(2021), teaching and promoting health and wellness is expected of the nurse providing care to a client. Teaching is
about using specific strategies to reinforce or change specific behaviors. Learning is the desired outcome that
results from teaching. A change in behavior is the evidence of teaching and learning. The primary target for teaching
in the health care setting is the client and family or caregiver. In order for the nurse to be an effective teacher, it is
important to understand how individuals learn. There are three domains of learning: cognitive, psychomotor, and
affective.

Cognitive Domain
The cognitive domain of learning is the thinking domain within the learning process. Concepts related to this domain
include knowing, comprehending or understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and synthesizing. Within this
domain, an individual's past experiences and perceptions are important to consider because they will impact the
client's ability to learn. The foundation for any learning experience is a person's previous experience and knowledge.
42  2 · Drug Administration

    Teaching a client with diabetes about insulin, how it works, its therapeutic effects, dosing, and side effects is within
    the cognitive domain.

    Psychomotor Domain
    The psychomotor domain relates to doing or skill, specifically motor skills. Nurses will frequently teach clients
    various skills related to their disease process. The nurse who teaches the client about insulin and demonstrates how
    to inject themselves with a dose of insulin is teaching within the psychomotor domain. The client with diabetes
    learning within the psychomotor domain will need to learn the physical skill of drawing up the insulin and then
    injecting the insulin into their body.

    Affective Domain
    The affective domain refers to the feelings, emotions, and beliefs within the learning process. It also encompasses
    an individual's interests and attitudes toward learning. The client with diabetes who is frightened about shots and is
    anxious about this process may have difficulty learning the skill of giving injections.

    Ideally, the nurse will use each domain in the teaching plan for the client. In order to be an effective teacher, the
    nurse will try to develop a positive teacher-learner relationship by developing different approaches for different
    learning styles. For a learner who learns best by doing the skill, the nurse should encourage the client to practice the
    skill under their supervision rather than simply explaining what must be done. It is important to assess the client's
    readiness for learning and adapt strategies that will help the process.

    Factors that Influence Learning
    According to Callahan (2023), many factors may facilitate learning in the client. The information needs to have
    relevance to the client. Someone who is actively involved in the learning process and is motivated to learn will
    usually master the content more readily. The nurse can approach the client and determine their readiness to learn.
    The client may wish to have a support person(s) with them to help them retain the information. The nurse should
    begin with a simple explanation and expand to more complex topics as time allows. Repetition is helpful in the
    learning process to reinforce the concepts. The nurse may make further arrangements to continue teaching or pass
    this on to a colleague as appropriate.

    There are also many potential barriers to learning; for example, a client who is extremely anxious or in a lot of pain
    may not have the ability to focus on the process. Other common barriers include:

        · Educational level
        · Developmental level
        · Attitudes, values, and beliefs
        · Unmet needs
        · Emotions (fear, anger, depression)
        · Physical health status (pain, anxiety, medication, fatigue, hunger)
        · Self-concept
        · Self-esteem
        · Cultural considerations (the individual's health beliefs and practices)
        · Language barriers
        · Lack of motivation
        · Lack of readiness
        · Psychomotor ability (e.g., the client with Parkinson's disease or who has had a stroke may have the cognitive

            ability to understand how to give an injection but may be limited physically by muscle strength or
            coordination)

    Developing a Teaching Plan
    To develop a teaching plan, the nurse should assess the client's learning needs. (The first part of the nursing process
    is to assess.) Determine their disease process, discover what the client already knows, and discuss the client's
    support system. Consider the client's characteristics. Are they motivated to learn? Are they ready to learn? What is
    their reading and comprehension level? What are their health and belief practices? What is their learning style? Do
    they learn best by visualizing material in colors, maps, and diagrams? Or do they learn best by listening (auditory
    learner) or by doing (kinesthetic learner)? Another characteristic to assess is the client's health literacy and where

they obtain information. According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (Bakerjian, 2023), health
information should be written in plain, straightforward language and should not exceed a sixth-grade reading level.
The information should use short sentences with pictures that illustrate instructions for the client. This should be
adapted according to the educational level of the client. Teach the priority information first and then repeat as
needed.

Part of the teaching process is to evaluate the learning. This is an ongoing process, and consideration of the
evaluation tools is important. Direct observation of behaviors and asking the client to teach back information or
demonstrate a skill back to the nurse are helpful ways to evaluate learning (Bakerjian, 2023). It is important to ask
for feedback and clarify when information is unclear. In order to promote a helping-trust relationship, the nurse
should instill faith and hope in the client while providing a supportive environment.

Teaching Resources
Discover the teaching materials at your institution. Most institutions have written materials, and some have various
smart tablets or e-health portals for educational information. Information provided by institutions or health systems
is considered reliable and accurate and can be very helpful to clients and their family members.

Many clients have smartphones and can access health learning applications with tutorials and quizzes that help the
learning process. A great deal of information is available to the client through the internet, and the nurse can assist
them in finding the appropriate websites to obtain reliable information on their disease process and treatment.

     TRENDING TODAY

 Determining a Website's Reliability

  The National Institutes of Health (2022) provide these guidelines for determining the reliability of websites:

      · Is there an author listed? If so, what are their qualifications?
      · What is the website's address? (Credible websites usually end in either .gov, .org, or .edu.)
      · Who pays for the website?
      · Is the website current? Are there references? Are there working links?
      · What is the content? Is it biased? Is it opinion? Is it fact? Why was it written?
      · Is it trying to sell a product?
      · How is the website constructed? Can the information be easily found?

Many applications (apps) available on phones or smartwatches can assist the client and provider in monitoring the
client's health, including pulse rate and rhythm monitoring, blood pressure monitoring, and blood glucose
monitoring. It is helpful to the client if the nurse has firsthand knowledge of the site or applications recommended.
Using reliable, credible resources can help the client and family make more informed decisions and become an
active participant in their care.

2.2 Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 2.2.1 Define how body cells respond to drugs.
    · 2.2.2 Explain the meaning of the half-life of a drug.
    · 2.2.3 List the factors that can influence the effectiveness of drugs in the body.
    · 2.2.4 Differentiate between side effects and adverse effects of drugs.
    · 2.2.5 Describe drug tolerance and drug toxicity.

Before administering a medication to a client, the nurse must understand what the body does to the drug and what
the drug does to the body. Drugs produce effects on the body's physiology by making chemical changes that affect
certain target cells within the body. The term pharmacodynamics essentially means "what the drug does to the
body." The root word, pharmaco, refers to medicines, and dynamics means change, so it refers to how the drug
changes the body. All living organisms are composed of chemicals that function through various chemical reactions.
When chemicals (drugs) are added to this structure, those chemicals change the body. Essentially,
44  2 · Drug Administration

    pharmacodynamics examines the relationship between drug concentrations at the drug's site(s) of action and the
    subsequent effects of the drug in the body--its mechanism of action.

    The term pharmacokinetics refers to how the body processes the medicine. The word can be broken down to the
    root word, pharmaco, meaning medicines, and kinetics, meaning movement. Once the nurse understands
    pharmacokinetics, they can better understand a drug's actions, effects, interactions with other drugs, dosing
    frequency, and precautions. The four primary processes of pharmacokinetics are absorption, distribution,
    metabolism, and excretion. These will be discussed in the following sections.

    Drug Absorption

    Absorption refers to the process of a drug traveling from the site of administration, through the body's membranes,
    and into the circulating bloodstream. Drugs may be absorbed through the skin (i.e., topical medications), through
    the membranes in the respiratory tract (i.e., inhalers), through the membranes of the gastrointestinal tract (i.e.,
    rectal medications and most pills, tablets, and capsules), or through subcutaneous (i.e., subcutaneous injections) or
    muscular (i.e., intramuscular injections) tissues. The route of administration influences the absorption of a drug. A
    drug's physical and chemical properties affect the absorption rate, as do the physical and chemical properties of the
    client's body. Absorption also affects the amount of time it takes for a drug to take effect. Some of the factors that
    may affect the rate of drug absorption or the extent to which a drug is absorbed include:

        · Formulation of the drug: Liquid formulations of oral medications are absorbed more rapidly than capsules or
            tablets.

        · Lipid solubility: Lipid-soluble drugs are absorbed more quickly than water-soluble ones.
        · Size of the drug's molecules: Large molecules are less readily absorbed than smaller molecules.
        · Blood flow: Drugs are more rapidly absorbed in areas where blood flow is high.
        · Route of administration: IV drugs enter the bloodstream immediately; other routes take the body longer to

            absorb.
        · Surface area: The larger the surface area where the drug is to be absorbed (e.g., small intestine vs. the

            stomach), the quicker the absorption rate.
        · Acidity: For oral medications, the acidity of the stomach or intestine can affect absorption.
        · Gastric motility: This may either slow down or speed up absorption, depending upon motility.
        · Coatings: Special coatings on oral preparations can affect absorption.
        · Food: The presence of food in the gut can affect the absorption of oral preparations.

    As mentioned above, surface area can greatly affect drug absorption. This may impact both the speed of absorption
    and the extent to which a drug is absorbed. Drugs administered via the respiratory tract as gases or aerosols are
    quickly absorbed due to the large surface area of the lungs and the very rich blood supply there. The alveolar
    epithelium is quite permeable, which also aids in absorption. Oral medications may be absorbed in the stomach or
    the small intestine (sometimes both). The small intestine has many mucosal villi and microvilli, which increases its
    surface area; this allows medications to be more rapidly absorbed when compared to the stomach, which has a
    relatively small surface area. When areas of the small intestine are removed, this greatly impacts drug and nutrient
    absorption.

    Bioavailability refers to the amount of the active drug entering the circulation and available at the site of action--or
    the physical ability of a drug to reach its specific target cells to have an effect on the body. Price and Patel (2022)
    define bioavailability "for majority purposes" as "the fraction of the active form of a drug that reaches system
    circulation unaltered." Typically, only a fraction of the administered dose enters the circulation unchanged, thus
    becoming bioavailable. For example, the antibiotic gentamicin is 0% bioavailable when taken orally because this
    drug is not absorbed by the small intestine; however, it is well absorbed following intramuscular (IM) administration,
    and it is 100% bioavailable with intravenous (IV) administration. IV medications are immediately 100%
    bioavailable because there are no barriers to absorption. Oral medications, in contrast, have several barriers to
    absorption, such as the pH of the stomach (acidity), the length of time the oral medication spends in the stomach,
    blood flow to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, or the presence of food in the stomach. After absorption, oral drugs can
    also be metabolized in the liver before entering systemic circulation, a process called first-pass metabolism. This
    can decrease the bioavailability of a drug. Therefore, oral medications are not as readily bioavailable. First-pass
    effect will be explained in further detail in the section "Drug Metabolism or Biotransformation."

Drug Distribution

Drug distribution refers to the movement of a drug through the body or the way that a drug is spread throughout the
body. There are several factors that may affect distribution:

    · Blood flow or tissue perfusion
    · Protein binding
    · Permeability of the cell membrane
    · Volume of distribution (the smaller the volume, the less distribution; the larger the volume, the more

        distribution)

The blood and lymphatic systems are the primary vehicles for the transport of drugs throughout the body. The most
vascular organs, and the organs receiving the most blood supply, are the heart, liver, kidneys, and brain. The more
vascular the area, the higher the concentration of a drug. Areas such as adipose (fatty) tissue, the skin, and bone are
less vascular and more difficult to deliver high concentrations of a drug. Tissue perfusion itself can affect
distribution; for example, in a client with an infected diabetic foot ulcer, it is more difficult to deliver systemic
antibiotic therapy to the area to kill the bacteria because blood flow is not adequate.

Drugs are often bound to proteins in the blood to be carried into the bloodstream; however, a drug may also be
considered free or unbound. Only a free drug can act at its target site of action, such as receptors, or cross into other
fluid compartments within the body (Grogan & Preuss, 2022). Drugs compete for protein-binding sites within the
bloodstream, primarily albumin. The more a drug is bound to a protein, the more difficult it is for the medication to
be freed and able to cross cell membranes and act on the body. In order for a drug to act on a tissue, it must be
released from the protein's binding site. Only the unbound portion of a drug can disperse into the tissue and interact
with cell receptors to produce the intended physiological effect of the drug. According to Grogan and Preuss (2022),
drug distribution aims to achieve effective drug concentration at its intended receptor site. If there is a decrease in
the plasma protein binding, this increases the amount of free drug available. This will intensify the effects of the
drug and may even lead to toxicity.

The drug must be able to cross through cell membranes to reach target sites. Medications that are lipid-soluble can
rapidly cross cellular membranes because of the high permeability of capillary endothelial membranes. These drugs
will be distributed more widely than those drugs that are water-soluble.

There are deterrents to the distribution of drugs. The blood-brain barrier is a protective system that prevents many
drugs (and foreign invaders or poisons) from entering the central nervous system. Some drugs readily cross the
blood-brain barrier, such as those that are lipid-soluble or poorly bound to proteins (e.g., sedatives,
anticonvulsants, and antianxiety agents); however, many antimicrobials are ineffective against central nervous
system infections because they are unable to cross the blood-brain barrier. Many antitumor drugs also fall into this
category, making cancer of the brain difficult to treat with standard chemotherapy drugs.

Drug Metabolism or Biotransformation

Biotransformation or metabolism is the process of chemically changing a drug into a form that can be more readily
eliminated from the body. This process occurs primarily in the liver by enzymes that change medications into
inactive forms of the drug; however, metabolism of drugs may occur at other sites in the body, such as the lungs,
vasculature, and lining of the GI tract. The enzymes for metabolism detoxify chemicals or substances to keep the
body functioning at an optimal level. Sometimes these enzymes alter the drug form into an inactive metabolite, a
soluble compound, or even a more potent metabolite. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, for example, aid in the
metabolism of drugs, and the liver is the primary site for CYP activity. These enzymes target primarily lipid-soluble
drugs.

Drugs that enter the GI tract first go to the liver, which detoxifies and treats them using the necessary enzymes. This
is known as the first-pass effect, and there may be variability of this effect between clients. This may affect the
dosing of some medications among different clients. (See the following section for more on the first-pass effect.) It
should be noted that any client with liver disease or cirrhosis can have decreased metabolic activity, making them
more susceptible to dose-related side effects if they are taking a medication metabolized through the liver.
Someone with cirrhosis will not metabolize a drug to the same extent as a client without liver disease, and this may
lead to higher concentrations of the drug in the system. Those higher concentrations, in turn, can lead to adverse
46  2 · Drug Administration

    effects. For example, the drug acetaminophen should be monitored carefully or avoided in clients with underlying
    liver disease. The other concern that should be mentioned is that of drug toxicity, which may occur if clients have
    liver disease. Clients with elevated liver enzymes may have difficulty metabolizing the drug, which may cause toxic
    drug levels in the client. Monitoring liver enzymes and drug-level concentrations will help ensure that drug
    concentrations remain therapeutic (Herman & Santos, 2023). Aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine
    transaminase (ALT) are two common liver enzymes to monitor because the elevation of these enzymes may indicate
    hepatic dysfunction or liver damage. AST is an enzyme that assists in the metabolism of amino acids, while ALT
    converts proteins into energy for the liver cells.

    First-Pass Effect
    Any medication ingested orally is most commonly absorbed in the small intestine and transported through the portal
    venous system to the liver (see Figure 2.3). As the drug circulates through the liver, it is transformed by the liver
    enzymes into various metabolites. Some metabolites are active and will cause effects on the body, whereas others
    are inactivated and will be excreted from the body, largely through the stool. A significant part of any oral dose of a
    drug is destroyed through this process and will never reach its intended tissues or target cells. This is known as the
    first-pass effect. The active portion of the drug will then be circulated in the bloodstream and transported
    throughout the body to exercise its intended action. The first-pass effect can potentially decrease the bioavailability
    of a drug significantly. This means that an oral drug must be given in much larger doses as compared to IV
    administration in order to obtain similar systemic concentrations. In some circumstances, the drug cannot be given
    orally at all due to being completely inactivated by the first-pass effect. Instead, the drug must be given parenterally
    so that it can bypass this effect. The first-pass effect process is summarized as follows:

        · The client ingests an oral medication.
        · The drug travels from the mouth to the esophagus, the stomach, and then the small intestine.
        · The medication is absorbed by the intestinal mucosa, and it travels across the membranes into the portal vein.
        · Once the drug is in the portal circulation, it travels to the liver.
        · During the first pass through the liver via the portal circulation, the drug is metabolized into active and inactive

            metabolites.
        · The drug metabolites then enter the circulation and travel to target cells in various tissues where they exert

            their action.
        · Inactive metabolites are excreted through the stool.

 First-Pass Effect

  Access multimedia content (https://openstax.org/books/pharmacology/pages/2-2-pharmacokinetics-and-
  pharmacodynamics)
  This video provides a visual explanation of the first-pass effect. It concisely describes bioavailability and first-
  pass effect, important concepts in pharmacokinetics.

Drug Excretion

Drugs are eliminated from the body through the process of excretion. Although the removal of a drug occurs
primarily through the renal system, it may also occur through the lungs, skin, bile, or feces. The two primary routes
of excretion are the kidneys via urine and the GI tract via feces. Water-soluble drugs are readily removed from the
body through glomerular filtration and eliminated in the urine. Because most drugs are metabolized in the liver and
have undergone extensive biotransformation there, by the time the metabolites reach the renal system, only a small
fraction of the drug remains.

There are several factors that affect the urinary elimination of drugs:

    · Presence or absence of kidney disease
    · Perfusion or blood flow to the kidneys
    · Maturity of the kidneys
    · pH of the urine
    · Other drugs (e.g., NSAIDs decrease renal blood flow and alter the glomerular filtration rate [GFR])

     CLINICAL TIP

 Renal Function Tests

  Prior to administering a medication, the nurse should always assess the renal function tests, if available. Blood
  urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine are two important tools to assess the kidneys. Renal disorders such as
  chronic kidney disease may increase a drug's action and duration, and clients will often need to have dosage
  adjustments to prevent toxicity. As clients age, they experience a decline in both kidney and liver function, and
  the nurse must be alert to the possibility that the metabolism and excretion of drugs can be affected. Drug
  concentrations may increase because they are not properly eliminated, leaving the client vulnerable to drug
  toxicity.

Half-Life

The half-life of a drug is the amount of time it takes for the serum concentration to reduce by 50%. For example, if a
client takes a 500 mg tablet with a half-life of 4 hours, then 4 hours after administration, the amount remaining of
the drug will be 250 mg. Eight hours following administration, the amount remaining will be 125 mg. (This is one-
half of the previous level.) Twelve hours after administration, the amount remaining will be 62.5 mg. Half-life is
important because it helps determine the dosing frequency of a medication. The half-life of medications varies
widely. The antidysrhythmic medication adenosine has a half-life of less than 10 seconds, so it clears the
bloodstream quite rapidly; however, another antidysrhythmic medication, amiodarone, has a half-life of roughly 100
days. It takes approximately five half-lives for the drug to be considered functionally eliminated (or 97% eliminated)
from the body.

Morphine has a half-life of 3 hours. If a client were given 20 mg of morphine, in 3 hours that amount would decrease
by 50% (10 mg would be gone from the body). If the client were given 2 mg of morphine, then in 3 hours, the
amount would drop to 1 mg. Acetaminophen also has a half-life of 3 hours. If a 500 mg tablet is given, then in 3
hours, the amount of drug in the body will be 250 mg; however, the client given a 325 mg tablet will have
approximately 162.5 mg of the drug in their body at the end of 3 hours.

Many medications must reach a threshold concentration in order to have a therapeutic effect; this is the minimum
48  2 · Drug Administration

    effective concentration (MEC). Medications that have a short half-life leave the body quickly, in less than 8 hours,
    and will need to have short dosing intervals because the concentration quickly drops below the minimum effective
    concentration. Medications with long half-lives (greater than 24 hours) will leave the body more slowly and will be
    prescribed less frequently or at lower doses. Medications with longer half-lives may pose a greater risk for drug
    toxicity because of their propensity to accumulate in the body.

    Many factors impact drug half-life, but the most significant are metabolism and excretion. Those can be affected by:

        · End organ function
        · Age
        · Genetic factors
        · Some disease processes

    Drug Therapeutic Index

    The therapeutic index refers to the range of dosing that is both safe and effective--the amount of drug that can
    produce a therapeutic effect but not so much that it causes a toxic effect (see Figure 2.4). Sometimes the
    therapeutic range is very narrow, meaning only a small amount of extra drug causes toxicity and a small decrease in
    the dosage may cause subtherapeutic effects. The wider the range, the safer the drug because small changes to the
    dose are less likely to cause toxicity. An example of this is some blood thinners or anticoagulants. They must make
    the blood thin enough to prevent clots from forming, but if too much is given, the client can suffer from life-
    threatening bleeding. Conversely, over-the-counter drugs usually have a wide safety margin, or therapeutic index.
    Drug monitoring is sometimes required for drugs with a narrow therapeutic window to ensure that the client's drug
    level stays within a safe range.

    Onset, Peak, and Duration of Action

    A drug's therapeutic effects are usually directly related to the serum drug concentration. Most drugs work in specific
    target tissues; however, blood concentrations may allow providers to approximate drug concentration at the site of
    action. The onset, peak, and duration of action are terms that are used to describe drug effects. The onset of action
    for a medication is the time required for the drug to produce a therapeutic response (the minimum effective
    concentration). For example, for a drug that lowers blood pressure, it is the time between administration of the drug
    and onset of its hypotensive (blood pressure-lowering) effect. As the drug continues to absorb, it eventually reaches
    its maximal or peak level. A drug's peak effect describes the time required for the drug to produce its maximum
    therapeutic response. The duration of action is the length of time a drug produces a therapeutic response.

Receptor Response

Generally, a receptor is a molecule composed of a protein, found on the inside of a cell (intracellular receptor) or on
the surface of a cell (cell surface receptor), that binds to specific external transmitters or messengers and causes a
response in the cell. Each type of cell in the body contains unique receptors that allow the cell to react in a specific
fashion in response to a set of signaling molecules. These receptors do not exist specifically to bind with drugs; in
general, they naturally bind with endogenous substances such as neurotransmitters or hormones. However, due to
the nature of drugs as chemical agents, they also can interact at receptor sites. The interaction between a drug and
a receptor is what comprises the drug's mechanism of action or the drug's effect.

Receptors can bind with a drug and cause various beneficial pharmacological actions in different disease states.
Consider the action of a receptor similar to that of a lock and key. The receptor unlocks a response to a chemical
(the drug), which then affects enzyme systems within the cell (see Figure 2.5). This activated enzyme system then
produces specific effects, sometimes affecting cell membrane permeability, changing cellular metabolism, or
changing cellular activity. Often, a particular activity of the cell is either heightened or inhibited. Sometimes drugs
will bind to a receptor site and cause an effect, whereas other times, another drug will bind to the same receptor
and prevent the first drug from binding with the cell (thus blocking the effect of the first drug). This is further
explained later in this section in the discussion about agonists and antagonists.

The more selective a drug is, the more ideal the drug is. This is because its selectivity for specific receptors reduces
the potential side effects of the drug. If a drug is specific for only a few receptors, it limits the response to the
drug--similar to a key that opens only one door. When a drug can interact with a wide variety of receptors, it can
have a wide variety of responses--this would be a master key. The master key is not better than the single key--they
are simply different. The single key (or receptor), however, allows for fewer side effects.

With the advent of the Human Genome Project, scientists have discovered that drug therapy is not an "one-size-fits-
all" therapy. Some individuals may have fewer receptors than others, whereas other clients may have more. There
are genetic differences among individuals that cause enzymes that metabolize drugs to vary, sometimes causing
drug toxicity. Some individuals may develop side effects to drugs or not respond to therapy as hoped. The future of
drug therapy, related to the field of pharmacogenomics, is customized treatment that is targeted for a specific client
rather than the population as a whole. When drug therapy is targeted through pharmacogenetics, it can have a
significant role in identifying responders and nonresponders to medications, avoiding adverse effects, and improving
drug dosing (FDA, 2023b).

Receptors are responsible for specific drug actions, affect the drug dose or concentration relationship, and mediate
the actions of both agonists and antagonists. The ligand is a molecule that binds to a receiving protein molecule or
receptor. An agonist is a drug that stimulates receptors to initiate a response. It mirrors the endogenous or body's
internal receptor ligand to initiate the receptor to emit a biological response. An agonist has an affinity, or strong
attraction, to a receptor and causes intrinsic activity, which refers to the efficacy of a drug and its ability to activate
50  2 · Drug Administration

    the desired receptor. The agonist basically mimics the action of the body's physiological response. An example of
    this is insulin, which mimics the body's actions of endogenous insulin at receptor sites. Another example is beta-
    adrenergic receptors (located in the heart and kidneys), which increase heart rate, myocardial contractility, and the
    speed of the electrical conduction through the heart when activated by an agonist, such as the catecholamine
    epinephrine (adrenalin).

    An antagonist, in contrast, binds with a receptor but does not activate the receptor; however, it prevents the agonist
    from binding to the receptor and initiating a response--in essence, it blocks or inhibits the natural or endogenous
    response. Antagonists may block a body's endogenous chemicals or other drugs. In contrast to the example above,
    beta-adrenergic blockers work by blocking endogenous catecholamines, such as the hormone epinephrine
    (adrenalin), thus causing the heart to beat more slowly, decreasing myocardial contractility, and decreasing the
    speed of conduction through the heart's electrical system. Some drugs are partial agonists, which have affinity and
    moderate intrinsic activity. A partial agonist activates a receptor but not to the extent that a full agonist does.

    Mechanism of Action

    The interaction between a drug and a receptor is the mechanism of action, or "how the drug works." This is the way
    that a drug produces its pharmacological effect. Sometimes drugs affect target cells through enzymes or by
    changing cell function or the cellular structure itself. Morphine, an opioid, acts directly upon mu and kappa receptors
    in the central nervous system and alters the perception of pain. Ibuprofen, another pain reliever, decreases pain and
    inflammation by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. Acetaminophen is thought to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis in
    the central nervous system, though it has no anti-inflammatory properties like ibuprofen does. (Interestingly, its
    exact mechanism of action is unknown.) These are three examples of pain relievers with different mechanisms of
    action.

    Other examples of different mechanisms of action are the drugs used to treat hypertension. A thiazide diuretic
    reduces blood pressure by reducing circulating blood volume--to be even more specific, it increases sodium and
    water excretion by inhibiting the reabsorption of sodium in the distal tubule of the nephron. Compare that to the
    beta-adrenergic blocker metoprolol, which reduces blood pressure by blocking beta-1 adrenergic receptors at beta-
    adrenergic receptor sites and causes arterial vasodilation. However, it also acts to decrease blood pressure through
    decreased renin production. On the other hand, the angiotensin-converting enzyme blocker lisinopril reduces blood
    pressure through a different mechanism. It blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to the potent vasoconstrictor
    angiotensin II. This prevents the breaking down of bradykinin and other prostaglandins, which are vasodilatory, and
    decreases aldosterone production, which retains sodium and water and excretes potassium. This decrease in
    aldosterone production causes less sodium and water to be retained and more to be eliminated through the
    kidneys. This illustrates that the same effect--reduced blood pressure--can be produced by vastly different
    processes.

    Not all drugs have a known mechanism of action. The therapeutic effect can be observed, but how the therapeutic
    effect occurs remains a mystery. Some examples of drugs where the exact mechanism of action is unknown include
    acetaminophen, cannabidiol (CBD), and the muscle relaxant cyclobenzaprine.

    Side Effects, Adverse Drug Reactions, Drug Tolerance, and Drug Toxicity

    Therapeutic effects are the intended, beneficial, desired effects of a drug. Sometimes a drug will have more than
    one therapeutic effect. Aspirin is an example of a drug with multiple therapeutic effects--it can reduce fever, pain,
    and inflammation. However, a drug may cause other responses that are undesirable, unintended, or secondary
    effects. These are known as side effects or adverse drug reactions. There are some who use these terms
    interchangeably, though others differentiate between the two. Side effects are secondary effects of the drug and are
    usually mild and predictable. Some side effects, or secondary effects, may even be desirable. Diphenhydramine is a
    histamine blocker. Because it has the side effect of drowsiness or sleepiness, it is sometimes used at night to
    occasionally aid in sleep. Adverse drug reactions may be harmful and lead to injury. These are secondary effects
    that are observed at therapeutic doses. Medication taken for hypertension sometimes causes hypotension, for
    example. Common side effects are usually mild, but some drugs have serious adverse effects that may be
    potentially lethal. An example of a common side effect of many drugs, including aspirin, is nausea or lack of
    appetite. A serious adverse drug effect of aspirin is gastrointestinal bleeding. Morphine, an opioid agonist, often has
    the side effect of constipation. However, respiratory depression is an adverse drug reaction sometimes seen with

the administration of morphine and can lead to harm to client.

Drug tolerance occurs when a client requires more drug (or higher concentrations) in order to achieve the desired
effect. Nitrates for chest pain sometimes cause tolerance. Essentially, the body becomes used to the medication,
and more drug may be needed to get the desired effect, or a different drug has to be used. For nitrates, the client
needs to have a period of time without the drug, so providers may order the drug for daytime use but withhold the
drug during the night. Another common example is the use of opioids. At high doses, this class of medications
causes euphoria and pleasure, but over time if the individual continues to take the drug, the euphoria and pleasure
produced by the drug decrease. Initially, the client might find pain relief when taking only 5 mg of oxycodone;
however, with continued use over time, higher and higher doses are required in order to achieve the same effects.
Drug dependence occurs when the body develops a physiological or psychological need for a drug. The
physiological need means that the drug's absence may cause physical withdrawal symptoms if the drug is not taken.
Psychological dependence is observed by an intense urge to have the drug despite the adverse consequences of
taking the drug.

Drug toxicity can occur when there is an excess accumulation of a drug in the system. The ingestion of an excessive
amount of a drug might cause toxicity; however, even therapeutic doses of some drugs may cause toxicity in some
clients. Drug concentrations can also accumulate if drug-metabolizing organs are not functioning properly and the
dose is not adjusted accordingly. A client who has liver or kidney dysfunction may be at risk for drug toxicity. When a
client with liver dysfunction is given a drug that is metabolized in the liver, the dosage may need to be decreased to
prevent the accumulation of the drug in the body. The same is true for a client with kidney dysfunction. If the drug is
excreted through the kidneys, then the dosage and frequency of the drug will need to be modified. A drug excreted
by the kidneys will usually be safe for the client with liver dysfunction, and vice versa.

2.3 Drug Administration Routes, Preparation, and Administration

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 2.3.1 Identify the different routes of drug administration.
    · 2.3.2 Discuss sites for parenteral therapy.
    · 2.3.3 Analyze nursing interventions related to drug administration.
    · 2.3.4 Explain equipment and techniques for drug administration.

This section will discuss the different routes for medication administration, how to prepare for administration, and
the various methods for administering drugs to the client. Both enteral and parenteral sites will be reviewed, along
with the equipment needed for each type of drug administration. Techniques for drug administration will be
described.

Forms and Routes of Drug Administration

There are many different forms of medication: liquid, suspensions, tablets, capsules, lotions, and ointment, to name
a few. There are also many routes through which medications can be given and absorbed into the body. The routes
of medication administration are broadly categorized as follows:

    · Enteral administration: "Enteral" means "pertaining to the intestines." Most enteral medications are absorbed
        in the intestines. The primary routes for enteral administration are oral and, to a lesser extent, rectal. Some
        clients have tubes placed directly into the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., nasogastric tubes or percutaneous
        endoscopic gastrostomy [PEG] tubes). Absorption will vary, but all will be affected by the first-pass effect.

    · Parenteral administration: "Parenteral" refers to any drug that is administered outside of the GI tract;
        however, it most commonly refers to injectable drugs administered via the subcutaneous, intramuscular, or
        intravenous routes. Drugs administered via these routes have improved bioavailability because they bypass
        the first-pass effect, making absorption and onset of action more rapid.
          Percutaneous administration: Some sources will define percutaneous administration as a separate
              category or a subcategory of parenteral routes. The percutaneous route refers to topical drugs absorbed
              through the skin--lotions, ointments, creams, or patches.

The following sections describe the equipment needed for the administration of medications. The various
techniques of each route are detailed, along with their pertinent advantages and disadvantages. Nursing
52  2 · Drug Administration

    implications are also covered in relation to each route of administration.

       SAFETY ALERT

    Medication Safety

    The following are some tips for medication safety:

        · It is best practice to prepare medications for only one client at a time. This safety practice reduces the risk
            of inadvertently administering medications to the incorrect client.

        · Medications that require a focused assessment or monitoring should be kept separate from other
            medications. For example, if administering a medication that lowers blood pressure and heart rate, vital
            signs should be assessed before giving the drug. Because opioids may cause respiratory depression,
            respiratory rate and oxygen saturation should be assessed before and after administration of the drug.

        · All unit-dose medications should be opened at the bedside rather than in the medication room.
        · Never leave medications unattended at the bedside unless specifically ordered. Remain with the client until

            all medications have been administered.

    Product (Drug) Labeling
    Each prescription drug includes a package insert that provides clients with information about the drug. Many
    package inserts are developed by the manufacturer and approved by the FDA for use by clients and caregivers (FDA,
    2023a). Some of the information contained in the inserts includes generic and trade names, routes, instructions for
    taking the drug, and how to store and dispose of the drug. Any side effects, especially if the drug has serious side
    effects, are listed, as are directions about what to do if adverse effects occur. General information about the safe use
    of the drug, how to report side effects, and ingredients are also listed. These package inserts are often one of the
    best resources for free information for the client.

    Oral Medications
    Oral administration encompasses several different drug forms. Liquids, elixirs, suspensions, tablets, capsules, and
    caplets may all be given orally. Oral administration is usually quick, easy, and convenient, but the onset of action is
    longer and unpredictable due to the first-pass effect, and not all drugs can be administered this way. Table 2.1 lists
    the advantages and disadvantages of oral administration.

                            Advantages                                         Disadvantages

    · More convenient for the client (it can be done at  · Variable absorption, with some oral drugs having
       home)                                                poor absorption

                                                            presence or absence of food
                                                         · Cannot be given if the client is nauseated or
                                                            vomiting or has decreased GI motility

                                                         · Clients must be cooperative

    TABLE 2.1 Advantages and Disadvantages of Oral Administration

    Steps to administering an oral medication:
      1. Assemble the appropriate equipment:

  2. Assess the client to determine if the drug is safe and appropriate to give.
  3. Check the medication, dose, and expiration date.
  4. Check NPO status and ensure the client does not have nausea or vomiting. (NPO is a Latin term meaning nil

       per os, or nothing by mouth. Sometimes this will include medications.)
  5. Follow the seven rights of medication administration throughout the procedure (at least three times or

        according to institutional policy).
          During verification of the contents of the medication administration record and the orders
          When preparing the medication
          At the bedside

  6. Wait to open blister packs or oral unit doses until at the client's bedside.
  7. Perform hand hygiene.
  8. Don gloves if you anticipate touching the pill or the client's mouth during administration.
  9. Identify the client, and verify allergies and reaction. (If the institution uses barcode scanning, scan the client's

        ID band and the barcode on the blister pack using the protocol recommended by the institution.)
          Perform the third medication check at the bedside. This check is completed by verifying that the
              medication name, dosage, route, and time match the medication administration record (this is the last
              opportunity to prevent an error from occurring). Most institutions now have barcode scanning at the
              bedside as an additional layer of security.

10. Explain the medication to the client:
          Name (brand and generic)
          Dosage
          Indication, rationale, or reason for the drug to be given
          Frequency
          Route
          Adverse effects

11. Position the client in an upright position or on side as condition allows.
12. Assess the client's ability to swallow and the gag reflex by offering a sip of water.
13. Ask the client if they prefer all medications at once or one or two at a time.
14. Give the client the medication with a cup of water (approximately 8 ounces unless the client is on a fluid

        restriction).
15. Document administration within the medication administration record (MAR).
16. Perform hand hygiene.
17. Evaluate the client's response to the drug(s) within the appropriate time frame.

Nursing Implications for Oral Medications
The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking oral medications:

    · If a tablet needs to be split, split only tablets that are scored. If a client has difficulty swallowing a tablet or
        capsule, consult a pharmacist for advice about the technique of administration because some capsules may
       be opened and emptied into a food or liquid. Timed-release capsules or tablets should not be crushed or
        chewed because this may affect the rate of absorption and toxicity may occur. For this reason, timed-release
       capsules should not be opened and emptied into food for ease of swallowing.

    · Use a hospital-approved device to split the tablet. (Some health systems split the tablets in the pharmacy and
        send them to the unit in unit-dosed packaging for safety purposes.)

    · Discard any unused portion according to institutional policy.
          If the drug is a controlled substance, document the waste with another nurse in the medication room.

    · If a tablet needs to be crushed:
          Ensure that it can be crushed.
          Never crush sustained-release, extended-release, or enteric-coated tablets.
          If crushing more than one tablet, keep them separate; do not combine them.

    · When filling a calibrated plastic cup with liquids, fill at eye level.
    · Always remain with the client until all medications are taken; do not leave drugs at the bedside unattended.
54  2 · Drug Administration

    Sublingual and Buccal Administration
    Absorption of sublingual medications occurs in the area under the tongue, whereas buccal medications are
    absorbed in the oral mucosa, generally between the cheek and gums. These are vascular areas, and medications
    administered here are absorbed rapidly because they do not undergo the first-pass effect. Table 2.2 lists the

    TABLE 2.2 Advantages and Disadvantages of Sublingual/Buccal Administration

    Steps to administering a sublingual or buccal medication:
      1. Assemble the appropriate equipment:
              Disposable medication cup (souffle cup)
              Drinking cup
              Straw

      2. Assess the client to determine if the drug is safe and appropriate to give.
      3. Check the medication, dose, and expiration date.
      4. Follow the seven rights of medication administration throughout the procedure (at least three times or

            according to institutional policy).
              During medication reconciliation
              When preparing the medication
              At the bedside

      5. Perform hand hygiene.
      6. Don gloves if you anticipate touching the pill or the client's mouth during administration.
      7. Identify the client, and verify allergies and reaction. (If the institution uses barcode scanning, scan the client's

            ID band and the barcode on the blister pack, using the protocol recommended by the institution.)
      8. Perform the third medication check at the bedside.
      9. Explain the medication to the client:

              Name (brand and generic)
              Dosage
              Indication, rationale, or reason for the drug to be given
              Frequency
              Route
              Adverse effects

    10. Offer sips of water to moisten the oral cavity.
    11. Assist the client in placing the medication sublingually (or between the cheek and gum for buccal drugs).
    12. Instruct the client to allow the medication to dissolve completely. Discuss the importance of not swallowing or

            chewing the pill.
    13. Educate the client about the importance of abstaining from food, drinking, or smoking until after the

            medication has dissolved.
    14. Document administration within the MAR.
    15. Perform hand hygiene.
    16. Evaluate the client's response to the drug(s) within the appropriate time frame.

    Nursing Implications for Sublingual or Buccal Medications
    The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking sublingual or buccal medications:

        · Always remain with the client until all medications are taken; do not leave drugs at the bedside unattended
            unless the provider has ordered the medication to be left at the bedside.

          Exception: Sublingual nitroglycerin tablets or sprays are often ordered to be left at the bedside so that a
              client may take them as needed in the event of chest pain.

Nasal Spray Administration
Nasal sprays can be rapidly absorbed into the mucous membranes of the nasal cavity. Table 2.3 lists the advantages
and disadvantages of nasal sprays.

                        Advantages                        Disadvantages

· Convenient                        · Few drugs are available in this form
· Rapidly absorbed                  · May be irritating to the nasal mucosa
· Very rapid onset of action        · Aseptic technique should be used due to the
· Avoids first-pass effect
· May affect taste                     connection between the nasal cavity and sinuses
                                    · Some nasal sprays, such as oxymetazoline for

                                       congestion, should be used for only 3-5 days;
                                       rebound congestion may occur if used beyond
                                       that time

TABLE 2.3 Advantages and Disadvantages of Nasal Sprays

Steps to administering a nasal spray:
  1. Assemble the appropriate equipment:
          Clean gloves
          Tissue
          Medication

  2. Assess the client to determine if the drug is safe and appropriate to give.
  3. Check medication, dose, and expiration date.
  4. Follow the seven rights of medication administration throughout the procedure (at least three times or

        according to institutional policy).
          During medication reconciliation
          When preparing the medication
          At the bedside

  5. Educate the client.
          Explain the method for administering the medication. (This route may be self-administered in the future;
              however, the nurse should observe this in order to provide appropriate documentation in the MAR.)
          Inform the client that they may experience a burning or stinging sensation with administration.

  6. Instruct the client to gently blow their nose (unless it is contraindicated for the client).
  7. Assess the nostrils for erythema, edema, drainage, or tenderness.
  8. Client should be upright in a sitting position with their head tilted back.
  9. Block one nostril.
10. Hold the medication bottle upright and shake.
11. Immediately insert the tip of the applicator into the nostril.
12. Ask the client to inhale while simultaneously squeezing a spray into the nostril.
13. Once the bottle has been squeezed to deliver the medication, do not release the squeeze until the spray bottle

        has been removed from the nares. Ensure that the nozzle of the nasal spray does not touch the nasal
        turbinates or septum because pain or injury could occur.
14. Repeat the process in the other nostril if indicated.
15. Have tissue available if needed to blot the nostril. The client should avoid blowing their nose immediately.
16. Wipe the spray applicator with a clean, dry cloth or tissue.
17. Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene.
18. Document administration within the MAR.
19. Evaluate the client's response to the drug(s) within the appropriate time frame.

Be aware that some nasal medications may vary from this procedure; it is important to consult the product labeling
to confirm the appropriate administration technique.
56  2 · Drug Administration

    Nursing Implications for Nasal Sprays
    The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking nasal sprays:

        · Do not readminister the drug if the client sneezes following the administration of the nasal spray because
            there is no way to assess how much of the drug has been absorbed.

    Removing Parenteral Medication from a Vial
    When administering a parenteral medication, such as a subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, it is important to
    remember that this is an invasive procedure (a needle is inserted into the client). The medication may come in a
    prefilled syringe; however, it is usually drawn up by the nurse from a vial of medication. The nurse should be very
    alert during the process of drawing up and administering the medication to keep the needle and contents sterile.

    Steps to withdrawing medication from a vial:
      1. Perform hand hygiene and don clean gloves (not sterile).
      2. Inspect and verify the medication, dose, volume, and expiration date.
      3. Verify the dosage calculation.
      4. Remove the plastic cap from the top of the unused vial with a flick of the thumb.
      5. Wipe the rubber stopper or port with an alcohol swab and allow it to air dry for approximately 10 seconds.
              The cap does not keep the top of the port sterile. Dust and microbial contaminants can collect under the
                  cap, so it is important to cleanse with alcohol.

      6. Insulin and tuberculin syringes have preattached needles. If drawing up insulin, insulin syringes have
            preattached needles with orange caps (see Figure 2.6). Insulin syringes are marked in unit measures rather
            than in milliliters (mL). The needles on these syringes are fragile and bend very easily, so it is important to be
            careful when inserting and withdrawing the needles from the vial.

      7. When drawing up medications into syringes that are not insulin or tuberculin syringes:
            a. Attach a blunt-tipped needle to the syringe of choice. The syringe choice should be large enough to hold
                  the dose of medication, but the smallest syringe closest to that measurement (i.e., if administering 4 mL,
                  draw it up in a 5 mL syringe rather than a 10 mL, 20 mL, etc.).
            b. Remove the needle cap and draw air into the empty syringe to the volume of medication to be given (e.g.,
                  if giving 2 mL of medication, then draw up 2 mL of air).
             c. Insert the air into the vial of medication through the center of the rubber port at the top of the vial.
                     Ensuring that the tip of the needle is above the fluid level of the vial will help avoid the presence of
                        bubbles. (It prevents agitation of the drug.)
                     Be sure to maintain the sterility of the needle.
                     Do not touch the needle.
                     Be careful not to bend the needle.

            d. Inject the air into the vial.
             e. Invert the vial and hold it at eye level to slowly withdraw the desired volume of medication.

                     If the medication is withdrawn too quickly, air bubbles may enter the syringe.
                    Important tip: Ensure that the tip of the needle is below the fluid level in the vial so that no air is

                        drawn into the syringe.
                     Withdraw slightly more of the medication than needed.
                     Express any air bubbles and the excess medication back into the vial until the desired amount of

                        medication is in the syringe.
                     Withdraw the needle from the vial, being careful not to bend the needle.
                     Exchange the blunt needle for a regular needle prior to administration.

Removing Medication from Ampules
Steps to withdrawing medication from an ampule:

  1. Wash hands and don clean gloves.
  2. Medication may be seen in both the bottom and top portion of the ampule (see Figure 2.7). Thump or flick the

        top of the ampule to bring the medication to the bottom portion of the ampule.

FIGURE 2.7 An example of what an ampule looks like; note the top and bottom portion. (credit: "Group of modern plastic ampules on blue
background (https://openstax.org/r/ampules)" by Marco Verch/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)

  3. Place an unopened alcohol swab packet or gauze pad between the thumb and fingers and wrap around the
       neck of the glass ampule. Snap the neck quickly and firmly away from you (and anyone around you).

  4. Dispose of the top of the ampule in a sharps container.
  5. Attach a blunt filter needle to the appropriate syringe.
  6. Remove the cap of the filter needle and insert the needle into the center of the opened ampule, being careful

        to avoid touching the rim of the ampule with the needle.
  7. Do not inject air into the ampule.
  8. Gently pull back on the plunger to draw the medication into the syringe, keeping the needle tip in the fluid. The

        ampule can be tipped to the side to aid in the process of drawing the medication into the syringe.
  9. If bubbles are aspirated into the syringe, do not expel the bubbles back into the ampule. Simply remove all of

        the fluid, withdraw the needle, and hold the syringe in a vertical position (at a 90-degree angle). Tap the side
58  2 · Drug Administration

            of the syringe to move the air bubbles to the top of the syringe and expel the excess air without wasting the
            medication.
    10. Scoop the needle cap onto the needle, twist and remove the filter needle from the syringe, and dispose of the
            filter needle in a sharps container.
    11. If the volume in the syringe is greater than needed, discard according to institutional policy.
    12. Place a sterile tip or the appropriate needle for parenteral administration onto the syringe.
    13. Do not administer the medication using the filter needle used to draw up the medication.
    14. Proceed with labeling and administering the medication according to the administration technique needed.

         SAFETY ALERT

     Filter Needles

     Never inject a medication into a client using a filter needle. A filter needle is used to remove any microscopic
      glass particles that might occur as a result of ampule breakage. This has the potential of administering these
      glass fragments into the client.

    Subcutaneous Administration
    Subcutaneous injections are administered "under the skin" into the adipose tissue between the dermis and
    muscular layer (see Figure 2.8). Clients can be instructed to self-administer injections subcutaneously. Common
    medications administered within this layer are enoxaparin, heparin, and insulin. Medication administered here is
    often absorbed slowly due to the reduced number of blood vessels in this area. There are many potential sites for
    subcutaneous injections: upper arms, thighs, abdomen, back, and buttocks. The specific sites for each drug are
    usually detailed in the drug's package insert or labeling. Routine injections should be rotated regularly among the
    different sites. Do not inject into sites that are hard when palpated. Do not rub the injection site, though gentle
    pressure may be applied to the area after the drug has been administered.

    Table 2.4 lists the advantages and disadvantages of subcutaneous administration.

                            Advantages                                         Disadvantages

    · Absorption is slower than with IM injections, but  · Maximum volume of medication via this route is
       the duration of action is longer                     1.5 mL

    · Can be self-administered by the client             · Absorption varies from site to site
    · Low risk of infection

 2. Assess the client to determine if the drug is safe and appropriate to give.
 3. Check the medication, dose, volume, and expiration date.
 4. Follow the seven rights of medication administration throughout the procedure (at least three times or

       according to institutional policy).

         At the bedside

 5. Perform hand hygiene.
 6. Don gloves.
 7. Identify the client, and verify allergies and reaction. (If the institution uses barcode scanning, scan the client's

       ID band and the barcode on the vial or unit dose, using the protocol recommended by the institution.)
 8. Perform the third medication check at the bedside.
 9. Explain the medication to the client:

         Name (brand and generic)
         Dosage
         Indication, rationale, or reason for the drug to be given
         Frequency
         Route
         Adverse effects

10. Prepare medication using the correct needle length (3/8-5/8 inches), gauge (25-29 gauge), and syringe
       (usually no more than 1.5 mL can be given via this route). For clients with little adipose tissue, use the smaller
       needle.

11. Select an injection site with an adequate fat pad.
         Avoid bruises, rashes, inflammation, or areas of injury.
         Ensure that the injection site is a minimum of 2 inches away from the umbilicus, a stoma, or an incision.
         Preferred sites include the abdomen, upper arms, and anterior thighs.

12. Assist the client into a position in which the site or extremity can be relaxed.
13. Cleanse the area with an alcohol swab using a circular motion by starting at the center and working outward in

       a widening circle to about 2-3 inches. Allow to air dry.
14. Grasp the skinfold between your thumb and index or third finger of the nondominant hand. (A new alcohol

       swab or gauze can be placed between the fourth and fifth fingers of this hand to use after injection.)
15. Remove the needle cap carefully and dispose.
16. Instruct the client that they will feel a "pinch."
17. Quickly and smoothly insert the needle into the skin and adipose tissue at a 45- to 90-degree angle. The

       anticoagulant enoxaparin is a subcutaneous injection that should be given at a 90-degree angle.
18. Inject the medication with the dominant hand depressing the plunger with slow and even pressure, while

       holding the barrel of the syringe steady with the nondominant hand.
19. Do not aspirate for subcutaneous injections.
20. Withdraw the needle smoothly at the same angle that it was inserted to prevent trauma at the injection site.
21. Apply gentle pressure with the alcohol swab, but do not massage the site, especially if the medication given

       was an anticoagulant such as heparin or enoxaparin, because this may cause extensive bruising.
22. Activate the safety device on the syringe and dispose of the syringe in the sharps container or a puncture-

       resistant needle disposal container according to institutional policy. Never throw it into the trash.
23. Do not recap the needle! This is a safety hazard for the nurse. Recapping needles may lead to needle sticks

       and exposure to pathogens.
24. Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene.
25. Document in the MAR. When documenting a subcutaneous injection, be sure to document the site the
60  2 · Drug Administration

            medication was administered to allow for the rotation of sites.
    26. Evaluate the client's response to the drug(s) within the appropriate time frame.

    Nursing Implications for Subcutaneous Administration
    The nurse should do the following for clients receiving a subcutaneous injection:

        · For heparins and insulins: Both are high-alert medications. A second nurse will need to verify the dose. Do not
            draw up the dose until a witness is available to verify.

        · Never draw heparin up into an insulin syringe. (Fortunately, many heparins come in prefilled syringes for safety
            reasons.)
              Insulin, and only insulin, should be drawn up into an insulin syringe. Never draw up insulin into a regular
                  syringe with milliliter (mL) markings because this will cause an overdose of insulin.

        · Administer subcutaneous injections at a 45- to 90-degree angle depending upon the body habitus of the
            individual. For extremely thin individuals and children, ensure that the angle is shallow enough that the
            medication is not given intramuscularly

       LINK TO LEARNING

    ISMP Guidelines for Safe Subcutaneous Insulin Use

    Review the ISMP Guidelines for Optimizing Safe Subcutaneous Insulin Use in Adults (https://openstax.org/r/
    ismpsites). According to the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP), insulin is associated with more
    medication errors than any other type or class of drugs.

    Intramuscular Injections
    Intramuscular injections (IM) are administered deep into the muscular tissue beneath the dermis and subcutaneous
    layers (see Figure 2.9). The most common sites for IM injections are the ventrogluteal and deltoid areas. Vastus
    lateralis landmarks are preferred for infants and children under age 2. Table 2.5 lists the advantages and
    disadvantages of intramuscular administration.

                            Advantages                          Disadvantages

    · Absorption is more rapid than with  · Maximum volume of medication via
       subcutaneous injections.              ventrogluteal route is 3 mL (If more than 3 mL is
                                             required, separate into two injections.)
    · Rapid onset of action
    · Avoids first-pass effect            · Incorrect placement of the needle may cause
                                             harm to the client (nerve or blood vessel injury)

                                          · Some drugs are very irritating to the tissues,
                                             which causes pain

                                          · Drug absorption is variable (depends on the

       resistant needle disposal container according to institutional policy. Never throw it into the trash.
22. Do not recap the needle! This is a safety hazard for the nurse. Recapping needles may lead to needle sticks

       and exposure to pathogens.
23. Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene.
24. Document in the MAR. When documenting an IM injection, be sure to document the site the medication was

       administered to allow for the rotation of sites if other doses are necessary.
25. Evaluate the client's response to the drug(s) within the appropriate time frame.

    Follow institutional policy about aspiration with IM injections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
    and World Health Organization (WHO) no longer recommend the practice of aspiration for vaccinations because no
    large blood vessels lie close to the area of injection (CDC, 2023). It is thought that it may cause pain at the site if the
    syringe is not stable and may actually cause damage to the tissue. At this point in time, there is not enough
    evidence-based information to support or abort the process of aspiration. Most studies look at the potential
    discomfort felt with aspiration rather than the safety of intramuscular administration. If the institution recommends
    aspiration, follow these steps:

      1. Quickly and smoothly insert the needle through the skin and adipose tissue into the muscular layer at a
            90-degree angle.

      2. With the dominant hand, pull back on the plunger to aspirate for blood return for 5 seconds. If blood enters
            the hub of the needle/syringe, stop. Pull the needle out and begin again using a new needle and a different
            site.

      3. If no blood return is seen with aspiration, inject the medication with the dominant hand depressing the
            plunger with slow and even pressure, while holding the barrel of the syringe near the hub steady with the
            nondominant hand.

      4. Continue, using the instructions above.

    Z-Track Method
    Some institutions require all IM injections to be given with the Z-track method. It is particularly helpful with
    medications that stain the skin or are irritating, such as iron preparations. The Z-track method is never wrong, but it
    isn't always necessary. For this reason, know the institutional policy and proceed accordingly.

      1. Use the nondominant hand to displace the skin tissue laterally approximately 1 inch.
      2. Hold the tissue laterally and insert the needle.
      3. Gently inject the medication into the muscle and wait 10 seconds.
      4. Remove the needle and then release the skin and allow it to return to its normal position after withdrawing the

            needle.

    Deltoid Injections
    To give a deltoid injection, remove clothing to expose the upper arm and shoulder area. Discuss the preferred arm
    with the client. They may prefer the nondominant arm to be used due to potential soreness; however, many
    individuals prefer the dominant arm because the increased movement with that arm may work the soreness out
    earlier. The client may bend the elbow to assist with relaxation of the muscle. To determine landmarks, find the
    acromion process, which will be the base of an upside-down triangle. Locate the lateral midpoint on the arm in line

with the axilla. The injection site will be located in the center of the triangle, approximately 1.5 inches below the
acromion process. (See Figure 2.10.)

     SAFETY ALERT

 Needle Disposal

 Never dispose of needles in trash cans. Needles should be disposed of in a sharps disposal container. These
  containers are made from rigid, puncture-resistant plastic or metal and have a tight-fitting lid that allows disposal
  of the sharp without allowing the hand or fingers to enter. These containers limit the potential of exposure to
  blood-borne pathogens from used needles. Once full, the containers should be entrusted into the care of a
  hazardous waste management company to ensure proper disposal.

Ventrogluteal Injections
To give an injection at the ventrogluteal site, position the client on their side with the knees bent (upper leg slightly
ahead of the lower leg). Use the left hand to find landmarks when injecting into the right ventrogluteal site, and use
the right hand to find landmarks when injecting into the left ventrogluteal site. Locate the greater trochanter at the
head of the femur and place the palm of the hand over the greater trochanter and the index finger on the
anterosuperior iliac spine. Aim the middle finger and ring finger toward the iliac crest. Point the thumb toward the
client's groin with the fingers toward the client's head. Spread the middle finger along the iliac crest toward the
buttocks. The injection site is in the center of the triangle formed by the middle and index fingers. (See Figure 2.11.)

    Intravenous Push (IVP) Administration via Saline Lock
    Intravenous medications are introduced directly into the vein and, thus, into the circulation during administration.
    This route is the fastest because no absorption is necessary, and drugs are 100% bioavailable because they bypass
    the first-pass effects of the liver. Table 2.6 lists the advantages and disadvantages of IVP administration.

                            Advantages                                       Disadvantages

    · Very fast absorption and onset of action         · Often more expensive
    · Useful in emergencies                            · Clients may be less mobile
    · Medications are delivered systemically           · Risk for infection (more invasive)
    · Drugs may be delivered both intermittently and   · When adverse effects occur, they may be more

       continuously                                       severe
    · Once the IV has been established, it is usually  · Risk of phlebitis (inflammation of the vein due to

       more comfortable for the client                    mechanical or chemical irritation)
    · Predictable drug levels                          · Risk of infiltration/extravasation (The IV catheter

                                                          is no longer in the vein; the medication infuses
                                                          into the tissue instead. Extravasation is related
                                                          to medication that is harmful to the tissue--in
                                                          fact, it may cause tissue death.)

    TABLE 2.6 Advantages and Disadvantages of IVP Administration

    Steps to administering an IVP medication:
      1. Assemble the appropriate equipment:
              Medication
              Syringe with a needleless device
              Needles
              Normal saline flushes
              Diluent, if needed
              Alcohol swabs
              Gloves

      2. Assess the client to determine if the drug is safe and appropriate to give.
      3. Check the medication, dose, volume, and expiration date.
      4. Check the compatibility of the medication with the IV fluids that are hanging.
      5. Double-check dosage calculations.

 6. Follow the seven rights of medication administration throughout the procedure (at least three times or
       according to institutional policy).
         During medication reconciliation
         When drawing up the medication
         At the bedside

 7. Perform hand hygiene.
 8. Don gloves.
 9. In the medication room (or possibly the client's room in some institutions), use aseptic technique to draw the

       medication into the syringe as described in the previous section.
        a. Use a syringe size closest to the amount of the drug needed (e.g., a 3 mL syringe to draw up 1-3 mL or a 5

             mL syringe to draw up 4-5 mL).
        b. Double-check the rate of administration.
        c. Label the medication syringe with the client's name, date of birth, medication name, dosage and volume,

             time, and initials. (This may vary slightly between institutions.)

10. Once in the client's room, identify the client, and verify allergies and reaction. (If the institution uses barcode
       scanning, scan the client's ID band and the barcode on the vial or package, using the protocol recommended
       by the institution.)

11. Perform the third medication check at the bedside.
12. Explain the medication to the client:

         Name (brand and generic)
         Dosage
         Indication, rationale, or reason for the drug to be given
         Frequency
         Route
         Adverse effects

13. Assess the IV site. Check for redness, swelling, or tenderness. Assess local skin temperature for warmth.
14. Unclamp the saline lock and expel air bubbles from a saline flush. Then remove the disinfecting cap from the

       port.
15. Scrub the hub of the port and the threads with an alcohol swab or the institution's preferred cleanser for 15

       seconds.
16. Remove the tip from the flush (see Figure 2.12) and insert the saline flush by twisting and pushing to the right.

       Once the flush is engaged with the saline lock, gently aspirate for blood return to assess for patency of IV.
66  2 · Drug Administration

    FIGURE 2.12 A syringe is attached to a saline lock by twisting and pushing to the right. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax,
    under CC BY 4.0 license)

    17. Using gentle force, attempt to flush the IV with 2-3 mL of saline to assess for IV patency. If resistance is felt,
           do not force! Stop flushing immediately because the catheter may be occluded. The saline lock may need to
            be restarted.

    18. If the catheter flushes easily, disconnect the flush from the saline lock, keeping the hub of the saline lock
            sterile. Keep the tip of the used saline flush sterile while attaching the syringe of medication to the saline lock.
            If the hub is dropped and no longer sterile, wipe the hub thoroughly for 15 seconds before attaching the
            syringe with the drug in it.

    19. Administer the medication in a smooth, continuous manner through the saline lock at the recommended rate
            of administration for that particular drug until the appropriate dose is given.

    20. Remember that IV medications have 100% bioavailability and an immediate onset of action. It is important to
            assess for adverse reactions during and after administration.

    21. Disconnect the syringe and reconnect the saline flush. (Ensure that the tip is still uncontaminated.) Infuse 2-3
            mL of saline through the saline lock at the same rate of infusion that the drug was given (medication is still in
            the saline lock) to clear the remainder of the drug from the line.

    22. Place a new disinfecting cap on the port per institutional policy.
    23. Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene.
    24. Document in the medication administration record.
    25. Evaluate the client's response to the drug(s) within the appropriate time frame.

         SAFETY ALERT

     IV Administration

      If white, cloudy particles appear in the saline lock during administration, immediately stop administering the IV
      drug. This is a precipitate usually caused by incompatibility between the drug being administered and the
      solution in the IV line or saline lock. Some drugs may harm the client when used together. Often this is due to a
      chemical alteration that occurs when used concurrently. Some incompatibilities cause a precipitate or crystals to

form; others cause an inactivation of the drug; yet others may cause a toxic solution to form. Immediately clamp
the IV or saline lock. Change the administration tubing and restart the infusion. Double-check for Y-site
compatibility (when a drug is administered into a Y-site connection with another solution) between the solution
and the medication.

Transdermal Patch (or Disk) Application
Transdermal patches are applied to the skin. Patches usually allow for a slow, very controlled release of medication
into the skin over a period of hours to days. Common medications that are delivered via this route are nitroglycerin
(for angina), fentanyl (for pain), and clonidine (for hypertension). Each drug delivery system is unique, so it is
important to read about the individual drug to know the onset and duration of action for the medication delivered by
a patch. Table 2.7 lists the advantages and disadvantages of transdermal administration.

                        Advantages                                          Disadvantages

· Medications are delivered systemically              · Patches are expensive
· A constant amount of medication is delivered for    · The rate of absorption may be affected by

   a specific time frame (e.g., fentanyl patches may     excessive perspiration and body temperature
   deliver 25 mcg per hour for 72 hours)              · If adverse effects occur, the drug continues to be
· Therapeutic effects last longer

  4. Wait to open the patch or disk until at the client's bedside.
  5. Perform hand hygiene.
  6. Don clean gloves for the administration of any patch or ointment. Never apply a patch or ointment with the

        bare hand because the medication can be transferred to you in the process.
  7. Identify the client and verify allergies and reaction. (If the institution uses barcode scanning, scan the client's

        ID band and the barcode on the blister pack, tube, or package, using the protocol recommended by the
        institution.)
  8. Perform the third medication check at the bedside.
  9. Explain the medication to the client:

          Adverse effects

10. Remove any old patches that remain on the skin.
          Many patches are small, clear, transparent disks, so some are difficult to find.
          Assess the skin for irritation at the site of the old patch.

11. Cleanse the skin with soap and water and allow it to dry before applying patches or ointments.
12. Ensure that the site of the new patch is free of irritation, scrapes, open sores, or bruises. It is best if it is

        located on an area with little to no hair.
13. Rotate sites each time a new patch is placed.
14. Label the patch prior to placing it on the client with the nurse's initials, the date, and the time administered.

    15. Perform hand hygiene.
    16. Document in the MAR.
    17. Evaluate the client's response to the drug(s) within the appropriate time frame.

    Nursing Implications for Transdermal Administration
    The nurse should do the following for clients receiving a transdermal patch:

        · Educate the client to administer the patch at the same time each day.
        · Administer after a shower or bath.
        · Always remain with the client until all medications are taken; do not leave drugs at the bedside unattended.
        · Educate the client to develop a schedule for rotating the sites of application.
        · Never cut a patch in half (unless allowed per the drug product's labeling) because this may release all of the

            medication at once, resulting in an overdose. Patches are developed with special technology to release the
            medication slowly over a long period of time. Some patches may only need to be replaced once each week.
        · Don gloves to remove a patch and dispose of according to institutional policy. Never dispose of a patch in the
            trash. Children have removed them from the trash thinking they were stickers, and this resulted in harm to the
            child. Pets also have eaten them.
        · Educate the client that the patch's effects may last for many hours following its removal (up to 72 hours).

    Cutaneous Administration
    Ointments and lotions are medications that can be applied to the skin. Some are used for local therapy (e.g.,
    hydrocortisone lotion applied to a rash), whereas some are used for systemic absorption. A common medication
    that is delivered via an ointment for systemic absorption is nitroglycerin (for angina). This medication will be
    discussed specifically due to its unique formulation.

    Steps to administering nitroglycerin ointment (nitroglycerin paste):
      1. Assemble the appropriate equipment:
              Gloves
              Nitroglycerin ointment and application paper
              Paper tape

      2. Assess the client to determine if the drug is safe and appropriate to give.
      3. Check the medication, dose, volume, and expiration date.
      4. Follow the seven rights of medication administration throughout the procedure (at least three times or

            according to institutional policy).
              During medication reconciliation
              When measuring the medication
              At the bedside

      5. Perform hand hygiene.
      6. It is important to don clean gloves for the administration of ointment. Never apply ointment with bare hands

            because the medication can be transferred to you in the process.
      7. Identify the client and verify allergies and reaction. (If the institution uses barcode scanning, scan the client's

            ID band and the barcode on the tube of ointment, using the protocol recommended by the institution.)
      8. Perform the third medication check at the bedside.
      9. Explain the medication to the client:

              Name (brand and generic)
              Dosage
              Indication, rationale, or reason for the drug to be given
              Frequency
              Route
              Adverse effects

    10. Remove any old nitroglycerin doses that remain on the skin.
              Assess the skin for irritation at the site of the old nitroglycerin applicator paper.

    11. Cleanse the skin with soap and water and allow it to dry before applying the ointment.

12. Ensure that the site of the new dose is free of irritation, open sores, scrapes, or bruises. It is best if it is located
       on an area with little to no hair.

13. Rotate sites each time ointment is applied.
14. To administer the drug, lay the applicator paper down on the counter with the print side facing down.
15. Measure the amount of ointment to be used on the applicator paper, which is marked in a 2-inch strip with

       marks every half inch. The ointment is in a tube similar to that of toothpaste and should be gently squeezed so
       that a strip of ointment is placed on the applicator paper in the appropriate measurement. For example, the
       provider may order "nitroglycerin ointment 1 inch every 6 hours." So, a one-inch ribbon of ointment would
       then be placed on the paper (see Figure 2.13).

FIGURE 2.13 Nitroglycerin ointment is drawn up for administration on applicator paper. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax,

16. Apply the applicator paper with the ointment side closest to the skin.
17. Tape in place using nonallergenic tape. Plastic wrap may be taped over the applicator paper to protect clothes.
18. Label the applicator paper if this was not done prior to placing it on the client with the nurse's initials, the date,

        and the time administered.
19. Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene.
20. Document in the medication administration record.
21. Evaluate the client's response to the drug(s) within the appropriate time frame.

Nursing Implications for Cutaneous Application
The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking a cutaneous medication:

    · Administer after a shower or bath.
    · Educate the client to develop a schedule for rotating the sites of the application.
    · Do not rub the ointment into the skin.
    · For nitroglycerin ointment: Allow a nitro-free time period every 24 hours (this is usually done at night). Some

        providers will order "nitroglycerin ointment 1 inch every 6 hours. Take off at 10 p.m. Reapply at 6 a.m."
    · As with transdermal patches, it is important to dispose of old ointment in a container safe from children or

        pets. A large dose of the medication will remain in the ointment, which may be toxic to children or pets.

Vaginal Administration
Vaginal medications may come in a variety of forms: creams, suppositories, foams, and so forth. Although vaginal
suppositories may be inserted with a gloved finger, foams, creams, tablets, and jellies should be inserted with a
special vaginal applicator. Table 2.8 lists the advantages and disadvantages of vaginal administration.

                        Advantages                                                      Disadvantages

    12. Position the client supine, hips elevated, knees bent, with the feet flat on the bed near the hips.
    13. Provide perineal care as necessary.
    14. Fill the applicator with the prescribed medication.
    15. Lubricate with water-soluble lubricant.
    16. Spread the labia, using the nondominant hand, and expose the vagina. Gently insert the applicator into the

            vagina approximately 2 inches using the dominant hand.
    17. Push the plunger to deposit the medication into the vagina.
    18. Remove the applicator and wrap it in a paper towel for cleaning later or disposal.
    19. For suppositories, remove the wrapping and lubricate the room-temperature suppository with water-soluble

            jelly. Use an applicator if available; otherwise, use a finger on the dominant hand to insert the suppository
            about 3-4 inches into the vagina along its posterior wall. For creams or foams, insert 2-3 inches.
    20. Client should remain in position for 10 minutes.
    21. Apply a perineal pad if the client wishes.
    22. Wash the applicator after each use.
    23. Remove gloves.
    24. Perform hand hygiene.
    25. Document in the medication administration record.
    26. Evaluate the client's response to the drug(s) within the appropriate time frame.

    Nursing Implications for Vaginal Applications
    The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking vaginal medications:

        · Administer at bedtime, when possible, to allow the medication to remain in place for as long as possible.
        · Assess for vaginal discharge and any other symptoms.
        · Be clear in your teaching of the process because vaginal medications may be administered by the client.
        · Educate the client to refrain from using douches and abstain from sexual intercourse after inserting

            medication.

Rectal Administration
Several medications can be given via the rectal route. This route can be used if clients are suffering from nausea and
vomiting, especially if no IV is in place. This route has both a mixed first-pass effect and a non-first-pass effect.
There are capillaries in the rectum that feed the portal circulation, which causes some of the medication to undergo
first-pass effect; however, some of the medication will also be absorbed into the perirectal tissues locally.

Suppositories are medications that are solid at room temperature but soften and dissolve once in the rectal cavity.
These medications are wrapped in foil or plastic packaging (see Figure 2.14), and it is important to remove the
packaging prior to inserting the suppository in the client.

Table 2.9 lists the advantages and disadvantages of rectal administration.

                        Advantages                                          Disadvantages

· Very helpful for clients who are actively vomiting  · Partially undergoes first-pass effect
· Absorption is fairly rapid                          · Absorption is very erratic and difficult to predict
                                                      · Cannot be used in clients with recent prostate or

                                                         rectal surgery or rectal trauma
                                                      · Cannot be used in clients with rectal bleeding or

                                                         diarrhea
                                                      · Inconvenient for the client to use
                                                      · Uncomfortable for the client

TABLE 2.9 Advantages and Disadvantages of Rectal Administration

Steps to administering rectal suppositories:
  1. Assemble the appropriate equipment:
          Gloves
          Water-soluble lubricant
          Medication
          Bedpan, if client is on bed rest

  2. Assess the client to determine if the drug is safe and appropriate to give. Assess for rectal bleeding or
        diarrhea.

  3. Check the medication, dose, volume, and expiration date.
  4. Follow the seven rights of medication administration throughout the procedure (at least three times or

        according to institutional policy).
          During medication reconciliation
          When preparing the medication
          At the bedside

  5. Perform hand hygiene.
  6. Don clean gloves for the administration of rectal suppositories. Never apply with a bare hand.
  7. Identify the client and verify allergies and reaction. (If the institution uses barcode scanning, scan the client's

        ID band and the barcode on the package using the protocol recommended by the institution.)
  8. Perform the third medication check at the bedside.
  9. Explain the medication to the client:

          Name (brand and generic)
          Dosage
          Indication, rationale, or reason for the drug to be given
          Frequency
          Route
          Adverse effects

10. Position the client on their left side with the uppermost leg flexed toward the waist. (This position is called the
        Sim's position or left lateral position.)

11. Provide privacy. Drape the client with a sheet.
12. Remove the foil or plastic wrapping from the medication (see Figure 2.14).
72  2 · Drug Administration

    FIGURE 2.14 Suppositories, like the ones shown here, need to be removed from the wrapping before inserting in the client's rectum.

    13. Lubricate the suppository with the water-soluble gel. Consider lubricating your gloved finger to support the
            client's comfort during this process. Never use petroleum-based products for lubrication because this may
            affect the absorption of the medication.

    14. The suppository is usually shaped similarly to a bullet. Insert the rounded end into the rectum while
            instructing the client to take a deep breath and then exhale.

    15. Insert the suppository along the side of the rectal wall, at least 1 inch beyond the internal rectal sphincter.
    16. Instruct the client to remain on their left side for approximately 20 minutes to allow the suppository to be

            absorbed. If the medication is being given to stimulate defecation, it may take 20-30 minutes for that to
            occur. If the medication is given for other reasons, such as fever or nausea, it may take as long as an hour.
            Check the pharmaceutical information for specifics.
    17. Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene.
    18. Document in the medication administration record.
    19. Evaluate the client's response to the drug(s) within the appropriate time frame.

    Nursing Implications for Rectal Administration
    The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking drugs rectally:

        · Do not insert a rectal suppository into stool. Palpate the rectal wall for the presence of feces.
        · Have the client defecate prior to inserting the suppository, if possible.
        · Never divide suppositories.
        · Loss of sphincter control may be seen in older clients. Have a bedpan handy.
        · Suppositories may be administered by the client. Be clear in your teaching of the process.
        · It is important to educate clients who are self-administering suppositories that these drugs are to be given

            rectally, not orally.

Dosage calculations are an important part of drug administration, and the safety of the client depends on the nurse's
ability to correctly calculate the dosage needed at any point in time. Drugs are not always available in the exact
dosage or units of measurement that the client needs or the provider ordered. Knowing how to accurately calculate
the amount needed is vital for the safety of the client. This chapter will review the units of measure used in drug
calculations, introduce drug labels and explain how to interpret them, and acquaint the learner with various
methods for performing drug calculations. The basis for all drug calculations is a fundamental knowledge of math
skills and problem-solving.

Systems of Measurement

There are several different systems of measurement. The apothecary system, the household system, and the metric
system are three of the most common.

Apothecary System
One of the older systems of measurement is the apothecary system, and it has been used by apothecaries or
pharmacists for the last couple of centuries. This system is very difficult to use, and the Joint Commission, the FDA,
and the Institute of Safe Medication Practice (ISMP) have recommended that it be discontinued. It is now seldom
used, and the metric system was adopted. The nurse will rarely see an apothecary measurement, but it is important
to understand how to correctly adapt an order using the apothecary system to the metric system. This can be
accomplished through collaboration with the pharmacist or by using a table of weights and measures. The units of
measure in the apothecary system are grains, drams, scruples, and the minim; the values are sometimes expressed
as Roman numerals (e.g., X, IV) instead of Arabic numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4). The nurse should be aware of this;
however, it won't be a focus of this chapter.

Household System
The household system (also known as the customary system) includes units of measure such as tablespoons,
teaspoons, pounds, and ounces. Unfortunately, there has been much confusion in using this system, which leads to
dosing errors. Thus, it is no longer used. The ISMP has issued recommendations to avoid household measurements.
For conversion equivalents, see Appendix C: Drug Conversion Tables.

Metric System
Three types of metric measures are commonly used: length, volume, and weight. This section will cover only volume
and weight. It is important to understand that the units can be smaller or larger in relation to their metric measure.
The basic units are multiplied or divided by multiples of 10, which increases the ease of use when converting from
one unit of measure to another.

Volume measures a liquid and is commonly used in dosage calculation when measuring liquid drugs, in the
reconstitution of drugs, or with intravenous therapy. The metric system defines volume in units of liters. Weight
measures mass and is commonly used in dosage calculation when a particular drug is administered based on the
client's weight. The metric system defines weight in units of grams. A few examples are listed in Table 2.10,
followed by their abbreviations and their equivalent number of grams. (See also Appendix A: International System of
Units.)

Kilo indicates a larger unit of measurement and equals 1000. Milli indicates a smaller unit of measurement and
equals 1/1000. Micro is also a smaller measurement and equals 1/1,000,000. Conversion between metric system
units routinely occurs when you are preparing to administer drugs to clients.

        Metric Prefix  Example for Weight (abbreviation)  Conversion to Base Unit

Weight  Kilo           Kilogram (kg)                      1 kg = 1000 g

        Milli          Milligram (mg)                     1000 mg = 1 g

        Micro          Microgram (mcg)                    1,000,000 mcg = 1 g

    TABLE 2.10 Common Metric Prefixes, Abbreviations, and Conversions Used in Dosage Calculation

    Note that the abbreviation for "micro" is sometimes shown as the Greek mu (µ, as in µg or µL); however, that
    practice is considered to be error prone by the Institute for Safe Medication Practices and has been supplanted by
    "mc," as in "mcg" for microgram or "mcL" for microliter.

Drug Labels and Precautions

To safely administer drugs to clients, one must understand the drug label and precautions listed. Components of a
drug label (see Figure 2.15 and Figure 2.16) include drug generic and brand names, the strength of the drug, drug
form, route of administration (if indicated), dosage and administration instructions, expiration date, controlled
substance notification (if indicated), drug reconstitution (if indicated), and if the drug is a single or multidose vial (if
indicated).

Drug Calculation Methods and Rounding Rules

There are three general methods for drug calculation: basic formula method, ratio and proportion, and dimensional
analysis. It is recommended that the learner use the method they are most comfortable with. Additionally, some
drugs require dosing based on weight and/or body surface area. These drugs require additional calculation.
76  2 · Drug Administration

    Basic Formula Method
    The basic formula method, also known as Desire Over Have, is the simplest of the drug calculation methods.

    To use this method:

      1. Write the desired dose or the dose ordered.
      2. Write the drug dose on hand (available).
      3. Divide the desired dose by the dose on hand and multiply by the quantity or volume of the drug form to get the

            amount calculated to be administered to the client.

    Note: It is extremely important that the units of measure are the same when doing these calculations. If the desired
    dose is in mg, the on-hand amount must also be in mg. The amount to be administered will be in the same units as
    the quantity or volume of the drug form.

    Example:

    Desired dose: Lisinopril 10 mg orally BID (twice a day)
    On hand: Lisinopril 2.5 mg per 1 tablet
    How many tablets should the client receive per dose?

    The amount to be administered to the client is 4 tablets.

  Understanding how to properly calculate dosage is important for nurses. This video provides additional
  information on the Formula or Desired Over Have method of dosage calculations.

Ratio and Proportion Method
The ratio and proportion method uses a linear equation to solve the dosage calculation problem.

To use this method:

  1. Write the known dose (dosage strength from drug label). (See K in the above formula.)
  2. Write the known unit of measurement (also found on the drug label). (See M in the above formula.)
  3. Write the desired ordered dose (usually found in the physician's orders). (See D in the above formula.)
  4. Write X in the above formula as the placeholder for the desired amount to be administered. You will solve for

       X.
  5. Check the units of measurement to make sure they are the same (e.g., mg : mg or tablets : tablets). Note that

       if they are not the same, you must convert them to the same unit of measurement prior to solving for X.
  6. Solve for X (the desired amount to be administered to the client) by multiplying the means (M and D in the

       middle of the formula above) and the extremes (K and X on the outside of the formula). (Work only with the
       numbers and not the units of measurement.) Clear the X by dividing both sides of the equation by the number
       in front of the X, which solves X.

Another method of setting up a ratio and proportion equation is as follows:

To solve this type of equation, cross multiply:       . (Work only with the numbers and not the units of

measurement.). Clear the X by dividing both sides of the equation by the number in front of the X, which solves for X.

Example:

Ordered: Lisinopril 10 mg orally BID
Available: Lisinopril 2.5 mg
How many tablets should the client receive per dose?

    Dimensional Analysis Method
    Dimensional analysis is one of several methods for determining the correct dose of medication. Dimensional
    analysis uses a series of equivalent measurements to change one unit of measurement to another to solve a
    problem. This method uses equivalent measurements that are set up as a series of "fractions," called conversion
    factors (or dimensions), that are used to cancel unnecessary units of measurements, leaving only the desired
    answer. There are times when there will be a number on top but not on the bottom. (These are not true fractions.)

    To use this method:

      1. Determine what you want to find (or solve for). Consider this a road map to your destination--where you want
           to go. Place the units of measure or quantity you want to find on the right side of the equation following the
            equal sign.

      2. Typically, you will then start on the far left with the provider's medication order. Once you know what you wish
           to find (the provider's order), place that number and unit at the top left portion of the equation.

      3. Use the information provided to slowly move forward, canceling units of measure when possible and circling
            units of measure you are looking for (using the road map as a guide).

    In the first example below:

      1. X number of tablets are placed on the right side of the equation following the equal sign because you are
            solving for how many tablets should be given.

      2. 10 mg is placed in the upper left side in the numerator position.
      3. Because you are solving for the correct number of tablets, tablet must be on the top left of the equation and

            not canceled out. And because mg is not on the right side of the equation, mg should be canceled out. That
            helps determine the placement of the next part of the equation.
      4. One tablet must be on top so that the mg in 2.5 mg can be canceled out.

Example 1:
Ordered: Lisinopril 10 mg PO BID
Available: Lisinopril 2.5 mg

How many tablets should the client receive per dose?

1. First, determine what goes on the right side of the equation. What units of measure are you solving for? In this

example, it is tablets.

2. Then, identify the information on the top left--in this example, 10 mg have been ordered. Note that there is no

number or letter under the 10 mg; leave it blank.

3. Cross out the units of measure--mg (numerator) and mg (denominator).

4. Now solve the math:                    . Divide by 2.5 and solve for X (see Figure 2.18).

Example 2:
Ordered: Give digoxin 0.5 mg IV push × 1 dose now
Available: Digoxin 0.25 mg/1 mL

How many mL should be given?

1. First, determine what goes on the right side of the equation. What units of measure are you solving for? In this

example, it is mL.

2. The next step is to identify the information on the top left of the equation, which is the ordered amount of 0.5

mg. Note that there is nothing under 0.5 mg. Leave it blank.

3. Cross out the units of measure--mg (numerator) and mg (denominator).

4. Now solve the math:                    . Divide by 0.25.

5. The answer is 2 mL (see Figure 2.19).

FIGURE 2.19 This example of dimensional analysis is for an IV push medication. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC

Dimensional analysis is particularly helpful for more complicated equations, such as the following one. Note how the
information can unfold as you add units of measure and cancel out as needed.

Example 3:
Ordered: Initiate dopamine IV infusion at 5 mcg/kg/minute
Available: Dopamine hydrochloride 800 mg in 500 mL normal saline
Client's weight: 176 lb

How many mL/hour should the medication infuse?

  1. First, determine what goes on the right side of the equation. What units of measure are you solving for? In this
        example, it is mL/hour.

  2. Now identify the information on the top left of the equation. In this example, it is 5 mcg. The order reads 5
        mcg/kg/min. Therefore, 5 mcg goes on the top left, and kg/min is on the bottom left.

  3. To solve the equation, the client's weight of 176 lb will also need to be converted within the equation. The
        following shows how the equation for solving for this infusion rate should be laid out. (It does not have to be

         laid out in this specific order, but all units of measurement should be included; for example, 1 kg/2.2 lb could
         switch places with 500 mL/800 mg).

    4. Because you are solving for mL/hour, circle mL on top and hour on the bottom, ensuring that those units of
         measure will not be crossed out.

    5. To solve the problem, you need to cross out duplicate units of measure. For this equation you would cross out
         (a) mcg, (b) kg, (c) min, (d) lb, and (e) mg.

    6. This leaves the desired measurement as mL/hour (see Figure 2.20).

  The dimensional analysis method can sometimes be complicated. This video provides additional information on
  performing dimensional analysis dosage calculations.

Body Weight Method
The body weight method allows dosage calculation for individualization. This method is commonly seen with
medications with a narrow therapeutic index, drugs being adjusted due to the individual's ability to metabolize the
drug, and pediatric clients.

To use this method:

1. Convert the client's weight from pounds to kilograms                     .

2. Determine the drug dose for body weight by multiplying them together.

3. Use your preferred dosage calculation method (formula, ratio proportion, or dimensional analysis) to solve for

the dose of the drug to be administered to the client.

Example:
Ordered: Amoxicillin 10 mg per kg orally QID (four times a day)
Available: Amoxicillin 125 mg/5 mL
Client's weight: 110 lb

How many mL should the client receive per dose?

Use the label shown in Figure 2.22 to calculate the number of mL per dose.

    Body Surface Area Method
    The body surface area (BSA) method allows dosage calculation for individualization. This method is commonly seen
    with medications that have a narrow therapeutic index, drugs that are being adjusted due to the individual's ability
    to metabolize the drug, chemotherapeutic agents, pediatric clients, and clients with burns. It is an approximation of
    the total skin area of an individual measured in meters squared (m2). BSA is calculated using the square root
    calculation as determined by the client's height and weight.

    To use this method:

      1. Convert pounds to kilograms.
      2. Calculate BSA. The formula is:

      3. Calculate the dose in mg.
      4. Calculate the dose in mL.

    Example:

    Calculate the dose of ceftriaxone in mL for a client who weighs 37 lb and is 97 cm tall. The dosing required is 2
    mg/m2, and the drug comes in 1 mg/mL.

      1.
      2.
      3.
      4.

    The dose to be administered is 1.34 mL.

    To calculate the dose using dimensional analysis, some of the same steps are used.

      1.
      2.
      3.
    Remember that body surface area is measured in meters squared (m2). Begin the dosage calculation by calculating
    the body surface area of the client, then multiply the size of the client by the ordered dose to obtain the dose
    needed for the client.

         CLINICAL TIP

     Body Surface Area Calculator

      BSA is estimated by using a formula; however, this can be simplified by using a BSA calculator
      (https://openstax.org/r/calcsurface).

    Rounding Rules
    Nurses must know when and how to round medication doses. Caplet and tablet doses can be rounded to the
    nearest half-tablet if they are scored. Some are scored in fourths and can be rounded accordingly. Caplets and
    tablets that are controlled release, extended release, sustained release, or enteric-coated should not be split or
    crushed. Capsules are rounded to the nearest whole number because they cannot be divided. Liquid drugs are
    rounded to the nearest tenth. If the nurse is calculating a liquid medication for drops, then it is to be rounded to the
    nearest whole number because it is not possible to administer a partial drop. These rounding rules guidelines
    (https://openstax.org/r/safemedicate) assist the nurse with rounding medication doses. The National Library of
    Medicine (https://openstax.org/r/ncbinlmnih) provides another resource for rounding as well as performing
    calculations.

    Next, rounding is determined by how many places from the decimal point are appropriate. If a number to the right of

2.4 · Dosage Calculations                                                                                                 83

the decimal point needs to be rounded and it is 4 or less, then it is rounded down. For example, if the nurse
calculated that they were to give 1.243 and they were rounding to the nearest tenth, the number would be rounded
to 1.2. If a number to the right of the decimal point is 5 or greater, then it should be rounded up. For example, if the
nurse calculated that they were to give 1.251 and they were rounding to the nearest tenth, the number would be
rounded to 1.3.

     SAFETY ALERT

 Rounding

  The nurse must always guard against the possibility of an overdose of medication. When in the pediatric setting
  or when working with high-alert medications, rounding rules may change. Many institutions round down in the
  pediatric setting to prevent overdose. Sometimes the numbers after the decimal point are dropped so that 5.642
  mL becomes 5 mL. This is known as rounding off or cutting off. It is imperative that the nurse be familiar with the
  policies of their institution. Most EMRs now have standardized rounding policies to assist the nurse.

CHAPTER OUTLINE
3.1 Legal Considerations
3.2 Drug Errors and Prevention
3.3 Documentation and Informatics

INTRODUCTION The primary focus of this chapter is the quality of care and safety of the client as it relates to the
administration of medications. The learner is introduced to legislative acts on a federal and state level that affect
nursing. The emphasis then moves to client safety and the prevention of medication errors. The core ethical
principles of nursing are discussed, and the learner is also introduced to the American Nurses Association (ANA)
Code of Ethics. The chapter finishes with a discussion of nursing informatics and how it affects drug administration
and error prevention.

3.1 Legal Considerations

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 3.1.1 Discuss federal legislative acts affecting nursing.
    · 3.1.2 Describe the function of state nurse practice acts.

Federal Legislative Acts

Prior to 1906, there were no legal controls over the sale or quality of any drugs. Before this time, rattlesnake oil for
pain and inflammation and other tonics could be sold out of the back of a covered wagon, a general store, or a
doctor's office. There was nothing in place to protect the consumer from fraud or harm. The manufacturers were not
required to list any of the ingredients in their elixirs, pills, or potions. It was not unusual for the medicine sold to
ultimately cause harm rather than provide the cure that was advertised.
90  3 · Ethics, Legal Considerations, and Safety

    The Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 controlled the manufacture, labeling, and sale of drugs. Although the law
    emphasized the importance of accurate labeling, it also prohibited certain ingredients from being used within drugs.
    It also prohibited contaminated or misbranded foods and drugs for either humans or animals from being sold across
    state lines (Petruzzello, 2023). It also established the National Formulary (NF) and the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP) as
    the standards for such products. A brief description of important federal legislation is provided in Table 3.1.

    TABLE 3.1 Summary of Federal Legislation Regarding the Safety of Medications in the United States

    Other important federal legislation impacting health care in the United States include the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health
    (HITECH) Act, and the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

    Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
    The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) was enacted by Congress in 1996. It is a federal
    law that set forth standards to protect sensitive health information from being divulged without the consent or
    knowledge of the client. Its purpose was to:

3.1 · Legal Considerations                                                                                                 91

    · Establish the Privacy Rule
    · Establish the Security Rule for protecting electronic health information
    · Ensure that covered entities report and resolve any breaches in security

This discussion will focus on the Privacy Rule, which protects a client's individually identifiable health information no
matter what form the information is in--oral, written, or transmitted. The Privacy Rule designates this information as
protected health information (PHI) and essentially covers any data by which the individual can be identified (name,
date of birth, Social Security number, address, phone number, etc.) in relation to their health condition, provision of
health care, or payment (past, present, and future) (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2021). It allows
PHI to be shared between health care providers and insurance companies to provide high-quality health care.
Individual practitioners and health care institutions may have civil or criminal penalties levied against them for
violation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Nurses should be alert to situations in which violations might occur, such as
discussions in common areas where one might be overheard, inappropriate use of social media, or deliberate
violations where one intentionally discloses personal information. In cases of deliberately violating the Privacy Rule,
the penalties to the health care worker and the institution can be quite severe.

Each client has the right to confidentiality and to determine who has access to their PHI. Health care providers
should not share confidential information obtained from the client with others without their express authorization.
Once the nurse obtains the client's health information (biographical information, chief complaint, medical and
surgical history, medications and allergies, family history, social history, signs and symptoms of present illness, and
physical assessment), the nurse should ascertain how it is to be treated and who will be given access to it.
Confidentiality should still be observed when obtaining a medication history because some medications will reveal
the treatment of specific diseases; for example, if a client is taking carbidopa/levodopa, they likely have Parkinson's
disease. However, an incorrect assumption could also be made. Aripiprazole (Abilify) is used for the treatment of
psychosis; however, it also treats depression. The nurse should not assume that the client has schizophrenia or
psychosis because they have been prescribed that drug. When reviewing medication information with the client, it is
important to protect the client's privacy by providing a private area for the discussion. The U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services provides more information about how HIPAA affects health care professionals
(https://openstax.org/r/professionalsin).

     TRENDING TODAY

 Social Media

  Social media is a powerful tool, and nurses can use this tool to inform the public about health, wellness, and
  illness. Nurses can also use social media to disseminate information, network, and educate others about
  important topics. However, it is crucial for nurses and others in the health care profession to be very mindful of
  the accuracy of the information they post, to exhibit professional behavior, and to maintain client confidentiality
 at all times, as this article from the HIPAA Journal (https://openstax.org/r/hipaajournalcomj) illustrates.

There are certain conditions under which PHI can be disclosed without the consent of the client. The information
may be given to other providers who are treating the client, as well as insurance companies, but it also can be
released if required by law or a court order for the intent of protecting public health or in cases of abuse or neglect.

     CLINICAL TIP

 HIPAA

  Nurses should take HIPAA concerns very seriously. No PHI should be shared unless it is on a "need-to-know"
  basis. Information should be shared only in secure locations. Be alert to situations where information could be
  overheard unintentionally, such as in elevators or the cafeteria.

Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act
The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act was enacted in 2009 to
improve the efficiency and quality of care for clients through the adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) across
92  3 · Ethics, Legal Considerations, and Safety

    the United States. Prior to the adoption of the EHR, records were handwritten or typed notes by providers, which
    were then stored in paper files in a medical records department. The HITECH Act also had a meaningful use (MU)
    element whose purpose was to provide an incentive for institutions and providers to adopt the EHR. In the
    beginning, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) provided financial incentives to physicians, and
    then physicians proved MU by reporting clinical quality measures for the purpose of improving client outcomes
    (Brooks et al., 2022). CMS had several objectives for MU:

        · Use of the EHR in a meaningful, significant way
        · Advancing clinical processes to improve the quality of health care
        · Improving client outcomes through the use of quality measures

    In 2018, CMS renamed the Meaningful Use program to the Promoting Interoperability Program. This expanded the
    focus to the interoperability of EHRs with the goal of improving client access to health information, health
    information exchange among health care providers, and data collection.

    Approximately 98% of hospitals have adopted some type of EHR, regardless of whether it would be described as
    basic or comprehensive (Apathy et al., 2021). The adoption of EHRs and the use of health information technology
    (HIT) has presented several challenges, including cost, usability, and a lack of interoperability. The Office of the
    National Coordinator for Health Information Technology is a U.S. government organization that has developed
    various strategies to assist with the burden related to HIT and to help agencies, institutions, and clinicians become
    more efficient through the use of technology.

    The addition of the electronic medication administration record is an important component of the EHR, and many
    institutions now use e-prescriber or computerized prescriber order entry (CPOE). This is discussed more in the last
    section of this chapter.

    The Affordable Care Act (ACA)
    President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act (ACA) into law in 2010. This law (sometimes called
    Obamacare) had three primary aims:

        · Make health insurance available and affordable to more Americans
        · Expand the Medicaid program by expanding the federal poverty level
        · Support innovative medical care delivery methods with the objective of lowering health care costs

            (HealthCare.gov, n.d.)

    The ACA prohibited insurance companies from charging excessive amounts for premiums and contained measures
    to ensure that the consumer received value for the cost of their premiums. It raised the age limit to 26 years of age
    for children to continue to be covered by a parent's insurance. It also allowed individuals with preexisting conditions
    to obtain and keep insurance coverage and provided preventive care. Under the ACA, there are medications with
    limited cost-sharing; these drugs are covered with little to no copay. Some of these medications include
    contraceptives, vaccines, aspirin, statins, tobacco cessation products, and breast cancer primary prevention drugs.
    This law was considered controversial when passed and has undergone several changes since 2010; however, many
    Americans consider the ACA positively (Kaiser Family Foundation [KFF], 2023). Although many more Americans are
    now insured, unfortunately, 27.5 million individuals in the United States still do not have insurance coverage (Tolbert
    et al., 2022).

    State Nurse Practice Acts

    All clients have the right to safe, competent nursing expertise. Each state and territory within the United States has
    legislated a nurse practice act (NPA) to create a board of nursing (BON). The focus of a BON is to protect and
    promote the welfare of the public across the state, and it is responsible for implementing and enforcing the NPA. It
    does so by ensuring that each person licensed to practice as a nurse is competent to practice. For an individual to
    become licensed, they must meet the minimum competencies set forth by each board. The NPA is a series of state
    statutes that contains the laws related to prospective nurses and the nurses' education, licensure, practice, and
    grounds for disciplinary actions.

    Each BON sets the educational standards for all nursing programs across the state, which prepares individuals to
    become licensed registered nurses. This includes prelicensure programs as well as advanced practice. All applicants

3.1 · Legal Considerations                                                                                                93

must complete specific educational requirements, pass a national licensing exam (the National Council Licensure
Examination [NCLEX]), and obtain clearance through a background check that looks for any criminal conviction that
might make the applicant unfit for licensure. Criminal conviction may or may not disqualify an individual from being
licensed as a nurse; most states decide on a case-by-case basis, depending on the crime. Some states require proof
of continuing competency for licensure renewal. This might be in the form of a certain number of hours of continuing
education in the area of the nurse's practice or a national nursing certification. There are many board-recognized
credentialing agencies and providers.

 State Boards of Nursing

  As mentioned above, each state and territory within the United States has legislated a nurse practice act to
  create a board of nursing or like entity. Find the board of nursing (https://openstax.org/r/rntravelwebco) for the
  state where you hope to practice after completing nursing training. Click on the individual state board of nursing
  site to familiarize yourself with the information available. Compare and contrast the different sites.

Most BONs were established about 100 years ago and have evolved over time. Many BONs have expanded their
scope and now provide remediation for licensed nurses who have had some type of practice issue. The BON
monitors compliance with the NPA and state laws. It is responsible for taking action against nurses who are unsafe
or have engaged in professional misconduct.

State BONs often participate in multistate licensure compacts and may even act as a forum for individuals to report
concerns about specific nursing services they have received. The states and territories that participate in these
nurse licensure compacts allow a nurse to practice under a single license; for example, an individual holding a
multistate license in Oklahoma is able to practice in Texas. Renewal and disciplinary actions are the responsibility of
the state issuing the license (Oklahoma, in this case); however, the nurse is responsible for knowing and following
the laws of the state in which they are practicing (Texas, in this example).

NPAs typically allow nursing students to practice nursing while under the auspices of an accredited nursing
education program and under the supervision of qualified nursing faculty. Student nurses do not practice on a
faculty member's license. Each nursing student is responsible for answering for any action they have taken and are
held accountable to the same standards as a licensed nurse.

Strategies for Students in the Practice Setting
The nurse's primary responsibility is safe, effective care of the client. Understanding the expectations of faculty, the
institution, and the BON is important for the nursing student. Some common guidelines for clinical practice that may
be helpful to the student include:

    · Providing safe, effective nursing care.
    · Ensuring understanding of the educational program's and facility's policies before accepting any assignment.
    · Demonstrating knowledge of the client's disease process, medications, nursing interventions, and plan of

        care.
    · Informing the faculty when unprepared for an assignment.
    · Seeking assistance if not prepared for a procedure (Callahan, 2023).
    · Never practicing outside their scope of practice.
    · Never going to a clinical site while impaired (this includes sleep deprivation).
    · Being accountable for learning.
    · Recognizing the limitations of their knowledge.

    3.2 Drug Errors and Prevention

    LEARNING OUTCOMES
    By the end of this section, you should be able to:

        · 3.2.1 Define core ethical principles as they relate to drug administration.
        · 3.2.2 Discuss ANA Code of Ethics principles related to safe drug administration.
        · 3.2.3 Describe the benefit-risk ratio.
        · 3.2.4 Identify steps to prevent medication errors.

    Drug errors are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. A medication error is "an error (of
    commission or omission) at any step along the pathway that begins when a clinician prescribes a medication and
    ends when the patient actually takes the drug" (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ], 2019b, para.
    1). This section addresses a nurse's response to medication errors, the role of prevention, and the ethics of dealing
    with an error once it happens.

    Core Ethical Principles

    According to Gallup's annual poll (Brenan, 2023), the American public ranked nurses number 1 (79%) as the most
    honest and ethical profession, above physicians (62%), high school teachers (53%), and pharmacists (58%). Ethics
    refers to the set of moral principles that direct how a person behaves. The foundations for an individual's ethical
    standards are one's values, or the personal beliefs someone has about what is right or wrong.

    Integrity means doing the right thing--always--even when no one is looking. It means being truthful and having
    honor or strong moral principles. There are many components to having integrity in the life of a nurse. The nurse
    should check all actions, decisions, and planning ahead of time to ensure the "rightness" of an action or decision.
    Being honest and owning up to a medication error is not only "right" but also may save the life of the client if an
    intervention can prevent a bad outcome. One of the most important things an individual can say is, "I made a
    mistake, and this is what happened. What can we do to solve this problem?" The sooner a problem is recognized
    and brought to the attention of the charge nurse and provider, the more quickly a solution can be found.

    Another crucial element to having integrity is owning the responsibilities that come with the job and being
    accountable for one's job performance. The nurse should take a moment to reflect on the day. Ethical care of the
    client is more than managing challenging decisions; it is about completing the mundane, day-to-day tasks to the
    best of one's abilities. Were the client and family truly cared for? Was the client's pain adequately controlled? Was
    teaching performed? Was the client adequately assessed prior to being given a drug? Was the nurse an advocate for
    the client? Was HIPAA violated in the elevator (or anywhere else)? Did the nurse demonstrate respect for the client?
    It is not unusual for ethical dilemmas to occur in the daily practice of nursing. Remembering the ethical principles of
    autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, justice, veracity (truth), and confidentiality will provide a framework for the
    nurse as these conflicts arise.

    Autonomy
    Autonomy in medicine essentially means having the right to make one's own health care decisions, being
    independent, and having control over oneself. In the past, Western medicine operated under a paternalistic style of
    authority with a "doctor always knows best" philosophy. The physician guided the client's care, sometimes with
    little input from the client or family. In 1979, Beauchamp and Childress (2013) introduced the idea of autonomy as it
    related to biomedical ethics and identified that a client should be able to make uncoerced and informed decisions
    about their health.

    A crucial piece of autonomy is having sufficient information to make a sound choice. Informed consent can assist
    the client in making appropriate choices for their body and deciding whether to pursue or decline specific medical
    treatments recommended by their provider. According to Varkey (2021, p. 19), "the requirements of an informed
    consent for a medical or surgical procedure, or for research, are that the client or subject (i) must be competent to
    understand and decide, (ii) receives a full disclosure, (iii) comprehends the disclosure, (iv) acts voluntarily, and (v)
    consents to the proposed action." The consent itself simply means that the client has the right to be told about a
    treatment or research in language that is easily understood and specifically told why it needs to be done, the risks or
    benefits, and alternative treatments. The client then has the right to refuse or allow the proposed treatment. The
    provider should not attempt to persuade or coerce the client to accept the treatment. The nurse is also obligated to

3.2 · Drug Errors and Prevention                                                                                                              95

respect a client's opportunity to choose or decline a treatment. Not only does a client have the right to select the
appropriate treatment, but the nurse must respect that choice once the decision is made (Walker, 2022).

Within the setting of medication administration, autonomy means clients have the right to refuse a drug that has
been ordered for them. Although the nurse may perceive that the drug is good and will be beneficial to the client,
the client may have a different viewpoint. That must be respected once the client is informed about the benefits and
risks of a drug. This empowers the client to participate in their care, with the aim of better adherence to the overall
plan of care.

Today, the shift is toward client-centered care. This empowers the client to be self-directed and still allows for a
relationship with health care providers that encourages dialogue and partnership. This is particularly important for
those with chronic diseases. Being part of a partnership and having a sense of empowerment increases safety,
improves outcomes, and decreases costs (Lian et al., 2018). Other benefits are increased self-confidence on the
part of the client and improved adherence to the medical regimen. An example of a model of client-centered care
can be seen in Figure 3.2.

An essential component of choice or exercising autonomy is competence on the client's part. The client must have
the ability to act autonomously. An individual who is not competent (someone who has been determined to be
incompetent) may not be able to make a decision in their best interests because they cannot understand their own
situation or the consequence of their decision. In this case, having a surrogate to make decisions would be in the
client's best interests.

FIGURE 3.2 This is an example of a client-centered model of interprofessional care. All professions interact with each other and the client,
but the client is at the center of the plan of care. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

Beneficence
Beneficence is a principle that requires nurses to "do good" to actively promote their clients' health and well-being.
They also must prevent and remove harmful situations that might affect their client. Beneficence implies an ethical
obligation to abstain from injuring the client in any way, whether physically, psychologically, or morally. It involves
mindfulness of the client's entire situation and needs.

Nonmaleficence
The principle of beneficence extends to nonmaleficence, which requires that nurses do no harm to the client and do
96  3 · Ethics, Legal Considerations, and Safety

    all they can to safeguard a client from harm. Obviously, intentional harm goes against the principles of beneficence
    and nonmaleficence; however, many acts performed by the nurse have the potential to cause harm unintentionally.
    For example, not all clients experience adverse effects of medications, but the potential is always there. A nurse
    could administer a medication hoping to make the client feel better, but an adverse effect may do the opposite and
    cause harm. An example of this might be a nurse who administers an opioid for a client's pain and then reevaluates
    the client 30 minutes later and observes that the client has developed respiratory depression.

    When administering drugs to clients, the nurse must recognize that although the drugs are intended for good, all
    medications carry some risk to the client. Before any drug is ordered by the provider, the benefit of the drug versus
    the risk of the drug is considered. Before any drug is administered to a client, the benefit of the drug versus the risk
    of the drug is again weighed. The client should be fully informed of the benefits as well as the risks of any
    medication.

    Justice
    Justice is the principle relating to clients' fair and equitable treatment (Varkey, 2021). Each individual should be
    treated appropriately and equally. They should be allowed access to the same treatment and health care resources
    without prejudice or social discrimination. Even time can be a limited resource as it relates to visits with a provider
    because for more complex cases, more time might be necessary; however, that may shorten the time allotted to
    another client. The distribution of resources can be difficult to balance, especially when resources are limited (as in
    the case of organ transplantation) or in the case of uninsured clients. Justice is denied if an expensive medication
    would cure a client of their disease but a less expensive treatment was recommended because it benefits the
    provider in some way. Another example would be in the case of expensive drugs going only to those who have
    insurance or financial resources.

    Veracity (Truth-Telling)
    Veracity is important to building trust in the provider-client relationship (Varkey, 2021). The client should be able to
    ask the provider about their diagnosis, prognosis, and potential treatment. Refusing to divulge the truth to clients
    with a terminal diagnosis means that they are unable to finish important life tasks, say goodbye to loved ones, put
    financial affairs in order, or put their spiritual life in order (Fallowfield et al., 2002). When providers are not honest
    with clients, it may cause fear, confusion, or anxiety, especially in cases where the provider discloses the truth to the
    family but not the client.

    ANA Code of Ethics

    Obtaining a registered nurse (RN) license and entering the profession of nursing requires that nurse to meet the
    standards set out by the profession and made explicit by the American Nurses Association (ANA). Ethics are an
    integral component of the profession of nursing--the very bedrock of the profession. The purpose of the ANA Code
    of Ethics is to make clear the key goals, values, and responsibilities of the profession of nursing (ANA, 2015). The
    nine provisions of the ANA Code of Ethics are set forth in Table 3.2.

TABLE 3.2 ANA Code of Ethics for Nurses (source: https://www.nursingworld.org/practice-policy/nursing-excellence/ethics/code-of-
ethics-for-nurses/)

When considering the aspects of drug administration and the ANA Code of Ethics, it is apparent that although the
focus is on the goals and values of the nursing profession, the client is central to the process. This is tightly bound to
the core ethical principles discussed in the previous section and is also tied closely to the client's safety, dignity, and
well-being. The nurse should establish a caring relationship with the client built on trust and respect. This
relationship should factor in elements such as culture, religious or spiritual beliefs, values, support systems, and
sexual orientation or gender expression when planning the care of the client (ANA Code of Ethics, Provision 1.2,
2015). This provision goes on to say that the nurse should respect the client's decisions. Clients have the right to
"accept, refuse, or terminate treatment without deceit, undue influence, duress, coercion, or prejudice, and to be
given necessary support throughout the decision-making and treatment process" (ANA Code of Ethics, Provision
1.4, 2015). Nurses can educate the client and family without placing pressure on the client to accept the treatment
or medication. Once the client has been given accurate and complete information about their condition and
treatment options, they have the right to self-determination.

Benefit-Risk Ratio

Each provider prescribing, dispensing, or administering medications carefully assesses the benefits of a drug and its
associated risks. Drugs are beneficial in many ways--they prevent, cure, and alleviate symptoms of disease--but
drugs also carry risks associated with adverse drug reactions (ADRs). These reactions may be mild (e.g., headache,
constipation, or nausea) or life-threatening (e.g., anaphylaxis, nephrotoxicity, or hepatic failure). The benefit-risk
assessment is the analysis of the benefits and risks associated with a drug (Kürzinger et al., 2020). This assessment
98  3 · Ethics, Legal Considerations, and Safety

    is completed for each drug during research and continues throughout the lifetime of the drug. The health care
    provider also performs a benefit-risk assessment for each client prescribed a drug.

    Risk can be defined as the probability of harm occurring as a result of an action--in this case, the administration of a
    drug. Benefit applies to the potential of a drug to treat the disease, ease suffering, or improve the quality of life. For
    example, the nurse administering a diuretic to a client with heart failure recognizes the benefit of the drug is to
    reduce the fluid that has accumulated in the lungs and improve the symptoms of shortness of breath; however, the
    risk may include loss of potassium or decrease in blood pressure (adverse effects). The risk is not the same for every
    client. In a client with an elevated potassium level and a normal or high blood pressure, the risk of the diuretic is
    minimal; however, if the client already has a low potassium level and low blood pressure, the risk will be higher. The
    provider makes a benefit-risk assessment based on the drug's probable benefits versus its potential risks. After
    drug therapy begins, the client is monitored to complete an ongoing evaluation of the benefit-risk balance. Ideally,
    the drug therapy continues as long as it is thought that the benefits outweigh the risks.

    Drug Administration and Safety

    Medication safety remains one of the most crucial challenges in institutions around the globe. There are many steps
    and many individuals involved in the process of a drug reaching the client. Most institutions have several processes
    in place to prevent a drug error from occurring, but not all processes are perfect, and no person is perfect. Many
    institutions have made the prevention of medication errors their number one priority, but errors continue to occur.
    The effects of a drug error are devastating and often long-lasting to the client, the client's family and friends, and the
    individual who made the error.

    A sentinel event is defined by The Joint Commission (TJC) (n.d.-b) as "a patient safety event that results in death,
    permanent harm, or severe temporary harm." The harm may be physical or psychological in nature and is usually
    unexpected. These are events that should be reported immediately so that an investigation (called a root cause
    analysis) can be initiated without delay. Examples of the most common sentinel events are wrong-site surgeries,
    invasive procedures on the wrong clients, or death related to something other than the client's original illness.
    Administering medications to the wrong client that results in death or severe injury is another example of a sentinel
    event. An institution accredited by TJC must have policies in place to investigate and respond to sentinel events. The
    root cause analysis is helpful in identifying the underlying factors related to the harmful event and developing a plan
    to prevent another event. This process focuses primarily on system problems rather than individuals in an effort to
    improve the quality of care and safety of clients.

    Adverse Drug Reactions
    The World Health Organization (n.d., p. 1) defines an adverse drug reaction (ADR) as "harmful, unintended reactions
    to medicines that occur at doses normally used for treatment." Coleman and Pontefract (2016, p. 481) define an
    ADR as "unintended, harmful events attributed to the use of medicines." Side effects, a type of ADR, are considered
    to be secondary drug effects produced at therapeutic doses. An example of this might be sedation related to the use
    of an antihistamine or diarrhea related to the use of a stool softener. An allergic reaction is an immune response
    due to sensitivity to a specific drug. A mild allergic reaction can cause itching and rash, but anaphylaxis is a severe,
    life-threatening reaction causing dangerous bronchospasm and hypotension. These drug reactions affect the safety
    of the client but are not due to a medication error on the part of a health care provider.

         TRENDING TODAY

     Reporting Adverse Drug Reactions

      It is important for the nurse to report adverse drug reactions. The U.S. Food and Drug administration (FDA) has a
      reporting mechanism in place through a portal called MedWatch for individuals (health care providers or
      consumers) to voluntarily report any adverse drug event. Each report is reviewed, and if a potential safety
      concern is identified, the FDA may take action--up to removing the drug from the market. Listen to this podcast
      from the FDA (https://openstax.org/r/newseventshuman) for more information about MedWatch.

    Medication Errors
    According to the National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention (2023), a medication

error is defined as "any preventable event that may cause or lead to inappropriate medication use or patient harm
while the medication is in the control of the health care professional, patient, or consumer." In 1999, a landmark
report by the Institute of Medicine, To Err Is Human, increased awareness of medical errors in the United States.
This report stated that as many as 98,000 people die in hospitals yearly due to medical errors. The following year
this was validated with the clarification that medication errors in health care facilities are the most common type of
these errors. This article describes 25 common medication errors in nursing and prevention recommendations
(https://openstax.org/r/medicationerr).

The FDA receives more than 100,000 reports of drug errors each year, but more than 7 million clients in the United
States are impacted by medication errors annually (da Silva & Krishnamurthy, 2016). Adverse drug events account
for almost 700,000 emergency department visits each year (AHRQ, 2019b). The cost of caring for individuals whom
a drug error has harmed exceeds $40 billion annually (Tariq et al, 2023). The financial and human costs of these
errors are staggering.

An adverse drug event (ADE) is client harm resulting from exposure to a drug. This is injury from a medication, a
missed medication, or an inappropriately dosed medication. It may or may not result from an error or poor-quality
care. Medication errors that do not cause harm to a client (perhaps due to luck or the drug not reaching the client)
are considered to be potential ADEs; in contrast, if harm to the client occurs, it is considered a preventable ADE. A
drug can be prescribed, dispensed, and administered correctly, but the client may still experience an ADE. This is
considered an adverse drug reaction (discussed in the previous section). This is an expected adverse outcome due
to the drug's pharmacological action and is not always preventable (Tariq et al., 2023). Medication errors, however,
are preventable.

If a physician orders an incorrect dose of a medication but the pharmacist catches the mistake before dispensing it,
it is considered a medication error. If the physician orders the correct medication and dose but the pharmacist
dispenses the wrong dose, it is a medication error. Errors may be related to any of the following (and this may not be
an exhaustive list) (Tariq et al., 2023):

    · Deteriorated drug
          Product expired
          Product stored incorrectly

    · Error in prescribing
    · Extra dose
    · Insufficient monitoring
    · Known allergen
    · Known contraindication
    · Omission of drug
    · Wrong client
    · Wrong dose
    · Wrong diluent
    · Wrong drug
    · Wrong infusion rate
    · Wrong preparation
    · Wrong route
    · Wrong strength or concentration
    · Wrong time
    · Wrong technique

          Crushing an extended-release tablet
          Administering a subcutaneous medication using an intramuscular technique

According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (MacDowell et al., 2021), medication administration is
a very complex process characterized by the involvement of many health care team members, not just the nurse.
Many institutions are working on ways to improve technology and workflow to make the process safer for the client.
The manufacturer, packager, provider, pharmacist, technician, and nurse are all part of the process--and each is in a
position to make an error. There are many different ways for an error to occur, but in the clinical setting, the nurse is
100  3 · Ethics, Legal Considerations, and Safety

     the final person in the chain able to prevent an error from occurring.

     Some errors harm the client directly, but others may harm the client indirectly. Administering the wrong drug or
     doubling the dose of a medication may harm the client directly, whereas giving too little medication may cause a
     client to be undertreated and not take care of the disease, thereby causing harm indirectly. The most common types
     of lethal medication errors include giving an overdose of a medication, giving the wrong medication, and giving the
     drug by the incorrect route. Failure to monitor kidney or liver function can also impact the client's safety.

     Causes of Medication Errors
     Medication errors most commonly occur when the medication is being ordered or prescribed. It is estimated that as
     many as 50% of drug errors occur when the medication is ordered, and nurses and pharmacists identify 30%-70%
     of those errors (Tariq et al., 2023). Almost 75% of drug errors have been attributed to distraction (Tariq et al., 2023).
     The provider may be distracted by phone calls, speaking to family members, or other situations requiring their
     attention. The same may be true for the pharmacist who dispenses the drug or the nurse who administers it.

     Some causes of medication errors can be related to human factors, communication errors, confusion over
     packaging, and confusion about medication names (Tariq et al., 2023). Human factors might include an incorrect
     drug calculation, a transcription error, a knowledge deficit, or a performance deficit, such as an incorrect drug
     administration technique. Communication errors may include illegible handwriting that causes an incorrect
     interpretation of an order, or misunderstood verbal or telephone orders. However, although human error may cause
     a medication error, the underlying issue may be the system itself. The system may be flawed and/or there may not
     be an adequate process in place to find mistakes (Tariq et al., 2023).

     Prevention of Medication Errors
     To prevent some of the previously described communication errors, many institutions have order read-back policies
     for verbal or telephone orders. The nurse or pharmacist first transcribes the order and then reads it back to the
     physician. Many institutions have policies recommending that if a written order is illegible, the pharmacist or nurse
     must call the provider to clarify rather than guess what the provider intended. Computerized order entry has
     decreased the incidence of illegible orders; however, there is still the chance that an incorrect dosage or route may
     be entered. Errors from the confusion of medication names occur because many drugs have names that sound alike
     or look alike, such as Celebrex, Cerebyx, and Celexa or dopamine and dobutamine. (See the List of Confused Drug
     Names (https://openstax.org/r/recommendations) from the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) for more
     information.)

     In the past, an individual was often blamed when medication errors occurred. Many errors were thought to be the
     result of procedural violations, negligence, or carelessness. As a result, individuals may have received disciplinary
     action (even firing), loss of license, or threat of a lawsuit. Institutions are slowly shifting their culture from "naming,
     blaming, and shaming" to "how can we improve the system to prevent errors." When shaming and blaming occur, it
     reduces the willingness of some individuals to come forward and acknowledge their mistakes. This may harm the
     client because the error is unreported, but it may also lead to another person making the same error if the fault is in
     the system. There has been a gradual move to a "just culture," which refers to a system of shared accountability.
     The organization may not have provided adequate training or had inadequate policies and procedures in place, or
     poorly designed units. In a just culture, the organization is accountable for the system or process it has designed as
     well as behaviors. Ideally, organizations will move away from policies that require punishment for errors and focus
     on reinforcing principles that decrease "at-risk" or reckless behaviors.

     James Reason (2000) developed the Swiss cheese model (see Figure 3.3), which drew attention to the occurrence
     of client harm as a result of failures in the health care system itself. Each barrier to client harm has a weakness (or
     hole); thus, Reason likened this to Swiss cheese. When all of the holes are aligned, the hazard (in this case, a
     medication error) reaches the client, and harm will occur. Figure 3.3 depicts an example of the Swiss cheese model
     using a prescribed medication moving through the layers of holes until the client is harmed. This model could be
     applied to any harm related to client care, not just errors in medication administration. This model focuses on the
     health care system rather than the individual in the occurrence of medical errors. Improving the safety of the client
     must begin with developing a culture of safety within the institution. The emphasis should be on working together as
     a team, collaborating with a focus on communication and client safety.

Many institutions have begun the process of developing strategies to prevent or reduce the number of medication
errors (https://openstax.org/r/psnet.ahrqgov). Some strategies include (Tariq et al., 2023):

    · Replacing handwritten orders with computerized order entry
    · Rounding with the physician (pharmacist/nurse)
    · Double-checking the dose of all high-alert medications with another provider
    · Double-checking drug calculations
    · Speaking with the pharmacist or looking the drug up in a resource if unsure about a medication
    · Remembering that any drug has the potential for adverse effects
    · Monitoring kidney and liver function
    · Knowing high-risk medications
    · Knowing the indication of a prescribed drug (if not known, then asking the provider)
    · Order read-back and verification of verbal or telephone orders
    · No use of abbreviations
    · Providing clear, explicit instructions for each medication

Other potential strategies include:

    · Bar code systems
    · Instituting medication reconciliation at any transition in care

Some medications have an increased likelihood of causing harm to the client if administered incorrectly, such as
potent blood thinners like heparin or insulin, which may cause a bleeding event or lethal drop in blood sugar,
respectively. The ISMP has classified these drugs as "high-alert" medications (https://openstax.org/r/ismporg).
These are drugs that should have two providers verify the dose to be administered, and both nurses must document
on the medication administration record (MAR) when these medications are given.

The ISMP has several strategies for the prevention of medication errors. Improving access to information about
drugs is helpful to any provider. This may take the form of drug books or guides on the unit or access to relevant
102  3 · Ethics, Legal Considerations, and Safety

     electronic resources. Another prevention strategy is limiting access to high-alert medications. Some high-alert
     medications, including neuromuscular blockers, are not needed on each hospital unit, so removing access to them
     on those units may help avoid dangerous drug errors. The more standardized the systems for ordering, storing,
     preparing, or administering medications, the less likely an error will occur. The electronic system has automated
     alerts to prevent errors (e.g., pop-up alerts to prevent administering a medication that a client is allergic to). "The
     responsibility for accurate medication administration does not lie with a single individual. Rather, it lies with multiple
     individuals, including organizational leaders, who are responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance
     of reliable systems to support safe medication use for all practitioners" (ISMP, 2023).

     Quality and Safety Education for Nurses (QSEN) Competencies

     As mentioned earlier, in 1999 the Institute of Medicine published its report, To Err Is Human, regarding the number
     of errors impacting clients within the health care system. Health care systems are incredibly complex, and that very
     complexity lends itself to error. In response to these concerns, the American Association of Colleges of Nursing
     (AACN) and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation developed the Quality and Safety Education for Nurses (QSEN)
     initiative. The primary focus of QSEN (https://openstax.org/r/qsenorgco) is to develop a culture of safety by
     maximizing system effectiveness and individual performance (Barnsteiner & AACN, n.d.). To address this, QSEN, in
     alignment with AACN, created several learning modules or competencies focusing on quality and patient (or client)
     safety. AACN/QSEN now incorporates the AACN Essentials. The modules aim to educate nurses and nursing
     students to minimize the risk of harm to clients and providers. This is done by showing learners how to examine
     system effectiveness and individual performance (Barnsteiner & AACN, n.d.). These competencies include (AACN,
     n.d.):

         · Patient-centered (client-centered) care
         · Teamwork and collaboration
         · Evidence-based practice (EBP)
         · Quality improvement (QI)
         · Safety
         · Informatics

     Some common errors in health care include incorrect medication administration, wrong site surgeries, diagnostic
     inaccuracies, equipment failures, and system failures, to name a few (Barnsteiner & AACN, n.d.). Errors that are a
     result of system failures and system design are called latent errors; in contrast, active errors are errors that are
     made by individual clinicians (Rodziewicz et al., 2023). These errors may occur from unintentional or intentional
     risk-taking behaviors. Unintentional "at-risk" behaviors are usually not perceived as risky, and the individual usually
     believes that they are making a safe choice. This could be a situation in which the nurse has two clients whose
     conditions suddenly deteriorated at the same time that an admission came on to the unit and an error occurred, or
     an experienced nurse who programs an IV pump outside of the pump drug library to save time (Barnsteiner & AACN,
     n.d.; ISMP, 2020). An intentional risk-taking behavior could be a nurse who purposely chose not to identify a client
     prior to giving medication. They are knowledgeable about the institutional process but choose not to practice it.
     When attempting to prevent errors, it is important to address the cause of the errors rather than use blanket
     strategies that may or may not be effective.

     The AACN states that it is important to have a culture of safety to counter the fact that all caregivers are human.
     Some of the elements of a culture that promotes safety are shared values and goals, collaboration, and openness
     and transparency regarding errors. Client involvement is crucial in this process so that they question a provider
     when they do not wash their hands, observe any unsafe behavior, or question a medication.

     The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ, 2019a) asks for organizations to commit resources to

address safety concerns. The AHRQ encourages institutions to set up blame-free environments for individuals so
they are able to report errors or near-misses without fear of punishment. A blame-free environment allows the
client to obtain quality care quickly in order to minimize harm. (For more information, see the AHRQ website
(https://openstax.org/r/programsind).)

  SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

  Safety

  QSEN strategies for promoting a culture of safety include:

      · User-centered design, such as wearing a vest that identifies the nurse when administering medications, so
          as to prevent interruptions

      · Attending to work safety--it is important to realize there are limits to the number of hours an individual can
          work and be safe

      · Avoiding relying entirely on vigilance
      · Use of checklists
      · Training health care professionals to function together as a team
      · Improving access to accurate, timely information
      · Involving clients in their care
      · Anticipating the unexpected
      · Designing and having a plan for recovery from an error

  (Source: Barnsteiner & AACN, n.d.)

The nurse should encourage clients to become active participants in their care. Each and every health care
professional needs to make safety one of their primary responsibilities (Barnsteiner & AACN, n.d.).

Documentation
The client record is one of the primary means of communication between health care providers. Having current,
effective communication within the health record (either the EHR or the paper record) is key to the client's safety
and quality of care. Communication between disciplines may occur verbally through physician rounds or handoffs
during shift report. It also may occur through provider orders or notes within a paper chart or EHR. When members
of the health care team make an entry into the record, it is known as charting or documentation. Documentation
should be accurate and timely, occurring near the time the provider made an observation or completed an
intervention, such as medication administration. That said, it is important to document at the time or slightly after
rather than before.

It is crucial that all providers remember that the chart is a legal document that provides proof of the client's status
and the care that was delivered. Although components of documentation are similar between facilities, most
institutions have their own policies about who can document within the record, how it is done, and when it should be
completed. The nurse should adhere to these standards and remember that these records should be kept
confidential.

One area in which the health care team should be alert to potential errors is any transition of care for the client. A
transition of care includes the client's admission to the hospital, transfer to another unit, and discharge home.
Transitions of care are critical times that increase a client's risk for medication errors. Often numerous changes in
medications occur when a client is admitted to the hospital setting. Medication reconciliation should be completed
at any transition of care or outpatient visit, especially when more than one provider is orchestrating the care of the
client. Medication reconciliation should occur whether a paper or an electronic record is used.

Reconciling medications is one of the Joint Commission's National Patient Safety Goals for documentation and is
considered evidence-based practice in improving client safety (Joint Commission, 2023). The nurse compares the
list of medications the client is taking or is supposed to be taking with the list of newly ordered medications. Once
this is completed, the nurse identifies discrepancies between the two lists, clarifies any differences, and attempts to
resolve any problems between the two by communicating with the client or family, the provider, and the pharmacist.
Potential problems that may be identified include (1) the omission of a drug, (2) discrepancies between frequency or
104  3 · Ethics, Legal Considerations, and Safety

     dosing, (3) duplicate drugs (this may happen when one provider orders a generic form of the drug and another
     provider orders by brand name), (4) contraindications, or (5) incorrect drugs. The nurse should instruct each client
     to carry a list of current medications with the dosage and frequency at all times. Ensuring that the client
     understands the changes to their medications is key to adherence to the medical regimen and the client's health.
     The use of technology such as the EHR can provide solutions to the challenges of managing medications during
     transition points (Vaghasiya et al., 2023).

     Although 98% of all facilities have some form of EHR, some facilities still rely on the paper record (Apathy et al.,
     2021). To complete medication reconciliation in a paper record, the medication administration record (MAR) is
     compared to the physician's orders for accuracy once each shift. The nurse then signs off that there are no
     discrepancies between the ordered or discontinued medications and the MAR. As mentioned previously, if any
     discrepancies are found, the nurse takes the appropriate steps to resolve them.

     Another key element in charting is client teaching. Each discipline should document any teaching that is performed,
     including when it occurred and who did the teaching. It should also include the topics discussed and the response
     to the education. Was the client receptive? Did the nurse evaluate the client's learning, and how was this done?
     Could the client demonstrate knowledge or "teach back" the information to the nurse? Once teaching is
     documented, it is also important to make recommendations about how others can reinforce the already
     accomplished teaching.

     The Joint Commission "Do Not Use" Abbreviations

     The Joint Commission (TJC) was founded in 1951, and its aim is to improve health care for the public through
     evaluating and accrediting health care institutions across the United States. It surveys institutions every three years
     to ensure they meet standards of compliance. All surveys are unannounced and are conducted by experts in the
     health care field, such as physicians, nurses, and hospital administrators. The primary foci of TJC are safety and
     quality of care. TJC has more than 250 standards that it expects institutions and health care workers to address.
     Some of these standards focus on medication management and the prevention of medication errors. In an effort to
     eliminate the use of potentially dangerous abbreviations and acronyms, TJC published an official "Do Not Use" list of
     abbreviations as part of its 2004 National Patient Safety Goals.

     The following is a list of abbreviations that should never be used (Joint Commission, n.d.-a):

         · U, u: Use "unit."
         · IU: Use "International Unit."
         · Q.D., QD, q.d., qd: Use "daily."
         · Q.O.D., QOD, q.o.d., qod: Use "every other day."
         · MS: Use "morphine sulfate."
         · MSO4: Use "morphine sulfate."
         · MgSO4: Use "magnesium sulfate."
         · Always use leading zeros! Naked decimals (.4 mg or .1 mg) may result in medication errors because they can

             be interpreted as 4 or 1. Instead, write 0.4 mg or 0.1 mg.
         · Trailing zeros (e.g., 3.0 g, 50.0 mg): Missed decimals result in medication errors. Instead, write 3 g or 50 mg.

     There are important exceptions to the use of trailing zeros: It is acceptable to use a trailing zero in the case of
     reporting laboratory values, when measuring lesions, when denoting the size of catheters and tubes, or in imaging
     studies. However, trailing zeros should never be used when writing medication orders or documenting dosages
     (Joint Commission, n.d.-a).

     The Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) is a nonprofit organization whose goal is to educate health care
     providers and consumers about safe medication practices. The nurse should refer to the ISMP for a more complete
     list of error-prone abbreviations (https://openstax.org/r/sitesdefaultfil), symbols, and dose designations.

     Nursing Informatics

     Understanding the tools and developing the knowledge necessary to function are crucial to success in the current
     digital age. A growing specialty within nursing that integrates health information technology (HIT) and supports this
     understanding is nursing informatics. The American Nurses Association (ANA, 2022, p. 3) defines nursing

     Access for free at openstax.org
3.3 · Documentation and Informatics                                                                                     105

informatics (NI) as "the specialty that transforms data into needed information and leverages technologies to
improve health and health care equity, safety, quality, and outcomes."

Modern technology is now an essential component of health care. A health information system integrates data
collection, processing, and reporting through information technology in order to improve system effectiveness and
efficiency (Torab-Miandoab et al., 2023). Essentially, it transforms information from a paper-based system into an
electronic health record (Tian et al., 2019). Health information technology (HIT) ideally allows for better
coordination of care and improved organization of information, timeliness, and accuracy (Torab-Miandoab et al.,
2023). Torab-Miandoab and colleagues (2023) go on to say that other advantages of HIT are decreased medical
errors, decreased cost, ease of information exchange, and ease of access for providers.

The amount of information the nurse and other health care professionals collect and process at the bedside is
extensive. Once a client is assessed and the information is collected, it goes into the EHR database. That information
will evolve throughout the hospital stay and beyond. The unique aspect of informatics as it relates to nursing, and
health care in general, is the need to use the principles of computer and information science combined with those of
nursing science. Communication is also a part of this process--communication between disciplines, institutions,
clients, and insurance companies as well as between devices. For example, many devices within an institution
communicate with the EHR, including lab applications, glucose monitors, pulse oximeters, and even devices that
track clients throughout the hospital.

Electronic Health Record
Most institutions rely on the electronic health record (EHR) as each client's primary health information source.
Technology now allows this record to serve as the vehicle for communication between each health care team
member and even across institutions. According to Campanella et al. (2016, p. 1), "an EHR may also include a
decision support system (DSS) that provides up-to-date medical knowledge, reminders or other actions that aid
health professionals in decision making." The client's demographics, status, assessments, the type of care provided,
and progress throughout the stay are provided through the EHR. The nurse provides documentation for the
assessments completed, nursing interventions, teaching, and observations made throughout their shift. The
electronic medication administration record (eMAR) is a part of the EHR and serves as the official documentation for
the medication administered or withheld by the nurse. The EHR is a legal document and must be kept current as
events occur during the stay. Documentation of medications administered or withheld should also be done in real
time to protect client safety. After discharge, the record is kept within the institution and can be accessed during
subsequent admissions or for insurance purposes, according to institutional policy. Each institution has its own
unique EHR, though they have similarities.

  (Sources: Campanella et al., 2016; HealthIT.gov, 2019)

Most hospitals and health care institutions across the country have adopted the use of EHRs, and many providers
106  3 · Ethics, Legal Considerations, and Safety

     now have a working knowledge of the technology needed to operate those systems. Some important features
     usually contained in the EHR are described in the following sections.

     Computerized Prescriber Order Entry (CPOE)
     An important aspect of the EHR is e-prescribing, also known as computerized prescriber order entry (CPOE). This
     allows the provider to prescribe medications through electronic means to a nurse and pharmacist on the unit or to a
     pharmacy miles away from the provider. The advantages of CPOE are the ability to verify other medications the
     client is taking, screening for possible drug-drug interactions, and hard stops in the system that prevent the
     medication from being ordered when contraindicated. E-prescribing also allows the provider to improve the safety
     of pain management when ordering a controlled substance because it reduces the opportunity for forgery, and it is
     easier to identify when multiple providers order the same controlled drug (Mandeville et al., 2020). Despite the
     CPOE often reducing some types of errors, it may enable other forms of errors. For example, CPOE has been linked
     to many HIT errors that have caused adverse events (Amato et al., 2017), including: (1) wrong drug ordered, (2)
     time delays with the client receiving the medication, (3) duplicate drug ordered, (4) prescription sent to the wrong
     pharmacy, (5) wrong dose, and (6) unidentified allergy.

     System alerts are often built into the EHR to assist with error prevention and help with clinical decision-making.
     Alerts in the EHR may improve treatment effectiveness, assist with decision support, and act as effective reminders
     for best care. For example, when a client is admitted with a stroke, the EHR may prompt the physician to order a
     computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan of the brain to assist with the diagnosis. The alert may appear as a small
     dialog box that allows the user to click OK or Cancel. One frequently seen alert regarding medication administration
     pops up to inform the nurse of a client's drug allergies. Other alerts will notify the nurse administering medications
     of a potential mix-up with look-alike and sound-alike drugs. The system will identify high-alert medications requiring
     a second nurse to double-check the first nurse. A nurse administering medications may find that the pharmacy has
     provided a 25 mg form of a tablet, but the order is for 50 mg. An alert will notify the nurse to give two tablets instead
     of one, thus preventing a medication error. The system may also flag the nurse with instructions on how to dilute or
     reconstitute medications.

     There are two types of alerts. A hard-stop alert is one in which the user is not allowed to proceed without taking
     some kind of action. The aim of a hard-stop alert is to improve quality of care and quality outcomes; unfortunately,
     they may cause a delay in care, especially if used frequently in the EHR. A soft-stop alert is one in which the alert is
     acknowledged, but the user may proceed. Both soft- and hard-stop alerts can be useful to the provider, but when
     "workarounds" are performed, it can place the client at risk. A workaround is a way of handling a problem or making
     something work without fixing the problem. One example of a workaround is a nurse having difficulty getting the
     barcode scanner to work, so the nurse types the client's name and medical record number into the system to
     manually document the medication administration. Although the client is able to get the drug, the problem is not
     solved. It may bypass safety measures in the system, placing the client at risk. Another unfortunate consequence of
     multiple alerts is alert fatigue because it interrupts workflow (Powers et al., 2018).

     Barcode Scanning
     Many institutions have implemented barcode-assisted medication administration as a means to reduce errors at the
     bedside. This technology is used to verify and document medication administration at the bedside. Once the nurse
     scans the barcode on the client's wrist, it identifies the client and opens the eMAR, which informs the nurse as to
     which medications should be administered. The nurse then scans the barcode on the medication, which should
     match the medication and the appropriate dose to be administered. If it corresponds to the client's record, the
     medication can then be administered. If it is incorrect, the nurse will receive an electronic alert.

     Recording Adverse Drug Events Through the EHR
     As mentioned previously, adverse drug events (ADEs) are a substantial problem in health care. Clients have
     complicated health histories, and care is very complex. Most hospitals rely on the voluntary reporting of ADEs,
     though few are actually reported (Murphy et al., 2023). The EHR can help obtain information on ADEs in hospitalized
     clients. An advantage to this is an improved ability to predict the occurrence of an ADE in future clients. The ability to
     identify ADEs earlier can increase client safety.

     Patient (Client) Care Portals
     Informatics has changed the way health care providers take care of the client, and it has changed the way that

clients interact with health care providers. Many providers have patient (client) care portals that allow
communication between provider and client, eliminating the need for face-to-face visits. Many applications (apps)
available on phones or smartwatches can assist the client and provider in monitoring the client's health, such as
pulse rate and rhythm monitoring, blood pressure, and blood glucose monitoring, to name a few.

CHAPTER OUTLINE
4.1 What Is Homeostasis?
4.2 Osmolality
4.3 Maintaining Homeostasis
4.4 Negative Feedback Loop

INTRODUCTION Homeostasis is important in helping the body maintain a stable environment. It involves the
regulation of physiologic processes. This process is achieved through the coordination of different organ systems
and feedback mechanisms. This chapter will provide an overview of homeostasis and these feedback mechanisms.

4.1 What Is Homeostasis?

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 4.1.1 Define homeostasis.
    · 4.1.2 Compare and contrast intracellular fluid and extracellular fluid and their effects on the body's cells.
    · 4.1.3 Discuss the major cations and anions and their essential functions.
Homeostasis is the ability of the body to maintain a stable and constant internal environment despite changes in
the external environment (Billman, 2020). This means that the body can regulate and balance its various physiologic
processes, such as body temperature (see Figure 4.2), fluid balance, pH levels, blood sugar levels, and hormone
levels, to ensure they remain within a narrow range that is optimal for the body's functioning.

     Homeostasis is a fundamental process that enables the body to maintain a stable internal environment in the face of
     constantly changing internal and external conditions. Disruption of homeostatic mechanisms may cause diseases
     and severe impacts on physiologic well-being. Two key principles govern homeostasis: fluid balance and electrolyte
     balance.

     The first principle of fluid balance involves maintaining the body's fluid compartments in osmotic equilibrium,
     except for transient change. This means that the concentration of solutes in each compartment is carefully
     regulated to prevent water from flowing into or out of cells, which could disrupt cellular function (Koeppen &
     Stanton, 2023; Valls & Esposito, 2022).

     The second principle of electrolyte balance involves ensuring that the numbers of ions (anions or cations) within
     each compartment of the body are balanced and electrically neutral. Each compartment works to maintain a
     constant volume of fluid and to replace and exchange ions to maintain this neutrality (Koeppen & Stanton, 2023;
     Valls & Esposito, 2022). This helps ensure that the body's pH remains within a narrow range, which is essential for
     proper physiologic functioning.

       SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

       Homeostasis in Children, Pregnant Clients, and Older Adults

       Children have unique physiologic characteristics and developmental needs. Children have a relatively higher
       water requirement compared with adults because of their higher metabolic rate and larger proportion of body
       water. Children are also more likely than older individuals to become dehydrated because their kidneys are less
       efficient at conserving water. Electrolyte balance in children may be more susceptible to imbalances because of
       their immature kidneys, resulting in higher renal losses of sodium and potassium.

       Pregnancy brings about significant physiologic changes that impact homeostatic mechanisms. Pregnancy
       increases blood volume and fluid retention to support the developing fetus. Hormonal changes influence fluid
       balance, causing the client to be more susceptible to edema and electrolyte imbalances. Increased levels of
       progesterone can also affect electrolyte regulation. Changes in kidney function and the demands of the
       developing fetus may impact the delicate balance of sodium, potassium, and calcium.

  As individuals age, various physiologic changes occur. Older adults often have a reduced sense of thirst and may
  not drink enough fluids, leading to an increased risk for dehydration. Age-related changes in the kidneys can
  also affect water and electrolyte regulation, resulting in a higher risk for imbalances such as hyponatremia (low
  sodium) and hyperkalemia (elevated potassium).

Homeostasis is a complex mechanism that requires an integrated control system for self-regulation. It is primarily
governed by a feedback loop that involves three key components: the receptor, the control center, and the effector
(Figure 4.3).

    · The receptor is a sensory organ that detects changes in the internal or external environment of the body. It
        sends signals to the control center when it detects a change that needs to be corrected.

    · The control center is typically located in the brain or other part of the nervous system. It receives the signals
        from the receptor and processes them to determine the appropriate response. The control center then signals
        the effector.

    · The effector is the part of the body that carries out the response. It could be a muscle, gland, or organ that
        alters its activity to counteract the initial change detected by the receptor.

FIGURE 4.3 Feedback loops involve a receptor to a stimulus, the control center, and the effector that carries out the control center's
response. (credit: reproduced with permission of Tina D. Barbour-Taylor)

The feedback loop plays a critical role in maintaining a balanced internal environment in the face of changing
internal and external conditions (Hannezo & Heisenberg, 2019; Molnar & Gair, n.d.). By detecting and correcting
deviations from the set point, the body is able to ensure that its various physiologic processes are functioning
optimally, thereby promoting overall health and well-being.

Cellular Compartments

Sixty percent of the total body weight is composed of water. The body separates this water into two main fluid
compartments: one that contains intracellular fluid and one that contains extracellular fluid. The fluid
compartments work together to maintain fluid and electrolyte balance within the body. The movement of water and
electrolytes between the compartments is regulated by various mechanisms, such as osmosis and active transport
(Libretti & Puckett, 2023; Molnar & Gair, n.d).

The body strives to maintain a balance between the fluids in the compartment to ensure that the cells are
surrounded by an environment that allows them to function optimally, as can be observed in Figure 4.4. The
concentration of ions, such as sodium, potassium, and chloride, is carefully regulated in each compartment to
maintain the proper osmotic pressure, which is the pressure needed to prevent water from flowing into or out of
cells.

Disruptions in the fluid compartments, such as excessive fluid loss or retention, can lead to various health problems,
including dehydration or edema. By regulating the equilibrium of body fluids, the body can guarantee the optimal
operation of its diverse physiologic functions, thereby enhancing overall health and well-being.

     Intracellular Fluid
     Intracellular fluid, also known as cytoplasm, refers to the fluid contained within the cells of the body. As shown in
     Table 4.1, intracellular fluid accounts for approximately 40% of the total body fluid in adults, and it plays a critical
     role in many physiologic processes.
     The composition of intracellular fluid is tightly regulated to ensure that it provides an optimal environment for
     cellular function. It contains various electrolytes, such as potassium, magnesium, and phosphate ions, as well as
     proteins and other molecules essential for cell function.
     Extracellular Fluid
     Extracellular fluid is the fluid that surrounds the cells of the body, including fluid in the blood vessels and the fluid in
     the spaces between tissues and organs. It accounts for approximately 20% of the total body fluid in adults.
     Extracellular fluid contains various electrolytes, such as sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate, as well as proteins,
     hormones, and other molecules.
     The extracellular fluid is divided into three subcompartments. The interstitial compartment, which surrounds the
     tissue cells, makes up approximately 15% of fluid volume; the intravascular compartment, which contains the
     plasma and blood, makes up approximately 5% of fluid volume; and the transcellular compartment makes up
     approximately 1% of fluid but is generally not included in fluid volume calculations.
     Transcellular Compartment (Third Space)
     The transcellular compartment, also known as the third space, refers to a small volume of fluid that is contained
     within certain body cavities and structures, such as the pleural cavity, peritoneal cavity, and joint spaces. This
     compartment is separate from the intracellular and extracellular fluid compartments and is characterized by its
     limited communication with the rest of the body. The volume of fluid in the transcellular compartment is regulated
     by various mechanisms, including pressure and transport mechanisms, which ensure that it is in balance with the
     other fluid compartments. Table 4.1 lists fluid compartments and their volumes and major electrolytes for an adult.

Ions

An ion is an atom or molecule that has an unequal number of protons and electrons. This inequality gives the ion an
electrical charge, either positive or negative. Ions are critical to maintaining homeostasis within the body.

Anions
An anion is a negatively charged ion, meaning it has more electrons than protons. This happens when an atom gains
one or more electrons, leaving it with a negative net charge. Chloride (Cl-), bicarbonate (HCO3-), phosphate (PO4-),
and sulfate (SO4-) are anions.

Cations
A cation is a positively charged ion, meaning it has fewer electrons than protons. This happens when an atom loses
one or more electrons, leaving it with a positive net charge. Calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), potassium (K+), and
sodium (Na+) are cations. Cations are important for acid-base reactions (reactions that affect pH).

4.2 Osmolality

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 4.2.1 Describe osmolality.
    · 4.2.2 Define tonicity.

Osmolality describes the concentration of solutes in a solution. It is defined as the number of solute particles per 1
kg of solvent, also known as an osmole, or a unit of osmotic concentration. Osmolarity refers to the number of
solutes per 1 liter of solvent and provides valuable insight into how solutions will behave under different conditions,
enabling the manipulation of their properties to achieve optimal changes within the body.

Osmolality

Osmolality is a measure of the concentration of solutes, such as sodium, glucose, and urea, in a solution;
specifically, it refers to the number of particles per kilogram of solvent. It is commonly used to assess the osmotic
pressure of body fluids, such as blood or urine, and can provide important information about the body's fluid and
electrolyte balance including:

· Hyperosmolality refers to a condition in which the concentration of solutes in a solution, such as blood or
   urine, is higher than normal. This can be caused by various factors, such as dehydration, diabetes, and certain
   drugs. Hyperosmolality may have serious consequences, such as impairment of the cardiovascular and
   circulatory system, as well as neurologic signs and symptoms such as irritability, seizures, and, in severe
   cases, coma.

· Hypoosmolality refers to a state in which the concentration of solutes in a solution is lower than normal. This
   can be caused by a variety of factors, including excessive water intake, certain drugs, disorders affecting the
   kidneys, and hormonal dysregulation of water balance. Hypoosmolality can have serious consequences,
   including neurologic signs and symptoms and even coma if not corrected.
116  4 · Introduction to Homeostasis

         · Iso-osmolality occurs when the concentration of solute particles per unit of volume in a solution is equal to a
             standard reference value.

     Tonicity

     Although osmolality and tonicity are related, they are not the same. Tonicity refers to the ability of a solution to
     cause a cell to gain or lose water and is relative to the cytoplasm of a cell (Khan & Farhana, 2023; Maldonado &
     Mohiuddin, 2022). A change in tonicity can have significant effects on cell function and overall fluid and electrolyte
     balance within the body, such as:

         · Hypertonicity occurs when the tonicity of a solution is greater than that of the cytoplasm of a cell. This state
             can cause water to move out of the cell, potentially leading to cell shrinkage and changes in cell function.
             Hypertonicity can be caused by a variety of factors, including dehydration and increased solute concentration
             in a solution, such as with high glucose levels in the blood.

         · Hypotonicity is related to hypoosmolality. It is a state in which the tonicity of a solution is less than that of the
             cytoplasm of a cell. Water can then move into the cell, potentially leading to swelling and other changes in cell
             function. Hypotonicity can be caused by a variety of factors, including excessive water intake and certain
             medical conditions.

         · Isotonicity exists when the tonicity of a solution is equal to that of the cytoplasm of a cell. This means the
             concentration of solutes in the solution is balanced with the concentration of solutes inside the cell, resulting
             in no net movement of water into or out of the cell.

     4.3 Maintaining Homeostasis

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 4.3.1 Describe how the body maintains homeostasis.
         · 4.3.2 List factors that affect the body's homeostasis.
         · 4.3.3 Discuss osmotic equilibrium and transient changes.

     Most medical conditions can be attributed to a breakdown in the homeostatic control system, whether it is due to an
     inability to detect external changes, failure to initiate a feedback loop, inability to respond to or return to the set
     point, or failure in the set point itself. The primary objective of health care providers is to restore the body's
     homeostasis to prevent cellular death and irreversible organ damage.

     Maintaining Homeostasis

     The human body maintains a state of internal balance, called homeostasis, that is regulated at the cellular level.
     Even when the external environment fluctuates, the body strives to keep this balance within a narrow range.
     However, a temporary transient change can occur before the body returns to a steady state. Changes in the
     extracellular or intracellular fluid compartments can occur due to internal or external factors and are crucial for
     maintaining a narrow range to prevent cell death, tissue damage, and organ dysfunction (Libretti & Puckett, 2023).

     Factors Impacting Homeostasis

     Disturbances in physiologic factors can have a significant impact on the body's ability to maintain homeostasis. Such
     disturbances include:

         · Disruptions in energy and nutrient balance, such as those that cause fluctuations in glucose levels
         · Dysregulation of immune response modulators, such as pH and cortisol
         · Disturbances in fluid and electrolyte levels, particularly sodium, potassium, and calcium

     These components play a critical role in maintaining homeostasis and are governed by a complex homeostatic
     mechanism called a feedback loop, which is discussed in more depth in a later section of this chapter.

     Osmotic Equilibrium

     Osmotic equilibrium occurs when the concentration of solutes on either side of a semipermeable membrane is
     equalized. It is achieved when the osmotic pressure of a solution is equal to the hydrostatic pressure on the
     solution. The force that causes the reabsorption of fluid from the interstitial fluid into the capillaries is known as

     Access for free at openstax.org
4.4 · Negative Feedback Loop                                                                                                      117

osmotic pressure or oncotic pressure. Unlike hydrostatic pressure, which pushes fluid out of the capillaries, osmotic
pressure pulls fluid back into them. This balance ensures that the optimal concentrations of electrolytes and
nonelectrolytes are maintained in cells, body tissues, and interstitial fluid. Transient changes in the body, such as
changes in temperature or pH, can disrupt the osmotic equilibrium, leading to a shift of water and solutes between
intracellular and extracellular fluid compartments in an attempt to restore balance.

The Na+K+ATPase pump (also referred to as the sodium-potassium-ATPase pump) is an essential component in
maintaining osmotic equilibrium (Pirahanchi et al., 2023). This pump moves sodium ions out of the cell and
potassium ions into the cell, against their concentration gradients. This active transport process requires energy
from adenosine 5-triphosphate (ATP), an energy molecule (Hoorm et al., 2020). Osmotic equilibrium is essential
for maintaining proper functioning of cells and body tissues. Figure 4.5 illustrates the Na+K+ATPase pump and the
method by which it allows for osmotic equilibrium.

4.4 Negative Feedback Loop

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 4.4.1 Define negative feedback loops as they relate to homeostasis.
    · 4.4.2 Describe homeostatic responses within the body.
    · 4.4.3 Explain positive feedback.

Feedback loops provide a mechanism for the body to maintain homeostasis. Feedback loops include negative
feedback, the homeostatic response system, and positive feedback.

Negative Feedback and Homeostasis

Negative feedback is critical in regulating the body's homeostasis to promote optimal health and well-being. These
inhibitory loops allow the body to self-regulate by counteracting any deviation from normal conditions. The process
begins with an increase in output from a body system, leading to higher levels of specific proteins or hormones. This
increase subsequently triggers the homeostatic response system to inhibit or reverse the production of those
proteins or hormones, preventing their levels from rising further. The body thus reduces the number of these
proteins or hormones, maintaining a balance within the normal physiologic limits (Chakravarty et al., 2023; Molnar &
Gair, n.d.). An example of negative feedback within the body is depicted in Figure 4.6.

     Homeostatic Response System

     The homeostatic response system is a biological structure that is in a constant state of flux because of external and
     internal factors that push the body's systems away from equilibrium. The homeostatic response system is vital for
     maintaining a stable internal environment. When the body experiences a stimulus, such as an elevated body
     temperature, a neuron (nerve cell) within the brain acts as a receptor or sensor, relaying the message to the control
     center, which may be the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, or nervous system. The control center then activates
     effectors, whose role is to counteract the stimulus, thereby restoring homeostasis (see Figure 4.6) (Libretti &
     Puckett, 2023). In this way, the homeostatic response system enables the body to adjust to changing conditions and
     maintain stability.

     Positive Feedback

     In positive feedback, the body responds to a stimulus by amplifying or enhancing it rather than inhibiting it. This
     mechanism leads to a continuous increase in the stimulus, also known as a runaway effect, creating a self-
     reinforcing cycle. Positive feedback loops are commonly found in processes that require rapid and decisive
     responses, such as:

         · Blood clotting
               When an injury occurs, platelets in the blood stick to the damaged area and release chemical signals that
                   attract more platelets. This recruitment of platelets leads to the formation of a blood clot, which further
                   activates more platelets and reinforces the clotting process.

         · Lactation
               During lactation, the mechanical stimulation of nerve endings in the breast signals the posterior pituitary
                   gland to release oxytocin, which stimulates the contraction of myoepithelial cells within the breast. As
                   breast milk is released, the sucking action of the infant continues, and this further stimulates the nerve
                   endings in the breast, creating a positive feedback loop.

         · Uterine contraction during childbirth
               During childbirth, the pressure of the newborn against the cervix and the tissue of the pelvic floor causes
                   contraction of the uterus, which then results in the release of oxytocin, which stimulates stronger
                   contractions. As contractions intensify, more oxytocin is released, resulting in positive feedback until the

adverse consequences.

INTRODUCTION Maintaining a healthy balance of fluids, electrolytes, vitamins, and minerals is a crucial aspect of a
person's overall well-being. Traditional pharmacological interventions are often used to manage imbalances in these
areas. However, alternative therapies may also offer potential benefits to relieving symptoms and conditions caused
by an imbalance in these areas. Understanding the role of fluids and electrolytes, as well as the potential uses and
limitations of alternative therapies, is important for health care providers seeking to optimize their clients' health
and well-being.

Fluid volume is a critical component of the body's homeostasis, allowing for proper functioning of numerous
124  5 · Fluids and Electrolytes, Vitamins, Minerals, and Alternative Therapies

     physiological processes. Disruptions to fluid volume can occur due to a variety of factors and can have serious
     consequences if left untreated. Maintaining an appropriate balance of fluids and electrolytes is essential for optimal
     health.

     Fluid Volume Introduction

     Fluid volume refers to the total amount of fluid present in the body, which includes both intracellular (inside cells)
     and extracellular (outside cells) fluids. The body is composed of approximately 60 percent water, which is
     distributed throughout the body in various compartments, including blood vessels, tissues, and organs.

     The fluid volume in the body is tightly regulated through a complex system of feedback mechanisms that help to
     maintain a balance of fluids and electrolytes. These mechanisms, which are discussed in Introduction to
     Homeostasis, help to ensure that the body's cells receive the appropriate amount of nutrients and oxygen and that
     waste products are removed efficiently. Figure 5.2 shows how diffusion works across cell membranes to create a
     balance.

     Maintaining, monitoring, and regulating fluid volume in the body is essential for proper bodily functions and an
     important aspect of medical care, especially when looking at fluid imbalances, which will be discussed in the next
     section.

     Fluid Imbalances

     A fluid imbalance occurs when there is an abnormal distribution of fluids between the intracellular fluid (ICF) and
     the extracellular fluid (ECF) compartments within the body. An abnormal distribution of fluids between the ICF and
     ECF compartments can disrupt cellular function and result in fluid imbalance in the form of either a deficit or an
     excess (Brinkman et al., 2023). These fluid imbalances will be discussed in more detail in the subsequent sections.

     A fluid imbalance can be caused by a variety of factors including medical conditions, such as kidney and heart
     disease, medication use, and lifestyle factors, such as diet and exercise.

     Treatment for the imbalance typically involves addressing the underlying cause and restoring the balance of fluids
     and electrolytes in the body. This may include oral or intravenous fluids, electrolyte replacement, and other
     interventions as necessary.

     Fluid Volume Deficit
     Fluid volume deficit, also known as hypovolemia, is a condition that occurs when there is a decrease in the body's
     fluid volume. This can be due to a loss of sodium from the body, decreased fluid intake, or a combination of both.
     Several conditions and diseases can lead to fluid volume deficit, such as dehydration, diabetes insipidus, and
     hemorrhage. Certain drugs, including diuretics, blood pressure drugs (e.g., angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
     inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which inhibit aldosterone), and laxatives (which increase fluid
     loss through stools), can lead to hypovolemia (Melendez-Rivera & Anjum, 2022).

5.1 · Fluid Volume                                                                                                     125

Manifestations of fluid volume deficit include:

    · Postural dizziness
    · Fatigue
    · Confusion
    · Muscle cramps
    · Chest pain
    · Abdominal pain
    · Postural hypotension
    · Tachycardia

The diagnosis of fluid volume deficit involves a comprehensive approach that includes a thorough physical
examination, a detailed client history, and laboratory tests such blood chemistry panels, electrolyte panels,
complete blood cell counts, and urinalysis.

Treatment of fluid volume deficit involves replenishing fluids and electrolytes through oral rehydration therapy or
intravenous (IV) fluid replacement, depending on the severity of the deficit.

Fluid Volume Excess
Fluid volume excess, also known as hypervolemia, is a condition that occurs when there is an abnormal increase in
the body's total fluid volume. This can be due to increased fluid intake, decreased fluid output, or a combination of
both. Several conditions and diseases can lead to fluid volume excess, including heart failure, liver disease, and
kidney disease (Ekinci et al., 2018). Certain drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and
corticosteroids (which can lead to fluid retention by affecting the kidneys' ability to eliminate sodium and water),
hormonal therapies such as estrogen replacement (which can lead to fluid retention), and diabetes drugs such as
thiazolidinediones can cause fluid retention as an adverse effect.

Manifestations of fluid volume excess include:

    · Shortness of breath
    · Crackles in the lungs
    · Swelling in the legs, ankles, and feet
    · Weight gain
    · High blood pressure
    · Fatigue

To diagnose fluid volume excess, the provider must take a comprehensive approach. This involves a physical
examination, a detailed client history, and various laboratory tests such as blood chemistry panels, electrolyte
panels, complete blood cell counts, and urinalysis. Additionally, imaging studies like a chest x-ray and
echocardiogram may also be necessary to assess the heart and lungs.

Treatment of hypervolemia involves addressing the underlying cause, restricting fluid and sodium intake, and
increasing urine output through diuretic drugs. In severe cases, hospitalization may be required for monitoring and
treatment.

Fluid Replacement

Fluid volume replacement is a medical treatment that involves replenishing lost fluid and electrolytes, specifically
sodium in the body, typically through IV infusion. This treatment is commonly used to address fluid volume deficit
and conditions that result in body fluid loss.

Fluid volume replacement works by restoring the balance of fluid and electrolytes that are essential for maintaining
proper bodily function. Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals such as sodium, potassium, chloride,
phosphate, magnesium, and calcium, which play roles in regulating cellular function and maintaining the body's
fluid balance (Melendez-Rivera & Anjum, 2022).

Fluid volume replacement usually involves various types of fluids or a combination of fluids containing electrolytes
and other nutrients. The specific type of fluid used depends on the client's condition and individual needs. Fluid
replacement and types of intravenous fluid replacement solutions will be discussed in more detail in subsequent
126  5 · Fluids and Electrolytes, Vitamins, Minerals, and Alternative Therapies

     sections.

     Fluid volume replacement is administered by health care professionals, and the treatment is closely monitored to
     ensure that the client's fluid and electrolyte levels are being properly balanced.

     Blood and Blood Products

     Blood is a vital component of fluid balance. Blood circulates through the body and is composed of various cells
     including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets (see Figure 5.3), as well as a liquid component called
     plasma. Blood plays an important role in:

         · Oxygen transport: Blood transports oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues. Red blood cells contain
             hemoglobin, which binds with oxygen and carries it throughout the body.

         · Nutrient transport: Blood carries nutrients such as glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids to the body's cells,
             where they are used for energy and cellular function.

         · Waste removal: Blood transports waste products such as carbon dioxide to the lungs and urea to the kidneys,
             where they are removed from the body.

         · Immune defense: White blood cells play a crucial role in the body's immune system, defending against
             infections and diseases.

         · Blood clotting: Blood contains platelets and clotting factors that help stop bleeding and promote the healing
             of injured tissues.

         · Hormone regulation: Blood helps regulate hormone levels in the body, which controls many important
             functions such as metabolism, growth, and development.

     FIGURE 5.3 White blood cells (including basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils), red blood cells, and platelet
     blood components are shown in this diagram. (credit: modification of work from Biology 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice University,
     OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

     Blood products are derived from donated human blood and are used for a variety of medical purposes, including
     fluid volume replacement. The most commonly used forms of blood products for fluid replacement are packed red
     blood cells (PRBCs), platelets, plasma, and cryoprecipitated anti-hemophilic factor (cryo) (American Red Cross,
     n.d.).
     When a person experiences severe blood loss or fluid volume deficit, fluid volume replacement is necessary to
     restore their blood volumes and prevent shock. Blood and blood products are administered intravenously to
     replenish lost fluids/blood, maintain the body's blood pressure and hormonal balance, and restore the body's
     oxygen-carrying capacity (Lotterman & Sharma, 2022). Blood and blood products will be discussed in more depth in
     the next section of this chapter.

5.2 Electrolytes

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 5.2.1 Define electrolytes.
    · 5.2.2 Discuss the functions of major electrolytes.
    · 5.2.3 Describe clinical manifestations related to common electrolyte imbalances.

Electrolytes are minerals that carry electrical charges and play vital roles in maintaining fluid homeostasis and
regulating various physiological functions. When there are imbalances in electrolytes, it can lead to a range of
symptoms and health issues that can significantly impact an individual's health and well-being. Therefore, it is
important to maintain proper electrolyte balance through a healthy diet, hydration, and medical care.

Electrolytes

Electrolytes are found in ICF and ECF compartments. They are responsible for many functions including regulating
nerves, muscle function, and fluid balance within the body and helping to maintain a healthy pH level. In the next
few sections, you will learn about potassium, sodium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and chloride.

Potassium
Potassium (K) is an essential cation primarily found inside cells. The normal intracellular concentration of potassium
ions in the body is approximately 140 mEq/L; the normal extracellular concentration is around 4 mEq/L. Therapeutic
serum potassium levels are 3.6 to 5.4 mEq/L (Shrimanker & Bhattarai, 2023).

Potassium moves into and out of the cells via the sodium-potassium-ATPase pump (also known as the
Na+K+ATPase pump) (see Figure 5.4), which uses energy from ATP hydrolysis to transport sodium ions out of cells
and potassium ions into cells against their concentration gradients. The pump is vital for maintaining the
concentration gradient of sodium and potassium ions across the cell membrane (Shrimanker & Bhattarai, 2023).

The levels of potassium in the body are influenced by acid-base imbalances. Acidotic conditions can lead to the
movement of potassium out of cells, whereas alkalotic conditions can promote movement of potassium into cells.
There is an inverse relationship between sodium and potassium reabsorption in the kidneys. Additionally, the
hormone aldosterone plays a role in regulating potassium excretion (Shrimanker & Bhattarai, 2023).

Potassium is necessary for transmission and conduction of nerve impulses and for contraction of skeletal, cardiac,
and smooth muscles. It is essential for normal renal function and glycolysis, the process of converting glucose into
energy. Potassium also promotes glycogen storage in hepatic cells and regulates osmolality of cellular fluids (Dalga
et al., 2023; Shrimanker & Bhattarai, 2023).

Hyperkalemia
Hyperkalemia is a condition where the level of potassium in the blood is higher than normal (usually above 5.5 mEq/
L) (Shrimanker & Bhattarai, 2023). Common causes include excessive potassium intake, impaired kidney function
that decreases its excretion, or a shift from intracellular to extracellular spaces.

Manifestations of hyperkalemia include muscle weakness, fatigue, palpitations, tachycardia, paresthesia, nausea,
diarrhea, and confusion. Electrocardiogram (ECG, EKG) changes such as peaked T waves, flattened P waves, and
prolonged QRS durations may be seen. In severe cases, hyperkalemia can cause cardiac arrest (Shrimanker &
Bhattarai, 2023).

Treatment for hyperkalemia includes removing excess potassium from the body through dialysis, administering
drugs that shift potassium from the extracellular fluid into the cells, administering potassium-binding drugs that
help bind to potassium and excrete it from the body, and treating the underlying cause. Common underlying causes
of hyperkalemia include kidney failure and diabetes (Shrimanker & Bhattarai, 2023).
128  5 · Fluids and Electrolytes, Vitamins, Minerals, and Alternative Therapies

     Nursing implications include restricting potassium in the diet. The health care provider may order administration of
     sodium bicarbonate (which elevates the pH level and moves potassium back into cells, thereby lowering the serum
     potassium levels), insulin and glucose (insulin helps to move potassium back into the cells by promoting the uptake
     of glucose and potassium), and/or sodium polystyrene sulfonate (which exchanges sodium ions for potassium ions
     in the colon, leading to removal of excess potassium through the stool). Monitoring potassium levels and reporting
     significant changes to the health care provider is key in ensuring appropriate potassium balance within the body
     (Shrimanker & Bhattarai, 2023).

     Clients should avoid food high in potassium (such as bananas, potatoes, and spinach), avoid salt substitutes (as
     these are high in potassium), take drugs as prescribed, and seek medical attention if they develop manifestations of
     hyperkalemia, such as palpitations, tachycardia, and muscle weakness.

     Hypokalemia
     Hypokalemia is a condition where the level of potassium in the blood is lower than normal (less than 3.6 mEq/L).
     Hypokalemia can be caused by excessive loss of potassium through the kidneys, increased loss of potassium in the
     digestive tract (through vomiting or diarrhea), insufficient potassium intake, redistribution of potassium from
     extracellular fluid into cells (by insulin therapy, alkalosis, or drugs), or by a magnesium deficiency (magnesium is
     necessary for the proper function of channels that regulate potassium transport in cells) (Shrimanker & Bhattarai,
     2023).

     Manifestations of hypokalemia include fatigue, muscle weakness, muscle cramps, constipation, and irregular
     heartbeat. EKG changes may be present with T wave inversion, widespread ST depression, and prominent U waves
     (Shrimanker & Bhattarai, 2023).

     Treatment for hypokalemia includes administering potassium supplements orally or intravenously, treating the
     underlying cause, and monitoring for complications such as low blood pressure. Common underlying causes of
     hypokalemia include diarrhea, diuretic use, excessive laxative use, excessive sweating, and diabetic ketoacidosis.
     Adverse reactions with potassium supplements include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Potassium
     supplements should be used cautiously with ARBs, ACE inhibitors, and potassium-sparing diuretics such as
     spironolactone.

     Nursing implications include monitoring potassium levels, assessing for manifestations of hypokalemia, and
     administering potassium supplements as prescribed by the health care provider. Clients should eat a diet containing
     potassium-rich foods (such as bananas, lentils, and dried fruits). Clients should avoid excessive use of laxatives or
     diuretics and report symptoms of hypokalemia, such as muscle weakness and constipation, to their health care
     provider.

     SAFETY ALERT

 Potassium and IV Bolus or Push

  Never push or bolus potassium intravenously. Rapid administration of potassium via intravenous bolus or push
  can result in cardiac dysrhythmias and client death. Intravenous potassium solutions are often premixed (diluted
  in 100-1000 mL of normal saline or lactated Ringer's solutions) to decrease the risk of errors.

     CLINICAL TIP

 Potassium Administration and IV Site Assessment

  Monitor the client's IV site closely when administering potassium intravenously for infiltration because potassium
  solutions can cause extravasation and tissue necrosis if they infiltrate into subcutaneous tissues. Discontinue the
  IV fluids immediately if this occurs and notify the health care provider. Maximum potassium concentration is 40
  mEq/L with a maximum peripheral infusion rate of 20 mEq/hour (Sur & Mohiuddin, 2022).

Sodium
Sodium (Na) is predominantly an extracellular cation, meaning it is found primarily outside of the cells in the
extracellular fluid. The normal concentration of sodium in the body is approximately 135-145 mEq/L (which is the
same as the therapeutic range for serum sodium levels), whereas the normal intracellular concentration is around
10 mEq/L (Shrimanker & Bhattarai, 2023).

The sodium-potassium-ATPase pump is vital for maintaining the concentration gradient of sodium and potassium
ions across the cell membrane. As you may recall, the pump uses energy to move sodium out of cells and potassium
into cells against their concentration gradients in order to maintain sodium-potassium balance (Shrimanker &
Bhattarai, 2023).

Sodium has many functions within the body. It is the primary determinant of the osmolality and volume of
extracellular fluids. It is involved in the transmission of nerve impulses throughout the body, including the brain and
nervous system. Sodium is important for proper muscle contraction and relaxation. Potassium and sodium work
130  5 · Fluids and Electrolytes, Vitamins, Minerals, and Alternative Therapies

     together to regulate blood pressure by maintaining the proper fluid balance. Sodium helps to maintain the pH
     balance of the blood. Additionally, sodium is necessary for the absorption of certain nutrients such as glucose and
     amino acids in the small intestine (Shrimanker & Bhattarai, 2023; Veniamakis et al., 2022).

     Hypernatremia
     Hypernatremia is a condition in which the sodium levels in the blood are higher than normal (above 145 mEq/L). As
     sodium levels rise, hypertonicity occurs, and water shifts out of the ICF space into the ECF. This can be caused by
     dehydration, excessive salt intake, deficient water intake, or kidney problems (Shrimanker & Bhattarai, 2023).

     Manifestations of hypernatremia include thirst, dry mucous membranes, flushed dry skin, elevated body
     temperature, muscle twitching, seizure, and coma. Treatment for hypernatremia involves correcting the underlying
     cause and restoring fluid and electrolyte balance. Intravenous fluids and drugs to lower sodium levels may be
     administered gradually.

     Nursing implications include monitoring intake and output as well as electrolyte levels. IV fluids and drugs such as
     diuretics are administered as needed.

       CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

       The client with hypernatremia should:

           · Avoid foods high in sodium, avoid using salt when cooking, and refrain from adding extra salt to foods at
               the table.

           · Read food labels and over-the-counter (OTC) drug labels to avoid excessive sodium intake.
           · Report manifestations of hypernatremia, such as thirst and muscle twitching, to their health care provider.

     Hyponatremia
     Hyponatremia is a condition in which sodium levels are lower than normal (less than 135 mEq/L). As sodium levels
     decrease, hypotonicity occurs, and water shifts from the ECF into the ICF. This can be caused by conditions such as
     kidney disease, heart failure, or excessive fluid intake (Shrimanker & Bhattarai, 2023). Manifestations of
     hyponatremia include muscle weakness, decreased deep tendon reflexes, headache, lethargy, confusion, weak or
     thready pulse, decreased blood pressure, seizures, and coma.

     Treatment for hyponatremia includes correcting the underlying cause and restoring fluid and electrolyte balance.
     Oral sodium replacement or intravenous fluids may be necessary to restore homeostasis. Adverse reactions include
     hypertension and fluid volume excess. Sodium replacement supplements should be used cautiously in clients with
     advanced renal disorders or heart failure.

     Nursing implications include monitoring intake and output of sodium and electrolyte levels, administering oral
     sodium replacements or intravenous solutions as ordered by the health care provider, and client education on fluid
     intake.

       CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

       The client with hyponatremia should:

           · Limit fluid intake to maintain proper fluid and electrolyte balance.
           · Report manifestations or changes in symptoms such as headache and lethargy to the health care provider.

     Calcium
     Calcium (Ca) is the fifth most abundant mineral in the body and is present in both intracellular and extracellular fluid
     compartments. In the ECF, calcium is present in ionized and protein-bound forms; in ICF, calcium is primarily bound
     to proteins and organelles. The therapeutic range for serum calcium levels is 8.8-10.4 mg/dL (Drake & Gupta, 2022;
     Shrimanker & Bhattarai, 2023).

     Calcium is necessary for the formation and maintenance of bones and teeth. It is also important for proper muscle

function, including contraction and relaxation. Calcium is involved in the transmission of nerve impulses and is
necessary for the release of certain hormones and enzymes. Additionally, calcium is involved in the clotting of blood
and helps to regulate heart rhythm (Shrimanker & Bhattarai, 2032). Calcium has an inverse relationship with
phosphorus and a synergistic relationship with magnesium. The parathyroid hormone from the parathyroid gland
and calcitonin from the thyroid gland regulate calcium levels. The absorption of calcium requires activated vitamin
D.

Hypercalcemia
Hypercalcemia is a condition in which serum calcium levels are higher than normal (greater than 10.4 mg/dL).
Hypercalcemia can be a result of hyperparathyroidism, malignancy, hypophosphatasia, and thiazide diuretic use
(Drake & Gupta, 2022; Sadiq et al., 2022; Shrimanker & Bhattarai, 2023).

Manifestations of hypercalcemia include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, excessive thirst or urination,
constipation, abdominal pain, bone pain, diminished deep tendon reflexes, confusion, kidney stones, muscle
weakness or twitching, and an irregular heartbeat.

Treatment for hypercalcemia includes identifying and treating the underlying cause, such as hyperparathyroidism or
certain cancers. Treatment options include drugs to decrease calcium levels, such as loop diuretics,
bisphosphonates, or calcitonin, or IV fluids to help flush excess calcium from the body.

Nursing implications include close monitoring of calcium levels and vital signs, administering drugs as prescribed by
the health care provider, and monitoring for complications such as kidney stones, renal impairment, and cardiac
arrhythmias.

  CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

  The client with hypercalcemia should:

      · Avoid overuse of calcium-containing antacids.
      · Report symptoms, such as bone pain or changes in urination, to the health care provider.

Hypocalcemia
Hypocalcemia is a condition in which serum calcium levels are lower than normal (lower than 8.8 mg/dL) (Drake &
Gupta, 2022). Hypocalcemia can result from calcium loss from bone, pathologic fractures due to calcium loss,
hypoparathyroidism, hyperphosphatemia, diarrhea, alcoholism, vitamin D deficiency, and malnutrition.
Manifestations of hypocalcemia include paresthesia, muscle cramps or spasms, weakness, fatigue, difficulty
swallowing or speaking, confusion, osteoporosis, irritability, seizures, and dysrhythmias (Shrimanker & Bhattarai,
2023).

Treatment for hypocalcemia includes identifying and treating the underlying cause, such as vitamin D deficiency.
Treatment options may include calcium and vitamin D supplements, drugs to improve calcium absorption, or
intravenous calcium if levels are severely low. Adverse reactions include constipation, severe diarrhea, and
abdominal pain. Calcium supplements should be used cautiously with levothyroxine, tetracycline antibiotics, and
quinolone antibiotics because they can decrease their absorption.

Nursing implications include administering oral or intravenous calcium supplements, administering vitamin D
supplements, assessing renal and cardiac functioning, and monitoring the IV site for infiltration and extravasation.

  CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

  The client with hypocalcemia should:

      · Maintain a balanced diet with calcium-rich foods, such as dairy products enriched with vitamin D,
          sardines, salmon, winter squash, and edamame.
132  5 · Fluids and Electrolytes, Vitamins, Minerals, and Alternative Therapies

          CLINICAL TIP

      Calcium Supplements and Iron Administration

       Avoid administering oral iron supplements within 1 to 2 hours of oral calcium supplements and dairy products
       because calcium may interfere with the absorption of iron and reduce its effectiveness (Piskin et al., 2022).

     Phosphorous
     Phosphorous (P) is the second most abundant element in the body and is a major anion in intracellular fluid. The
     majority of the body's phosphorus is found in phosphate; it is important to note that the terms phosphate and
     phosphorus are used interchangeably. Phosphorus is needed to help bones and teeth maintain their structure, for
     RNA and DNA synthesis, for cell signaling, and for pH balance in the body. The therapeutic range for serum
     phosphorus level is 3.4-4.5 mEq/L (Shrimanker & Bhattarai, 2023).

     Hyperphosphatemia
     Hyperphosphatemia is a condition where the body's phosphorus level is greater than the therapeutic range (above
     4.5 mEq/L). Causes of hyperphosphatemia include chronic kidney disease, hypoparathyroidism, excess phosphorus
     intake, and certain drugs (Goyal & Jialal, 2022; Shrimanker & Bhattarai, 2023).

     Manifestations of hyperphosphatemia include muscle spasms, hyperreflexia, nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal
     cramps. Treatment for hyperphosphatemia involves addressing the underlying cause and may involve restricting
     dietary intake of phosphorus, administering phosphate-binding drugs, and in severe cases, dialysis.

     Nursing implications include monitoring serum phosphate levels, assessing manifestations, and educating the client
     regarding dietary intake.

       CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

       The client with hyperphosphatemia should:

           · Report symptoms such as abdominal pain and tetany to the health care provider.
           · Avoid foods high in phosphorus, such as whole grains and nuts.

     Hypophosphatemia
     Hypophosphatemia is a condition where the body's phosphorus level is lower than the therapeutic range (below 2.5
     mEq/L). Causes include malnutrition, alcoholism, hyperparathyroidism, and certain drugs, such as diuretics.
     Manifestations include muscle weakness, altered mental status, bone pain, paresthesia, and dysphagia (Sharma et
     al., 2022; Shrimanker & Bhattarai, 2023).

     Treatment for hypophosphatemia depends on the underlying cause and may involve oral or intravenous phosphorus
     supplementation and adjusting drugs or drug dosages. Adverse effects of phosphorus supplements include kidney
     stones, headache, dizziness, and seizures. Phosphorus supplements should be used cautiously in clients at risk for
     kidney stones or who have kidney failure.

     Nursing implications include monitoring phosphate levels, assessing manifestations for worsening symptoms, and
     monitoring for adverse effects of phosphorus supplements, which include bone pain, muscle cramps, confusion,
     tachycardia, or swelling in hands, legs, or feet.

       CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

       The client with hypophosphatemia should:

           · Report symptoms such as bone pain and tremors to the health care provider.
           · Maintain a well-balanced diet with foods high in phosphorus, such as whole grain cereals, nuts, and dairy

               products.

      · Drink a full glass of water every hour to reduce the risk of kidney stone development.

Magnesium
Magnesium (Mg) is a mineral that is essential for many physiological processes, including energy production, protein
synthesis, muscle and nerve function, and bone health. It is found in both ICF and ECF. The therapeutic range for
serum magnesium is 1.46-2.68 mEq/L (Shrimanker & Bhattarai, 2023). Magnesium assists in the release of
parathyroid hormone (PTH). Magnesium and potassium have an interdependent relationship; when potassium levels
decrease, so do magnesium levels, and vice versa.

Hypermagnesemia
Hypermagnesemia refers to high levels of magnesium in the blood (greater than 2.68 mEq/L). It can be caused by
kidney dysfunction, excessive use of magnesium-containing antacids or laxatives, excessive magnesium
supplement use, or use of certain medications, such as proton pump inhibitors and lithium-based psychotropic
drugs (Cascella & Vaqar, 2023; Shrimanker & Bhattarai, 2023).

Manifestations of hypermagnesemia include weakness, lethargy, confusion, low blood pressure, and in severe
cases, cardiac arrest. Treatment of hypermagnesemia consists of removing the cause of excess magnesium,
administering drugs such as calcium gluconate to reduce magnesium in the body, and symptom management.

Nursing implications include close monitoring of electrolyte levels and timely reporting of any changes in client
symptoms or laboratory values to the health care provider.

  CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

  The client with hypermagnesemia should:

      · Use magnesium or magnesium-containing supplements or drugs carefully.
      · Promptly report any symptoms that may indicate hypermagnesemia, such as weakness and low blood

          pressure, to the health care provider.

Hypomagnesemia
Hypomagnesemia refers to low levels of magnesium in the blood (less than 1.46 mEq/L). It can be caused by a
variety of factors including malnutrition, alcoholism, gastrointestinal disorders, and drugs such as diuretics.
Manifestations include generalized weakness, tremors, cramps, arrhythmias, and seizures (Gragossian et al., 2022;
Shrimanker & Bhattarai, 2023).

Treatment for hypomagnesemia involves oral or intravenous magnesium supplementation and addressing the
underlying cause. Adverse reactions to magnesium supplements include nausea, abdominal cramping, diarrhea,
hypotension, flushing of skin, and urinary retention. Magnesium supplements should be used cautiously in clients
with diabetes, digestive disorders, and heart or kidney disorders.

Nursing implications involve careful monitoring of magnesium levels, identifying clients at risk for development of
hypomagnesemia, and monitoring and reporting changes in symptoms and laboratory values to the health care
provider.

  CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

  The client with hypomagnesemia should:

      · Take magnesium supplements with meals to prevent gastrointestinal upset and diarrhea.
      · Eat foods rich in magnesium, such as avocado, broccoli, spinach, and lentils.
134  5 · Fluids and Electrolytes, Vitamins, Minerals, and Alternative Therapies

          CLINICAL TIP

      Magnesium and Folic Acid, Fiber, and Iron Supplements

       Avoid administering magnesium within 2 hours of folic acid, fiber, and iron supplements because magnesium
       may interfere with the absorption of these drugs and reduce their effectiveness (National Health Service, 2023).

     Chloride
     Chloride (Cl) is an anion found primarily in the ECF and is essential in maintaining fluid balance and helping to
     regulate the pH of bodily fluids. Chloride ions are important for the formation of hydrochloric acid in the stomach,
     which is necessary for the digestion of food. Additionally, chloride ions work together with other electrolytes, such
     as sodium and potassium, to maintain proper electrical balance and conduct nerve impulses throughout the body.
     The therapeutic range for chloride is 98-106 mEq/L (Fishman, 2023; Shrimanker & Bhattarai, 2023).

     Hyperchloremia
     Hyperchloremia is a condition where there is an excess amount of chloride in the blood (greater than 106 mEq/L). It
     may be caused by various conditions such as dehydration, metabolic acidosis, and kidney disease and by certain
     drugs, such as chemotherapy (Shrimanker & Bhattarai, 2023).

     Manifestations of hyperchloremia include weakness, confusion, lethargy, and tachypnea (rapid breathing).
     Treatment involves addressing the underlying cause in addition to fluid and electrolyte replacement.

     Nursing implications include monitoring fluid and electrolyte balance, intake, and output; administering drugs such
     as diuretics as ordered; and maintaining the client on a low-sodium diet.

       CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

       The client with hyperchloremia should:

           · Avoid foods high in salt because chloride binds readily to sodium.
           · Monitor their fluid intake and report symptoms of hyperchloremia, such as tachypnea and lethargy, to the

               health care provider.

     Hypochloremia
     Hypochloremia is a condition where there is a low amount of chloride in the blood (less than 98 mEq/L). It may be
     caused by diarrhea, vomiting, kidney disease, or metabolic alkalosis. Manifestations include weakness, fatigue,
     trouble breathing, and dizziness (Fishman, 2023; Shrimanker & Bhattarai, 2023).

     Treatment is focused on treating the underlying cause, replacing fluids and electrolytes, and adjusting drugs or drug
     dosages. Adverse effects include fever and fluid volume excess. Fluid replacement with chloride-containing
     solutions should be administered cautiously in clients with heart failure and kidney disorders.

     Nursing implications include monitoring intake and output, administering fluids and electrolytes per health care
     provider orders, and monitoring for signs of fluid volume excess, such as shortness of breath, crackles, and
     peripheral edema, from overtreatment.

       CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

       The client with hypochloremia should:

           · Maintain a balanced diet that includes sources of sodium.
           · Report symptoms of hypochloremia, such as tremors and low blood pressure, to the health care provider.

5.3 Intravenous Fluid Therapy, Total Parenteral Nutrition, and Blood Products

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 5.3.1 Describe types of intravenous solutions.
    · 5.3.2 Compare and contrast crystalloid and colloid intravenous solutions.
    · 5.3.3 Define total parenteral nutrition and its uses.
    · 5.3.4 Discuss the importance of blood and blood products in fluid balance.
    · 5.3.5 Discuss how intravenous solutions are used to correct fluid imbalances within the body.

Fluid volume replacement is an important part of fluid and electrolyte homeostasis within the body. In this section
of the chapter, intravenous fluid therapy, total parenteral nutrition, and blood products will be discussed.

Intravenous Fluid Therapy

Intravenous (IV) fluid therapy is a medical treatment that involves the administration of fluids directly into a
person's veins through an intravenous catheter. The fluids are typically a combination of water, electrolytes, and
other nutrients, depending on the specific needs of the client.

IV fluid therapy is used for a wide variety of medical conditions including hypovolemia, electrolyte imbalances, and
shock. It is commonly used during and after surgical procedures to help maintain fluid balance and prevent
complications.

A health care professional administers IV fluid therapy. The appropriate type and amount of fluid administered is
based on the client's medical history, a thorough physical exam, and laboratory results. The fluids are delivered
through an IV catheter, which is inserted into a peripheral vein or via a central venous access device or mediport.
The rate and duration of IV fluid therapy will vary depending on the client's condition and response to treatment.
Therapy may last a few hours, several days, or even weeks. Refer to Drug Administration for review of dosage
calculation formulas for drops per minute and milliliters per hour as they relate to IV fluid therapy.

Overall, IV fluid therapy is critical in restoring fluid balance, maintaining blood pressure, and preventing
complications related to fluid volume deficit. IV fluid therapy usually involves crystalloid solutions, colloid solutions,
total parenteral nutrition, and blood and blood products, all of which will be discussed further in the following
sections.

Crystalloid Solutions

Crystalloid solutions are a type of IV fluid therapy that consists of electrolytes and fluids that can readily cross the
capillary walls. These solutions lack proteins that maintain colloidal oncotic pressure (osmotic pressure exerted by
large proteins that holds water within the vascular space) that prevents water from leaving the intravascular space
(Epstein & Waseem, 2022). These solutions are commonly used for short-term maintenance of fluids and in treating
fluid volume deficits. The three main types of crystalloid solutions are isotonic, hypotonic, and hypertonic, which are
discussed in the following sections; examples can be seen in Table 5.1.

Isotonic Solutions
Isotonic solutions have the same concentration of dissolved particles, such as sodium and glucose, as the body's
own fluids. This means they have the same approximate osmolality as ECF or plasma. Because of their osmotic
equilibrium, water does not enter or leave the cells. Isotonic solutions are typically used to treat conditions such as
dehydration caused by vomiting, diarrhea, or excessive sweating or other conditions that cause fluid volume deficit
(Epstein & Waseem, 2022).

Hypotonic Solutions
Hypotonic solutions have a lower concentration of dissolved particles than the body's own fluids. This means they
exert less osmotic pressure than ECF, which allows water to move into the cell or ICF compartment. Hypotonic
solutions are often used to treat intracellular fluid volume deficit conditions, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or
hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (Epstein & Waseem, 2022).

Hypertonic Solutions
Hypertonic solutions have a higher concentration of dissolved particles than the body's own fluid, which means
136  5 · Fluids and Electrolytes, Vitamins, Minerals, and Alternative Therapies

     they exert greater osmotic pressure than ECF. This results in a higher solute concentration than the serum, thus
     pulling water from the interstitial space into the ECF and causing cell shrinkage. They are used to treat conditions
     such as severe hyponatremia (low sodium levels), cerebral edema (swelling of the brain), or increased intracranial
     pressure (ICP) (Epstein & Waseem, 2022).

     Colloid Solutions

     Colloid solutions, also known as volume expanders, differ from crystalloid solutions in that they contain large
     molecular structures, such as proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids, that increase their osmolality without dissolving in
     the solution. Due to their large size, colloid solutions cannot cross the semipermeable membrane of capillary walls
     and remain confined to the intravascular compartment. These solutions increase the colloidal oncotic pressure,
     which draws fluid from the interstitial space into plasma, resulting in an increase in blood volume.

     Commonly administered colloidal solutions are listed in Table 5.1 along with their indications and precautions
     (Crosignani et al., 2022).

SAFETY ALERT

Hydroxyethyl Starch (HES) Product Risk

Use of hydroxyethyl starch (HES) products increases the risk of mortality, kidney injury, and coagulopathy. Do not
use HES products (such as hetastarch) unless an adequate alternative treatment is unavailable.

Total Parenteral Nutrition

Total parenteral nutrition (TPN), also known as intravenous nutrition, is a medical treatment that involves
administering a specialized nutritional formula directly into a person's bloodstream through a central venous
catheter. The nutritional formula is tailored to the specific needs of the client and typically includes amino acids,
carbohydrates, proteins, fats, electrolytes, vitamins, and minerals (Hamdan & Puckett, 2022).

TPN is used for clients who are unable to receive adequate nutrition through their digestive system due to illness,
injury, or surgery. TPN is administered through a central venous catheter (central line, peripherally inserted central
catheter, or an implanted port), which is placed in a large vein that terminates in the superior vena cava. The
administration rate and duration of TPN depends on the client's condition and response to treatment (Hamdan &
Puckett, 2022).

          SAFETY ALERT

      TPN and Peripherally Inserted Venous Catheters

       Due to its high osmolality, TPN should not be administered through a peripheral venous catheter because it can
       cause vein irritation, damage, or thrombus formation (American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition,
       n.d.).

     Indications for TPN include:

         · Severe malnutrition
         · Gastrointestinal disorders that prevent the absorption of nutrients
         · Severe burns
         · Inflammatory bowel disorders or diseases
         · Short bowel syndrome
         · Cancer or cancer treatments that affect the digestive system

     Contraindications for TPN include:

         · Intestinal obstruction or perforation
         · Hepatic impairment
         · Kidney impairment
         · Uncontrolled diabetes

     Adverse Effects
     Adverse effects for TPN include:

         · Catheter site infection
         · Fluid volume overload
         · Hyperglycemia
         · Hypoglycemia if discontinued suddenly
         · Parenteral-associated cholestasis
         · Bleeding
         · Refeeding syndrome
         · Venous thrombosis

     Clients should be monitored closely until they are stable. Monitoring should include (Hamdan & Puckett, 2022):

         · Intake and output every 12 hours
         · Urine sugar monitoring every 8 hours
         · Serum electrolyte levels
         · Serum protein levels
         · Liver function levels

     Blood and Blood Products

     As you may recall, blood is a complex bodily fluid that is essential for transporting oxygen, nutrients, and hormones
     to the body's tissues and organs as well as removing waste products. Blood products are components of blood that
     have been separated from whole blood through a process called blood fractionation. This process involves dividing
     the blood into red blood cells, platelets, and plasma and then processing and storing them separately (American
     Red Cross, n.d.).

     Packed Red Blood Cells (PRBCs)
     Packed red blood cells (PRBCs) are a blood product that contains concentrated red blood cells. PRBCs are created
     by removing most of the plasma from donated blood, leaving behind a concentrated mixture of red blood cells.
     PRBCs are used to treat conditions such as anemia, blood loss, or other conditions that require a boost in red blood
     cells. PRBCs are typically stored in a refrigerator unit in a blood bank and have a shelf life of up to 42 days (American
     Red Cross, n.d.).

Platelets
Platelets are another type of blood cell that plays a crucial role in blood clotting. They help to plug damaged blood
vessels and prevent excessive bleeding. Platelets can be separated from donated blood and are used to treat
conditions such as thrombocytopenia, which is a low platelet count (American Red Cross, n.d.).

Fat Emulsions (Lipids)
Fat emulsions, also known as lipids, are a substance found in the bloodstream. They include cholesterol,
triglycerides, and other types of fatty acids. Lipids are given to clients who have a deficiency of fatty acids. Lipids are
commonly administered along with TPN via piggyback or combined into the total TPN formula (Ahmed et al., 2023;
American Red Cross, n.d.; Sepulveda & Pak, 2022).

Cryoprecipitated Anti-hemophilic Factor (Cryo)
Cryoprecipitated anti-hemophilic factor (cryo) is a blood product that contains a concentrated mixture of proteins
used to treat bleeding disorders such as hemophilia. It is produced by freezing and thawing a unit of plasma and
then removing the resulting precipitate. Cryo contains factors such as fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and
Factor VIII, which are essential for blood clotting (American Red Cross, n.d.; Sachais & Senaldi, 2019).

Blood Typing, Cross-Matching, and Transfusion
Blood and blood products must be compatible with the recipient's blood type to minimize the risk of transfusion
reactions. Blood typing involves determining the blood group and Rh factor of the donor and the recipient. There are
four main blood groups: A, B, AB, and O. Each group can be either Rh positive or Rh negative. The donor blood type
is determined by testing for the presence of specific antigens on the surface of red blood cells (American Red Cross,
n.d.).

Cross-matching involves mixing a sample of the donor's blood with a sample of the recipient's blood to check for
compatibility. This is done to identify any potential reaction between the donor and recipient's blood, such as the
development of antibodies or agglutination (clumping) of the red blood cells (Harris & Crookston, 2022).

Once the blood has been typed and cross-matched, it can be transfused into the recipient's bloodstream. An adult
client will need a 16-18 gauge IV catheter for rapid transfusions and a 20-22 gauge IV catheter for routine
transfusions. A pediatric client will need a 22-25 gauge IV catheter for transfusions. The length of the blood
transfusion depends on the amount of blood or blood product being transfused and the rate of infusion. Generally, a
unit of PRBCs takes about 2-4 hours to transfuse; other blood products such as platelets may take less time
(Lotterman & Sharma, 2022).

During the transfusion, the client's vital signs should be monitored regularly and per the facility's protocol. The client
should be observed closely for any signs of a transfusion reaction, which can range from mild to severe. Common
reactions to blood transfusions include (Harris & Crookston, 2022; Lotterman & Sharma, 2022):

    · Febrile reactions: the most common type of transfusion reaction, characterized by a fever and chills
    · Allergic reactions: can range from mild itching, hives, and shortness of breath to severe anaphylaxis, which

        can be life-threatening
    · Hemolytic reactions: occur when the body's immune system attacks the transfused blood cells, causing them

        to break down
    · Transfusion-associated circulatory overload: occurs when the body cannot handle the volume of fluid being

        transfused, leading to fluid volume excess and/or heart failure

It is important to note that blood transfusions are generally safe and effective when administered properly. Health
care providers can take steps to minimize the risk of transfusion reactions, including premedicating with
acetaminophen and diphenhydramine. Clients are closely monitored during and after the transfusion to ensure their
safety.

Correcting Fluid Imbalance

Fluid imbalance in the body can be corrected by addressing the underlying cause of the imbalance. The goal is to
restore the fluid balance through various interventions. The two main types of fluid imbalances are fluid volume
deficit and fluid volume excess. Correcting fluid imbalances is critical to promoting normal physiological function.
140  5 · Fluids and Electrolytes, Vitamins, Minerals, and Alternative Therapies

     Correcting Fluid Volume Deficit
     As you may recall, fluid volume deficit occurs when the body loses more fluid than it takes in. Correction of fluid
     volume deficit includes oral rehydration with electrolyte solutions and water and treating the underlying cause, such
     as vomiting, diarrhea, or excessive sweating. IV fluid therapy may need to be administered by a health care
     professional after a thorough physical examination and review of laboratory values (Melendez-Rivera & Anjum,
     2022). Fluid volume deficit is commonly treated with a crystalloid solution (see Table 5.1); however, it may
     occasionally require a colloid volume expander and/or blood or blood products to prevent further fluid loss and
     promote recovery.

     Correcting Fluid Volume Excess
     Fluid volume excess occurs when the body retains more fluid than it excretes. Correcting fluid volume excess
     involves restricting fluid and sodium intake, using diuretics to increase urine output, and treating the underlying
     causes, such as heart failure or kidney disorders, to prevent further accumulation of fluid and to promote healing
     (Ekinci et al., 2018).

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 5.4.1 Discuss water-soluble and fat-soluble vitamins and their importance in the body.
         · 5.4.2 Identify minerals to treat deficiencies.
         · 5.4.3 Discuss chelating agents to remove excess copper, iron, and lead from the body.
         · 5.4.4 Identify food source and deficiency conditions associated with vitamins and minerals.
         · 5.4.5 Describe the use of common complementary and alternative therapies.
         · 5.4.6 Explain how complementary and alternative therapies may potentiate, negate, or cause toxicity

             with prescribed drugs.
         · 5.4.7 Discuss the nursing implications related to complementary and alternative therapies.
         · 5.4.8 Explain the client education related to complementary and alternative therapies.

     Vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that the body requires for various physiological functions, including
     growth, development, and maintenance. Complementary and alternative therapies such as acupuncture,
     aromatherapy, and herbal supplements are becoming increasingly popular as nontraditional treatments for various
     medical conditions. This section of the chapter will discuss vitamins, minerals, and common complementary and
     alternative therapies.

     Vitamins

     Vitamins are essential organic compounds required for normal metabolic function, growth, and healing. The body
     requires only small amounts of vitamins daily, which are typically obtained through a well-balanced diet. Vitamins
     are usually prescribed for clients who have the inability to metabolize and absorb vitamins, such as with celiac
     disease; increased vitamin losses, such as with diarrhea and crash diets; and when there is an increased vitamin
     need, such as with pregnancy. There are two types of vitamins, water-soluble and fat-soluble, discussed in the
     following sections.

     Water-Soluble
     Water-soluble vitamins dissolve in water. They are excreted by the kidneys in urine and are minimally stored in the
     body. Water-soluble vitamins need to be consumed regularly in the diet or through supplements to maintain
     adequate levels in the body. They play a critical role in various bodily functions, such as energy, metabolism, nerve
     function, and collagen synthesis. Water-soluble vitamins, their functions, food sources, and deficiency conditions
     are also discussed in Table 5.2.

     Fat-Soluble
     Fat-soluble vitamins dissolve in fat and are stored in the body's fat tissues and liver. They are absorbed along with
     dietary fat and can be stored in the body for extended periods. Excessive intake of fat-soluble vitamins can lead to
     toxicity because they are not readily excreted. Fat-soluble vitamins are essential to various bodily functions such as
     vision, immune function, blood clotting, and bone health. Fat-soluble vitamins, their functions, food sources, and
     deficiency conditions are also discussed in Table 5.2.

     Minerals are inorganic substances that are essential for certain physiological functions. Minerals are necessary for
     the formation of strong bones and teeth, regulation of fluid balance, muscle function, and the production of
     hormones and enzymes. They aid in the transport of oxygen and nutrients throughout the body and support immune
     function. Table 5.3 lists the heavy metal minerals iron, copper, lead, and zinc and their functions, food sources,
     chelating agents for toxicity, and deficiency conditions. Table 5.4 lists the functions, food sources, and deficiency

     Complementary and Alternative Therapies

     Complementary and alternative therapies, also known as complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), is a
     broad term used to describe health practices and treatments that are used in addition to or instead of conventional
     medical therapies. Examples of CAM include herbal supplements, acupuncture, chiropractic care, massage therapy,
     and mind-body practices such as meditation and yoga. Some people choose CAM therapies because they believe
     they are more natural or holistic than conventional medicine or because they have had negative experiences with
     conventional medicine (Jones et al., 2019; National Institutes of Health, n.d.-b). However, it is important to note
     that not all CAM therapies are safe and effective, and some may even be harmful.

     Dietary Supplement and Health Education Act
     The Dietary Supplement and Health Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994 is a federal law that regulates the
     manufacturing and labeling of dietary supplements. Under DSHEA, dietary supplements are classified as a food, not
     a drug, and are not subject to the same strict regulations as drugs. However, DSHEA does require that
     manufacturers of dietary supplements meet certain labeling requirements and notify the Food and Drug
     Administration (FDA) of any new ingredients they plan to use. DSHEA also allows manufacturers to make certain
     health claims about their products as long as they are truthful and not misleading (National Institutes of Health,
     n.d.-a).

     Good Manufacturing Practices
     Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) are a set of guidelines established by the FDA that ensures quality, purity, and
     strength of dietary supplements. GMPs require manufacturers to use standardized manufacturing processes,
     perform regular testing of raw materials and finished products, and maintain detailed records of all production and
     testing. GMPs also require manufacturers to have a system in place for handling complaints and reporting adverse
     events (National Institutes of Health, n.d.-a).

     Common Complementary Therapies
     Complementary therapies are used to promote overall health and well-being. They are often used to alleviate
     symptoms and side effects associated with medical conditions and treatments, but they are not intended to replace
     or serve as a substitute for traditional medical care. Table 5.6 describes common complementary therapies, their
     uses, and special considerations.

     SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

     Asian Americans and CAM

     Asian Americans are more likely to use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as compared to other
     races or ethnicities. Many continue cultural traditions of using Eastern alternatives such as acupuncture,
     Ayurveda, and yoga.

Cannabis has been used for centuries as a natural remedy to alleviate symptoms of various health conditions,
such as chronic pain, anxiety, and insomnia. Medical cannabis is a new trend that is legal in many states and
countries, allowing clients access to cannabis-based treatments under the supervision of licensed health care
providers. With the increasing use of medical cannabis, there is a growing need for health care professionals to
be trained in its use and to be able to provide accurate information to clients. Dr. Josh Axe, DNM, DC, CNS, is a
doctor of natural medicine, chiropractor, and clinical nutritionist. In the video podcast "Medicinal Benefits of

INTRODUCTION The immune system is an intricate defense mechanism that protects the human body from
diseases and infection. It uses antibodies and white blood cells to combat foreign invaders such as bacteria and
viruses. Maintaining a healthy immune system is essential for overall well-being and resilience against potential
harm. This section of the chapter will discuss the immune system and its function, explain antigen-antibody
interactions, and compare antibody-mediated and cell-mediated immunity.

6.1 Introduction to Immunity

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 6.1.1 Discuss the immune system and its function.
    · 6.1.2 Compare and contrast antibody-mediated immunity and cell-mediated immunity.
    · 6.1.3 Explain antigen-antibody interactions.

The Immune System

The immune system is a complex and sophisticated defense mechanism that protects the human body from harmful
pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, and other foreign substances (Justiz-Vaillant et al., 2022). It is composed of
152  6 · Introduction to the Immune System and the Inflammatory Response

     various cells, tissues, and organs. These components work in harmony to identify, neutralize, and eliminate foreign
     invaders by distinguishing between self and non-self and recognizing specific patterns found on the surface of a
     pathogen.

     There are two main branches of the immune system: the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system
     (as seen in Figure 6.2). The innate immune system provides the first line of defense and is always "on." It acts
     rapidly upon encountering pathogens (Justiz-Vaillant et al., 2022). It includes physical barriers like the skin, hair,
     and mucous membranes as well as certain white blood cells, such as basophils, mast cells, monocytes, neutrophils,
     and macrophages, that respond quickly to infections.

     When a pathogen breaches the innate defenses, the adaptive immune system (also known as the acquired immune
     system) comes into play to control infection. It is more specific to pathogens, has memory, and develops over time,
     through either encountering a pathogen or receiving a vaccination (Justiz-Vaillant et al., 2022).

     FIGURE 6.2 This image illustrates the cooperation between the innate and the adaptive immune systems in response to pathogens. The
     innate immune system enhances adaptive immune responses so they can be more effective. (credit: modification of work from Anatomy
     and Physiology 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

     The adaptive immune system relies on white blood cells called T and B lymphocytes. T cells produce a cell-
     mediated immune response, and B cells produce the humoral immune response (as seen in Figure 6.3). These
     immune responses will be discussed in more detail in the subsequent sections.

Antibody Mediated/Humoral Immunity

Antibody mediated/humoral immunity is a type of immune response that primarily involves B cells and their
production of antibodies (Karagiannis & Arnold, 2022). When an antigen, such as a pathogen, foreign substance, or
vaccination, enters the body, B cells recognize it and become activated (see Figure 6.3). These activated B cells then
undergo differentiation and proliferation to form plasma cells, which are specialized factories for producing
antibodies. The production of antibodies increases over time, reaching peak levels within 1 to 2 weeks after the
initial encounter with the antigen. During the immune response, some B cells undergo differentiation into memory B
cells. These cells remain in the body even after the antigen has been cleared. Memory B cells remember the
encountered antigen and can rapidly initiate a strong response if the same antigen is encountered again in the
future.

Cell-Mediated Immunity

Cell-mediated immunity is an immune response that involves T cells, specifically helper T cells (CD4 cells) and
cytotoxic T cells (CD8 cells). This clusters of differentiation (CD) system is a way to classify and characterize
different immune cell types based on the presence of specific surface markers, and this system is particularly
relevant when distinguishing subsets of T helper cells, like CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. When an antigen is presented to
T cells, helper T cells become activated and play a central role in coordinating the immune response (see Figure
6.3). They release chemical signals (cytokines) that stimulate the proliferation and activation of other immune cells,
including cytotoxic T cells and B cells.

Cytotoxic T cells recognize cells that display foreign antigens on their surface, such as virus-infected cells or cancer
cells. Cytotoxic T cells release toxic substances that attack and kill infected or abnormal cells, effectively eliminating
the cells.

Antigen-Antibody Interactions

Antigen-antibody interactions are essential for the functioning of both innate and adaptive immune responses. They
help in the identification and elimination of harmful invaders as well as in the establishment of immune memory,
allowing the body to mount a more rapid and efficient response upon subsequent exposure to the same antigen.
This process forms the basis for vaccination, where the body is exposed to harmless versions of antigens to develop
immunity without experiencing severe symptoms of the disease.

Antigen-antibody interactions are fundamental processes in the immune response that play a crucial role in
154  6 · Introduction to the Immune System and the Inflammatory Response

     defending the body against infections and foreign substances (Karagiannis & Arnold, 2022). An antigen is a
     molecule or molecular structure, typically a protein or polysaccharide, that is recognized by the immune system as
     foreign or non-self. It can be present on the surface of pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, or parasites as well as
     on non-pathogenic substances like pollen or certain foods.

     Antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins (Ig), are Y-shaped proteins produced by B cells in response to the
     presence of antigens (Aziz et al., 2023). Each antibody is specifically designed to recognize and bind to a particular
     antigen, much like a lock-and-key mechanism. The region of the antibody that binds to the antigen is called the
     antigen-binding site or paratope (Justiz-Vaillant et al., 2023; Greenspan, 2023).

     When an antigen enters the body, it triggers the immune system to mount a response. B cells detect the antigen and
     start producing antibodies that specifically match its molecular structure. The process of antibody production and
     maturation takes a few days to weeks, but once antibodies are generated, they remain in the body as part of the
     immune memory.

     The binding of antibodies to antigens is highly specific. When an antibody encounters its target antigen, it attaches
     to it, forming an antigen-antibody complex. This binding serves various purposes:

         · Neutralization: Antibodies can neutralize pathogens or toxins by blocking their ability to infect cells or exert
             harmful effects.

         · Opsonization: Antibodies can coat pathogens, facilitating their recognition and uptake by phagocytic cells like
             macrophages and neutrophils, leading to their destruction (Thau et al., 2023).

         · Agglutination: Antibodies can bind to multiple antigens on the surface of pathogens, clumping them together
             and making it easier for phagocytes to engulf and clear them.

         · Activation of complement: Antibodies can activate the complement system, a group of proteins that can lead
             to the destruction of pathogens through various mechanisms. Complement proteins interact like a chain
             reaction where one step leads to the next, creating a powerful response to invaders. This reaction is also
            known as a complement cascade (Bardhan & Kushik, 2023).

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 6.2.1 Define immunity.
         · 6.2.2 Differentiate between natural and active acquired immunity.
         · 6.2.3 Describe the difference between active and passive immunity.
         · 6.2.4 Explain the importance of vaccination in the immunity process.

         · 6.2.8 Describe nursing implications related to vaccines and immunizations.
         · 6.2.9 Explain the client education related to vaccines and immunizations.

     Vaccine-preventable diseases are infectious illnesses caused by viruses or bacteria that can be effectively
     prevented using vaccines, which stimulate the immune system to develop specific immunity against these
     pathogens (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2023a). Vaccines are biological preparations
     containing weakened or inactivated pathogens or their components, prompting the body to produce protective
     antibodies and memory cells. Immunizations involve administering vaccines to clients, providing them with the
     necessary immunity to ward off specific diseases, thus reducing the risk of infection and its potential severe
     consequences while contributing to vital public health efforts to control and eradicate these preventable diseases.

     Immunity

     Immunity is the ability of an organism to resist or defend against harmful pathogens such as microorganisms or
     toxic substances (CDC, 2023a). It is an essential defense mechanism that helps protect the body from infections
     and diseases. There are different types of immunity, including natural, active acquired, active, and passive immunity,
     which are discussed below.

Natural Immunity
Natural immunity, also known as innate immunity, is the inborn resistance to certain diseases that a client
possesses without prior exposure to the causative agent. This type of immunity is non-specific, meaning it provides
a general defense against a wide range of pathogens. Natural immunity is the first line of defense and includes
physical barriers (e.g., skin), chemical barriers (e.g., stomach acid), and cellular responses (e.g., macrophages and
natural killer cells).

Acquired Immunity
An acquired immunity is the immunity that develops after exposure to a foreign antigen. The immune system
recognizes the antigen as foreign, and a specific response is generated to target and eliminate it. This type of
immunity is long lasting and involves the production of memory B cells, which "remember" the encountered antigen
and can mount a faster and stronger response upon subsequent exposures (Grubbs & Kahwaji, 2022). Active
acquired immunity can be achieved through two main ways:

    · Naturally acquired active immunity: This occurs when a client is exposed to a pathogen in the environment
        and develops immunity as a result. For example, getting infected with a virus and recovering from the infection
        leads to natural active acquired immunity.

    · Artificially acquired active immunity: This type of immunity is induced through vaccination. Vaccines contain
        weakened or inactivated forms of pathogens or their components, which stimulate the immune system to
        produce a response without causing the actual disease. The immune system then develops memory cells to
        provide protection against future infections by the same pathogen.

Active Immunity
Active immunity, in a broad sense, refers to immunity that is generated by the body's immune system actively
responding to a foreign antigen. It encompasses both natural and active acquired immunity. This type of immunity
enables a rapid and potent response upon subsequent exposures to the same pathogen.

Passive Immunity
Passive immunity is the temporary protection against a specific pathogen that is conferred to a client by receiving
pre-formed antibodies rather than producing them internally (Slifka & Amanna, 2018). Unlike active immunity,
passive immunity does not involve the production of memory B cells, and the protection is short-lived. Passive
immunity can be acquired through two main ways:

    · Natural passive immunity: This occurs when antibodies are passed from a pregnant person to the fetus
        through the placenta during pregnancy or through breast milk during breastfeeding. These antibodies provide
        the newborn with some protection during the early stages of life until their own immune system matures.

    · Artificial passive immunity: This type of immunity is achieved by administering pre-formed (synthetic or
        pooled from donors) antibodies obtained from another individual or animal. For example, in certain medical
        situations, such as treating some viral infections or providing immediate protection against specific diseases,
        purified antibodies can be given as a treatment. The protection offered by artificial passive immunity
        diminishes as the administered antibodies are gradually cleared from the body.

Vaccines and Immunizations

Vaccines and immunizations are related concepts, but they differ in their scope and application. Vaccines are
biological substances designed to stimulate the immune system and generate a protective response against specific
pathogens (CDC, 2023a). They can be composed of weakened or inactivated forms of the disease-causing agent
(virus, bacteria, or toxin) or subunits of the pathogen. When administered, vaccines prompt the immune system to
recognize the antigens present in the vaccine and produce antibodies, memory cells, and other immune responses.
These immune responses prepare the body to defend against future infections by the actual pathogen.

Immunization is the process of administering vaccines to clients, aiming to establish immunity against certain
diseases (CDC, 2023a). It is a preventive measure to protect clients from infections, especially those that can cause
severe illness, disability, or death. Through immunizations, clients build immunity without experiencing the full-
blown disease, which reduces the risk of infection and contributes to public health by controlling the spread of
disease.
156  6 · Introduction to the Immune System and the Inflammatory Response

     Vaccines employ various mechanisms of action, and there are different types including:

         · Live attenuated vaccines: These vaccines contain weakened but live forms of the pathogen. These weakened
             strains can still replicate within the body but are rendered less virulent, so they do not cause the disease in
             healthy individuals. Examples of live attenuated vaccines include the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine
             and the oral polio vaccine (OPV). These vaccines generally provide long-lasting immunity with a single or few
             doses.

         · Inactivated vaccines: These vaccines contain killed versions of the pathogen, meaning the virus or bacteria
             have been rendered nonfunctional and cannot replicate. As a result, they do not cause disease in recipients.
             Inactivated vaccines often require multiple doses or booster shots to build and maintain immunity. Examples
             of inactivated vaccines include the hepatitis A vaccine and the injectable polio vaccine (IPV).

         · Subunit, recombinant, and conjugate vaccines: These vaccines contain only specific antigens or parts of the
             pathogen rather than the whole microorganism. Recombinant vaccines use genetically engineered antigens to
             trigger an immune response. Conjugate vaccines combine a weak antigen with a strong antigen to enhance the
             immune response, especially in young children. Examples of subunit, recombinant, and conjugate vaccines
             include the hepatitis B vaccine, human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, and some meningococcal vaccines.

         · mRNA vaccines: These vaccines do not contain any live or inactivated virus or bacteria. Instead, mRNA
             vaccines contain genetic instructions (mRNA) that instruct the cells in the body to produce a specific viral or
             bacterial protein. This protein then triggers an immune response, leading to the production of antibodies and
             memory cells. mRNA vaccines, like the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, have shown high
             efficacy and can be developed more rapidly than traditional vaccines.

     Not only do vaccines and immunizations protect clients, but they also play a role in herd immunity. Herd immunity
     is a state where a significant portion of a population becomes immune to a specific infectious disease through
     vaccination or previous exposure (McDermott, 2021). Herd immunity works as a barrier against the transmission of
     the disease because the pathogen has fewer susceptible individuals to infect. The threshold required for achieving
     herd immunity depends on the contagiousness of the disease. For highly contagious infections like measles, a large
     proportion (around 95%) of the population needs to be immune to prevent outbreaks. For less contagious diseases,
     the threshold may be lower. Therefore, herd immunity is a crucial aspect of public health strategies and vaccination
     campaigns.

     Vaccine hesitancy is a concerning issue and refers to the delay or refusal of vaccination despite its availability (Shen
     & Dubey, 2019). It is driven by factors like safety concerns, distrust in vaccines or health care providers, and
     misinformation. Vaccine hesitancy poses a public health challenge, as it can lead to outbreaks of preventable
     diseases. Addressing it requires evidence-based communication, education, and building trust to promote
     vaccination and protect public health.

          SAFETY ALERT

      Vaccines and Immunizations

       The CDC and FDA monitor the safety of vaccines after they are approved. If a problem is found with a vaccine, the
       CDC and FDA will inform health officials, health care providers, and the public through the Global Rapid Response
       Team (GRRT) (https://openstax.org/r/cdcgovgloba) and through public health announcements and
       communications.

     Vaccine-Preventable Diseases
     Vaccine-preventable diseases (CDC, 2023a) are illnesses that can be avoided through vaccination. Some common
     vaccine-preventable diseases include measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis, polio, hepatitis A and B, varicella, human
     papillomavirus (HPV), pneumonia, and influenza. Vaccination against these diseases is a crucial public health
     measure that not only protects clients but also helps to establish herd immunity, reducing the overall prevalence
     and transmission of these infectious agents within communities.

     Vaccine Recommendations
     Vaccines are an important tool to prevent the spread of infectious diseases and protect public health. The World
     Health Organization (WHO, 2021; CDC, 2021) recommends routine vaccination for children against several diseases

such as measles, polio, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), and hepatitis B. Vaccination is also
recommended for adults against influenza, pneumococcal disease, shingles, COVID-19, and other illnesses
depending on their age, health status, occupation, travel plans, and other factors.

Vaccines have guidelines on immunization schedules for different age groups and populations based on scientific
evidence and expert opinion (see Table 6.1). It is important to follow these recommendations to ensure that clients
receive the appropriate vaccines at the right time and in the correct doses.

Some vaccines, such as hepatitis A and B vaccines, varicella vaccine, and MMR vaccine, require titers to assess
immunity levels. A titer is a blood test that measures the level of antibodies against the virus in the bloodstream.
Checking titers after completing the vaccination or the vaccination series helps to determine if a client has
developed sufficient immunity to the virus. A positive titer indicates protective antibodies are present in the body,
and the client is considered immune. If the titer is negative or below the protective level, a booster dose of the
vaccine may be recommended to enhance immunity. Titers are drawn at different intervals depending on the
vaccine, when vaccinated, and the client's need.

Table 6.1 provides additional information on common recommended vaccines and illustrates their indications,
routes, and dosing for pediatric and adult clients.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Vaccines are generally safe and effective in preventing infectious diseases (CDC, 2023b). However, like any medical
     intervention, they can have adverse effects. It is important to remember that the benefits of vaccination far
     outweigh the risks for most people. Vaccine adverse effects commonly involve local and systemic reactions.

     Local reactions including tenderness, erythema, induration, and swelling at injection site. Systemic reactions include
     fever, irritability, drowsiness, anorexia, and vomiting. Other reactions include anaphylactic reactions, such as
     urticaria and angioedema, as well as nervous system reactions such as convulsions and syncope.

     Contraindications to vaccines include hypersensitivity to the vaccine or any of its constituents.

     International Travel Considerations
     When planning international travel, it is important for clients to consider the possible health risks and ensure all
     vaccinations are up to date. Vaccines protect against many infectious diseases such as typhoid, yellow fever,
     hepatitis A and B, meningitis, measles, mumps, rubella, and polio (WHO, n.d.). Some countries may require proof of
     certain vaccinations for entry. Clients should allow enough time for multiple doses or immunity to develop. An
     International Certificate of Vaccination may be required by clients traveling abroad.

     Clients should consider personal health factors and consult a health care provider before getting vaccinated.

borne diseases assists in decreasing risk factors for diseases. It is essential for clients to plan and prioritize
immunizations to ensure a safe and healthy travel experience. Consulting a travel health specialist can provide
valuable guidance.

     CLINICAL TIP

 Vaccine Administration

  Administration of vaccinations should follow appropriate precautions to minimize risk for disease exposure and
  spread. The nurse should cleanse their hands with an alcohol-based waterless antiseptic hand rub or wash them
  with soap and water before preparing vaccines for administration and between each client contact. The nurse
  should draw up vaccines in a designated clean medication area that is not adjacent to areas where potentially
  contaminated items are placed. Multi-dose vials to be used for more than one client should not be kept or
  accessed in the immediate client treatment area.

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking vaccines:

    · Review the client's medical history and immunization record to assess for allergies and previous vaccinations
        to identify any contraindications or precautions for the specific vaccine being administered.

    · Educate the client about the vaccine's purpose, potential side effects, and benefits to help the client make an
        informed decision and reduce vaccine hesitancy.

    · Confirm informed consent from the client or their legal guardian before administering the vaccine.
    · Check the vaccine's storage and handling to verify that the vaccine has been stored at the appropriate

        temperature and that it is within the expiration date to maintain its potency and efficacy.
    · Prepare and administer the vaccine safely following the guidelines for the vaccine, including the appropriate

        route, dosage, and injection site. Proper aseptic technique should be maintained throughout the procedure to
        prevent infections and ensure client safety.
    · Provide client teaching regarding vaccines and when to call the health care provider. See below for client
        teaching guidelines.

  CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

  The client receiving a vaccine should:

      · Discuss their medical history with the health care provider and discuss the vaccine prior to immunization.
      · Report any reaction caused by the vaccine to the health care provider including local reactions such as

          tenderness, erythema, and swelling at the injection site; systemic reactions such as fever, irritability,
          drowsiness, and vomiting; anaphylactic reactions such as urticaria and angioedema; and CNS reactions
          such as convulsions and syncope.
      · Ask questions, seek clarification, and fully understand the information provided before giving their consent
          for vaccination.

  The client receiving a vaccine should not:

      · Withhold information about their medical history or any known allergies to vaccine components.
      · Rush through informed consent.
      · Disregard post-vaccination care instructions, as these guidelines can help manage potential side effects

          and ensure a smooth recovery after vaccination.
162  6 · Introduction to the Immune System and the Inflammatory Response

     6.3 Immunosuppressants, Biologics, Monoclonal Antibodies, and Biosimilar
     Drugs

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 6.3.1 Identify the characteristics of immunosuppressants, biologics, monoclonal antibodies, and
             biosimilar drugs.

         · 6.3.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions for immunosuppressant,
             biologics, monoclonal antibodies, and biosimilar drugs.

         · 6.3.3 Describe the nursing implications related to immunosuppressants, biologics, monoclonal
             antibodies, and biosimilar drugs.

         · 6.3.4 Explain the client education related to immunosuppressants, biologics, monoclonal antibodies, and
             biosimilar drugs.

     This section of the chapter will delve into the realm of therapeutic agents used to manage various autoimmune
     diseases and conditions. Immunosuppressants are drugs that suppress the immune system, helping to prevent
     organ rejection in transplant recipients and manage autoimmune disorders. Biologic drugs, including monoclonal
     antibodies, represent a class of medications derived from living organisms that target specific molecules or cells
     involved in autoimmune processes, offering highly targeted and personalized treatment options. Biosimilar drugs,
     which are biologic medications designed to be highly similar to already approved biologics, provide cost-effective
     alternatives with comparable efficacy and safety profiles.

     Immunosuppressant Drugs

     Immunosuppressant is a class of medicines that inhibit or decrease the intensity of the immune response in the
     body. They are commonly prescribed to clients who have received an organ transplant and those with autoimmune
     disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. While these medications can effectively
     prevent rejection of transplanted organs and manage symptoms of autoimmune diseases, they also come with
     potential adverse effects. Clients taking immunosuppressants may be at higher risk for infections, including
     opportunistic infections that can be life-threatening.

     It is important for clients who are taking immunosuppressant drugs to work closely with their health care provider to
     monitor any potential side effects and receive regular follow-ups. Additionally, steps should be taken to minimize
     the risk of infection, such as practicing good hygiene and avoiding close contact with sick clients. Overall, while
     immunosuppressant drugs can be beneficial in certain medical conditions, it is important for clients to weigh the
     potential benefits against the risks and work closely with their health care provider to ensure safe and effective use.

     Glucocorticoids
     Glucocorticoids are a steroid hormone produced by the kidneys' adrenal cortexes that regulate metabolism and the
     immune system. They have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, making them essential in treating
     inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Commonly used synthetic glucocorticoids include prednisone and
     dexamethasone. Glucocorticoids are typically reserved for short-term or last-resort use due to potential toxic
     effects. Careful tapering is necessary to address potential rebound symptoms resulting from prolonged use (see
     Table 6.2 for dosing information and Hypothalamus, Pituitary, and Adrenal Disorder Drugs for additional information
     on glucocorticoids).

     Azathioprine
     Azathioprine is an immunosuppressant used to treat autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.
     Azathioprine works by suppressing the immune system, reducing inflammation, and preventing tissue damage.
     Long-term use has been associated with an increased risk of certain types of cancer. Regular blood tests, such as a
     complete blood cell count to detect bone marrow suppression or infection, liver function tests to ensure no
     abnormal liver function is occurring, and serum creatinine to assess proper kidney function, may also be necessary
     to ensure that the medication is not causing any adverse or harmful effects on the body. See Table 6.3 for additional

rejection in clients who have undergone organ transplantation, such as kidney, heart, or liver transplants. It works by
inhibiting the proliferation of T and B immune cells, thus suppressing the immune system's response against the
transplanted organs. Mycophenolic acid is commonly used in combination with other immunosuppressants to
maintain the function of the transplanted organ and prevent rejection episodes.

Table 6.2 lists common immunosuppressants and typical routes and dosing for adult and pediatric clients.

Drug           Routes and Dosage Ranges

Prednisone     Dosage requirements are variable and individualized based on disease and response of the
               client; 5-60 mg orally daily.
               In situations of less severity, lower doses will generally suffice, while in select clients, higher
               initial doses may be required.

Dexamethasone  Dosage requirements are variable and individualized based on disease and response of the
   (Decadron)  client; 0.75-9 mg orally daily.

               For rheumatoid arthritis: 1 mg/kg (50-100 mg) orally given as a single dose or twice daily.

               The dose may be increased, beginning at 6-8 weeks and thereafter in 4-week intervals.

Azathioprine   Increments should be 0.5 mg/kg orally daily, up to a maximum dose of 2.5 mg/kg orally per

     Azathioprine

     The use of azathioprine increases the risk of malignancy in humans, including post-transplant lymphoma and
     hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma.

     Mycophenolic Acid

     The use of mycophenolic acid increases the risk of fetal toxicity (resulting in pregnancy loss or congenital
     malformations), malignancies (lymphomas and skin), and susceptibility to bacterial, viral, fungal, protozoal, and
     opportunistic infections.

     Biologic Drugs and Monoclonal Antibodies

     Biologic drugs, also known as biologics, are a class of medications derived from living sources such as cells,
     proteins, or tissues. They are used to treat various medical conditions, particularly autoimmune rheumatic diseases,

            6.3 · Immunosuppressants, Biologics, Monoclonal Antibodies, and Biosimilar Drugs                               165

and certain types of cancer (American Cancer Society, 2018; Drosos et al., 2021). Biologics are different from
traditional chemical-based drugs because of their complex structure and the process used to manufacture them,
which involves biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques.

Monoclonal antibodies are a type of biologic drug. They are engineered in the laboratory to target and bind to
specific molecules or cells in the body, thus exerting precise and targeted effects (American Cancer Society, 2018).
Monoclonal antibodies are designed to mimic the immune system's natural ability to recognize and attack foreign
invaders, such as bacteria, viruses, and cancer cells. These antibodies can be used to block certain pathways
involved in disease processes, modulate immune responses, or deliver drugs directly to specific cells or tissues.

Both biologic drugs and monoclonal antibodies have revolutionized the treatment of various medical conditions,
providing more personalized and effective therapeutic options for clients with complex and difficult-to-treat
diseases. However, due to their complex manufacturing process and targeted actions, these medications can be
relatively expensive compared to traditional drugs. Additionally, some clients may experience immune-related side
effects, and close monitoring is often required during treatment.

Adalimumab
Adalimumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets and inhibits the action of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-
alpha), a cytokine involved in inflammation. By blocking TNF-alpha, adalimumab reduces inflammation and
alleviates symptoms associated with various autoimmune diseases. See Table 6.4 for dosing information.

Etanercept
Etanercept is another TNF inhibitor that acts as a soluble TNF receptor, binding to and neutralizing TNF-alpha. Like
adalimumab, etanercept dampens the inflammatory response and provides relief from autoimmune-related
inflammation. See Table 6.5 for additional information.

Infliximab
Infliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets TNF-alpha, effectively neutralizing its activity. Infliximab is
often used in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and
inflammatory bowel diseases to manage inflammation and improve quality of life. See Table 6.4 for dosing
information.

Rituximab
Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets a specific protein known as CD20 found on the surface of B cells. It
is primarily used to treat certain types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Rituximab
works by binding to CD20-positive B cells, leading to the destruction and reduction in cancerous cell growth. It is
also used to treat certain autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. See
Table 6.4 for dosing information.

Bevacizumab
Bevacizumab (Avastin) is a monoclonal antibody that targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). It is used to
treat various types of cancer, including colorectal cancer, lung cancer, kidney cancer, and glioblastoma multiforme (a
type of brain tumor). By inhibiting VEGF, bevacizumab disrupts the formation of new blood vessels that tumors need
to grow and spread, ultimately slowing down tumor growth and improving outcomes.

Table 6.4 lists common biologic drugs and monoclonal antibodies and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

Biologics and Monoclonal Antibodies

Biologic drugs and monoclonal antibodies increase the risk for infections including active tuberculosis and
invasive fungal infections as well as bacterial, viral, and other opportunistic infections. They also can increase
the risk for certain cancers including lymphomas, melanoma, non-melanoma skin cancer, and Merkel cell
carcinoma.

Biosimilar Drugs

Biosimilar drugs are a type of biologic medication that is highly similar to an already approved reference biologic,
also known as the original biologic or reference product. Biosimilars are designed to have similar efficacy, safety,
and quality as the reference product (American Cancer Society, 2018; U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2023).
168  6 · Introduction to the Immune System and the Inflammatory Response

     They are developed to be equivalent in terms of structure, biological activity, and clinical effects.

     Unlike generic versions of traditional chemical-based drugs, which are identical to their reference products,
     biosimilars are not exact copies due to the complexity of biologics and the variability in the manufacturing process.
     Biosimilars undergo rigorous testing and comparison to the reference product to ensure they are highly similar and
     have no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety and efficacy.

     Biosimilars offer an opportunity to increase access to effective biologic treatments at potentially lower costs
     compared to the reference products. They play a crucial role in promoting competition and driving down prices,
     making biologic therapies more affordable for clients and health care systems.

     Regulatory authorities, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have established robust guidelines for
     the approval of biosimilars, ensuring they meet stringent standards for quality, safety, and efficacy (American
     Cancer Society, 2018). This regulatory framework ensures that clients can have confidence in the safety and
     effectiveness of biosimilar medications.

     Pegfilgrastim
     Pegfilgrastim is a medication used to reduce the risk of infection in clients undergoing certain cancer treatments,
     such as chemotherapy, that may cause a decrease in the body's white blood cell count. It is a long-acting form of
     filgrastim, a synthetic version of a natural protein called granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF).

     Pegfilgrastim stimulates the bone marrow to increase white blood cell production, particularly neutrophils, which
     are essential for fighting infections. By increasing the white blood cell count, pegfilgrastim helps to reduce the
     likelihood of severe infections during cancer treatment. See Table 6.7 for additional information.

     Table 6.6 lists common biosimilar drugs along with the typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

Nursing Implications

The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking immunosuppressants, biologics, monoclonal
antibodies, and biosimilar drugs:

· Review the client's medical history to assess allergies and contraindications or potential drug interactions with
   current medications.

· Monitor complete blood counts for leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia; liver function tests for
   hepatotoxicity; renal functions tests for nephrotoxicity; and lipids for elevated lipid levels.

· Evaluate the client's tuberculosis (TB) status prior to administering biologic drugs, as they can increase the
   risk of reactivating latent tuberculosis.

· Educate the client about the drug's purpose, potential side effects, and benefits to help the client make an
   informed decision about the treatment plan.

· Ensure proper administration technique including the appropriate route, dosage, and injection site. Maintain
   proper aseptic technique throughout the procedure to prevent infections and ensure client safety.

· After administration, closely monitor the client for any immediate adverse reactions, such as allergic
   responses or infusion-related reactions. Vital signs, signs of infection, and changes in the client's condition

           · Keep a journal of symptoms and note improved or worsening symptoms.
           · Practice good hygiene and avoid contact with sick individuals to decrease the risk of infection.
           · Report symptoms of fever, chills, sore throat, and skin rash to the health care provider because these may

               indicate an adverse reaction to the drug.
           · Attend all appointments, undergo recommended blood tests, and report any changes or concerns to the

               health care provider.

       The client taking an immunosuppressant, biologic drug, monoclonal antibody, or biosimilar drug should
       not:

           · Dispose of needles or sharps container in the household trash.
           · Reuse needles.
           · Stop taking the drug unless directed by the health care provider.
           · Get a live vaccine such as measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) or oral polio vaccine (OPV), as this

               increases the risk of developing the disease from the immunization.

     Inflammation, the body's complex response to harmful stimuli, plays an important role in the immune system's
     defense against injury and infection. This section of the chapter explores mechanisms for inflammation and drugs
     used to treat inflammation.

     Inflammation

     Inflammation is a fundamental biological response that the body activates in response to harmful stimuli, such as
     pathogens, tissue injury, or irritants. It is a crucial part of the immune system's defense mechanism, designed to
     protect the body and initiate the healing process. Inflammation involves a series of intricate events and interactions
     among cells, chemicals, and blood vessels. When tissues are damaged or infected, various immune cells are
     recruited to the site of injury or infection (Chen et al., 2018; Hannoodee & Nasuruddin, 2022). The key players in the
     inflammatory response include:

         · Mast cells: These cells are present in connective tissues and release substances such as histamine, which
             trigger blood vessels to dilate and become more permeable, leading to increased blood flow and leakage of
             fluid into the affected area.

         · White blood cells (leukocytes): Neutrophils and macrophages are the primary types of leukocytes involved in
             the inflammatory response. They migrate to the site of injury or infection to engulf and destroy invading
             pathogens and damaged cells.

         · Cytokines: These are signaling molecules that help regulate the immune response and mediate
             communication between different cells. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor
             necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-), play a central role in initiating and amplifying the inflammatory process.

         · Chemokines: These are a subgroup of cytokines that attract immune cells to the site of inflammation,

        promoting their migration and recruitment (Chen et al., 2018; Hannoodee & Nasuruddin, 2022; Patel &
        Mohiuddin, 2023).

There are five cardinal signs of inflammation that were first described by the Roman encyclopedist Celsus in the 1st
century AD and are still widely recognized as classic indicators of an inflammatory response in the body (Cavaillon,
2021). These are (Chen et al., 2018; Hannoodee & Nasuruddin, 2022):

    · Redness (rubor): The affected area becomes red due to increased blood flow and dilation of blood vessels in
        response to inflammation.

    · Swelling (tumor): Swelling occurs as fluid and immune cells accumulate at the site of inflammation.
    · Heat (calor): Inflammation leads to increased blood flow and metabolic activity in the affected area, resulting

        in elevated temperature and warmth.
    · Pain (dolor): Inflammatory mediators sensitize nerve endings in the affected region, leading to pain.
    · Loss of function (functio laesa): In more severe cases of inflammation, the affected area may lose some or all

        of its normal function. This can occur due to the damage caused by the inflammation or the body's protective
        response to limit further harm.

Pathophysiology
The body's inflammatory response is a complex and coordinated reaction aimed at defending against harmful
stimuli and promoting tissue repair (Hannoodee & Nasuruddin, 2022). When tissues are damaged, injured, or
infected, various immune cells and chemical mediators work together to initiate and regulate the inflammatory
process. The response can be triggered by various factors, including pathogens (e.g., bacteria, viruses), physical
injury, toxins, or autoimmune reactions. The inflammatory response (see Figure 6.4) presents as follows:

    · Recognition of harmful stimuli: The process begins when the body detects a threat, such as a pathogen or
        tissue injury. Immune cells, particularly macrophages, recognize these harmful stimuli through pattern
        recognition receptors.

    · Release of chemical mediators: Upon recognition of the threat, immune cells release signaling molecules
        called cytokines, such as interleukins and TNF-, which trigger the cascade of events that lead to
        inflammation.

    · Vasodilation: Cytokines and other chemical mediators cause blood vessels in the affected area to dilate,
        leading to increased blood flow and allowing more immune cells, antibodies, and nutrients to reach the site of
        injury or infection.

    · Increased vascular permeability: The cytokines increase the permeability of blood vessel walls, leading to the
        leakage of fluid and proteins into the surrounding tissues, which contributes to the swelling, redness, and
        warmth.

    · Migration of immune cells: Chemokines attract immune cells, particularly neutrophils and monocytes.
    · Phagocytosis and immune response: Neutrophils and macrophages engulf and destroy invading pathogens,

        dead cells, and debris through a process called phagocytosis. This helps contain the infection and clear away
        damaged tissues.
    · Activation of the adaptive immune system: As the inflammatory response progresses, dendritic cells, another
        type of immune cell, process and present antigens from the pathogens to T and B lymphocytes. This leads to
        the activation of the adaptive immune system, which provides a more specific and targeted response to
        infection.
    · Resolution and tissue repair: As the threat is neutralized and the tissue damage begins to heal, the body
        releases anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-10 (IL-10), which promote the resolution of
        inflammation. Immune cells shift their focus to tissue repair and regeneration.
172  6 · Introduction to the Immune System and the Inflammatory Response

     recruitment of phagocytes. (credit: modification of work from Anatomy and Physiology 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax,

     The inflammatory response is a highly regulated process that aims to eliminate the threat, initiate healing, and
     restore tissue function. However, an exaggerated or dysregulated inflammatory response can lead to chronic
     inflammation and contribute to various diseases. Anti-inflammatory drugs are used to control and modulate this
     response, providing relief and preventing further tissue damage in certain conditions.

     Etiology and Diagnostic Testing
     Factors that trigger the inflammatory response in the body can arise from various sources, including infections
     (bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic), physical injury to tissue (trauma, burns), autoimmune disorders (rheumatoid
     arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus), allergic reactions, irritants, and chronic conditions such as chronic
     obstructive pulmonary disorders (COPD) and peripheral vascular disorders (PVD).

     Diagnostic and lab studies are essential for diagnosing and assessing inflammation. Some common tests and
     investigations include:

         · Complete blood count (CBC) with differential: This test provides information about the number and types of
             blood cells, including white blood cells (WBCs). An increased WBC count, particularly neutrophils, can indicate
             an inflammatory response.

         · C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR): These blood tests measure markers of
             inflammation. Elevated levels of CRP or an accelerated ESR suggest the presence of inflammation in the body.

         · Blood cultures: If an infection is suspected as the cause of inflammation, blood cultures may be performed to
             identify the specific microorganism responsible.

         · Imaging studies: X-rays, ultrasounds, CT scans, or MRIs can help visualize inflamed tissues and identify the
             extent of inflammation or structural damage.

         · Biopsy: In some cases, a tissue sample may be obtained through a biopsy to determine the cause and severity
             of inflammation.

         · Autoantibody testing: For suspected autoimmune disorders, specific autoantibody tests can be conducted to
             identify abnormal immune responses against the body's own tissues.

         · Allergy testing: In cases of allergic inflammation, skin tests or blood tests can help identify specific allergens
             responsible for the allergic response.

     The combination of clinical evaluation, medical history, and appropriate diagnostic tests helps health care providers
     diagnose the presence of inflammation, identify its underlying cause, and develop an effective treatment plan to
     address the condition.

Inflammation versus Infection

Inflammation and infection are related but distinct concepts in the context of the body's response to harmful
stimuli. Inflammation is a general physiological response of the body to tissue injury, irritation, or foreign
substances. It is a part of the body's immune defense mechanism and plays a vital role in protecting and healing
tissues. Inflammation can be triggered by various factors, such as physical injury, exposure to irritants, autoimmune
reactions, or the presence of pathogens like bacteria or viruses. When tissues are damaged or perceived to be under
threat, immune cells and chemical mediators are recruited to the affected site, leading to the characteristic
symptoms of inflammation, including redness, swelling, heat, and pain. The inflammatory response aims to
eliminate the source of injury or infection, clear away damaged cells and debris, and initiate tissue repair (Chen et
al., 2018; Hannoodee & Nasuruddin, 2022).

Infection, on the other hand, specifically refers to the invasion and colonization of the body by harmful
microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, or other microbes (CDC, 2016). When pathogens enter the body, they can
multiply and cause damage to tissues, leading to illness. Infections can occur in various parts of the body, such as
the respiratory tract, urinary tract, gastrointestinal system, or bloodstream. The body responds to infections by
initiating an inflammatory response as part of its immune defense mechanism. Infections may or may not cause
obvious symptoms of inflammation, depending on the type and location of the infection and the client's immune
response. While not all inflammation is caused by infections, infections frequently lead to an inflammatory
response.

Anti-inflammatory Drugs

Anti-inflammatory drugs are a classification of drugs used to reduce inflammation, relieve pain, and alleviate fever
(Ghlichloo & Gerriets, 2023). These drugs work by inhibiting the production of certain enzymes called
cyclooxygenase (COX), which are involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins, hormone like-substances that play a
role in the inflammatory response.

Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. COX-1 and COX-2 are
enzymes involved in the production of prostaglandins, which are signaling molecules that regulate inflammation and
various physiological processes. COX-1 is constitutively present in many tissues and plays a role in maintaining
normal bodily functions, such as protecting the stomach lining and regulating blood clotting. COX-2 is induced
during inflammation and is primarily responsible for generating prostaglandins that contribute to pain, inflammation,
and other responses associated with injury and inflammation. The inhibition of these enzymes helps to decrease
inflammation, pain, and fever. These drugs are for short-term use, and many can be found over the counter (OTC).
Several subclassifications of NSAIDs are explored in the subsequent sections.

Salicylates
Salicylates are a group of chemical compounds that contain a salicylate acid backbone. The most common and well-
known salicylate is acetylsalicylic acid, also known as aspirin. Salicylates can be found in various plants, including
fruits (such as berries), vegetables (such as spinach), and herbs (such as peppermint). Salicylates are commonly
used to alleviate pain, reduce inflammation, and lower fever, making them effective for various conditions, including
headaches, arthritis, and minor injuries. See Table 6.8 for dosing information and Pain Response Drugs for additional
information on salicylates.

Aspirin also has anti-platelet properties that are unrelated to its anti-inflammatory properties. At low doses, aspirin
irreversibly inhibits the enzyme cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) in platelets, which are specialized blood cells involved in
blood clotting, thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation and blood clot formation (see Anticoagulant, Antiplatelet, and
Thrombolytic Drugs for additional information on aspirin as an antiplatelet).

Phenylacetic Acid Derivatives
Phenylacetic acid derivatives are a class of chemical compounds that have a phenylacetic acid structure. These
derivatives are often found in medications and are used for various therapeutic purposes. Like salicylates,
phenylacetic acid derivatives inhibit the enzyme cyclooxygenase, thereby decreasing inflammation. They also act as
an antipyretic and analgesic to alleviate pain. Common phenylacetic acid derivatives include diclofenac and
indomethacin. See Table 6.8 for dosing information.
174  6 · Introduction to the Immune System and the Inflammatory Response

     Propionic Acid Derivatives
     Propionic acid derivatives have a propionic acid base in their chemical structure. They also inhibit the enzyme COX,
     thereby decreasing inflammation, relieving pain, and reducing fever. Common propionic acid derivatives include
     ibuprofen and naproxen sodium. See Table 6.8 for dosing information and Pain Response Drugs for additional
     information on these drugs.

     Oxicams
     Oxicams are a class of NSAIDs that share a common chemical structure called "oxicam." These drugs work by
     inhibiting the enzyme COX, thus decreasing the inflammatory response. Oxicams are used for their anti-
     inflammatory, analgesic (pain-relieving), and antipyretic (fever-reducing) properties, like other NSAIDs. Common
     oxicams include meloxicam and piroxicam. See Table 6.8 for dosing information.

     COX-2 Inhibitors
     COX-2 inhibitors are a specific class of NSAIDs that selectively target and inhibit the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)
     enzyme. This class of drugs was developed to provide pain relief and anti-inflammatory effects while minimizing
     some of the gastrointestinal side effects associated with traditional non-selective NSAIDs, which inhibit both COX-1
     and COX-2 enzymes. Celecoxib is the only COX-2 inhibitor on the market in the United States. See Table 6.9 for
     additional information.

     Table 6.8 lists common nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

NSAIDs

NSAIDs increase the risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and
stroke, which can be fatal. This risk may occur early in treatment and may increase with duration of use.

NSAIDs also increased the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and
perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. These events can occur at any time during use and
without warning symptoms. Older clients and clients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI
bleeding are at greater risk for serious GI events.
176  6 · Introduction to the Immune System and the Inflammatory Response

     Glucocorticoid Drugs

     Glucocorticoids, also known as corticosteroids or simply steroids, are a class of anti-inflammatory drugs that mimic
     the action of naturally occurring hormones produced by the adrenal glands. These hormones, specifically cortisol,
     play a crucial role in regulating the body's response to stress and inflammation. When used as medication, synthetic
     glucocorticoids have potent anti-inflammatory effects due to their ability to modify the immune response. See
     Immunosuppressants, Biologics, Monoclonal Antibodies, and Biosimilar Drugs and Hypothalamus, Pituitary, and
     Adrenal Disorder Drugs for drug information on glucocorticoids.

     Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs)

     Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are a class of medications used primarily to treat autoimmune
     and inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (Benjamin et al., 2022; Mysler et al., 2021). These drugs
     work by targeting specific components of the immune system to suppress the abnormal immune reaction
     responsible for causing inflammation and tissue damage.

     DMARDs have immunomodulatory effects, meaning they modify the immune response rather than just providing
     symptomatic relief. The main goal of DMARDs is to slow down or modify the underlying disease process, reduce joint
     damage, and improve long-term outcomes for clients with autoimmune diseases. They may take weeks to months
     to achieve the disease-modifying effects. DMARDs are usually prescribed for long-term use and are considered the
     ongoing management of autoimmune conditions.

     Conversely, non-DMARDs, such as NSAIDs and glucocorticoids, primarily provide symptomatic relief by reducing
     pain and inflammation. They do not alter the underlying disease process or the progression of the autoimmune
     condition. Non-DMARDs are often used for short-term and intermittent relief of acute symptoms, especially pain and
     inflammation. Non-DMARDs are often used in combination with DMARDs for comprehensive autoimmune disease
     management.

     DMARDs can include both biologics and non-biologic drugs (Mysler et al., 2021). The choice of DMARD depends on
     the specific condition being treated, disease severity, individual response, and potential side effects. Treatment
     decisions are made in consultation with a health care provider who will tailor the therapy to each client's unique
     needs and health status.

     Biologic DMARDs
     Biologic DMARDs are drugs derived from living cells or organisms. They are typically large, complex molecules
     produced through biotechnology processes. They target specific components of the immune system to suppress the
     abnormal immune response seen in autoimmune diseases. Biologic drugs such as adalimumab, etanercept,
     infliximab, and rituximab are discussed in Immunosuppressants, Biologics, Monoclonal Antibodies, and Biosimilar
     Drugs.

     Non-biologic DMARDs
     Non-biologic DMARDs, also known as conventional or synthetic DMARDs, are small-molecule drugs synthesized
     chemically. They are not derived from living sources and typically have a more general or broader mode of action.
     They may act on multiple targets within the immune system or inhibit enzymes that play a role in the inflammatory
     process. For example, methotrexate inhibits an enzyme involved in the synthesis of DNA and RNA, which affects
     rapidly dividing cells, including immune cells. Common non-biologic DMARDs include methotrexate, sulfasalazine,
     and gold salts. See Table 6.10 for dosing information and Table 6.11 for additional information on methotrexate.

     Table 6.10 lists common non-biologic DMARDs and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

     FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

     Methotrexate and Gold Salts

     Methotrexate can cause embryo-fetal toxicity, including fetal death. For non-neoplastic diseases, methotrexate
     tablets are contraindicated in pregnancy. For neoplastic diseases, advise clients of childbearing age of the
     potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception.

     Serious adverse reactions, including death, have been reported with methotrexate. Closely monitor for adverse
     reactions of the bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract, liver, lungs, skin, and kidneys. Withhold or discontinue
     methotrexate tablets as appropriate.

     Antimalarial Drugs

     Antimalarial drugs are a group of medications primarily used to treat and prevent malaria, a parasitic infection
     transmitted by mosquito bites. However, some antimalarial drugs have been found to have beneficial effects in the
     treatment of certain autoimmune diseases due to their immunomodulatory properties.

     The exact mechanisms of action of these drugs in autoimmune diseases are not fully understood, but they are
     believed to modulate the immune response by influencing the function of immune cells and cytokines involved in
     the inflammatory process (Haladyj et al., 2018). Therefore, they help to control disease activity by decreasing
     inflammation, slowing joint damage, and preserving joint function, reducing the frequency of flares and improving
     overall disease management.

     The two main antimalarial drugs used in autoimmune disease treatment are hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine.
     These drugs are known to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, which can help in managing
     autoimmune conditions.

     It is important to note that while antimalarial drugs can be beneficial for some clients with autoimmune diseases,
     not everyone responds the same way to these medications. The decision to suggest antimalarial drugs as part of the
     treatment plan is made by a health care professional, who considers the specific autoimmune condition, disease
     severity, individual response, and potential side effects.

     Hydroxychloroquine
     Hydroxychloroquine is the more commonly prescribed antimalarial drug for autoimmune disease treatment. It is
     used to manage conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
     Hydroxychloroquine works by interfering with the immune response and dampening the activity of certain immune
     cells. It can help reduce inflammation, slow disease progression, preserve joint function, and improve disease
     control in some clients with autoimmune disorders. See Table 6.13 for additional information on
     hydroxychloroquine.

     Chloroquine
     Chloroquine shares similar properties with hydroxychloroquine. It has been used to treat autoimmune diseases, but
     its use has decreased due to the availability of hydroxychloroquine, which is considered to have a better safety
     profile.

     Table 6.12 lists common antimalarial drugs with typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

Antigout Drugs

Antigout drugs are a class of medications used to treat gout, a condition caused by the buildup of uric acid crystals
in the joints. These drugs work to manage acute gout attacks and prevent future gout flares by reducing the level of
uric acid in the body or by alleviating inflammation and pain associated with gout attacks (National Institute for
Health and Care Excellence (NICE), 2022).
180  6 · Introduction to the Immune System and the Inflammatory Response

     Although various drugs can be used to treat gout, including glucocorticoids and NSAIDs, this section of the chapter
     will only discuss the more common drugs used to treat gout (and its inflammatory response): colchicine, allopurinol,
     and probenecid.

     Colchicine
     Colchicine is an alkaloid drug derived from the autumn crocus plant. It is used to treat acute gout attacks and can
     help reduce inflammation and pain in the affected joints. Colchicine works by interfering with the movement of
     white blood cells to the inflamed area, thereby reducing the inflammatory response. Despite its effectiveness,
     colchicine has side effects that may impact compliance with the medication regimen. These include gastrointestinal
     disturbances such as severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Health care providers should discuss
     this drug thoroughly with the client so that gout can be adequately managed. See Table 6.15 for additional
     information on colchicine.

     Allopurinol
     Allopurinol is a medication used primarily to manage gout and certain other conditions associated with elevated
     levels of uric acid in the body. It is classified as a xanthine oxidase inhibitor and primarily works to lower uric acid
     levels in the body by inhibiting the enzyme xanthine oxidase.

     When uric acid crystals accumulate in the joints, they can provoke an inflammatory response by activating the
     immune system. This leads to the release of inflammatory cytokines and other mediators that cause the
     characteristic swelling, redness, and pain associated with gout attacks. By lowering uric acid levels, allopurinol
     helps to reduce the frequency and severity of gout attacks, thereby indirectly contributing to the reduction of
     inflammation.

     While allopurinol is effective in managing gout and preventing gout attacks, it may take several weeks or months of
     continuous use to achieve full benefits. See Table 6.14 for dosing information.

     Probenecid
     Probenecid is classified as a uricosuric agent, which means it works by increasing the excretion of uric acid in the
     urine. It does this by inhibiting the reabsorption of uric acid in the kidneys, which leads to more uric acid being
     eliminated from the body through urine. By increasing the excretion of uric acid, probenecid helps lower the levels of
     uric acid in the blood, reducing the risk of uric acid crystal formation and gout attacks. Probenecid indirectly helps to
     manage the inflammatory response associated with gout.

     Table 6.14 lists common antigout drugs with typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

     Drug                             Routes and Dosage Ranges

     Colchicine   0.6 mg orally once or twice daily; maximum dose 1.2 mg per day.
     (Colcrys)

     Allopurinol  For mild gout: 200-300 mg/day orally.
     (Zyloprim)   For moderately severe tophaceous gout: 400-600 mg/day orally.

        Probenecid 250 mg orally twice daily for 2 weeks, followed by 500 mg orally twice daily thereafter.

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking antigout drugs:

· Before administering antigout drugs, conduct a thorough assessment of the client's medical history, current
   medications, allergies, and kidney and liver function.

· Monitor the following laboratory studies: serum uric acid levels to assess effectiveness of medications in
   reducing uric acid levels, liver function for hepatotoxicity, renal function for nephrotoxicity, and electrolyte
   levels, which may be impacted by the use of these drugs.

· Educate the client about the drug's purpose, potential side effects, and benefits to help the client make an
   informed decision about the treatment plan.

· Some antigout drugs may have potential side effects or interactions with other medications. The nurse should
   be vigilant for signs of adverse effects and monitor for drug interactions that could affect the client's health.

· Antigout drugs, especially during initial treatment, may not provide immediate relief of symptoms during an
   acute gout attack. The nurse should offer emotional support and symptom management strategies to help
   alleviate pain and discomfort.

· Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client
   teaching guidelines.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking an antigout drug should:
182  6 · Introduction to the Immune System and the Inflammatory Response

         · Take the medication at the scheduled times and follow the prescribed dosage. Consistent adherence to
             the medication regimen helps control uric acid levels and prevent gout attacks.

         · Maintain adequate hydration by drinking plenty of water throughout the day to help the kidneys flush out
             excess uric acid from the body.

         · Report adverse effects such as rash, diarrhea, muscle pain, and weakness to the health care provider, as
             these may be adverse effects of the medication.

         · Avoid purine-rich foods, such as red meats, organ meats, and seafood, as these can lead to increased uric
             acid levels in the body and exacerbate gout flare-ups.

         · Keep follow-up appointments to have uric acid levels assessed and to ensure that medication
             management is effective.

     The client taking an antigout drug should not:

         · Become dehydrated when using probenecid, as this may increase the risk of kidney stone formation.
         · Eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice when taking colchicine, as this may impact the efficacy of the drug.

         b. "Active immunity involves receiving pre-formed antibodies from an external source, like the hepatitis A
              vaccine. Passive immunity occurs when your immune system actively produces antibodies upon
              exposure to the live virus during an infection."
         c. "Active immunity is achieved through receiving pre-formed antibodies from an external source, such as
              the hepatitis A vaccine. Passive immunity occurs when antibodies are passed from the birthing parent

and drug interactions.

Infection and the Body's Defense System

The body's immune system has several different means of preventing infection from various microorganisms. These
different barriers to infection can be broken down into two distinct types: innate immunity and adaptive immunity.
Innate immunity is the body's first line of defense against many types of organisms. It includes physical barriers
188  7 · Anti-infective Drugs

     such as the skin, the acidic pH of the stomach, phagocytic cells (e.g., macrophages), and the inflammatory cascade
     (see Introduction to the Immune System and the Inflammatory Response). This type of immunity does not require
     prior exposure to an organism to provide protection and is not specific to any type of microorganism. Innate forms of
     immunity work quickly, within minutes to hours.

     By comparison, adaptive immunity, also known as acquired immunity, is highly specific to individual
     microorganisms. Adaptive immunity works through various immune cells with the ability to recognize specific
     targets (antigens) as belonging to the self or as foreign. When the body detects foreign antigens, the adaptive
     immune system can mount a response against the pathogen to eliminate it (Figure 7.2). Adaptive immunity is
     initially slow upon the first exposure to an antigen, but it has a "memory" that allows it to mount fast responses
     upon repeated exposure to that same pathogen. This immune memory is durable and able to last the individual's
     whole life in some cases. This same process is how some vaccines work to induce immunity to organisms.

     FIGURE 7.2 As part of the adaptive immune system, a macrophage engulfs and digests a foreign bacterium. (credit: modification of work
     from Biology for AP® Courses. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

     When microorganisms evade the innate and adaptive immunities, infection can occur. The individual may develop
     signs and symptoms consistent with elevated levels of inflammation that are caused by the immune system
     attempting to fight the infection. These signs and symptoms can include fever, malaise, nausea, vomiting, and pain.

     Various diagnostic tests are available to aid in diagnosis of an infection. These include laboratory blood tests (e.g., a
     complete blood count can reveal white blood cell abnormalities), imaging (e.g., a chest x-ray can reveal pneumonia),
     and various direct and indirect organism tests (e.g., an influenza swab can reveal the presence of influenza viral
     antigens). The health care provider's choice of tests to order depends on the client.

     People who are immunocompromised are more susceptible to, and have less immune defense against, infection.
     They may also be unable to mount "typical" signs and symptoms of infection, including fever, which can delay
     recognition of the infection. This can increase morbidity and mortality significantly in this client population because
     they are more prone to serious infections than clients with competent immune systems are. A client can be
     immunocompromised for a variety of reasons, such as by having human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the
     associated acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), receiving chemotherapy for cancer treatment, or using
     corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone, dexamethasone). Nurses should take particular care to investigate any potential
     infections in clients who are immunocompromised.

     Anti-infective Drugs

     A variety of anti-infective medications are available today. Because many drugs are specific to the organisms that
     they treat, the first step in selection is to determine the most likely organism causing the infection. This allows for
     more judicious use of anti-infective medications and avoids the unnecessary use of drugs to treat organisms that are
     not present in the client. This consideration is commonly referred to as anti-infective stewardship.

Antibiotics and Infection

Antibiotics are a group of drugs used specifically to treat infections caused by bacteria, either by directly killing the
bacteria (bactericidal) or by suppressing their growth and multiplication (bacteriostatic). Antibiotics are some of
the most commonly prescribed medications in the world; therefore, careful stewardship is necessary to avoid
overuse, which can lead to antibiotic resistance.

Antibiotic Drug Resistance

Antibiotic drug resistance is the process by which bacteria become less responsive to antibiotics over time. As
bacteria are exposed to antibiotics, evolutionary changes occur, leading to the development of resistant strains that
can withstand the antibiotic exposure and continue to thrive. These changes can include modification of antibiotic
targets (e.g., bacterial DNA or proteins) or the ability to remove a drug from the bacterial cell more effectively. Some
bacteria are even able to share snippets of DNA that code for drug resistance with other bacteria.

Antibiotic resistance is a major public health issue. Having fewer options to treat a client's infection leads to
worsened morbidity and mortality, higher health care costs, and the potential for bacteria to develop against which
effective treatment does not exist. Superinfections can occur when the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics kills off
normal nonpathogenic bacteria and leaves behind drug-resistant bacteria that can produce a new infection that is
more difficult to treat (Figure 7.3). Most antibiotic drug resistance occurs due to antibiotic overuse, both in humans
and in agriculture. This is why health care providers should prescribe antibiotics only when there is sufficient
probability that the client has a bacterial infection.

     CLINICAL TIP

 Antibiograms

  Most hospital systems will develop a document known as an antibiogram. Cultured bacterial samples from
  clients at that hospital are used to determine regional bacterial resistance patterns against antibiotics.
  Antibiograms allow health care providers to make more informed decisions about which antibiotics are most
  effective in treating clients at their facility.
190  7 · Anti-infective Drugs

     Antibiotic Drugs

     The following sections cover the most common antibiotic agents available. Not every antibiotic is able to treat all
     types of bacteria equally, so health care providers must follow guidelines and antibiotic references to select the
     most appropriate antibiotic.

     Penicillins
     Penicillin, which was discovered in 1928 by Alexander Fleming, was the first antibiotic (American Chemical Society,
     n.d.). Since then, different drugs within the penicillin family have been developed, including nafcillin, piperacillin,
     and the aminopenicillins amoxicillin and ampicillin. These agents are used for a variety of infections, including
     streptococcal pharyngitis (strep throat), acute otitis media, and endocarditis.

     Penicillins are part of the family of beta-lactam antibiotics because they include a beta-lactam ring in their chemical
     structure. The beta-lactam ring is critical for the antibiotic actions of penicillins. Penicillin-binding protein is a
     bacterial enzyme that is necessary to form the cross-links in the bacterial cell wall that provide structural integrity.
     When a penicillin is administered, the beta-lactam ring of penicillin will bind to the penicillin-binding protein and
     inhibit it. This inhibition causes fewer cross-links to form, thereby producing holes in the bacterial cell wall, leakage
     of internal contents, and cellular death of the bacteria.

     Beta-Lactamase Inhibitors
     One way that bacteria become resistant to antibiotics, such as penicillins, is by producing enzymes that can
     neutralize the drug. Beta-lactamase is one such enzyme; it is produced in resistant bacteria to cleave the beta-
     lactam ring found in drugs like penicillin to render it ineffective. Beta-lactamase inhibitors such as sulbactam,
     clavulanic acid, and tazobactam were produced to be administered with certain penicillins to help them retain and
     expand their activity to treat even more types of bacteria, such as anerobic organisms (e.g., Peptostreptococcus
     sp.). The most common combinations include amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid (Augmentin), ampicillin plus
     sulbactam (Unasyn), and piperacillin plus tazobactam (Zosyn).

     Cephalosporins
     Cephalosporins are another group of beta-lactam antibiotics and share the same mechanism of action as penicillin.
     The major differences between cephalosporins and penicillins are the various bacteria they have activity against
     and, thus, the types of infections they are best suited to treat.

     Cephalosporins are divided into several different generations based on their spectrum of activity. First-generation
     cephalosporins include cephalexin and cefazolin; these are used for a variety of conditions such as uncomplicated
     urinary tract infections, upper respiratory tract infections, and prevention of infection during surgery. Second-
     generation cephalosporins, such as cefoxitin and cefprozil, are used for similar conditions, including otitis media,
     pneumonia, and urinary tract infections. Third-generation cephalosporins include ceftriaxone and cefotaxime. These
     agents have increased gram-negative bacterial coverage and are useful in the hospital setting for a variety of more
     serious infections, such as meningitis, pneumonia, and neonatal sepsis. The only fourth-generation cephalosporin
     currently available is cefepime. Cefepime has broad antimicrobial coverage, including the difficult-to-treat gram-
     negative organism Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Finally, the fifth-generation cephalosporin ceftaroline is relatively new
     and has the unique aspect of being the only cephalosporin to have activity against methicillin-resistant
     Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

     Macrolides
     Macrolide antibiotics include the agents azithromycin, clarithromycin, and erythromycin. These agents work by
     inhibiting protein production by the bacterial ribosomes. Macrolides and other protein synthesis inhibitors do not
     directly kill bacterial cells, but they sufficiently suppress their reproduction enough to allow the client's immune
     system to eliminate the bacteria. Macrolides treat infections caused by atypical bacteria that do not fall into the
     gram-positive or gram-negative categorization, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, and
     Chlamydia pneumoniae. Therefore, macrolides are useful for treating a variety of respiratory conditions, such as
     pneumonia and Legionnaires' disease, as well as chlamydia, a sexually transmitted infection (STI).

     Macrolides inhibit the liver enzyme cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), which is responsible for metabolizing many
     medications. Medications that use the CYP enzyme system for metabolism will not undergo metabolism at the rate
     expected, leading to increased serum drug levels. This can result in adverse reactions and toxicity. Some examples

of drugs that would be affected include amlodipine, nifedipine, diltiazem, verapamil, lovastatin, simvastatin,
carbamazepine, buspirone, midazolam, fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, and dextromethorphan. (This is not an
exhaustive list.)

Glycopeptides
The glycopeptide class of drugs includes vancomycin, a common antibiotic used in the hospital setting for treating
infections caused by gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA. Vancomycin works by disrupting the integrity of the
bacterial cell wall, leading to cellular death. Interestingly, oral vancomycin has good activity against Clostridioides
difficile, which is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause colitis and severe diarrhea after clients receive
antibiotics that disrupt the gut's normal bacterial flora. However, it is completely ineffective against bloodstream
pathogens. Vancomycin is entirely renally eliminated and must be monitored by checking renal function and serum
blood levels of the drug to ensure proper dosing.

Oxazolidinones
Oxazolidinones include the medication linezolid, which is commonly used to treat gram-positive infections that are
highly resistant to agents such as vancomycin. One such infection is vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(VRSA), which is difficult to treat. Oxazolidinones work by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis to suppress further
growth and multiplication of the bacteria.

Lincosamides
The lincosamide category is primarily represented by the drug clindamycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor.
Clindamycin possesses strong gram-positive coverage (including against MRSA) and is also able to treat anaerobic
bacterial infections. This allows clindamycin to be used in a variety of conditions, such as skin infections, animal
bites, and topically as a treatment for acne.

Tetracyclines
The tetracyclines include the medications tetracycline, doxycycline, and minocycline. These work by inhibiting
bacterial protein synthesis, which suppresses their growth. They possess good coverage against a wide variety of
bacteria, making them ideal agents for treating conditions such as acne, Lyme disease, and anthrax.

Aminoglycosides
The aminoglycosides, including gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin, are used commonly in the hospital setting for
their broad-spectrum gram-negative activity, including against infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The
aminoglycosides work by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. They are entirely renally eliminated, and renal
function must be monitored along with serial serum drug levels to ensure that aminoglycosides do not accumulate
in the body.

Fluoroquinolones
The fluoroquinolones include drugs such as ofloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. These are
commonly used to treat a variety of respiratory and urinary tract infections due to their excellent coverage of gram-
negative, gram-positive, and atypical bacteria. Fluoroquinolones work by inhibiting the bacterial enzyme
DNA gyrase. This enzyme is responsible for the winding and unwinding of bacterial DNA. Inhibition of this enzyme
leads to increased DNA strand breakage, leading to eventual programmed cell death (apoptosis).

Sulfonamides
The sulfonamide category of antibiotics includes the combination product of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim
(Bactrim). This combination has a broad spectrum of coverage, making it effective for treating urinary tract
infections, infectious diarrhea, and skin infections. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim work at different steps along
the folic acid pathway necessary for the bacterial cell to produce nucleotides and, subsequently, DNA, RNA, and
proteins; the drug combination's interference thus leads to cell death.

Nitroimidazoles
The nitroimidazoles include the drugs metronidazole and tinidazole. These agents are unique in the antibacterial
category because they have good activity against anaerobic bacteria and protozoa, making this class useful for
treating a number of STIs and vaginal infections. Nitroimidazoles work by entering the bacterial cell and disrupting
the cell's DNA structure, leading to eventual cell death.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Most oral antibiotics can cause gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. A
contraindication to any antibacterial is known hypersensitivity.

Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, are possible with penicillins. If a client has a severe allergy to any
penicillin, then they should not receive any other drug in the penicillin class because they may experience a cross-
sensitivity.

Most cephalosporins, except for ceftriaxone, must be renally dose adjusted to avoid adverse effects in clients with
renal insufficiency. For many years there was concern that clients with a penicillin allergy could not receive
cephalosporins due to risk for cross-reactivity and anaphylaxis. More recent data have shown that this concern is
unfounded and that the largest risk is for clients with true anaphylactic reactions to penicillins receiving a first-
generation cephalosporin. Later generations of cephalosporins carry a much lower risk and are safe to administer to
clients with a history of penicillin allergy.

Macrolides are known to cause gastrointestinal discomfort because they activate motilin receptors in the intestines,
which increases peristalsis, cramping, and diarrhea. Macrolides are also capable of inhibiting potassium efflux out of
myocardial cells, leading to prolongation of the heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) on an electrocardiogram
(ECG/EKG) and increasing the client's risk for developing torsades de pointes, a potentially fatal ventricular
dysrhythmia.

Vancomycin is known to cause a severe flushing reaction when given too quickly intravenously, known as
194  7 · Anti-infective Drugs

     vancomycin flushing syndrome. Vancomycin flushing syndrome can be mistaken for an allergic reaction, but all that
     is necessary to manage it is to slow the infusion of vancomycin and infuse it over at least 60 minutes. Elevated
     vancomycin levels are associated with risk for renal injury and hearing damage (ototoxicity). Older adults and those
     who are critically ill are especially at risk, so close monitoring of renal function and vancomycin blood levels is
     critical for successful use of the drug.

     Unique adverse effects seen with tetracyclines include photosensitivity, skin discoloration, and risk for skeletal
     growth stunting and tooth discoloration. These last two effects occur because of the tetracyclines' ability to bind to
     calcium in developing bones and teeth. Recommendations to help prevent these effects include avoiding prolonged
     therapy (more than 21 days) in children who still have their baby teeth and avoiding use in pregnant clients during
     the second and third trimesters. Oral tetracyclines should not be taken with multivitamins or calcium-containing
     products. When taken together, tetracyclines will bind to metal ions such as iron and calcium, and the drug will not
     be absorbed; instead, it will be eliminated in the feces, leading to therapeutic failure.

     Fluoroquinolones have a variety of safety issues, making screening for contraindications particularly important. In
     older adults and in clients with poor kidney function, fluoroquinolones are known to induce neuropsychiatric issues,
     including hallucinations and psychosis. Fluoroquinolones also increase the risk for tendonitis and tendon rupture.
     Fluoroquinolones can increase the QTc interval on ECG, which should be monitored for clients taking multiple QTc-
     prolonging medications and for those with congenital prolonged QTc to reduce risk for torsades de pointes.
     Fluoroquinolones should not be taken orally with multivitamins or calcium-containing products because this will
     cause the drug to bind to the metal and not be absorbed.

 · Advise the client to take the entire prescribed course of the medication to ensure adequate treatment and to
     reduce the development of antibiotic drug resistance.

 · Instruct the client to maintain adequate hydration; monitor kidney function for renally eliminated medications,
     such as penicillins, most cephalosporins, vancomycin, aminoglycosides, and particularly fluoroquinolones.

 · For clients taking macrolides, always review their medication list for medications metabolized by CYP3A4.
 · Monitor for thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and anemia in clients receiving linezolid. Monitor complete blood

     count (CBC) periodically. Notify prescriber if blood counts drop.
 · If client is taking any medication that can increase serotonin levels (SSRIs, SNRIs, or MAOIs), the nurse

     should observe for signs of serotonin syndrome, including hyperthermia, headache, confusion, agitation,
     increased blood pressure, tachycardia, tremor, ataxia, muscle rigidity, and seizures.
 · Ensure that any ordered samples for serum levels of agents such as vancomycin and aminoglycosides are
     obtained at the intended time so that accurate dosage adjustments can be made. Timing may include peak
     levels drawn after a dose of the antibiotic has been given or trough levels drawn immediately before a dose.
 · Monitor for severe or bloody diarrhea and, if ordered, obtain a sample to check for C. difficile.
 · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client
     teaching guidelines.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking an antibiotic should:

    · Alert their health care provider about any signs and symptoms of allergic reactions, including throat
        swelling, severe itching, rash, or chest tightness.

    · Alert their health care provider about any recent antibiotic use prior to starting therapy.
    · Alert their health care provider that they are taking antibiotics, including the dose and frequency.
    · Take the drug with food if it causes an upset stomach.
    · Take the entire course of antibiotics, even if they begin to feel better.
    · Take a missed dose as soon as they remember; however, they should not take double doses.

The client taking an antibiotic should not:

    · Take multivitamins or calcium-containing products with fluroquinolone or tetracycline drugs.

FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

Antibacterials

All antibacterials: Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all
antibacterial agents, including clindamycin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis.
Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon, leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

Aminoglycosides can cause neurotoxicity, manifested by ototoxicity, both vestibular and auditory. This can
occur in clients treated with gentamicin, primarily in those with preexisting renal damage and in clients with
healthy renal function treated with higher doses and/or for longer periods than recommended. Aminoglycoside-
induced ototoxicity is usually irreversible. Other manifestations of neurotoxicity may include numbness, skin
tingling, muscle twitching, and convulsions. Monitor serum concentrations of aminoglycosides when feasible to
ensure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels.

Fluoroquinolones have been associated with disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions
that have occurred together, including tendinopathy and tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, and central
nervous system effects. Discontinue ciprofloxacin immediately and avoid the use of fluoroquinolones in clients
who experience any of these serious adverse reactions. Because fluoroquinolones have been associated with
serious adverse reactions, ciprofloxacin is reserved for use in clients who have no alternative treatment options
for the following indications: acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, acute sinusitis, and acute uncomplicated
cystitis.
196  7 · Anti-infective Drugs

       Fluoroquinolones also may exacerbate muscle weakness in clients with myasthenia gravis. Avoid ciprofloxacin
       in clients with known history of myasthenia gravis.

       Vancomycin: A formulation of this injection contains the excipients polyethylene glycol (PEG 400) and N-acetyl
       D-alanine (NADA), which resulted in fetal malformations in animal reproduction studies at dose exposures
       approximately 8 and 32 times, respectively, higher than the exposures at the human equivalent dose. If use of
       vancomycin is needed during the first or second trimester of pregnancy, use other available formulations of
       vancomycin.

     Viruses and Antiviral Drugs

     Compared to bacteria, viruses are simple microorganisms made up of single or double strands of DNA or RNA inside
     a cellular coating known as a capsid. Viruses are unique in that they are unable to replicate on their own. Instead, a
     virus will harness the host's cellular mechanisms to make new copies of itself to then infect other cells. Most viral
     infections (e.g., adenoviruses, rhinoviruses) are minor and self-limited, meaning they rarely require drug therapy.
     More serious viral infections, including those caused by the hepatitis viruses, pose much more significant risks to
     clients and require specific antiviral therapy. Clients at risk for more serious viral infections include individuals at the
     extremes of age (i.e., the very young and the very old) and those who are immunocompromised.

     The following section covers the common antiviral drugs used to treat a variety of viral infections, including those
     caused by hepatitis, herpes, and influenza viruses. The mechanisms of action, drug interactions, adverse effects,
     and indications are discussed, including special considerations for use.

     Hepatitis Antivirals
     Hepatitis viruses are clinically important because they can cause inflammation and damage to the liver. The three
     main types are hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV). HAV infection is usually
     self-limited, with many individuals being able to rid themselves of it without any intervention. HBV and HCV
     infections are of more clinical concern because without intervention, many clients will develop chronic infection,
     which can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and risk for liver cancer. HAV is spread via the fecal-oral route, and HBV and
     HCV are usually spread through parenteral transmission (such as by sharing contaminated needles) and during
     sexual intercourse. Vaccines can prevent HAV and HBV infections.

     Medications to treat chronic HBV infection are not always curative and are used with the goal of preventing
     complications such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. HBV infection is typically managed with nucleoside/nucleotide
     antivirals, which include entecavir, tenofovir, lamivudine, adefovir, and telbivudine. These drugs work against viral
     DNA polymerase, an enzyme critical for DNA production and viral replication. They are incorporated into the viral
     DNA and function as "chain terminators," meaning that no other nucleotides may be added onto them in the chain of
     DNA, and DNA production is thereby halted. Another treatment option is interferon (interferon alfa); however, due to
     toxicity, this medication is considered a last resort when all else fails.

     HCV infection previously was a chronic disease with no definitive cure and consisted of treatment with parenteral
     medications with poor tolerability (e.g., interferons). This condition has radically changed, and now many clients
     with HCV can achieve virologic cure (no presence of the virus in the body) with 12-24 weeks of oral drug therapy
     using a direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agent such as sofosbuvir. The DAAs can work on a variety of steps in the HCV life
     cycle to prevent replication or transmission of active virus. Nurses should stress to clients that they must take the
     entire course of their DAA regimen because resistance can develop if the virus is not completely suppressed. More
     resistant cases may require treatment with the injectable drug ribavirin, the action of which is not currently
     understood.

     Herpes Antivirals
     Two main types of herpes viruses are responsible for causing clinically significant disease. Herpes simplex virus
     (HSV)-1 is usually responsible for causing lesions (e.g., cold sores) on the mouth, face, and skin. HSV-2 is usually
     responsible for infections in the genitals and rectum. No curative therapy for HSV-1 or HSV-2 currently exists, but
     medication is useful to reduce the duration and severity of symptoms a client experiences and to help prevent
     spread of the virus to other individuals. Agents used to treat herpes viruses include acyclovir and its oral prodrug,
     valacyclovir, as well as famciclovir. Ganciclovir, valganciclovir, and cidofovir also have activity against herpes viruses,

but due to multiple adverse effects, they are reserved for cases of resistance to the first-line agents. These agents
work by inhibiting the formation of new viral DNA by acting as chain terminators.

Clients with herpes virus infections may take these medications either when symptoms occur (episodic therapy) or
every day for chronic suppression. Chronic suppression is linked to lower incidence of transmission of the virus to
uninfected individuals and is useful for clients who have multiple outbreaks each year. Clients using the episodic
method must be instructed to begin taking their therapy within 24 hours of symptom onset for the medication to be
effective. They should also be informed that viral shedding can occur even without an active lesion, which may
increase transmission risk.

Influenza Antivirals
Influenza refers to a diverse set of viruses known to cause upper respiratory tract illnesses, most commonly in the
winter months. Annual vaccination will not prevent all infections but may help reduce the symptoms that individuals
experience, and it is critical for protecting people most at risk for complications, such as older adults and
immunocompromised individuals. However, vaccines are able to protect against only four strains each year with the
current quadrivalent vaccines, which protect against two strains of influenza A and two of influenza B. This means
that many people still go on to develop influenza infections that require treatment with medications.

The primary class of drugs used to treat influenza infection includes the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir,
zanamivir, and peramivir. Neuraminidase inhibitors work by inhibiting the enzyme neuraminidase, which is used to
cleave mature copies of the virus from an infected cell to allow it to go infect other cells. Inhibiting this enzyme
prohibits the virus from infecting host cells. If the client has had flulike symptoms for more than 48 hours,
neuraminidase inhibitors should not be used due to lack of efficacy.

Oseltamivir is considered the first-line option for treatment of influenza and is given orally over 5 days. Zanamivir is
an inhaled neuraminidase inhibitor that can be used as an alternative to oral oseltamivir. Peramivir is the only
intravenous neuraminidase inhibitor and should be reserved for clients who cannot take oral or inhaled medications.

Table 7.3 lists common antivirals and typical routes and dosing for adult and pediatric clients.

     Nursing Implications
     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking antivirals:

     · Monitor for signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis (e.g., shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, difficulty
        swallowing).

     · Advise the client to take the entire prescribed course of the medication to ensure adequate treatment and to
        reduce the development of drug resistance.

     · Instruct the client to maintain adequate hydration; monitor kidney function for renally eliminated antivirals
        such as acyclovir and valacyclovir.

     · Monitor the client's complete blood count to check for bone marrow suppression.
     · Monitor for mental status changes in clients receiving intravenous antivirals who have poor renal function.
     · For clients using antiviral medication episodically, teach them to begin taking it as soon as possible after

        symptom onset.
     · Use appropriate personal protective equipment (e.g., mask and gloves) when clients are diagnosed with

        influenza to prevent infection spread.
     · Check a pregnancy test in clients capable of pregnancy prior to initiating antiviral therapy.
     · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

  CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

  The client taking an antiviral should:

      · Alert their health care provider about any signs of allergic reactions, including throat swelling, severe
          itching, rash, or chest tightness.

      · Alert their health care provider about any recent antiviral use prior to starting therapy.
      · Alert their health care provider that they are taking these medications, including the dose and frequency.
      · Take the drug with food if it causes an upset stomach.
      · Take a missed dose as soon as they remember; however, they should not take double doses.
      · For episodic use, begin taking the antiviral as soon as possible (within 24 hours of symptom onset) to

          reduce symptom duration.
      · Stay well hydrated while using these medications to avoid kidney issues.

  FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

  Antivirals

  Ganciclovir: Granulocytopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia have been reported with
  ganciclovir.

  Ganciclovir: Based on animal data and limited human data, ganciclovir may cause temporary or permanent
  inhibition of spermatogenesis in males and suppression of fertility in females, may cause birth defects in
  humans, and has the potential to cause cancer in humans.

  Cidofovir: Renal impairment is the major toxicity of cidofovir. Cases of acute renal failure resulting in dialysis
  and/or contributing to death have occurred with as few as one or two doses of cidofovir. Cidofovir is
  contraindicated in clients who are receiving other nephrotoxic agents.

  Sofosbuvir: HBV reactivation has been reported in HCV/HBV coinfected clients who were treated with HCV
  antivirals but were not receiving HBV antiviral therapy.

  Tenofovir: Acute exacerbations of HBV have been reported in clients who have discontinued HBV antiviral
  therapy.

COVID-19 and Anti-COVID-19 Drugs

In 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) led to a global pandemic that resulted in millions of deaths (World Health Organization,
n.d.). Given the severity of illness and the propensity of the virus to kill individuals with poor immune systems and
multiple comorbidities, there was a rush to develop both vaccines against the virus and medications to treat
individuals with COVID-19 infections.

This section focuses on drug therapy for clients with an existing COVID-19 infection. It is important to note that
treatment for COVID-19 is still an evolving topic and more research is still being conducted, so health care
professionals should always consult the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID-19 website
(https://openstax.org/r/coronavirus) for up-to-date guidance.

Note that COVID-19 can present as asymptomatic or with potentially life-threatening symptoms. The variation can
be due to issues such as vaccination status, medical comorbidities, immune system status, and age. These factors
should always be considered when deciding whether COVID-19 drug therapy is needed. Clients without risk factors
for progression to severe disease and those who are asymptomatic can be managed with supportive care and
without drug treatment.

Nirmatrelvir
Nirmatrelvir is an oral antiviral medication that works by inhibiting the protease enzyme that is necessary to develop
200  7 · Anti-infective Drugs

     mature proteins. Because these proteins are prevented from being made, new mature virus copies cannot be made.
     Nirmatrelvir is combined with ritonavir, which is used as a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor to boost levels of nirmatrelvir and
     reduce dosing frequency. Because ritonavir is combined with nirmatrelvir, the nurse must review a client's
     medication profile to avoid any significant CYP3A4 interactions. Nirmatrelvir should be taken as soon as possible
     once symptoms occur because it loses efficacy and is not recommended after 5 days of symptom onset.

     Remdesivir
     Remdesivir works by inhibiting viral RNA polymerase, causing inhibition of viral protein synthesis and reproduction.
     Remdesivir is an intravenous product, so it is usually reserved for hospitalized clients or those who cannot receive
     nirmatrelvir within 7 days of symptom onset.

     Molnupiravir
     Molnupiravir is an oral product that works by being incorporated into the SARS-CoV-2 RNA; it then induces errors
     that lead to inhibited viral reproduction. There are some questions about the efficacy of molnupiravir in the
     treatment of COVID-19, so it is recommended as an alternative if clients cannot receive nirmatrelvir due to drug
     interactions or impaired renal function. Initiation of molnupiravir should occur within 5 days of symptom onset.

     Table 7.5 lists anti-COVID-19 drugs and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

     Anti-COVID-19 drugs are known to cause gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. A
     contraindication to any antiviral drug is known hypersensitivity.

     Nirmatrelvir is well tolerated, with diarrhea and dysgeusia (impaired sense of taste) being the most frequently
     reported adverse effects. Adverse effects seen with the use of remdesivir include elevated serum glucose levels and
     reduced kidney function. Remdesivir should be administered only when emergency airway tools (e.g., laryngoscope)
     are available in case of a severe allergic reaction.

Fungi and Antifungal Drugs

Fungi make up a diverse group of microorganisms that includes yeasts, molds, and mushrooms. Some of the key
differences between human and fungal cell structures are that fungi introduce sterols into the cell membrane, and
they have a cell wall that includes products such as chitin and glucans. These differences form the basis for drug
therapy designed to eliminate fungi. Fungal infections can vary in presentation from less severe infections of the
scalp, skin, or nails, which may require topical antifungal therapy, to severe systemic fungal infections that may be
life-threatening. The latter are primarily found in immunocompromised clients and require aggressive systemic
therapy to avoid serious morbidity and mortality.
202  7 · Anti-infective Drugs

     This section will cover commonly used antifungal drugs, including their mechanisms of action, adverse effects,
     indications, and contraindications. Given the wide variety of fungi that can cause disease (e.g., Aspergillus, Candida,
     Blastomyces), positive identification is ideal to ensure that the appropriate drug is selected. Unfortunately, fungal
     cultures can take weeks for identification. In severely ill clients, broad-spectrum antifungals are used until culture
     results are available.

     Polyenes
     Polyene antifungal drugs include amphotericin B and nystatin. These are broad-spectrum antifungals that bind to
     ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane, leading to membrane breakdown and fungal cell death. Amphotericin B is
     used intravenously to treat severe systemic fungal infections. Nystatin is used orally for infections such as
     oropharyngeal candidiasis (thrush). Nystatin is not absorbed systemically when taken orally or topically; therefore, it
     is ineffective for systemic infections.

     Azoles
     The azole antifungals include two broad classes: imidazoles and triazoles. Examples of imidazoles include
     clotrimazole, miconazole, and ketoconazole. Examples of triazoles include fluconazole, voriconazole, and
     posaconazole. These drugs work by inhibiting the enzyme 14-alpha-sterol demethylase. This enzyme is necessary
     for the fungal cell to produce ergosterol, which is then transferred to the cell membrane. Inhibition of this enzyme
     leads to arrest of fungal cell growth.

     Antimetabolites
     Flucytosine is the only antifungal antimetabolite. It works by being converted to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in the fungal
     cell; 5-FU inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase as well as DNA, RNA, and protein production in fungal cells,
     leading to arrested growth.

     Echinocandins
     The echinocandins include the drugs caspofungin, anidulafungin, and micafungin. These work by inhibiting the
     enzyme 1,3-beta-glucan synthase, which is responsible for providing structural integrity to the fungal cell wall.
     Inhibiting this enzyme decreases glucan synthesis and disrupts the cell wall, leading to fungal cell death.

     Table 7.7 lists antifungal drugs and typical routes and dosing for adult and pediatric clients.

     Drug                                       Routes and Dosage Ranges

     Amphotericin   Progessive, potentially life-threatening fungal infections:
             B      Adults: 0.25-0.3 mg/kg IV daily over 2-6 hours. Total daily dose of 1.5 mg/kg should not be

                    Children: 3 mg/kg (not to exceed 200 mg) on day 1, followed by a once daily IV maintenance
                    dose of 1.5 mg/kg (not to exceed 100 mg) thereafter for 14 days.
                    Esophageal candidiasis:
                    Adults: 100 mg IV loading dose on day 1, followed by a 50 mg IV once daily maintenance dose
                    for 14 days.

     Fluconazole    Oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis:
      (Diflucan)    Adults: 200 mg orally on the first day, followed by 100 mg orally once daily for 2 weeks to

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Antifungals are known to cause gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. A
contraindication to any antifungal drug is known hypersensitivity.

Amphotericin B is very toxic and can cause flulike symptoms during infusion, hypotension, renal toxicity, and
electrolyte disturbances. To reduce these adverse effects, several formulations have been developed that
incorporate the drug into a lipid membrane. This significantly increases medication costs but is much better in
reducing client harm.

SAFETY ALERT

Oral/Intravenous Azole Antifungals

Some oral and intravenously administered azole antifungals are strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, which can affect
many medications. Affected medications will have higher levels in the body and increase the risk for drug toxicity.
The health care provider should screen a client's medication profile for interactions before initiating therapy with
an oral or intravenous azole antifungal.

     Pathophysiology

     The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is responsible for causing deterioration in the infected individual's
     immune system, leaving them vulnerable to a variety of opportunistic infections and cancers. This state of
     immunodeficiency is known as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Since HIV was first identified in the
     1980s, highly effective medications for antiretroviral therapy (ART) have been developed to suppress the virus and
     delay the development of AIDS-defining illnesses such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP; previously known
     as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia or PCP), cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and the cancer known as Kaposi's
     sarcoma. However, HIV infection is a lifelong condition with no known curative treatment.

After the individual's initial exposure to HIV, the virus targets the CD4 T lymphocytes (helper T cells). It binds to and
fuses with the CD4 cell and then enters it. From there, the enzyme reverse transcriptase takes the HIV RNA and
forms a complementary strand of DNA. The enzyme integrase then incorporates the viral DNA into the individual's
DNA, which causes the host cell to begin producing viral proteins. The enzyme protease then cuts the viral proteins
into their mature form, and the new copy of the virus is ready to bud off from the infected cell to go infect a new CD4
cell (Figure 7.4). As this process continues, there is continual degradation in the number of CD4 cells available to
fight infection, and the person becomes immunocompromised and more at risk for various opportunistic infections
and cancers. Once an individual develops one of these opportunistic illnesses or their CD4 cell count drops <200
cells/mL of blood, they are considered to have AIDS. People with AIDS have badly damaged immune systems.
Understanding the life cycle of the virus is important because these steps present different drug targets that can be
used to suppress viral replication. HIV treatment can slow or prevent progression of the disease. There are three
stages of HIV. The first stage is acute HIV infection, in which clients have a large amount of HIV in their blood and
are very contagious. Many have flu-like symptoms. Stage two is chronic HIV infection, also called asymptomatic HIV
infection or clinical latency. HIV is still active, and the client can still transmit the infection to others as it continues
to reproduce in the body. The third stage is when the client is diagnosed with AIDS. This is the most severe form of
HIV. Clients have a high viral load and can easily transmit the virus.

Cycle" by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)

Clinical Manifestations

Upon initial infection, many individuals may have few to no symptoms. Early symptoms may mimic the symptoms of
mononucleosis, including fever, enlarged lymph nodes, and fatigue. After several weeks, the virus enters a latent
period, and the person becomes asymptomatic. This provides a false sense of security because the virus is
continually replicating, and immune cell destruction is occurring steadily. Once the client's CD4 cell count falls to
206  7 · Anti-infective Drugs

     less than 200 cells/mL of blood, the client may present with an opportunistic infection such as PJP, which may be
     the first time the client is evaluated for HIV infection. Without HIV treatment, people with AIDS typically survive
     about 3 years due to complications caused by opportunistic infections and malignancies. People who are treated for
     HIV in stage one or two may never move into stage three. Without HIV treatment, stage two may last a decade or
     longer. At the end of this stage, the viral load of HIV in the blood increases and the person may move into stage
     three (AIDS).

     HIV Transmission

     HIV transmission can occur in different ways. Many bodily fluids from an infected individual, including blood, breast
     milk, semen, and vaginal fluids, contain the virus. These fluids can then be transmitted to an uninfected person via
     unprotected sexual intercourse, sharing of contaminated needles during injection drug use, or perinatal
     transmission from a pregnant client to their fetus. The type of sexual exposure can also affect the possibility of
     transmission of the virus to uninfected individuals. The risk of transmission is low during oral intercourse.
     Transmission rates are higher for penile-vaginal intercourse, and anal intercourse, especially receptive anal
     intercourse, carries the highest risk for transmission.

     One factor that may influence the risk for viral transmission is the infected individual's viral load, or the number of
     copies of the viral RNA that are measured in the blood. The higher the viral load in the blood, the more likely the
     infected individual's fluids will contain copies of the virus capable of infecting another individual. This is why viral
     suppression with ART can help prevent the spread of HIV, along with other techniques such as using condoms and
     clean needles.

     Laboratory Testing

     Testing for and diagnosing HIV infection can be done with several types of tests, including antibody tests, antigen/
     antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests. The first two tests look for the presence of antibodies against the virus that
     the body has produced; therefore, the test may be negative if the client was recently infected and has not had time
     to develop antibodies. The nucleic acid test looks for copies of the viral RNA and can detect the presence of HIV
     sooner than antibody-based tests can. It is important for high-risk individuals (e.g., those who share needles, those
     who have unprotected sex with multiple partners) to be screened more often for HIV to ensure early diagnosis
     because treatment with ART can preserve immune function for as long as possible.

     Two primary laboratory tests are used to track the efficacy of ART in HIV-infected individuals. The first is the viral
     load, which is a measure of how actively the virus is reproducing itself. The second is the CD4 cell count, which
     shows the degree of immune system degradation that has occurred and the degree of risk for developing
     opportunistic infections. Ideally, under ART treatment, the HIV viral load will be undetectable, and the CD4 cell
     count will be 500-1600 cells/mm3. The CD4 cell is a type of white blood cell that plays a key role in the immune
     system by alerting other immune cells to the presence of infections in the body.

     Testing can also be performed to determine the sensitivity or resistance to a variety of ART drugs. This is helpful to
     make sure that any treatment the client is receiving will be able to sufficiently suppress viral replication. HIV is
     prone to making mistakes when it copies itself, which leads to frequent mutations that induce resistance to various
     ART drugs, so sensitivity testing is critical to choosing an effective regimen.

     Antiretroviral Drugs

     Treatment of HIV is an ever-evolving subject, with guidelines frequently recommending different preferred ART
     regimens based on up-to-date research. The best place to get accurate, timely recommendations for ART is through
     the National Institutes of Health's HIV information website (https://openstax.org/r/hivinfo). For effective ART,
     multiple drugs utilizing different mechanisms of action are used together to synergize and suppress viral replication.
     The client's adherence is critical to achieve viral suppression and preserve their immune function. Nonadherence
     will often lead to viral resistance against ART drugs. Choosing combination products that reduce the number of pills
     a client takes in a day can help decrease regimen complexity and increase adherence.

     Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitors
     Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (integrase inhibitors) include the drugs raltegravir, dolutegravir, and elvitegravir.
     They work by inhibiting the HIV enzyme integrase to prevent HIV DNA from being incorporated into the individual's

     Access for free at openstax.org
7.3 · Introduction to HIV, AIDS, and Antiretrovirals                                                                       207

DNA. This then prevents the production of new copies of the virus. Integrase inhibitors are a relatively new class of
drugs used in the treatment of HIV; given their efficacy and favorable tolerability, they have become components of
many first-line regimens recommended for clients newly diagnosed with HIV.

Fusion Pump Inhibitors
The fusion pump inhibitor enfuvirtide works by preventing the fusion of the HIV virus with a CD4 cell. This prevents
the cell from being infected and suppresses viral replication. Enfuvirtide is usually reserved for clients with
treatment-resistant HIV because the drug must be injected subcutaneously twice daily and is quite costly.

Protease Inhibitors
Once HIV has integrated itself into the host cell's DNA, it begins to produce copies of viral proteins. These are
produced in one long chain and must be cleaved via the enzyme protease to form functional, mature proteins. The
use of protease inhibitors, such as atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, and ritonavir, keeps those proteins from
maturing, and viral replication is suppressed.

Chemokine Coreceptor (CCR5) Antagonists
During the fusion process, some variants of HIV will look for the C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) that lies on
the cell surface to help the virus enter the cell. This protein plays a major role in inflammation by recruiting and
activating leukocytes. CCR5 is also the principal HIV coreceptor and is involved in the pathology of both cancer and
neuroinflammation. In addition, it has been implicated in the inflammatory complications of coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19). Maraviroc is a CCR5 antagonist that blocks this receptor to discourage fusion and entry of HIV
into the cell. If the HIV that the client is infected with does not express the protein looking for the CCR5 receptor,
then this drug will be ineffective.

Cytochrome P-450 Inhibitors
One way to increase blood levels of certain ART medications and reduce the number of pills a client takes in a day is
by inhibiting CYP3A4. The two drugs used for this purpose are cobicistat and the protease inhibitor ritonavir.
Inhibiting CYP3A4 reduces drug metabolism and boosts the blood levels of several antiretrovirals.

     CLINICAL TIP

 Double-Check for Drug Interactions, Including CYP Interactions

  CYP3A4 inhibitors are useful to help reduce the number of pills a client needs to take and thus simplify their
  medication regimens. These inhibitors can also be the source of many drug interactions, including medications
  used for tuberculosis, high cholesterol, and bacterial infections. Nurses should always inspect a client's
  medication history to determine whether any changes to their current medications are necessary to avoid drug
  toxicity.

Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors
Reverse transcriptase takes the viral RNA and makes a complementary copy of DNA that can then be integrated into
the host cell DNA. By inhibiting reverse transcriptase, viral replication can be suppressed. One way to inhibit reverse
transcriptase is by directly binding to it to affect its conformational shape and reduce its ability to produce DNA. This
class of drugs is known as the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and includes the drugs
delavirdine, efavirenz, etravirine, and rilpivirine.

Nucleoside/Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors
An alternative way to inhibit reverse transcriptase is by using drugs that look like the nucleosides/nucleotides that
are normally incorporated into viral DNA but that are modified to function as chain terminators to prevent DNA chain
elongation. These drugs are called the nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and include
the drugs abacavir, didanosine, tenofovir, and zidovudine. These agents serve as the backbone to many ART
regimens. The NRTIs are ineffective as a monotherapy due to rapid resistance. First-line antiretroviral regimens
include two NRTIs and one other drug from a different class, such as NNRTIs or protease inhibitors. Today,
treatment has become simplified due to the availability of combination agents. This simplified regimen enhances
adherence.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Antiretroviral agents are known to cause gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. A
     contraindication to any antiretroviral drug is known hypersensitivity.

     The most common adverse effects associated with enfuvirtide include fatigue, diarrhea, and injection site reactions.

     Common adverse effects among the protease inhibitors include liver injury and metabolic disorders such as
     dyslipidemia and glucose intolerance.

     SAFETY ALERT

     Protease Inhibitors

     Effective ART therapy has allowed many clients with HIV to live decades longer than they might have if diagnosed
     in the 1980s. Protease inhibitor use, however, can increase the risk for metabolic complications in these clients,
     including raising serum glucose and lipid levels. This may predispose them to conditions such as diabetes and
     atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (e.g., angina, myocardial infarction). As these clients age, health care
     professionals should screen for these metabolic conditions to be able to intervene before complications develop.

     The main adverse effects seen with maraviroc are gastrointestinal upset and upper respiratory infection.

     Common adverse reactions to the NNRTIs include rash, insomnia, and liver injury. Use of this class of drugs is on the
     decline due to poor tolerability and safety issues.

     Older, first-generation NRTIs such as didanosine and zidovudine are more frequently associated with adverse
     effects such as peripheral neuropathies, pancreatitis, and lactic acidosis. Newer agents such as abacavir and
     tenofovir tend to be better tolerated and are included in many of the recommended regimens for HIV treatment.

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking antiretroviral drugs:

· Monitor for signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis (e.g., shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, difficulty
   swallowing).

· Advise the client to take the entire prescribed course of the drug to ensure adequate treatment and to reduce
   the development of drug resistance.

· Teach the client to monitor for symptoms of lactic acidosis (e.g., abnormal heartbeat, muscle cramps,
   abdominal pain).

· Educate about sterile, proper injection technique if the client is using enfuvirtide.
· Monitor for potential CYP3A4 interactions with other medications the client is taking if they are using ritonavir

   or cobicistat.
· Monitor for liver dysfunction in clients receiving maraviroc.
· Evaluate for the presence of the HLA-B*5701 genetic mutation before beginning abacavir because its

   presence increases the risk for anaphylaxis.
· For clients receiving protease inhibitors, monitor for changes in serum lipids and glucose to reduce the risk for

   heart disease.
· Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

   teaching guidelines.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking an antiretroviral should:

    · Alert their health care provider about any signs of allergic reactions, including throat swelling, severe
        itching, rash, or chest tightness.

    · Alert their health care provider that they are taking these medications, including the dose and frequency.
    · Take the drug with food if it causes an upset stomach.
    · Take a missed dose as soon as they remember; however, they should not take double doses.
210  7 · Anti-infective Drugs

     · Alert their health care provider about any adverse effects or barriers to taking the medication correctly to
        ensure adherence and appropriate drug selection.

     · Understand proper sterile injection technique to reduce the risk for infection.
     · Report any rash or yellowish skin discoloration if they are taking maraviroc.
     · Make sure to take every dose in their regimen to decrease the development of viral resistance.
     · Make sure to practice safer sex (e.g., condom use, fewer sexual partners) and avoid sharing needles to

        reduce the chances of transmitting HIV.

         · 7.4.7 Describe nursing implications of drugs used to treat common sexually transmitted infections.
         · 7.4.8 Explain the client education related to drugs used to treat common sexually transmitted infections.

     According to the World Health Organization, more than 1 million sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are
     acquired every day (2023b). Many of these are asymptomatic, which accounts for their rapid spread between sexual
     partners. The consequences of not appropriately preventing, screening for, and treating STIs are numerous and
     include complications such as infertility, cancer, pregnancy complications, and increased risk for HIV infection. Due
     to the societal stigma around STIs, many people may be hesitant to seek out care for STIs because of perceived
     judgement from friends, family, and health care professionals. Nurses should always adopt a curious,
     nonjudgmental approach with clients to encourage open and honest communication so that clients get the care they
     need and deserve.

     Bacterial Infections

     Bacteria are known to cause several STIs, and they respond well to antibiotics covered previously in this chapter.
     One ongoing concern with the treatment of bacterial STIs is the development of drug-resistant bacteria that do not
     respond to traditional therapies. Health care professionals should follow the latest clinical guidelines from the
     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (https://openstax.org/r/cdcgovstd).

     Bacterial Vaginosis

     vagina shift from the normally dominant lactobacilli to other pathogenic species. Disruption of the normal vaginal

flora can occur for a variety of reasons, but sex with multiple partners, douching, and not using condoms are cited as
the most common risk factors. Individuals with BV may be asymptomatic or can have signs and symptoms such as
vaginal discharge and fishy odor. Treatment is necessary to prevent outcomes such as acquisition of other STIs,
pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and preterm delivery if pregnant.

Chlamydia
Chlamydia is one of the most reported STIs in the United States, with more than 1.6 million cases being reported in
2021 (CDC, 2023a). The condition is caused by the organism Chlamydia trachomatis, which can spread during
sexual intercourse. Clients with chlamydia may present with painful urination and urethral discharge in males or
vaginal discharge in females. However, many affected individuals are asymptomatic and are diagnosed only if
screened. Screening usually includes a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) to look for the presence of the
organism. Untreated cases of chlamydia can progress to PID in female clients, which may result in chronic pain and
infertility.

Gonorrhea
Gonorrhea is the second most reported STI in the United States, with over 700,000 cases being reported in 2021
(CDC, 2023a). The condition is caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which is transmitted during sexual contact. As with
chlamydia, some clients will remain asymptomatic, which aids in the spread to sexual partners. The most common
presenting symptoms include mucopurulent penile discharge and painful urination. Diagnosis is made using a NAAT
to look for presence of the organism. Complications from untreated cases of gonorrhea include PID, infertility, and
increased risk for HIV infection.

Syphilis
Syphilis is a bacterial infection caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum. It can be transmitted perinatally and
through sexual contact. Syphilis can present in a variety of ways depending on the stage to which it has advanced.
Primary syphilis is associated with a painless chancre on tissue that was exposed to the organism (usually the
genital tissue). Secondary syphilis occurs as the organism spreads through the lymph system, producing skin lesions
throughout the body. The third stage of syphilis is the latent phase, when the symptoms of the secondary stage
disappear. In the most advanced stage, the organism can invade the body's organ systems, including the central
nervous system (neurosyphilis) and the cardiovascular system (cardiovascular syphilis) and can result in stroke,
seizures, vision problems, and death. Several tests can be performed to diagnose syphilis; the rapid plasma reagin
(RPR) and venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) tests are the most common.

     TRENDING TODAY

 Increasing Rates of STIs

  The CDC tracks STI rates year to year and documented over 2.5 million cases in 2021, which is a marked
  increase from 2020 (CDC, 2023b). Although rates rose in all parts of the United States, certain populations were
  disproportionately affected, including gay and bisexual males; and females who belong to racial and ethnic
  minorities. The changes included more cases of gonorrhea and chlamydia and a 32.5% increase in congenital
  syphilis cases. Congenital syphilis occurs when an infant acquires the infection in utero from the birthing parent,
  and it is a cause of stillbirths and infant deaths. The CDC has called for an increased commitment to educating,
  preventing, and treating these infections to help reverse this trend. All health care professionals should be able
  to discuss sexual health topics with clients to increase disease awareness and teach them about safe practices to
  help prevent future cases of STIs.

Viral Infections

Viruses cause some STIs and may exist alongside the various bacterial organisms discussed previously. Unlike
bacterial STIs, most of the viral STIs do not have definitive curative therapy, meaning these infections may become
lifelong conditions to manage.

Herpes Simplex
Herpes simplex virus (HSV), discussed earlier in the chapter, is a major cause of genital ulcerations in the United
States, with an estimated 572,000 cases reported each year (CDC, 2021). Despite its prevalence, many individuals
212  7 · Anti-infective Drugs

     are asymptomatic, leading to transmission of the condition without the person's knowledge. Ulcerations are often
     painful and can occur in multiple episodes per year in susceptible individuals. Individuals with HSV infection are
     also more susceptible to HIV infection.

     Human Papillomavirus
     Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a DNA virus that spreads through skin-to-skin contact. HPV infection is also
     prevalent; an estimated 42.5 million people contracted the virus in 2018 (CDC, 2021). Most individuals who
     contract HPV remain asymptomatic; however, the signs and symptoms include genital warts, which can produce
     varying levels of discomfort. Many subtypes of HPV exist and are linked to different types of cancer, including
     cervical, anal, vaginal, and oropharyngeal cancers. This association prompted development of an HPV vaccine that
     protects against nine strains of the virus. The vaccine protects against cervical, vulvar, and vaginal cancer in females
     along with anal cancer and genital warts in both females and males.

     Other Pathogenic Infections

     A variety of other microorganisms are responsible for STIs, including trichomoniasis, a genitourinary infection that is
     caused by the protozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. It is the most common nonviral STI; the CDC estimated
     that 6.9 million cases occurred in 2018 (CDC, 2021). Trichomoniasis infections are spread through sexual contact
     and typically present with purulent vaginal discharge and painful urination. As with many other conditions
     discussed, untreated trichomoniasis can lead to PID, infertility, and increased risk for HIV infection. A NAAT is
     available for screening clients for trichomoniasis to aid in diagnosis.

     Preventing Transmission of STIs

     Preventing STI transmission is the single best step individuals can take to protect their sexual health. Several
     strategies are available and should be discussed with clients to help prevent future infections from occurring. The
     most important way to prevent the spread of STIs is through education. Nurses should teach clients how STIs are
     transmitted and how they prevent infections.

     STIs can be transmitted to anyone who has sexual contact (oral, vaginal, anal) with an infected individual, so one
     way to prevent transmission is to reduce unprotected contact. Correct and consistent use of barrier methods of
     protection, such as condoms, can reduce the risk for STI transmission. Clients should be instructed to use either
     latex or polyisoprene condoms because lambskin condoms are too porous to prevent the transmission of many
     organisms that cause STIs. Routine screening for individuals who do not use barrier methods of protection or who
     have multiple sexual partners can also detect STIs earlier, allowing earlier treatment and prevention of
     asymptomatic transmission to other individuals. Reducing the number of sexual partners can also decrease the risk
     for transmission. Finally, vaccination can help prevent several STIs, including HPV and HBV infections. Vaccines
     should be given before the onset of sexual activity because they will have little efficacy if the client has already been
     infected.

     When diagnosed with an STI, the client should be encouraged to have their sexual partners tested as well because
     many infections may be asymptomatic. In addition, an asymptomatic infection may serve as a reservoir for
     transmission back to the client or to other sexual partners. Clients should also be educated to refrain from sexual
     activity while being treated for an STI to prevent transmission.

     Communicating with Partners

     Communication between sexual partners plays a crucial role in preventing the spread of STIs and promoting sexual
     health. Open and honest discussions about sexual history, testing, and protection methods are essential to
     maintaining a safe and responsible sexual relationship. By communicating openly, partners can share information
     about their STI status, discuss previous experiences, and make informed decisions together about contraception
     and safer sex practices. It is important for nurses to help create a nonjudgmental and supportive environment in
     which individuals feel comfortable discussing their sexual health concerns and seeking appropriate medical care
     when needed.

  SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

  Sexually Transmitted Infections

  Health equity refers to the equal chance of every person to be healthy regardless of race, ethnicity, income,
  gender, religion, sexual identity, or disability. Unfortunately, data have shown that certain groups are more prone
  to STIs and encounter various structural and cultural barriers that prevent them from accessing the care they
  deserve (Norris et al., 2019). Notable groups disproportionately affected by STIs include females and some
  members of ethnic and racial minority groups. The reasons for this disparity are complex and multifactorial but
  include having insufficient financial support to access health care, being generally distrustful of the health care
  system, and being sexually active in communities in which sexual partners are more likely to have an STI. No
  single health care professional will be able to fix these problems, but they can educate and foster open and
  honest communication with their clients. This includes teaching them strategies to reduce the risk for acquiring
  an STI, directing the client to resources for preventive devices such as condoms, and fostering a nonjudgmental
  environment to encourage client honesty about their sexual health.

Drugs to Treat STIs

A variety of drugs are used to treat STIs in clinical practice; many were discussed in the previous sections. This
section presents the agents that are appropriate for specific STIs and the concerns regarding resistance issues that
have developed over time.

Antimicrobials
The ideal antimicrobial to treat an STI is one that is effective, has few adverse effects, is inexpensive, and can be
given as a single dose or short course to ensure adherence. However, drug resistance continues to be problematic
for drugs used to treat STIs. Therefore, nurses should make sure to regularly review current guidelines for the
treatment of STIs. The following are common antimicrobials used to treat STIs:

    · Metronidazole: Metronidazole has good activity against anaerobic bacteria and protozoa. For this reason,
        metronidazole is recommended for treatment of BV and trichomoniasis. The client's sexual partners should
        also be treated with metronidazole to prevent reinfection. Metronidazole may be given either orally or as a
        vaginal gel.

    · Clindamycin: Clindamycin is an alternative treatment for BV if metronidazole cannot be used. It can be given
       orally or as a vaginal cream. Oral options are less preferred due to the risk for C. difficile infection and severe
        diarrhea.

    · Penicillin: Penicillin is considered the treatment of choice for syphilis. It can be given as a single-dose, long-
        acting intramuscular injection to assist with client adherence. Continuous intravenous infusion may be
        necessary to treat neurosyphilis.

    · Ciprofloxacin: Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that has some activity against N. gonorrhea and
       C. trachomatis. Due to fluoroquinolone overuse, antimicrobial resistance is a major issue with continued use of
        this drug, and guidelines list ciprofloxacin only as an alternative agent if clients cannot receive other first-line
        therapies such as ceftriaxone or doxycycline. Clients should be educated to avoid taking ciprofloxacin with any
        multivitamins or dairy products because iron and calcium can bind to the drug and render it ineffective.

    · Ceftriaxone: Ceftriaxone is the treatment of choice for gonorrhea. It can be given as a single intramuscular
        injection for most cases of uncomplicated gonorrhea. The main adverse effect expected with this treatment is
        pain at the injection site, which can be offset by mixing ceftriaxone with a local anesthetic such as lidocaine.

    · Doxycycline: Doxycycline is a tetracycline antibiotic that is the treatment of choice for chlamydia. Single doses
        of the macrolide azithromycin used to be the preferred therapy, but due to rising chlamydial resistance,
        doxycycline is now considered first-line therapy. The downside of doxycycline is that it must be given twice
        daily over 7 days, so nurses should impress upon the client the need to take all doses to prevent treatment
        failure and to control resistance.
214  7 · Anti-infective Drugs

     SAFETY ALERT

     Doxycycline

     It is important to educate clients using doxycycline to avoid taking the medication with calcium- or iron-
     containing products to ensure absorption. Clients should also be instructed to avoid prolonged sun exposure and
     to use appropriate sun protection (e.g., physical coverings, sunscreen) to prevent sunburn.

         · Erythromycin: Erythromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that can be used for treating neonatal gonococcal and
             chlamydial infections acquired perinatally from the birthing parent. Known or suspected infections can be
             treated with systemically administered erythromycin, and ophthalmic ointment administered to newborns as
             prophylaxis is standard of care in many U.S. hospitals. Approximately 1 cm in length of ointment should be
             administered into each lower conjunctival sac. The ointment should not be flushed from the eye following
             instillation. A new tube should be used for each infant.

     Antivirals
     Although not curative for any viral STIs, the antivirals acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir are used to help
     manage the symptoms of HSV and prevent spread to sexual partners. Nurses should inform clients taking antivirals
     for STIs that even if they do not have active lesions, viral shedding can still occur and thereby spread the infection to
     partners. If clients are taking antivirals for episodic management of HSV-related lesions, they should begin therapy
     within 24 hours of symptom onset to ensure drug efficacy. Chronic suppressive therapy, in which clients take the
     medication every day regardless of symptom status, can help prevent spread to sexual partners, but nurses should
     instruct clients to use additional protective measures such as condoms if the partner does not have HSV.

     Table 7.11 lists commonly used medications to treat STIs and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

     Nursing Implications
     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking medications for STIs:

     · Monitor for signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis (e.g., shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, difficulty
        swallowing).

     · Advise the client to take the entire prescribed course of the drug to ensure adequate treatment and to reduce
        the development of drug resistance.

     · Instruct the client to maintain adequate hydration; monitor kidney function for renally eliminated medications
        such as penicillin and ciprofloxacin.

     · Educate about safer sex practices and ways to avoid STIs in the future.
     · Mix ceftriaxone with lidocaine, as ordered, to reduce the pain of intramuscular injections for treatment of

        gonorrhea.

    · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client
        teaching guidelines.

  CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

  The client taking a medication for an STI should:

      · Alert their health care provider about any signs of allergic reactions, including throat swelling, severe
          itching, rash, or chest tightness.

      · Alert their health care provider that they are taking these medications, including the dose and frequency.
      · Take the drug with food if it causes an upset stomach.
      · Take a missed dose as soon as they remember; however, they should not take double doses.
      · Avoid consuming alcohol when receiving metronidazole/tinidazole treatment.
      · Avoid taking ciprofloxacin or doxycycline with iron- or calcium-containing products because they will

          prevent the drug from being absorbed.
      · Use sunscreen or protective coverings while out in the sun to prevent rash or sunburn when taking

          doxycycline.
      · Refrain from sexual activity while taking medications for an STI.
      · Use barrier methods such as condoms to help prevent transmission of HSV because transmission can

          occur even when no active lesions are present.
      · Encourage all sexual partners to be tested as well to determine whether they also require treatment.

Tubercular Infections

Tuberculosis (TB) is a deadly respiratory infection primarily caused by the organism Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Worldwide, TB is the second leading cause of infectious deaths after COVID-19 (World Health Organization, 2023a).
Although TB is less of a concern in high-income nations, it is still a major cause for concern in lower-income nations
and in clients at greater risk, including those who are immunocompromised and those living in close contact with
other people (e.g., prisons, shelters, nursing homes). TB has been found to disproportionately affect marginalized
racial and ethnic groups who already have limited access to health care and are most susceptible to the devastating
effects of TB (CDC, 2018).

M. tuberculosis is a slow-growing mycobacterium that possesses a cellular envelope made up of mycolic acid, which
makes it difficult for conventional antibiotics to penetrate and inhibit cellular growth. After an individual inhales
aerosol droplets containing M. tuberculosis, they may either clear the organism immediately, develop an active TB
infection, or develop latent TB, in which the organism goes into a dormant state. Latent TB can reside in the person's
lungs for years, waiting to activate either spontaneously or through an episode of immunosuppression that can be
brought on by conditions such as HIV, diabetes, end-stage kidney disease, or the use of corticosteroids (e.g.,
dexamethasone, prednisone).

Individuals with TB typically present with common signs and symptoms, including weight loss, fatigue, productive
cough, fever, and night sweats. Other signs and symptoms may include chest pain and hemoptysis (coughing up of
blood). The health care provider should order a chest x-ray and then sputum samples if the x-ray shows infiltrates
216  7 · Anti-infective Drugs

     suggestive of TB. Common findings on chest x-ray in clients with TB include mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pleural
     effusion, and pulmonary consolidation. Cases of latent TB are often screened for using tuberculin skin tests or
     interferon gamma release assay. Skin testing introduces tuberculin protein under the skin; redness and swelling
     (induration) at the injection site due to the presence of TB antibodies indicates latent TB infection. If clients show
     positive results from these tests, they will be referred for more diagnostic testing, including a chest x-ray to
     determine whether a latent infection is present.

     First-Line Drug Therapy

     Once a definitive diagnosis of TB has been made, treatment specific for TB should begin immediately. Due to the
     difficulty of drug penetration and the slow-growing nature of the organism, TB treatment requires at least 6 months
     of therapy. Failure to adhere to TB therapy can lead to clinical worsening in the client and more resistant strains of
     M. tuberculosis. Traditionally, clients with an active TB infection begin therapy with a four-drug regimen consisting of
     isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for 2 months followed by 4 additional months of isoniazid and
     rifampin. The specific drugs used and their durations may be altered depending on client comorbidities and TB
     resistance.

          CLINICAL TIP

      Antitubercular Drug Compliance

       Adherence to antitubercular drug regimens is critical to ensure eradication of the infection and prevention of
       drug-resistant strains of TB. One way to help ensure adherence is by using directly observed therapy, in which a
       trained observer watches the client take every dose of their TB medication. This can take place in the clinic,
       home care agency, correctional facility, or treatment center. Directly observed therapy helps provide stability and
       accountability and has been shown to increase antitubercular drug therapy completion. Directly observed
       therapy can even be completed electronically if that is more convenient for the client (Burzynski et al., 2022).

     Drugs used to treat TB include:

         · Ethambutol hydrochloride: Ethambutol inhibits RNA synthesis in susceptible mycobacteria to suppress
             cellular replication.

         · Isoniazid: Isoniazid is an important component of the antitubercular regimen and works by inhibiting the
             production of mycolic acid. This inhibition disrupts the integrity of the mycobacterial cell wall, causing cell
             death.

         · Pyrazinamide: Pyrazinamide is used during the first 2 months of therapy. Its mechanism for inhibiting
            M. tuberculosis is not fully known, but it is thought to reduce the pH of the local environment and discourage
             mycobacterial growth.

         · Rifamycins: Rifampin, rifabutin, and rifapentine belong to the rifamycin class. These medications work to
             inhibit mycobacterial growth by binding to the enzyme RNA polymerase to reduce the cell's ability to produce
             new proteins, thereby stifling growth.

     Drug Therapy for Multidrug-Resistant Tubercular Infections

     Growing resistance to standard therapy is an ongoing concern for health care professionals managing TB. Health
     care providers should take care to select agents that the mycobacterium is susceptible to and weigh that efficacy
     against the adverse effect profiles of these agents. Selection should be based on sensitivity testing performed on
     samples collected from the client at the time of diagnosis and is made based on the discretion of an expert in
     infectious disease. Alternative agents include aminosalicylate sodium, capreomycin, ethionamide, and
     streptomycin. Resistant cases of TB should be referred to infectious disease specialists to ensure appropriate
     management of these complex cases.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Antituberculosis medications are known to cause gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhea. A contraindication to any antituberculosis drug is known hypersensitivity.

Ethambutol is partially renally eliminated, so the dose should be adjusted in clients with renal dysfunction. The
major adverse effects seen with ethambutol are optic nerve inflammation, changes in visual acuity, and loss of
ability to distinguish between the colors red and green.

Isoniazid is a known hepatotoxin; serial liver function tests should be performed to determine whether therapy
should be altered. Isoniazid also can cause neurotoxicity, including peripheral neuropathies at standard doses and
seizures and coma in overdose. Clients particularly at risk for neurotoxicity include those who are pyridoxine
deficient (e.g., pregnant clients, individuals with excessive alcohol intake).
218  7 · Anti-infective Drugs

          SAFETY ALERT

      Isoniazid

       Nurses must inform clients that they should have their liver function assessed regularly while on isoniazid to
       monitor for liver toxicity. The client should also abstain from excessive alcohol use, which may increase the risk
       for hepatotoxicity. Excessive drinking includes binge drinking (4 or more drinks during a single occasion for
       females or 5 or more drinks during a single occasion for males) and heavy drinking (8 or more drinks per week for
       females or 15 or more drinks per week for males).

     Pyrazinamide also is a known hepatotoxin, so serial liver function tests should be monitored for evidence of liver
     injury. In addition, pyrazinamide raises uric acid levels.

     Rifampin and rifapentine are potent inducers of CYP3A4. These drugs can prove a challenging addition to a client's
     medication regimen because induction of CYP3A4 can speed the metabolism of affected drugs and lead to
     therapeutic failure. Medication profiles should be examined closely and adjustments made to account for the
     inclusion of rifampin and rifapentine. Rifabutin has much less CYP3A4 induction and causes fewer drug interactions,
     making it an alternative to rifampin. Rifampin can cause the client's secretions (e.g., urine, tears, sweat) to turn an
     orange to red color, which clients should be warned about before they start therapy. Rifampin is another TB drug
     that requires monitoring for elevations in liver function tests because it may worsen hepatic function.

     Nursing Implications
     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking an antitubercular drug:

         · Monitor for signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis (e.g., shortness of breath, difficulty swallowing, etc.).
         · Advise the client to take the entire prescribed regimen to ensure adequate treatment and to reduce the

             development of drug resistance.
         · Tell the client to report signs and symptoms of liver impairment (e.g., yellowish skin, vomiting, abdominal pain,

             dark urine) that may occur while clients are taking isoniazid, rifampin, or pyrazinamide.
         · Screen clients using rifampin for any medication interactions and alert the health care provider as needed.
         · Monitor uric acid levels as well as liver function tests for clients taking pyrazinamide.
         · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

             teaching guidelines.

       CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

       The client taking an antitubercular drug should:

           · Alert their health care provider about any signs of allergic reactions, including throat swelling, severe
               itching, rash, or chest tightness.

           · Alert their health care provider that they are taking these medications, including the dose and frequency.
           · Take the drug with food if it causes an upset stomach.
           · Take a missed dose as soon as they remember; however, they should not take double doses.
           · Alert their health care provider about any visual changes, such as decreased ability to see certain colors,

               while on ethambutol.

     Parasitic Infections

     In the United States, parasitic infections can affect anyone, but they disproportionately affect
     immunocompromised individuals, members of racial and ethnic minority groups, and those with low income.
     Parasitic infections are defined by the relationship been the host (human) and the parasite. Common types of
     parasitic infections are caused by protozoa and helminths.

         · Protozoa: Protozoa are unicellular organisms that replicate within a human host. Examples of protozoal
            infections include those caused by Giardia, Plasmodium, and Babesia. Many of these conditions affect clients
             living in areas with poor sanitation because the spread can be attributed to either fecal-contaminated water or
             fecal-oral transfer. Signs and symptoms of protozoal infections include diarrhea, low-grade fever, nausea,
             greasy stools, and depressed appetite. Intestinal protozoal infections are most often diagnosed from
             microscopic stool samples, although molecular tests have recently been developed that may allow faster
             detection of infections.

         · Helminths: Helminths, or worms, are large complex organisms that can be consumed while they are in a larval
             stage and then mature into their adult stage in the host's gastrointestinal tract. Common signs and symptoms
             include abdominal pain and diarrhea; however, infections can also be asymptomatic. Similar to protozoal
             infections, microscopic examination of stool samples can reveal helminth eggs and aid in diagnosis.

     Antiparasitic Drugs

     This section covers the most frequently used antiparasitic drugs, including their mechanisms, adverse effects,
     indications, and contraindications. It is important to ensure that an accurate diagnosis has been made regarding the
     causative organism because this will dictate which medication is most appropriate for the client. Some of the most
     common antiparasitic drugs include:

         · Metronidazole: For Giardia lamblia, Trichomonas vaginalis, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Toxoplasmosis
            gondii, metronidazole is the drug of choice. It provides good coverage against Entamoeba, Giardia, and
            Trichomonas, which are the species that cause infection.

         · Tinidazole: Tinidazole is structurally related to metronidazole and has similar actions, adverse effects, and
             interactions. It also has a longer half-life than metronidazole, so dosing is more convenient. However,
             tinidazole is much more expensive than metronidazole. Tinidazole is contraindicated in clients consuming
             alcohol while using the drug due to risk for causing a severe flushing reaction.

         · Nitazoxanide: Nitazoxanide is an alternative antiparasitic that can be used to treat giardiasis and
             cryptosporidiosis. Its full mechanism is unknown, but it is thought to disrupt the ability of these
             microorganisms to undergo anaerobic metabolism, leading to cell death. Nitazoxanide is well tolerated but
             can cause some gastrointestinal signs and symptoms.

         · Scabicides and pediculicides: Scabicides and pediculicides are designed to treat infestations caused by lice
             and scabies. Lice, depending on the species, can cause symptoms on the head, body, or genitals. Collectively,
             this condition is known as pediculosis. Lice can be difficult to treat because if the eggs (nits) are not
             successfully removed from the hair after treatment, reinfestation can occur. Nit combs can be indispensable
             along with pediculicides. All agents in this category are applied topically to the affected area.

                                                                      7.6 · Antiparasitic and Anthelminthic Drugs            221

· Permethrin: Permethrin has a wide range of activity against a variety of arthropods, which makes it useful for
   lice infestations. Permethrin works by causing neuronal hyperpolarization and paralysis in the organism,
   leading to death.

· Lindane: Lindane has activity against lice and scabies and works by being absorbed into the parasite's
   exoskeleton, leading to seizures and death.

· Malathion: Malathion comes from a group of chemicals known as organophosphates, which have been used as
   agricultural insecticides for many years. It works by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which is
   responsible for metabolizing acetylcholine. This causes a buildup of acetylcholine, leading to overstimulation,
   paralysis, and death of the parasite.

· Spinosad: Spinosad is another topical antiparasitic with activity against scabies and lice. It works by inducing
   neuronal excitation and eventual paralysis and death of the organism. The most common adverse effects seen
   with spinosad include redness and skin irritation at the application site.

CLINICAL TIP

Ensure Removal of Nits

Nits are the eggs of lice that attach to the hair, and they are unaffected by pediculicides. To ensure that nits do
not go on to mature into adults requiring further pediculicide treatment, it is important to carefully comb through
the hair with a fine-tooth nit comb after using a pediculicide. Shaving the head is a viable alternative, but this is
not a desirable outcome for many clients.

Anthelminthic Drugs

The available anthelminthic agents are broad spectrum and can treat a variety of worms, including roundworms,
pinworms, hookworms, and whipworms. Because worm infections occur in the gastrointestinal tract, these agents
are taken orally.

    · Mebendazole: Mebendazole works by inhibiting microtubule formation in susceptible helminths and blocking
        glucose uptake. This action leads to eventual death of the worm, after which it can be passed through the
        feces.

    · Ivermectin: Ivermectin is an interesting antiparasitic agent because it has activity as both a pediculicide and
        an antihelminth. When used topically, it can treat lice and scabies infestations; when taken orally, it can treat a
        variety of helminth infections. Ivermectin works by inhibiting parasite nerve and muscle tissue, causing
        paralysis and death of the organism.

Table 7.15 lists antiparasitic and anthelminthic drugs and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

Drug           Routes and Dosage Ranges

Lindane        Head lice: Apply 30-60 mL shampoo to dry hair and massage into hair for 4 min; add small
               quantities of water to hair until lather forms, then rinse hair and comb with fine-tooth comb to
               remove nits.

Mebendazole    Ascariasis: 100 mg orally twice daily for 3 days or 500 mg orally once daily.
  (Emverm)

Metronidazole  Giardiasis: 250 mg orally 3 times daily for 5-7 days.
    (Flagyl)   Trichomoniasis: 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days.
               Amebiasis: 500 mg orally every 8 hours for 7-10 days.

Nitazoxanide   Giardiasis: 500 mg orally every 12 hours for 3 days.
    (Alinia)

Permethrin     Head lice: Apply enough lotion or cream to saturate hair. Leave on for 10 min and then rinse
 (Elimite)     with warm water.

Spinosad       Head lice: Apply sufficient amount to cover scalp.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Most oral antiprotozoal and anthelminthic drugs can cause gastrointestinal upset. Any topical scabicides and
     pediculicides may cause skin irritation to the area where they are applied. Excessive use of lindane is not
     recommended in high doses, especially in children, because it can cause central nervous system excitation and
     seizure. Malathion should be kept away from children because ingesting it could cause cholinergic poisoning.

     Nursing Implications
     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking antiparasitic or anthelminthic drugs:

     · Monitor for signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis (e.g., shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, difficulty
        swallowing).

     · Advise the client to take the entire prescribed course of the medication to ensure adequate treatment and to
        reduce the development of drug resistance.

     · Instruct the client to maintain adequate hydration; monitor kidney function for renally eliminated medications.
     · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

        teaching guidelines.

     CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

     The client taking an antiparasitic or anthelminthic drug should:

         · Alert their health care provider about any signs of allergic reactions including throat swelling, severe
             itching, rash, or chest tightness.

         · Alert their health care provider that they are taking these medications, including the dose and frequency.
         · Take the drug with food if it causes an upset stomach.
         · Take a missed dose as soon as they remember; however, they should not take double doses.

INTRODUCTION Cancer is a broad term used to describe the development of cell mutations that cause
unrestricted cell growth, ultimately resulting in malignant neoplasms or tumors (benign overgrowths can also occur
but will not be discussed in this chapter). These malignancies can occur in many areas of the body and can
metastasize, or spread, to other sites from which the tumor originated.
Cancer care is a large part of the health care economy. However, when considering cancer care, nurses should be
aware that there are many disparities in the provision of cancer care. Nurses should consider these disparities in
order to understand the issues and challenges for clients and health care providers. Nurses must be client
advocates to help negate those disparities in the care of clients with cancer. The National Cancer Institute provides
substantial information about the disparities and effects on client care (https://openstax.org/r/cancergov).

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 8.1.1 Describe cancer and cancer development.
         · 8.1.2 Discuss contributing theories of environmental versus genetic etiologies of cancer development.
         · 8.1.3 Identify the characteristics of cancer cells.
         · 8.1.4 Describe different types of cancer.

     Cancer Development

     Each day, the human body experiences cell mutations that result in a change in cellular structure, which may lead to
     cancer development. When this happens, the intracellular machinery may be able to repair the mutation, or the
     body's immune system recognizes these cells as abnormal and attacks them. These are two innate defenses against
     cancer development. When either defense fails, cancer development can occur. There are multiple theories about
     the causes of cancer development. The most common theories are based on environmental exposures and genetic
     predispositions as causes of cancer development.

     Environmental and Genetic Factors

     Environmental exposures are outside factors that can cause cell mutations when the body is exposed to them. Most
     commonly, these factors include exposure to tobacco products, benzenes, petroleum-based products, asbestos,
     and certain drugs, including chemotherapies. There are many other substances that are classified as carcinogens, or
     cancer-causing agents. Somatic mutations occur from carcinogen exposures after birth. They do not develop from
     genetic mutations and do not affect germ cells that become ova and sperm.

      Environmental Exposure in a Community: Love Canal, New York

       Access multimedia content (https://openstax.org/books/pharmacology/pages/8-1-introduction-to-cancer-and-
       phases-of-cancer-therapy)
       One of the earliest findings of cancer and other diseases directly linked to environmental exposures occurred in
       the small community of Love Canal, Niagara Falls, in upstate New York. The story of Love Canal, while very
       unfortunate, brought about widespread change in environmental protection and regulation of toxic substances.

     Genetic factors are those internal predispositions to cellular changes that result in cancer development. For
     example, clients who inherit the breast cancer oncogenes (BRCA1 and BRCA2) have a much higher chance of
     developing breast cancer than clients without these mutations (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC],
     2020). These are considered to be germline mutations that develop in the eggs or sperm of a parent and are passed
     on to offspring.

          LINK TO LEARNING

      Oncogenes and Breast Cancer

       Because genetic mutations that cause specific cancers to develop are present at birth, screening for the
       presence of some of these oncogenes (https://openstax.org/r/cdcgovgenomics) is now possible. When these
       oncogenes are identified before cancer has developed, clients now have options for improved surveillance and
       early detection and intervention. This promotes better outcomes for those clients who were born with hereditary
       gene mutations. The breast cancer antigen mutations 1 and 2 (BRCA1, BRCA2) are two of the most well-
       understood oncogenes.

     Additional theories are based on immune system failure and the effects that physical and mental stress have on the
     body's ability to defend itself. Cell mutations occur frequently throughout the human body, but these cells are
     usually targeted and either repaired or destroyed by the immune system. When the immune system fails to

8.1 · Introduction to Cancer and Phases of Cancer Therapy                                                                                   229

recognize mutated cells, these cells continue replication, forming a tumor. Other illnesses, physical stress, and
mental distress are some factors that decrease the effectiveness of the immune-system functions. When
considering theories of cancer development, most researchers agree that a combination of causative factors, rather
than one single theory, contributes to cancer development (Mbemi et al., 2020).

Cellular Changes

Once a cancer-causing mutation occurs, if it is unable to be repaired, the mutated cells continue to divide, resulting
in the development of a tumor or malignancy (see Figure 8.2). These cells lose many of the regulatory
characteristics of normal cells, including contact inhibition and a regulated rate of mitosis. Tumors also have the
property of neoangiogenesis, which is the ability to grow new blood vessels to support the metabolic needs
associated with the abnormal growth. As these cells continue to grow, they can result in physical changes that
greatly affect the function of the body.

Pain, compression, nutritional deficiencies, weight loss, and fluid and electrolyte imbalances are some of the effects
that can occur with cancer development. However, tumors can also go unnoticed for many years. As growth
continues, cancerous cells can metastasize to distant sites through direct extension into surrounding tissues,
through seeding, and by embolization into the lymph and circulatory systems.

Cancer Types

Cancers are classified either by the type of tissue in which the cancer originates (histological type) or by the location
in the body where the cancer originated (primary site) (National Cancer Institute, n.d.). Health care providers tend to
refer to a cancer's histological type, while clients more frequently refer to the cancer's location. Many types of
cancer will form tumors. Solid tumors are cancers that form in tissues of bones, skin, organs, and muscles. Liquid, or
hematologic, tumors arise in the bone marrow and involve blood and lymphatic cells. Typically, regardless of tumor
type, pharmacologic treatment will involve medications with systemic effects.

Solid Tumors
Solid tumors develop as a mass of cancer cells that originate in a specific area of the body. Adenocarcinomas and
squamous cell carcinomas are two common pathological types of solid tumors. Adenocarcinomas develop in
230  8 · Introduction to Cancer Therapy and Cancer Drugs

     glandular and epithelial tissues, while squamous cell carcinomas arise in the skin or in the lining of the respiratory
     and gastrointestinal system (National Cancer Institute, n.d.). Another type of solid tumor that is less common is a
     sarcoma. These tumors may form in soft tissues including fat, muscles, nerves, vessels, and skin. Sarcomas may
     also form in bones and most often affect young adults. In the United States, lung, prostate, and breast cancers are
     the leading causes of cancer-related mortality (National Cancer Institute, n.d.).

     Hematologic (Liquid) Tumors
     Hematologic cancers are cancers that arise in the bone marrow and involve blood cells, especially white blood cells
     and their precursors, and lymphocytes. These cancers are often called liquid tumors because they originate in the
     bone marrow and flow in the bloodstream. In the United States, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, and multiple
     myeloma are the three most common hematologic cancers, respectively. These types of tumors present multiple
     issues because they exist in the vascular system, circulating through all parts of the body. When these cells are
     destroyed by chemotherapy, cellular debris and electrolytes are released into the blood. This may result in tumor
     lysis syndrome (TLS), a life-threatening condition that is characterized by acidosis, hyperkalemia,
     hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. When chemotherapy is given for a blood tumor in which high numbers of
     cancer cells are in the blood, clients must be pretreated with hydration therapy, allopurinol or rasburicase, and
     management of electrolytes. While tumor lysis occurs most commonly in hematologic cancers, it may occasionally
     occur with solid tumors that are very large and bulky.

          LINK TO LEARNING

      Tumor Lysis Syndrome

       Tumor lysis syndrome is considered an oncologic or medical emergency, which without immediate recognition
       and treatment can result in fatal outcomes. The Cleveland Clinic has provided important updates about this
       syndrome (https://openstax.org/r/clevelandclinicorg) that can occur within hours of cancer treatment.

     8.2 Chemotherapeutic Drugs

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 8.2.1 Identify principles of proper handling of chemotherapeutic agents.
         · 8.2.2 Discuss different administration methods, phases, routes of administration, and types of

             chemotherapy.
         · 8.2.3 Describe major side effects of chemotherapeutic agents.
         · 8.2.4 Identify characteristics of different classes of chemotherapeutic agents used in cancer treatment.
         · 8.2.5 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of chemotherapeutic agents

             used in cancer treatment.
         · 8.2.6 Describe the nursing implications of chemotherapeutic agents.
         · 8.2.7 Explain the client education related to chemotherapeutic agents.

     Handling of Chemotherapeutic Agents

     The complexity of administering chemotherapy and caring for clients that have been treated with cancer therapies
     requires advanced knowledge. Special training and certifications to administer chemotherapy are required.
     Chemotherapy agents may cause cytotoxic exposure to those who compound and administer these drugs as well as
     to clients, families, and other caretakers who might be exposed through spills, improper handling and disposal, and
     other means. Proper training in compounding, administering, and managing exposure emergencies is a requirement
     of all personnel who work with chemotherapy. Principles of appropriate handling include, but are not limited to,
     storage of cytotoxic substances in impervious containers, double gloving (chemotherapy-rated gloves),
     compounding in a negative-pressure hood, and disposing of cytotoxic substances based on national standards and
     institutional policies.

TRENDING TODAY

Chemotherapy Administration Safety Standards

The Oncology Nursing Society, a leader in developing oncology standards, developed chemotherapy
administration guidelines and safety standards (https://openstax.org/r/onsorgonf) to assist nurses in safely
administering chemotherapy and other cancer treatments. Advances in technology, cancer treatment, and
nursing training prompted the need for a periodic review and revision of the standards for general oncology
practices. The latest standards include pediatric oncology practices and new standards affecting chemotherapy
prescription, preparation, and administration (Oncology Nursing Society, 2023).

Cancer Treatments

Chemotherapy may be given for many different reasons. Often, it is given as a curative measure to eradicate all
malignant cells. However, cure is not always realistic. When cure is not attainable, chemotherapy can be used to
decrease tumor size and prevent metastasis, and sometimes it may be used for palliation and symptom control.
Differing regimens of chemotherapy are used for varying client needs (see Table 8.1).

Type of Therapy      Description

Adjuvant therapy     Given after initial treatment with surgery to destroy leftover cells

Neoadjuvant therapy  Initial treatment given to shrink the cancer before surgery

Salvage therapy      Second-line therapy given when first-line therapy is unsuccessful

Targeted therapy     Given to selectively kill cancer cells without harming normal cells

Biologic therapy     Used to enable the immune system to better kill cancer cells

Chemotherapy Treatment

Access multimedia content (https://openstax.org/books/pharmacology/pages/8-2-chemotherapeutic-drugs)
This video describes the typical day and process of the treatment of a client receiving chemotherapy.

Phases of Chemotherapy

There are three phases of chemotherapy, beginning with induction. This phase is also known as first-line, front-line,
or primary therapy. During this phase, the goal is to induce a remission. For most tumors, this may be the only phase
required. For hematological cancers, clients may undergo a second phase, called consolidation, intensification, or
post-remission therapy. This phase is used after a remission has been achieved, with a goal of eradicating any
remaining cancer cells. The third phase, the maintenance phase, may be used either after induction or after
consolidation. In this phase, a maintenance dose of chemotherapy is given to prevent reoccurrence of cancer. This
phase is the longest phase and may last for several years.

Routes of Chemotherapy Administration

Chemotherapy may be administered by different routes depending on the purpose and toxicities of each individual
drug. These different routes include oral, intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intracavitary, topically, and
intrathecally. Intracavitary administration involves the infusion of a chemotherapeutic agent into a body cavity such
as the bladder or abdomen. Intrathecal administration involves instilling chemotherapy into the spinal column or
intracranially to treat cancers in the central nervous system. For drugs that are vesicants, which have the ability to
cause necrosis if they extravasate, the intravenous route must be used. When a vesicant drug is being
administered, slow administration in a rate/minute modality and vigilant assessment of the intravenous infusion site
must be performed. Maintaining patency of the administration site is paramount to preventing tissue injury (see
Figure 8.3).
232  8 · Introduction to Cancer Therapy and Cancer Drugs

     FIGURE 8.3 Vesicants can cause severe damage that can take months to heal. (credit: "This image depicted a view of the volar surface of a
     patient's right forearm, highlighting a number of erythematous, well-circumscribed lesions, which had resulted from an infection known as
     tinea corporis, more commonly referred to as ringworm" by Dr. Lucille K. Georg/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Public Domain)

          CLINICAL TIP

     Administering Vesicant Drugs

     When administering a vesicant drug, the nurse should use extreme caution. If, for any reason, the nurse feels that
     an intravenous site could be compromised, the infusion should be immediately stopped and a new access
     obtained. Should an actual extravasation occur, the health care provider should be notified and any applicable
     protocols should be followed.

     Chemotherapy may be given by different routes, depending on the cancer location. When cancer develops in a body
     cavity or in the brain or spinal column, treatment may require the use of special routes of administration to
     overcome the blood-brain barrier or to increase effectiveness by placing drug therapy more directly at the tumor
     site. Table 8.2 describes the different methods of chemotherapy administration.

     Method of Chemotherapy           Description
     Administration

     Oral                             Tablets, capsules, or liquids that are swallowed

     Intravenous                      Liquid preparations administered into a vein via peripheral or central
                                      catheters

     Injection                        Liquid preparations administered via intramuscular or subcutaneous
                                      injections

     Intrathecal                      Injected by syringe or catheter directly into the brain or spinal cord

     Intraperitoneal                  Injected or infused via catheter into the peritoneal cavity

     Intracavitary                    Injected or infused via catheter into a body cavity such as the bladder

     Intraarterial                    Injected directly into an artery flowing to tumor sites

     Topical                          Applied directly to the skin or tumor site

     TABLE 8.2 Routes of Chemotherapy Administration

     Types of Chemotherapy

     There are many different classifications of chemotherapy drugs, many of which fall into one of two broad
     categories--cell-cycle specific and cell-cycle nonspecific therapies. Each cell goes through five phases of mitosis

8.2 · Chemotherapeutic Drugs                                                                                                                    233

before producing daughter cells (see Figure 8.4). Chemotherapy agents that cause cancer cell death in all phases of
mitosis are referred to as cell-cycle nonspecific (CCNS), whereas those that are effective only in one phase of
mitosis are called cell-cycle specific agents (CCS). In combination chemotherapy, both CCS and NCCS agents are
used to eliminate cancer cells more completely.

FIGURE 8.4 One phase of the cell cycle includes mitosis, when the cell divides. During this phase, the duplicated chromosomes are
segregated and distributed into daughter nuclei. Following mitosis, the cytoplasm is usually divided as well by cytokinesis, resulting in two
genetically identical daughter cells (credit: modification of work from Biology 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC

Side Effects of Chemotherapy

Side effects of chemotherapy vary from client to client and drug to drug. However, most chemotherapies have
overlapping side effects. Each of these side effects must be managed appropriately to protect the client and
promote positive outcomes. Nurses who care for clients receiving chemotherapy must possess excellent
assessment skills to recognize and treat these side effects early.

Most chemotherapies work by interrupting DNA or RNA synthesis. These chemicals are most effective in eliminating
cells that are most rapidly reproducing, with high mitotic rates. Unfortunately, chemotherapy cannot tell the
difference in cells that are abnormally dividing versus normally rapidly dividing; therefore, the client may experience
effects on normal cells as well. This includes hair, nails, skin, mucus membranes, the lining of the gastrointestinal
system, and, most importantly, the stem cells within the bone marrow.

Major Side Effects
Most chemotherapy agents have major side effects in common. These include myelosuppression, alopecia, nausea
and vomiting, skin or nail changes, and late-term effect, including secondary cancers. Myelosuppression is one of
the most common effects of chemotherapy. This occurs as chemotherapy affects the stem cells in the bone marrow,
resulting in decreased production of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Myelosuppression affecting red
blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets all together is referred to as pancytopenia. Without proper support
during this myelosuppression, clients may experience sepsis, bleeding, and hypoxemia, which may result in
increased mortality rates. Frequent monitoring of the client's complete blood count is imperative. In some
regimens, pancytopenia may happen very rapidly, in just a few days, while with other regimens, myelosuppression
may not occur for 7-14 days or longer. The nadir period, or lowest point of myelosuppression, differs for each
specific chemotherapy. Clients must be monitored closely after receiving myelosuppressive therapies for the nadir
period, which predisposes clients to safety issues including infection, bleeding, impaired oxygenation, and falls.
Protective measures must be instituted to prevent these from occurring, and the nurse must teach clients self-care
principles (see Client Teaching Guidelines).
234  8 · Introduction to Cancer Therapy and Cancer Drugs

       CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

       To prevent infection, the client receiving chemotherapy should:

           · Bathe daily to reduce bacterial colonization.
           · Cleanse their mouth after each meal and at bedtime.
           · Cook eggs, meats, and seafood thoroughly to decrease the risk of foodborne illness.
           · Use gloves when gardening to protect hands from direct contact with soil, which can contain bacteria and

               mold.
           · Increase dietary fluids and fiber.
           · Notify their health care provider for a temperature greater than 100.4°F (38°C), productive cough,

               diarrhea, or urinary burning, urgency, or frequency.

       To prevent infection, the client receiving chemotherapy should not:

           · Eat raw fruits and vegetables to decrease the risk of developing a foodborne illness.
           · Eat wild game such as deer, rabbits, and pheasants to decrease the risk of ingesting contaminated meat.
           · Clean cat litter boxes to decrease the risk of contact with bacteria or parasites.

     Neutropenia, leukopenia, and granulocytopenia occur when the white cell indices (neutrophils, leukocytes,
     granulocytes) are decreased. This is typically defined as having an absolute neutrophil count less than 1.5 cells/
     mcL. When this occurs, the client may be prescribed prophylactic antibiotic therapy that may include broad-
     spectrum gram-positive, broad-spectrum gram-negative, and/or antifungal agents to assist in preventing sepsis.
     (See Anti-infective Drugs.) Clients with neutropenia present a fragile and complicated situation, especially in regard
     to nursing care and assessments. It is common for severely neutropenic clients to acquire infections, and even
     sepsis, with few clinical symptoms. Vigilant nursing assessment is a priority in preventing negative client outcomes.
     With low white blood cell counts, normal immune responses to infection may be absent. For example, a client who
     has developed a local infection at a central venous access site would normally display warmth, redness, and edema
     at the site. However, that same client, when experiencing neutropenia, would not exhibit these symptoms. During
     this time of decreased immunity, clients may also be treated with biologic colony stimulating agents such as
     filgrastim or pegfilgrastim. These drugs stimulate increases in stem cell production of white blood cells, accelerating
     a client's recovery from white blood cell destruction.

          CLINICAL TIP

      Febrile Neutropenia

       Febrile neutropenia occurs when a client has an absolute neutrophil count that is less than 1.5 per microliter,
       accompanied by a body temperature above 100.4ºF. When it occurs, febrile neutropenia should become first
       priority for assessment and intervention. The health care provider should be called immediately. Typically, blood
       cultures will be obtained, and the client will begin empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics. Failure to recognize and
       treat febrile neutropenia may result in life-threatening sepsis.

     Thrombocytopenia, another result of myelosuppression, results in increased risk of bleeding as the number of
     circulating platelets (thrombocytes) decreases. Thrombocytopenia may cause gastrointestinal hemorrhage,
     intracerebral bleeding, and other sites of bleeding such as gum and scleral hemorrhages. Platelet counts less than
     50,000 per microliter require special precautions; below 20,000, the bleeding risk greatly increases, and the client
     may require platelet transfusions.

       CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

       To prevent bleeding, the client being treated for thrombocytopenia should:

           · Use tooth sponges for oral care to decrease the risk of bleeding secondary to brushing. Avoid alcohol-

8.2 · Chemotherapeutic Drugs                                                                                               235

          based mouthwash, which can dry the mouth and increase the risk of bleeding.
      · Increase dietary fluids and fiber.
      · Use stool softeners and fiber laxatives to produce regular, soft bowel movements.

  To prevent bleeding, the client being treated for thrombocytopenia should not:

      · Participate in contact sports or other activities that could cause bleeding.

Erythrocytopenia (anemia), a decrease in the production of red blood cells (erythrocytes), is another result of
myelosuppression. Red blood cells function to carry oxygen to tissues, remove carbon dioxide from tissues, and
provide volume within the intravascular space. When red blood cell counts decrease, clients may become
hypoxemic when there are not enough red blood cells to transport oxygen. This results in fatigue and shortness of
breath. Hypovolemia also occurs, in which decreased numbers of circulating red blood cells cause lowered vascular
pressure. Clients may then experience orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and disequilibrium. Clients may require
transfusions of packed red blood cells, hydration with isotonic intravenous fluids, and oxygen. To decrease the
occurrence of erythrocytopenia, clients may be given biologic colony stimulators to increase red blood cell
production. These include epoetin alfa and darbepoetin.

  CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

  To promote oxygenation, the client with anemia (erythrocytopenia) should:

      · Schedule activities around periods of rest.
      · Notify the health care provider if shortness of breath increases or does not resolve with rest.
      · Sit on the side of the bed or chair for a few minutes before rising.

  To promote oxygenation, the client with anemia (erythrocytopenia) should not:

      · Perform tasks or engage in activities that cause shortness of breath.

Alopecia, or hair loss, is a side effect of some chemotherapies. Drugs such as doxorubicin damage hair follicles,
which results in partial or complete hair loss. While this is not usually permanent, it will last throughout the duration
of the treatments. Although this is not harmful for the client physically, it may be very difficult for a client
emotionally and socially. Hair loss ultimately affects body image and self-esteem and may cause others to be
uncomfortable around the client. Regrowth of hair usually begins within 6 months after treatments have finished
(American Cancer Society, 2021).

Skin and nail changes may occur with administration of some types of cancer treatments. Skin rashes (erythema) or
peeling of the skin on the hands and feet may occur. Hyperpigmentation of the skin and nail beds may develop as
well. Tactile effects may cause neuropathic pain or increased sensitivity to cold. Nails may break, crack, or fall off.
The nurse must provide care to prevent the development of infection should the nails or skin become broken.

Chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting is another common side effect and can vary from drug to drug and
client to client. Risk factors for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting include female sex, clients who
experienced nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, age less than 50 years, and incidence of nausea and vomiting
with previous chemotherapy treatments. Dehydration and electrolyte imbalances are also associated with increased
nausea and vomiting. While there is pharmacological support for nausea and vomiting, some chemotherapeutic
agents continue to cause significant negative effects. Nausea and vomiting may occur as anticipatory, beginning
before a treatment begins, or during or soon after a treatment. Some agents like cisplatin may cause delayed
nausea and vomiting, defined as occurring more than 24 hours after administration. This may last 5 days or more.
Management of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting includes efforts to maintain client comfort, adequate
hydration, and electrolyte balance. Antiemetics such as ondansetron and aprepitant may be given before, during,
and after treatment. Nutritional support to help maintain adequate intake of required nutrients and prevent
chemotherapy-related cachexia ("wasting syndrome") accompanies the management of nausea and vomiting.

For clients undergoing chemotherapy, another complication involves long-term effects. Most chemotherapy
236  8 · Introduction to Cancer Therapy and Cancer Drugs

     treatments effectively begin both therapeutic and untoward effects as soon as they are administered. The acute
     effects may last throughout the treatment period and for a few months afterward. However, the cumulative effects
     of repeated cycles of treatment often result in effects that persist and even worsen over many years. Long-term
     effects typically involve decreased pulmonary and cardiac function, but other effects such as infertility may be seen.

     In addition to monitoring for late-term effects of chemotherapies, clients must be evaluated for recurrence of
     disease and for development of secondary cancers. Recurrence of a tumor happens when cells of the original cancer
     return and begin growing despite treatment modalities. Secondary cancers differ from recurrent cancer in that these
     tumors develop in different tissues than the original cancer. Chemotherapeutic agents, unfortunately, are
     carcinogens. Receiving chemotherapeutic agents for cancer treatment places a client at risk of developing other
     types of cancers known as secondary cancers. For cancer survivors, follow-up care includes continued surveillance
     to assess for these effects.

     Alkylating agents are among the oldest group of chemotherapies. They were developed after World War I when it
     was noted that these substances, when used as weapons, caused myelosuppression. Upon this discovery, they were
     developed into chemotherapeutic agents. In general, the medications in this class kill cancer cells by cross-linking
     DNA, which which prevents cell division in a manner that can lead to toxicity within the cell or unbalanced growth,
     both of which can cause cell death. These agents work most effectively on slower-growing tumors with a slowed
     mitotic rate. Alkylating agents are separated into several different subclasses. Some of these medications are dosed
     based on the client's weight, and others are administered based on the client's body surface area (BSA), which is
     determined using a formula using the client's height and weight (mg/m2).

     Subclass 1: Nitrogen Mustards
     In use today are five alkylating agents that are classified as nitrogen mustards. These include mechlorethamine,
     melphalan, chlorambucil, ifosfamide, and cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide is the most widely used nitrogen
     mustard and can be found in the regimens for many different cancers. Cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide pose the
     risk of hemorrhagic cystitis, usually when high-dose therapy is used. To prevent this, a rescue agent, or
     uroprotectant, is given to prevent bladder irritation. Mesna is the rescue agent used with these drugs for supportive
     interventions to prevent bladder complications.

     Subclass 2: Nitrosoureas
     Nitrosoureas are classified as alkylating agents, yet these have an advantage that nitrogen mustards do not: they
     cross the blood-brain barrier. This characteristic allows these drugs to pass into the brain, treating cancers like
     glioblastomas and other brain tumors. Carmustine is a more commonly used intravenous nitrosourea. Lomustine,
     which is similar to carmustine, is administered via oral routes.

     Subclass 3: Alkyl Sulfonates
     Alkyl sulfonates such as busulfan are administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion rather than IV push. These are
     very potent drugs, used to treat chronic leukemia, and they have severe adverse effects. These include
     myelosuppression, stomatitis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and electrolyte imbalances including hypomagnesemia
     and hypokalemia. Busulfan requires very close pharmacokinetic monitoring and dose alteration.

     Chemotherapy, while it acts to target cell functions and reproduction, may cause widespread undesired damage to
     normal cells. For this reason, many chemotherapeutic agents have black box warnings. These warnings are used to
     emphasize the most serious and potentially damaging side effects of a drug or a class of drugs. Boxed warnings are
     set specifically to make clients and health care providers aware of very serious risks of using certain medications.
     With chemotherapeutics, there are multiple reasons that a boxed warning may be issued. However, the most
     common reasons include myelosuppression, teratogenicity, and hypersensitivity reactions. Prior to administering a
     chemotherapeutic drug, nurses should check for boxed warnings so that drugs may be administered safely and
     clients may be educated regarding these warnings.

     Table 8.3 lists common alkylating agents and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Alkylating agents are some of the most toxic chemotherapies used in cancer treatment. One benefit of these
toxicities is that drugs like busulfan can be used to eradicate bone-marrow production prior to stem-cell and bone-
marrow transplants. This reduces recurrence of the primary disease after transplant. However, alkylating agents are
known for the negative effects associated with administration of these drugs. Short-term side effects include
myelosuppression, which usually occurs 6-10 days after administration, with recovery after 14-21 days.
Myelosuppression resulting in neutropenia can result in severe infections and sepsis. Mucositis, nausea, and
vomiting are side effects that affect the client's overall nutritional status. Neurotoxicity and alopecia are also short-
term side effects. Long-term (delayed) effects of alkylating agents include pulmonary fibrosis, infertility, and
secondary malignancies (Amjad & Kasi, 2020). These long-term effects may occur months after treatment or may
develop many years later.

  FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

  Various Alkylating Agents

  Busulfan injection causes severe and prolonged myelosuppression at the recommended dosage.

  Carboplatin causes severe bone marrow suppression, resulting in bleeding, infection, and anemia.
  Anaphylactic-like reactions to carboplatin may occur within minutes of administration.

  Carmustine causes bone marrow suppression, which may contribute to bleeding and overwhelming infection. In
  cumulative doses above 1400 mg/m2, pulmonary toxicity is a significant risk.

  Chlorambucil causes severe bone marrow suppression and infertility and is carcinogenic, mutagenic, and
  teratogenic.

  Cisplatin causes severe renal toxicity that is dose related and cumulative. Peripheral neuropathy occurs and is
  cumulative with repeat courses. Cisplatin causes severe nausea and vomiting. Bone marrow suppression may be
  severe, requiring interruption of therapy.

  Lomustine causes severe, dose-related, delayed, and cumulative myelosuppression, occurring 4-6 weeks after
  administration. Overdose is fatal. Only 1 dose should be dispensed with each prescription.

  Oxaliplatin may cause anaphylactic-like reactions that may occur within minutes of administration.

Antimetabolites

Antimetabolite chemotherapies are a group of drugs that prevent cancer cell growth by imitating metabolites, which
are substances necessary for tumor cell growth. Cancer cells use these substances, which, once inside the cell,
prevent DNA replication. This results in cell death. Within this class, there are three types of metabolites that are
inhibited: purines, pyrimidines, and folic acid. Each drug in this class specifically targets replacement of one of these
substances. The most common drugs within this class are fluorouracil, fludarabine, gemcitabine, and methotrexate.
Common side effects include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, stomatitis, alopecia, and myelosuppression.
Antimetabolites are useful in treating leukemias, lymphomas, and cancers of the gastrointestinal and biliary tracts.

Table 8.5 lists common antimetabolite agents and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Antimetabolites are associated with many adverse effects. Folate antimetabolites are associated with
     myelosuppression, mucositis, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and cutaneous reactions. Pyrimidine antimetabolites
     cause mucositis and myelosuppression as well but are also associated with dose-limiting hand-foot syndrome and
     diarrhea. Contraindications for fluorouracil include clients with dihydropyridine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency,
     which may result in toxic levels of fluorouracil. This can lead to cardiac dysfunction, colitis, neutropenia, and
     encephalopathy. Uridine triacetate is used to treat toxicity in these clients. Cytarabine is associated with
     inflammation of the conjunctiva. Corticosteroid eye drops are used prophylactically to prevent this. Purine
     antimetabolites, in addition to causing myelosuppression, also decrease the CD4 lymphocyte count, resulting in
     immunosuppression and risk of opportunistic infections (Amjad & Kasi, 2020).

     FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

     Antimetabolites

     Methotrexate causes embryo-fetal toxicity, hypersensitivity reactions, benzyl alcohol toxicity, and other serious
     adverse reactions.

     Capecitabine causes increased risk for bleeding when administered with coumarins such as warfarin.

     Fludarabine causes severe central nervous system toxicity, including blindness, coma, seizures, and death.
     Autoimmune syndromes including hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hemophilia may occur with
     fludarabine administration. Concomitant use of deoxycoformycin (pentostatin) may cause fatal pulmonary
     toxicity.

     Anthracyclines/Antitumor Antibiotics

     Anthracyclines are some of the most potent chemotherapies on the market today. These drugs are very strong
     vesicants that cause severe necrosis when extravasated. Three major drugs in this class are daunorubicin,
     doxorubicin, and epirubicin. These drugs cause cell death by preventing DNA replication. They do this by inhibiting
     topoisomerase, leaving DNA strands unable to unwind and replicate. The major side effects of anthracyclines are
     myelosuppression, nausea and vomiting, alopecia, skin and nail hyperpigmentation, and, most notably,
     cardiotoxicity. Many drugs in this class are red in color and can resultingly cause urine and other body fluids to turn
     red/orange. This is a benign side effect but is usually discussed with clients to avoid any panic. These drugs are
     assigned maximum lifetime dose limits to aid in preventing debilitating chemotherapy-induced heart failure.
     Additionally, clients must have a left ventricular ejection fraction of at least 55% to receive these drugs. Table 8.7
     lists common anthracyclines/antitumor antibiotics and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications

Anthracyclines and antitumor antibiotics are associated with very serious adverse effects. In general, the drugs
cause significant myelosuppression, alopecia, and nausea and vomiting. Doxorubicin and daunorubicin are
associated with both short- and long-term cardiotoxicity. These drugs are contraindicated in clients with preexisting
cardiac disease when the left ventricular ejection fraction is less than 55%. Clients receiving doxorubicin are also
limited to a lifetime cumulative dose of 550 mg/m2. Bleomycin administration requires vigilant monitoring for
cumulative pulmonary toxicity and fibrosis. Doxorubicin and daunorubicin are vesicant drugs that cause severe
necrosis if extravasation into tissues occurs.

         · Know which drug/food interactions to avoid.
         · Follow up with screenings for long-term effects and secondary malignancies.

     The client taking an anthracycline and antitumor antibiotic agent should not:

         · Be around others who are ill or who have received live vaccines within 3 months.
         · Garden without the use of gloves to protect hands from direct contact with bacteria and mold present in

             the soil.
         · Clean feline litter boxes to reduce risk of contact with bacteria and parasites.
         · Take vaccines without prior approval of their health care provider.
         · Consume uncooked meats and wild game such as deer, rabbits, and pheasants.
         · Begin taking new supplements or medications without consulting their health care provider.

       FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

       Doxorubicin and Epirubicin

       Potentially fatal congestive heart failure can occur during or years after therapy. The probability is based on the
       total cumulative doses received.

       Secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) has been reported in clients
       taking these medications.

     Plant Alkaloids

     Several chemotherapies are derived from plants and are considered plant alkaloids. Vinca alkaloids are the most
     common plant alkaloids. Vincristine, vinblastine, and etoposide (VP-16) are all plant alkaloids that cause
     misalignment of chromosomes in cancer cells, resulting in apoptosis, or cell death. These are useful in treating
     lymphomas, leukemias, Kaposi sarcoma, squamous cell carcinomas, lung cancer, and bladder cancer. Side effects
     include myelosuppression, mouth sores, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. The most significant adverse effects involve
     the nervous system. Because plant alkaloids decrease nerve function, these substances can cause hearing loss,
     neuropathies, and severe constipation that may develop into a paralytic ileus. Neurologic symptoms may

necessitate discontinuance of therapy. Vinca alkaloids are often part of regimens that also require intrathecal
administration. However, close attention and safety measures (i.e., drug is always compounded in an IV bag for
infusion) must be in place to ensure these are never administered via the intrathecal route. The drugs are fatal if
administered intrathecally.

Table 8.9 lists common plant alkaloids and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Peripheral neuropathy is a common but serious adverse effect of plant alkaloids. Both motor and sensory functions
are affected, and neuropathy can be severe enough to result in paralytic ileus. Myelosuppression is another adverse
effect caused by plant alkaloids. These drugs are classified as irritants, which may cause significant irritation to the
skin should extravasation occur.

     Taxanes

     Taxanes are a group of chemotherapeutic agents that were developed from the bark of a yew tree. These are
     effective in the treatment of breast, ovarian, prostate, gastric, esophageal, pancreatic, and non-small cell lung
     cancers as well as Kaposi sarcoma. These agents are typically used in combination with other agents rather than as
     a monotherapy. Adverse reactions include, most notably, hypersensitivity reactions. For this reason, clients will be
     premedicated, usually with corticosteroids, but may also receive diphenhydramine and a histamine-2 receptor
     antagonist to prevent these reactions from occurring. Other adverse effects include hepatotoxicity, fluid retention,
     myelosuppression, alopecia, skin and nail changes, and nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications

Taxanes are most known for the adverse effect of hypersensitivity reactions. A test dose and premedication with
antihistamines and acetaminophen may be used prior administration. Myelosuppression may result in lowered
levels of platelets and white blood cells. Taxanes are contraindicated in solid tumors with myelosuppression with
neutrophil counts under 1500 cells/mm3. Peripheral neuropathy is also commonly associated with taxanes,
resulting in pain and limited movement. Fatigue and arthralgias are also seen with these drugs. Cardiovascular
changes including hypotension, bradycardia, hypertension, and electrocardiogram (ECG, EKG) changes may be
noted (DailyMed, Paclitaxel, 2023).

     Common Drugs Used as Supportive Therapies for Clients Receiving Chemotherapy

     Because chemotherapy regimens are so complex, supportive care with other pharmacologic agents is usually
     required. Management of adverse effects is critical to safe and successful chemotherapy treatment.
     Myelosuppression and nausea and vomiting are most commonly managed with supportive therapies.
     Corticosteroids and biologic colony stimulating factors are frontline supportive therapies. Table 8.13 encompasses
     the most common supportive therapies that may be necessary when administering chemotherapy.

These supportive therapies can increase the client's quality of life as well as decrease risks associated with
pancytopenia, such as sepsis and decreased oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. The advent of biologic colony
stimulating factors marked a significant decrease in sepsis-related deaths for clients receiving chemotherapy.
Ondansetron, specifically, has greatly changed the way chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting are treated.
Traditional phenothiazines cause vein and tissue irritation as well as central nervous system depression, placing a
client at risk for injury. Ondansetron does not affect central nervous system function, reducing the risk of falls and
other injuries.

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 8.3.1 Identify the characteristics of hormonal therapy drugs used to treat cancer.
         · 8.3.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of hormonal therapy drugs used

         · 8.3.3 Describe the nursing implications of hormonal therapy drugs used to treat cancer.
         · 8.3.4 Explain the client education related to hormonal therapy drugs used to treat cancer.

     Antiestrogen Medications

     Antiestrogens, or estrogen antagonists, are a group of medications used to block estrogen receptors. By blocking
     these receptors, cancer cells that require estrogen for growth are no longer able to undergo mitosis and cannot
     cause tumor development. These drugs are classified as hormonal therapies, as they block the influence of the
     hormone estrogen. They are primarily used for breast cancer; however, antiestrogens are only effective in breast
     cancers that are hormone-receptor positive. Tamoxifen and fulvestrant are two commonly used antiestrogens used

     Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                     8.3 · Hormonal Therapy  251

for breast cancer. Tamoxifen is an oral medication that is given for approximately 5 years after breast cancer
treatment. Fulvestrant, given intramuscularly, and elacestrant, a newer oral medication approved in 2023, are
selective estrogen downregulators (SERD) that block estrogen receptors.

Aromatase Inhibitors

Aromatase inhibitors are another classification of hormonal therapy used to treat breast cancer in postmenopausal
clients. Aromatase is an enzyme found in fatty tissue that converts hormones into estrogen. Aromatase inhibitors,
including anastrozole and exemestane, stop the production of estrogen and thus the growth of estrogen
receptor-positive tumors by blocking aromatase. These medications are taken daily as an oral tablet. Aromatase
inhibitors may be prescribed for clients who are not good candidates for antiestrogens. Aromatase inhibitors may
cause symptoms of menopause and muscle and joint pain, which may limit use if clients are not able to tolerate side
effects. These drugs may also put clients at higher risk of osteoporosis (DailyMed, Anastrozole, 2023).

Antiandrogens

Antiandrogens, also known as androgen inhibitors or testosterone blockers, are hormonal therapies used to treat
prostate cancer. These drugs block androgen receptors so that cancers that rely on testosterone and other
hormones to grow cannot survive. These drugs may induce a reduction in masculine characteristics such as hair
growth and erectile dysfunction. Drugs in this class include flutamide and bicalutamide. They are given by the oral
route daily. Liver enzymes must be periodically evaluated during therapy, as these drugs are hepatotoxic.

Table 8.15 lists common hormonal therapies and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications

Tamoxifen citrate tablets are contraindicated in clients who require concomitant coumarin-type anticoagulant
therapy or in clients with a history of deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolus. Adverse effects of hormonal
therapies include weight gain, fatigue, vaginal dryness, loss of interest in sex, hot flashes, osteoporosis, nausea,
vomiting, and diarrhea. Male clients receiving hormonal treatment, such as for prostate cancer, may experience
breast development and tenderness (DailyMed, Tamoxifen, 2022).

254  8 · Introduction to Cancer Therapy and Cancer Drugs

     Monoclonal Antibodies and PD-1 Inhibitors

     Cancer therapy has experienced an explosion of new treatments with the development of biologics. Monoclonal
     antibodies are a type of biologic response modifier used to treat autoimmune diseases as well as various cancer
     types. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that enables the immune system to better recognize and destroy cancer
     cells. These drugs pose a high risk of sensitivity reactions that include chills, fever, and anaphylaxis. Clients must be
     premedicated with diphenhydramine and acetaminophen to prevent or decrease risks for hypersensitivity reactions.

     The newest approved class of monoclonal antibodies is PD-1 inhibitors. These drugs inhibit PD-1 proteins on T
     lymphocytes. When these proteins are blocked, the T lymphocytes are able to identify cancer cells and kill them
     more easily. Because these drugs increase the activity of T lymphocytes, a side effect of these drugs is possible
     development of autoimmune syndromes. Clients receiving these drugs must be carefully monitored throughout
     intravenous infusions for possible hypersensitivity reactions.

     Growth Factor and Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors

     Growth factor inhibitors and tyrosine kinase inhibitors are also types of biologic response modifiers. Erlotinib is a
     tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is used to treat non-small cell lung cancer and late-stage pancreatic cancer. This drug
     works to prevent the growth of tumors influenced by epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR). Cell differentiation,
     proliferation, and angiogenesis cannot occur when EGFR is blocked. Ibrutinib is another tyrosine kinase inhibitor
     used to treat leukemias and lymphomas.

     Table 8.17 lists common growth factors and tyrosine kinase I inhibitors and typical routes and dosing for adult
     clients.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications

     One of the most critical adverse reactions of biologic therapy is hypersensitivity reactions. These may occur
     suddenly, especially during the initial treatment, and may be severe and life-threatening. Any premedication must
     be given, and emergency drugs such as epinephrine should be available. Biologic therapies are also associated with
     skin reactions that may be severe. Erlotinib has been shown to cause renal dysfunction, arrhythmias, hepatotoxicity,
     and gastrointestinal perforation. Clients may also develop widespread, severe acneiform rashes. In addition to
     severe hypersensitivity reactions, rituximab is also associated with cardiotoxicity, nephrotoxicity,
     leukoencephalopathy, bowel obstruction or perforation, tumor lysis syndrome, neutropenia, and infection.

Nursing Implications

The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking biologic and biologic response modifying agents:

· Assess client overall well-being prior to chemotherapy administration including vital signs, hydration status,
   oral mucosa, skin, weight, cardiac function, bowel pain, level of consciousness changes, and signs of
   neuropathy.

· Review laboratory values thoroughly, including complete blood counts, electrolyte profiles, serum creatinine,
   and liver enzymes.

· Observe clients for adverse effects before, during, and after treatment.
· Ensure patency of intravenous access sites and monitor these frequently during drug administration.
· Adhere to proper handling and administration procedures when administering biologic therapies.
· Be aware of the drug's black box warnings.
· Recognize and manage emergent situations such as hypersensitivity reactions.
· Assess for and provide supportive therapies as needed.
256  8 · Introduction to Cancer Therapy and Cancer Drugs

      · Provide for educational, spiritual, and psychosocial needs of the client and caregivers.
      · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

          teaching guidelines.

     CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

     The client taking a biologic or biologic response modifying agent should:

         · Know signs and symptoms to report to the health care provider: fever, chills, productive cough, urinary
             symptoms, skin reactions, chest pain, confusion, and level of consciousness changes.

         · Report side effects including nausea and vomiting and skin reactions.
         · Know how to care for long-term intravenous accesses at home.
         · Understand the need for frequent follow-up and laboratory tests.
         · Know which drug/food interactions to avoid.
         · Understand the need for regular follow-up for early identification of long-term effects and secondary

             malignancies.

     The client taking a biologic or biologic response modifying agent should not:

         · Be around large crowds or around others who are sick to decrease the risk of infection.
         · Become dehydrated.

CHAPTER OUTLINE
9.1 Introduction to the Nervous System
9.2 Structure and Function of the Nervous System
9.3 Characteristics of Drugs to Treat Nervous System Disorders

INTRODUCTION Neurological disorders affect the body's autonomic, peripheral, and central nervous system.
These disorders may occur at different points in the lifespan of an individual and for a variety of reasons. The
severity of neurological disorders also varies greatly, with some disorders being mild and self-limiting to other
disorders that may be quite debilitating or even life-threatening. Some examples of neurological disorders are
migraines, non-migraine headaches, multiple sclerosis, dementia such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease,
brain tumors, spinal cord injuries, stroke, and epilepsy. Clients with a neurological disorder may experience a wide
range of signs and symptoms. Therefore, a thorough neurological assessment is vital to detect deficits or changes in
baseline neurological functioning. Signs and symptoms of a neurological disorder include headaches, memory or
sensation loss, muscle weakness, tremors, nausea/vomiting, loss of bowel and/or bladder control, seizures,
impacted speech, aphasia (trouble speaking), dysphagia (swallowing difficulties), intractable pain, blindness, and
paralysis, all of which may vary in severity from mild to complete loss (Sargsyan, 2020; Shahrokhi & Asuncion,
2023). The occurrence of neurological disorders may be related to factors including genetics, infections, trauma,
autoimmune reactions, or degenerative processes.
The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) identified the overall incidence of noncommunicable neurological
disorders across the Americas. Neurological disorders related to death and disability were recognized as a global
public health challenge and are expected to continue increasing as the population ages. The United States is the
highest ranked country from the region of the Americas for age-standardized death rates related to
noncommunicable neurological disorders. Females were more affected (60%) than males (40%), but males had a
slightly higher death rate compared to females (33.1 per 100,000 and 32.2 per 100,000, respectively) (PAHO,
262  9 · Introduction to the Nervous System

     2021). Nationally, treatment of neurological disorders is also recognized as a public health objective. The Healthy
     People 2030 objectives focus on various health conditions related to neurological disorders (i.e., dementia, stroke,
     sensory or communication disorders, and mental health disorders) (Office of Disease Prevention and Health
     Promotion, 2021).

          TRENDING TODAY

      Tracking the Epidemiology of Neurological Conditions

       The National Neurological Conditions Surveillance System (https://openstax.org/r/cdcsurveillance) (NNCSS)
       (CDC, 2023) is a national surveillance system overseen by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
       that tracks the epidemiology of neurological disorders. The aim of the NNCSS is to use the gathered
       epidemiological data to extend knowledge about neurological disorders and future research efforts to investigate
       related causes, diagnoses, and treatment.

     9.1 Introduction to the Nervous System

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 9.1.1 Define the nervous system.
         · 9.1.2 Identify the purpose of the nervous system and how it affects the body.

     The Nervous System

     The nervous system is composed of the central nervous system (CNS) (i.e., the brain and the spinal cord) and the
     peripheral nervous system (PNS) (i.e., the nerves that extend from the spinal cord to the body). The PNS is
     subdivided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system. Together the CNS and PNS
     communicate with each other, the organs, and the body to promote homeostasis (see Figure 9.2).

     FIGURE 9.2 The CNS contains the brain and spinal cord; the PNS is composed of the nerves that branch out from the brain and spinal cord
     and serve as the communication between the CNS and the body. (credit: modification of work from Anatomy and Physiology 2e. attribution:

The Nervous System and the Human Body

The nervous system serves as the communication and control system for the human body. This control system,
which is essentially composed of all of the nerve cells in the body, regulates everything that we remember, think,
and say. It also controls movement and sensation as well as the autonomic responses of breathing, blood pressure,
and digestion. It has the unique ability to interact with the environment as well as regulate the activities of the
body's internal organs. Essentially, the nervous system propels the other systems of the body; no other system can
function without input from the nervous system. It does so by its composition of structures that transmit electrical
and chemical signals between the organs, tissues, and brain.

9.2 Structure and Function of the Nervous System

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 9.2.1 Discuss the structure and function of the nervous system and neurons.
    · 9.2.2 Recognize terminology related to the nervous system.

Overview of the Nervous System and Neurons
Within the PNS, the autonomic nervous system (ANS) controls involuntary processes and regulates vital functions
such as heart rate, digestion, respiration, and glandular secretion, while the somatic nervous system (SNS) consists
of motor and sensory pathways that are associated with the voluntary movement of skeletal muscles. The PNS
relays information between the CNS and the rest of the body via neurons, the basic units of the nervous system. The
brain contains approximately 100 billion neurons (Chen, 2023). Glial cells are also found in nervous tissue and serve
to support neurons. While glial cells are unable to generate action potentials, they play a key role in the
development, support, and protection of neurons.

Structurally, neurons consist of three main components: the cell body (soma), dendrites, and an axon. The cell body
contains the nucleus and other essential cellular components. Dendrites branch out from the cell body, acting as
receivers of signals from other neurons. The axon is a long, slender extension that carries electrical impulses away
from the cell body toward other neurons or target cells. See Figure 9.3 for a visual representation of a neuron.

Neurons grouped together are bundles of nerve cells that transmit electrochemical information via a process known
as neurotransmission. Neurotransmitters, which are chemical messengers, are stored in the axon terminals of
presynaptic neurons. These neurotransmitters then bind to receptors on the receiving neuron's dendrites,
transmitting the signal across the synapse and allowing the information to be passed on. The two main types of
synapses are electrical and chemical. Electrical synapses have direct communication by physical connections. With
chemical synapses, when an electrical signal reaches the end of an axon, it triggers the release of one of the
chemical messengers (or neurotransmitters) into the chemical synapse, which is the small gap between neurons. If
the postsynaptic cell is also a neuron, there may be a subsequent increase or decrease in firing rate. However, if the
postsynaptic cell is a muscle cell, muscle contraction or relaxation can result. If the postsynaptic cell is a glandular
cell, there will be an increase or decrease in secretion.

The connections formed by neurons create neural networks, which serve as the framework for the brain's ability to
process and integrate information. These networks allow for the transmission of sensory input, coordination of
motor functions, and the execution of higher cognitive processes such as learning, memory, and decision-making.

Neurons are diverse in terms of their structure, function, and location within the nervous system. Sensory neurons
transmit information from sensory organs to the brain, motor neurons carry signals from the brain to muscles and
glands, and interneurons facilitate communication between different neurons within the central nervous system.

     Overview of the Brain
     The brain has four main components: the cerebrum, cerebellum, brain stem, and limbic system (see Figure 9.4).

     FIGURE 9.4 Basic brain structures include the cerebrum, cerebellum, brain stem, and the limbic system. (attribution: Copyright Rice
     University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

     The cerebrum is divided into two hemispheres that are connected by the corpus callosum. The lobes and structures
     within the left and right hemispheres are contained in both hemispheres with the exception of the pineal body. The
     pineal body is an endocrine gland located between the two cerebral hemispheres. Each hemisphere is divided into
     four lobes: the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and the occipital lobe.
     The cerebellum, located below the cerebrum, controls coordination of movement and postural adjustment.
     The brain stem is composed of the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata. The brain stem is responsible for basic
     involuntary respiratory and cardiovascular functions.
     The limbic system is composed of a thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala. These structures
     regulate various bodily functions (e.g., activity, sensation, emotion, temperature, appetite, endocrine function, and
     sexual drive).

The spinal cord is approximately 18 inches long, encased in the spinal column, and surrounded by cerebrospinal
fluid. The spinal cord originates from the brain stem and extends down the back. The spinal cord is protected by
bone segments, or vertebrae, supported by discs and ligaments. The vertebrae are identified by their relative
position on the body. The spinal cord is divided into four sections (see Figure 9.5):

    · Cervical vertebrae (C1-C7) in the neck
    · Thoracic vertebrae (T1-T12) in the upper back and attached to the ribcage
    · Lumbar vertebrae (L1-L5) in the lower back
    · Sacral vertebrae (S1-S5) in the pelvis

Nerves extend from the spinal cord and spread throughout the body. There are 31 pairs of spinal nerves. Spinal
nerves are the conduit for communication between the CNS and the PNS.

Peripheral Nervous System
The peripheral nervous system (PNS) delivers signals between the central nervous system (CNS) and the body. The
PNS contains both motor neurons and sensory neurons. Motor neurons coordinate signals that correspond to
muscle and gland activity, while sensory neurons provide the signals to sensory organs. The somatic nervous system
and autonomic nervous system are both types of motor neurons. The somatic nervous system regulates voluntary
movements of skeletal muscles. The autonomic nervous system regulates involuntary responses by controlling the
cardiac muscle and smooth muscle contractions in addition to gland activity.

FIGURE 9.5 The spinal cord is divided into four sections, and there are 31 pairs of spinal nerves. (credit: modification of work from Anatomy
and Physiology 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

The autonomic nervous system is divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The
sympathetic nervous system is commonly known as the "fight or flight" system and is activated when the body is
under actual or perceived stress to ready the body's response to a potential threat. Activation results in the
following physiological changes:

    · Increased heart rate, heart contraction, and blood pressure
    · Shunting of blood to skeletal muscle
    · Bronchial dilation
266  9 · Introduction to the Nervous System

         · Pupillary dilation
         · Decreased salivation and digestion
         · Glucose release
         · Epinephrine and norepinephrine secretion, resulting in peripheral vasoconstriction
         · Bladder relaxation

     Conversely, the parasympathetic system is known as the "rest and digest" system. Activation of the
     parasympathetic nervous system translates into a series of bodily reactions that are, generally but not always,
     opposite of the reactions seen in the sympathetic nervous system. These changes are:

         · Slowed heart rate, heart contraction, and decreased blood pressure

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

     Neurotransmitters

     Neurotransmitters play a crucial role in the communication between neurons in the nervous system.
     Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that transmit signals across the chemical synapses, enabling various
     functions and processes in the body, including signaling to release neurotransmitter molecules. Synapses are
     composed of three components: the presynaptic terminal, the post-synaptic terminal, and the synaptic cleft.
     Synaptic vesicles, containing neurotransmitter molecules, are located on the presynaptic terminal at the end
     neuron's axon. Subsequently, the postsynaptic terminal uses specialized protein receptors to bind to these
     neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters result in an action, inaction, or inhibition of a neuron (see Figure 9.6). When
     neurotransmitter levels are imbalanced or disrupted, it can lead to pathological conditions and disorders.

It is important to note that neurotransmitter imbalances are just one aspect of the complex mechanisms
underpinning pathological conditions. Many disorders involve a combination of genetic, environmental, and
neurochemical factors. Diagnosis and treatment of these conditions often require a comprehensive approach
involving various therapies and medications targeting specific neurotransmitter systems.

The main neurotransmitters of the nervous system, function, and potential pathology are shown in Table 9.1. (The

     Nervous System Drug Properties

     The primary neurotransmitters of the PNS are acetylcholine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine.

     Nerves that release acetylcholine are called cholinergic nerves. Nicotinic receptors and muscarinic receptors are the
     two subtypes of cholinergic receptors. Cholinergic receptor activation results in tachycardia, hypertension,
     increased tone, and motility of the digestive tract. Drugs that increase or stimulate the release of acetylcholine are
     known as parasympathomimetic due to their mimicking of the parasympathetic nervous system. Drugs that block
     acetylcholine are known as anticholinergic, cholinergic-blocking, or parasympatholytic and result in inhibition of the
     parasympathetic nervous system and sympathetic nervous system induction.

     Adrenergic receptors mediate the response to epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine. The subtypes of
     adrenergic receptors are the alpha receptors (alpha1 and alpha2) and beta receptors (beta1, beta2, and beta3).
     Adrenergic drugs, also referred to as sympathomimetics, mimic the sympathetic nervous system response.
     Adrenergic antagonists block adrenergic receptors and reduce the effects of norepinephrine. Some drugs may target
     the activation of one receptor or activate multiple receptors. See Table 9.2 for an overview of autonomic receptors
     and subsequent responses.

     Autonomic Nervous System Stimulant and Blocker Characteristics
     Any pathological process that causes a disruption in the homeostasis between the SNS and the PNS may cause one
     of these branches to become overexcited while causing the other system to be extremely inhibited (Clar & Sharma,
     2023). A wide range of symptoms may occur due to this disruption in homeostasis, and medications may be used to
     restore homeostasis. There are four groups of medications that are used to restore homeostasis between the SNS
     and PNS, and they are classified on how they affect the ANS (Clar & Sharma, 2023):

  1. Cholinomimetics/cholinesterase antagonists include medications that are used in the treatment of urinary
        retention, glaucoma, smoking cessation, the diagnosis and treatment of myasthenia gravis, and the treatment
        of Alzheimer's disease.

  2. Anticholinergics can be used in the treatment of bradycardias, bronchospasm, postoperative nausea and
        vomiting, bladder spasms, and diarrhea.

  3. Adrenoreceptor agonists/sympathomimetics include medications that are indicated for the treatment of
        hypertension, asthma (bronchodilators), and Parkinson's disease. The drugs dobutamine, phenylephrine, and
        epinephrine are also in this category; they are used to treat hypotension, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and
        anaphylaxis.

  4. Adrenoreceptor antagonists are indicated in the treatment of urinary retention (in benign prostatic
        hyperplasia), hypertension, dysrhythmias, angina, heart failure, and migraine prophylaxis.

It is important to remember that the four categories just discussed act as either an agonist or an antagonist for the
receptors mentioned in Table 9.2.

Sympathetic Nervous System Stimulant and Blocker Characteristics
Medications that are classified as stimulants cover a wide range of drugs that increase the activity of the central
nervous system (Farzam et al., 2023). Some of the medications in this category treat attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder, narcolepsy, asthma, obesity, sinus congestions, and hypotension. Drugs in this category range from
caffeine to amphetamines and from legal to illegal.

Since the sympathetic nervous system plays a rather large role in the regulation of the circulatory system and in the
regulation of blood pressure, many medications that act to block the sympathetic nervous system reduce blood
pressure (see Antihypertensive and Antianginal Drugs). Some of these drugs work by affecting the central nervous
system, and others work at peripheral neuromuscular sites.

Parasympathetic Nervous System Stimulant and Blocker Characteristics
As mentioned earlier in this section, parasympathomimetic drugs mimic the physiologic effects of the
parasympathetic nervous system by acting as the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Bethanechol, which treats
urinary retention; carbachol, which is used in the treatment of open-angle glaucoma; and pilocarpine, which treats
both open- and closed-angle glaucoma, are examples of direct-acting parasympathomimetic drugs. There are other
indirect-acting parasympathomimetic drugs that cause an increase in the synaptic concentration of acetylcholine,
which result in the extended stimulation of cholinergic receptors throughout both the CNS and PNS (Patel &
Dewaswala, 2023).

INTRODUCTION The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is divided into two main subdivisions: the somatic motor
system and the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The somatic nervous system controls voluntary muscle
movement, and the autonomic nervous system is responsible for regulating numerous involuntary functions, such as
the heart, secretory glands, and smooth muscle. The ANS is further divided into the parasympathetic nervous
system (PSNS) and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) (see Figure 10.2). The PSNS relaxes the body and
maintains certain life-sustaining properties such as digestion and excretion. The SNS is involved in the fight-or-flight
response by preparing the body to deal with stressors. There are two primary types of receptors within the PNS:
cholinergic receptors and adrenergic receptors. Cholinergic receptors are activated by the neurotransmitter
acetylcholine (ACh) and can be activated by endogenous or exogenous substances. Adrenergic receptors are
stimulated by the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (Bekdash, 2021). In addition, these primary receptors have
subtypes.

     (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

     This chapter will focus on only the cholinergic receptors with no further discussion of adrenergic receptors. There
     are three major subtypes of cholinergic receptors: muscarinic, nicotinicM, and nicotinicN. Table 10.1 describes the
     functions of each of these. In some organs, the PSNS and SNS work in opposition to each other (such as increasing
     or decreasing the heart rate). In other organs, the two systems have a complementary effect where both divisions
     are necessary for a physiological function to occur; for example, the PSNS is involved in males obtaining an erection,
     and the SNS is responsible for ejaculation. Both systems are required to work together for reproduction to
     successfully take place.

     Notably, cholinergic receptors are not associated with the nervous system in any way. Regardless, the cholinergic
     receptors on blood vessels do have pharmacologic efficacy because drugs that are able to activate these receptors
     will cause blood pressure to decrease.

10.1 Introduction to Myasthenia Gravis

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 10.1.1 Describe the pathophysiology of myasthenia gravis.
    · 10.1.2 Identify the clinical manifestations related to myasthenia gravis.
    · 10.1.3 Identify the etiology and diagnostic studies related to myasthenia gravis.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a progressive autoimmune neuromuscular disorder characterized by fluctuating muscle
weakness and the onset of rapid fatigue. This disease does not discriminate based on gender, race, ethnicity, or
religion--it most commonly affects young adult females (under 40) and older males (over 60), but it can occur at any
age, including childhood (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2023b). To date, no biological
inheritance component has been associated with MG. The disease can present in two forms: ocular and generalized.
The ocular form causes muscle weakness only in the eyelids and extraocular muscles. The generalized form
includes a combination of extremities, esophageal and respiratory muscles, and the aforementioned ocular form.

Pathophysiology

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder of neuromuscular junction (NMJ) transmission. In a healthy person,
nerve impulses release ACh at the NMJ, the area where nerve cells connect with the muscles they control. This
neurotransmitter, ACh, will then travel across the synapse, where it will reach nicotinicM receptors located on the
muscle endplate. Once ACh has activated enough receptor sites, muscle contraction will occur. According to the
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (2023b), individuals with MG lack a significant number of
functional receptor sites (as much as 70%-90%) because the individual's immune system produces antibodies
(protein produced in response to a specific antigen) that block, alter, or destroy the receptors for acetylcholine at
the NMJ. In addition to fewer receptor sites, the synaptic space widens, which impairs signal transmission. The
outcome of these changes is the inability of muscles to contract, resulting in muscle weakness.

Etiology

What triggers an immunological attack on the NMJ receptor sites is not fully understood. The autoantibodies
(antibodies that destroy a person's own proteins and antigens) against the ACh receptors have been identified as
immunoglobulin G (IgG) derived from the plasma B-lymphocytes. These antibodies destroy ACh receptor sites, but
they also attack other proteins such as the muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) protein that impairs the
neurotransmitter's communication at the NMJ. T-lymphocytes also play a role in this immunological attack. The
thymus is the principal organ in cell-mediated immunity. Normally, the thymus will begin to atrophy after puberty.
Thymus abnormalities, such as hyperplasia (enlarged thymus) or thymoma (tumor on the thymus gland) have been
acknowledged in those with MG. It is believed the thymus gland provides incorrect instructions to developing
immune cells, which results in the immune system not recognizing itself and attacking its own cells and tissues
while producing acetylcholine receptor antibodies.

Diagnostics

Because weakness is a common and vague complaint, diagnosis of MG can be delayed or even missed. Several
different tests can be conducted to confirm the diagnosis of MG. Just like with most conditions, the nurse should
first obtain an accurate history and physical examination. The assessment of the neurological system is the primary
focus: the client's muscle strength, tone, and coordination should be examined; sensation and extraocular eye
movements should be evaluated.

Serological tests can detect the presence of anti-ACh receptor antibodies and/or anti-MuSK antibodies circulating
within the bloodstream. However, some clients with MG will have neither of these antibodies, a condition termed
seronegative (negative antibody) myasthenia gravis.

A single-fiber electromyography (EMG) test can detect delayed or failed neuromuscular transmission in muscle
fibers that are supplied by a single nerve fiber. The EMG is considered the most sensitive test in diagnosing MG.
Another noninvasive examination is the repeated nerve stimulation test, which stimulates the nerves with small
pulses of electricity for the purpose of tiring specific muscles. Muscle fibers in myasthenia gravis do not respond
well to repeated electrical stimulation. To confirm a thymoma or enlarged thymus, a computed tomography (CT) or

     Ptosis (drooping of the eyelid) and diplopia (double vision) are the presenting symptoms in half of the clients
     diagnosed with MG. The cardinal feature of early MG is fluctuating skeletal muscle weakness and muscle fatigue.
     Many times, muscle strength is strongest in the morning hours and will decrease throughout the day. The fatigue is
     an indication there is worsening of the muscle contractile force, most notably seen with repetitive motions, such as
     blinking, walking, or even talking. For instance, a client's speech may become slurred after a few minutes of
     constant talking. This is referred to as dysarthria (difficulty speaking). After resting, the voice will return to baseline,
     and speech will become clear. As the disease progresses, muscle weakness and fatigue become more constant.

     Several factors can exacerbate MG symptoms, including emotional stress, infection, surgery, aminoglycosides,
     hypo- or hyperthyroidism, hormonal fluctuations, and an increase in body temperature. A sudden exacerbation of
     symptoms is known as a myasthenic crisis, which is considered a medical emergency because fatal consequences
     can result. If respiratory muscles are affected, ventilation will be compromised. Chewing and/or swallowing muscles
     can also be affected because the disease eventually affects the muscles of the lower half of the face. The
     impairment of these muscles will result in dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and lead to choking and/or aspiration.

     Pharmacological Management

     The main pharmacological class to treat MG is acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors. These indirect-acting
     cholinergic agonists react chemically with AChE, the enzyme responsible for breaking down ACh in the synaptic
     cleft. The presynaptic neuron continues to release ACh, while the synapse accumulates ACh because it is not broken
     down. This results in the cholinergic receptors being stimulated for a prolonged period of time. The reversible AChE
     inhibitors are used to treat MG because they are effective at all the cholinergic junctions (muscarinic, ganglionic, and
     neuromuscular).

     Some cases of MG may go into remission (resolution of symptoms), either temporarily or permanently, where
     muscle weakness disappears completely. Drugs may not be needed during these periods. When the MG is well
     controlled, the safety factor of nerve to muscle transmission has been largely restored, and strength has been
     increased. In contrast, when clients still have symptoms with first-line agents, they may require immunosuppressive
     therapy, which may include high-dose glucocorticoids, until symptoms are under control. These drugs cause lysis of
     antigen-activated lymphocytes, suppress lymphocyte proliferation, and increase sequestration of lymphocytes at
     extravascular locations. The doses for immunosuppressive purposes are high, leading to a broad spectrum of
     adverse effects. When the client's symptoms are under control, the glucocorticoids should be gradually titrated and
     discontinued.

     Other immunosuppressants and immunomodulators are also used when MG is not well-controlled. One example of
     an immunosuppressant is azathioprine. This drug blocks the purine pathway and inhibits DNA, RNA, and protein
     synthesis, which causes the immune system to be unable to mount a response to an antigen. Azathioprine is given
     orally. It does have a black box warning related to the risk of malignancy (DailyMed, Azathioprine, 2022).
     Immunomodulators can deliver more targeted drug therapy. These are also known as monoclonal antibodies
     (MABs). Overall, these drugs activate the body's natural immune response. For a more detailed discussion of these
     classifications, please refer to Drugs to Treat Parkinson's Disease and Multiple Sclerosis.

    · 10.2.1 Identify the characteristics of drugs used to treat myasthenia gravis.

Cholinergic agonists are also termed parasympathomimetics, and cholinergic antagonists (also known as
anticholinergics) are termed parasympatholytics. (The anticholinergic agents will be discussed in Drugs to Treat
Parkinson's Disease and Multiple Sclerosis.) The PSNS has two general sites where drugs can act: (1) the synapses
between preganglionic neurons and postganglionic neurons, and (2) the junctions between postganglionic
neurons and their effector organs. The class of cholinergic agonists is subdivided into direct acting and indirect
acting. The direct-acting cholinergic agonists interact with the postsynaptic cholinergic receptors and cause them to
perform the same functions as if endogenous ACh was present. The indirect-acting cholinergic agonists are
classified as AChE inhibitors and do not bind directly to receptors. AChE inhibitors prevent the enzyme from
destroying acetylcholine. Because the enzyme is inhibited, there is more acetylcholine available for use. AChE
inhibitors are subdivided into two categories: reversible and irreversible. These classes are discussed in the
following sections.

Direct-Acting Cholinergic Agonists

Direct-acting cholinergic agonists mimic the effects of ACh when they bind to cholinergic receptors. They are
considered direct acting because they have affinity (attracted to a receptor) and intrinsic activity (ability to
stimulate a receptor) to these receptors. Direct-acting cholinergic agonists mainly bind to the muscarinic receptors
of the PSNS. (Refer to Table 10.1 earlier in this chapter to see responses produced when muscarinic receptors are
activated.) The most common therapeutic uses for these drugs are to promote urinary excretion and gastrointestinal
(GI) motility/secretions. Additionally, there are several direct-acting cholinergic agonists that are found in
ophthalmic formulations and induce miosis for the purpose of treating glaucoma because they help to relieve
increased intraocular pressure. An example of a direct-acting cholinergic agonist in an ophthalmic formulation is
pilocarpine. Pilocarpine also comes as an oral solution and is used to treat dry mouth associated with Sjogren's
syndrome or salivary gland damage. Due to the direct-acting cholinergic agonist's selective action on muscarinic
receptors, nicotinic responses are minimal or nonexistent; therefore, this class is not used in the treatment of MG.

Indirect-Acting Cholinergic Agonists: Reversible Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors

Indirect-acting cholinergic agonists bind reversibly to AChE. They inhibit the enzyme that destroys acetylcholine,
making acetylcholine more available. The specific mechanism of action is to delay the splitting of ACh into choline
and acetone. Because AChE must degrade the drug in order to become unbound, less of this enzyme is available to
break down ACh. This leaves more ACh to bind to the cholinergic receptors, intensifying its response at all the
junctions where it serves as the neurotransmitter. The result of this action is prolonging access to ACh, allowing it to
accumulate within the synaptic cleft; ACh continues binding to cholinergic receptors on the postsynaptic neuron,
causing activation of that neuron. The effectiveness lasts until AChE is released. Once released, AChE will begin to
break down ACh, and the effects of the drug will wear off. Reversible inhibitors produce effects of moderate
duration. The optimal dose is determined by administering a small initial dose followed by gradual small increases
until optimal muscle function is observed.

Pyridostigmine Bromide
Pyridostigmine bromide is the drug of choice for managing MG. This drug is formulated in a powder, syrup, or tablet.
Tablets are available in immediate-release (IR) and extended-release (ER) forms. Both IR and ER forms may be
needed to sustain effects. When adequate amounts of ACh are present at the NMJ, skeletal muscle is stimulated.
The force of skeletal muscle contraction is increased at therapeutic doses. In contrast, too much drug can reduce
the force of skeletal muscle strength because it leaves the NMJ in a state of constant depolarization.
278  10 · Drugs to Treat Myasthenia Gravis and Alzheimer's Disease

     Neostigmine
     Neostigmine is administered only intravenously (IV). Essentially, it is used in the diagnosis and treatment of MG and
     reversal/recovery of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents after surgery. The onset of action is 10-30
     minutes, and peak effects occur in 20-30 minutes. Atropine should be readily available when infusing this drug.

     A peripheral nerve stimulation device (also known as a train of four) is used to determine the degree of muscle
     relaxation based on muscle response after a stimulus is provided. This helps to determine if more medication is
     necessary when reversing any neuromuscular blockade postoperatively. The train of four count consists of four
     consecutive 2-Hz stimuli to a muscle group and the number of twitches evoked.

     Table 10.2 lists common reversible AChE inhibitors and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     If the amount of pyridostigmine becomes too elevated, this can result in a cholinergic crisis. It is essential that the
     prescriber does not interpret skeletal muscle weakness as a sign of inadequate dosing because increasing the dose
     will elevate the risk of cholinergic crisis.

     SAFETY ALERT

     Differentiating Between Cholinergic Crisis and Myasthenic Crisis

     Taking too much of an AChE inhibitor can result in cholinergic crisis. Cholinergic and myasthenic crises share
     similar symptoms, such as muscle weakness or paralysis. The nurse must accurately distinguish between the two
     because the treatments are very different. A medication history or signs of excessive cholinergic stimulation
     (excess saliva, watery eyes, difficulty breathing, bradycardia, frequent urge to urinate, muscle twitching, and
     nausea/vomiting/diarrhea) can indicate a person is experiencing a cholinergic crisis not related to the myasthenia
     gravis. Stop direct or indirect cholinergic agonists until muscle strength improves.

     Antidote for cholinergic crisis: Atropine (selective muscarinic antagonist) blocks the muscarinic receptors, which
     helps to reverse most of the signs/symptoms.

     Antidote for myasthenic crisis: AChE inhibitor (pyridostigmine) will increase the necessary ACh levels.

     (Sources: Adeyinka & Kondamudi, 2023; Health Union, 2023)

     Apart from the adverse drug reactions associated with skeletal muscle, the majority of the adverse effects relate to
     the excessive stimulation of the muscarinic receptors. Intravenous atropine can alleviate the muscarinic effects. The
     fall in cardiac output can lead to hypotension. The diaphragm can be negatively affected, causing respiratory
     depression that is treated by mechanical ventilation with oxygen and not with medications. Pyridostigmine can
     cause bradycardia and exacerbate any underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Due to the constriction of the
     bronchi, asthmatics must be closely monitored when taking AChE inhibitors. Dysphonia (hoarseness) is the result of
     laryngospasms. Depending on the severity of the vomiting, diarrhea, diaphoresis, and urine output, dehydration can
     result.

CLINICAL TIP

Underdosing Versus Overdosing

Although failure of clients to show clinical improvement may reflect underdosage, it can also be indicative of
overdosage. As is true of all cholinergic drugs, overdosage of pyridostigmine bromide may result in cholinergic
crisis.

     Nursing Implications
     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking an indirect-acting reversible AChE inhibitor:

         · Monitor heart rate/rhythm and blood pressure periodically.
         · Assess respiratory pattern (rate, depth, rhythm, effort) and airway patency.
         · Time the administration of the drug so that peak effects occur at meals to help with eating and swallowing.
         · Evaluate client's ability to chew and swallow.
         · Monitor client's ease of ability to raise the eyelids (important sign of improvement).
         · Monitor for clinical manifestations of dehydration if vomiting, diarrhea, or diaphoresis is present.
         · Administer antiemetics to reduce nausea and vomiting.
         · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

             teaching guidelines.

       CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

       The client taking an indirect-acting reversible AChE inhibitor should:

           · Understand that MG is not curable, so treatment is lifelong.
           · Be able to recognize signs of therapeutic failure (ptosis, difficulty swallowing) and toxicity (excess

               muscarinic responses).
           · Maintain records of the times the drug was administered, times at which fatigue occurred, and level of

               muscle strength before and after taking the drug.
           · Wear a medic alert bracelet due to the potential of experiencing a crisis (myasthenic or cholinergic).
           · Move and change positions slowly due to hypotension.
           · Sit or lie down if dizziness occurs and wait until it subsides before standing or walking.
           · Ensure adequate lighting to enhance vision due to the pupillary constriction.
           · Ensure they have ready access to a restroom/commode due to the stimulatory effect on the GI and

               genitourinary (GU) systems.
           · Contact their prescriber immediately if they have any difficulty with swallowing, speaking, hoarseness, or

               breathing.
           · Space activities to obtain optimal benefit from the drug.

       The client taking an indirect-acting reversible AChE inhibitor should not:

           · Chew, break, or crush extended-release capsules.
           · Rise or change positions quickly due to possible orthostatic hypotension.
           · Stop drugs abruptly because symptoms will quickly reoccur.
           · Overexert themselves; they should take rest periods between activities.

     Indirect-Acting Cholinergic Agonists: Irreversible AChE Inhibitors
     These drugs bind irreversibly to AChE. The effects of these drugs are prolonged--they will last until new molecules
     of cholinesterase are synthesized. Another method of reversing the inhibition of AChE, especially at the NMJ, is to
     administer pralidoxime, a cholinesterase reactivator. This drug is a specific antidote to poisoning by the irreversible
     cholinesterase inhibitor. The drug has no effect on reversible AChE inhibitors. This medication is administered either
     via IV or intramuscularly. Dosage is individualized according to the severity of symptoms.

     The only therapeutic indication for this drug class is the treatment of glaucoma. For that indication, only one drug,
     echothiopate, is available. The drugs have limited use because they are highly toxic. Once they become absorbed,
     they will easily cross the blood-brain barrier, causing adverse effects.

     10.3 Introduction to Alzheimer's Disease

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 10.3.1 Describe the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease.
         · 10.3.2 Identify the clinical manifestations related to Alzheimer's disease.
         · 10.3.3 Identify the etiology and diagnostic studies related to Alzheimer's disease.

     Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative condition of the brain and is characterized by
     significant changes in brain tissue. This disease is the most frequent cause of dementia in older adults. It is
     estimated that nearly 13 million Americans age 65 and older will develop AD and other dementias by 2050,
     according to the 2023 Alzheimer's Association Disease Facts and Figures report (https://openstax.org/r/
     alzorgnews). Alzheimer's is irreversible and eventually has a major negative impact on cognition due to loss of short-
     term memory, reasoning, insight, and judgment and the inability to learn new information. It also has an undesirable
     effect on a client's social functioning skills. However, the disease progresses very slowly; the risk of AD increases
     with age, but it can also occur between the ages of 30 and the early 60s (National Institute of Neurological Disorders
     and Stroke, 2023a).

     Several factors have been identified that may reduce the risk of AD. These include higher levels of formal education,
     routinely engaging in mentally challenging activities--such as reading--adequate uninterrupted deep sleep, engaging
     in routine aerobic exercise, eating a healthy balanced diet, and maintaining social interactions.

     Two major goals of care are maintaining socialization and providing support for caregivers. One way to provide relief
     for caregivers while increasing socialization for clients is adult daycare and respite centers.

     Pathophysiology

     To fully understand how a drug alters symptoms, it is important to understand the pathophysiology of the disease
     being treated at the biochemical level. In most central nervous system disorders, the existing knowledge is limited.
     The brain is a complex structure, and the overall neuronal degeneration and cerebral atrophy recognized in AD has
     been theorized to result from a variety of changes. Researchers are still trying to unravel the underlying
     pathophysiology of AD. The following is a list of alterations that have been identified as origins for the cognitive
     decline seen with this disease (Huang, 2023):

         · Degeneration of neurons: This destruction of neurons first occurs in the hippocampus, the area of the brain

        When neurons of the cerebral cortex begin to degenerate, speech, reasoning, and other higher cognitive
        functions become impaired.
    · Beta-amyloid plaques: These plaques form outside neurons. Their central core is composed of beta-amyloid,
        a protein fragment of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Accumulation of beta-amyloid begins very early in the
        disease before any appearance of clinical manifestations. It is believed this protein plays a central role in AD.
    · Neurofibrillary tangles and abnormal tau protein: These tangles form inside neurons. They result when the
        orderly arrangement of microtubules becomes disrupted. Microtubules are responsible for bringing nutrients
        to the axons and back. Normally, tau protein binds to these microtubules and provides stability. In AD, tau
        protein becomes "sticky" and tangles together with other tau threads. The microtubule is unable to transport
        nutrients, so the neuron can no longer function and eventually dies. As more and more neurons die, the brain
        atrophies.
    · Oxidative stress: Oxidative stress produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as free radicals. These cause
       brain cell damage and cellular apoptosis. Oxidative stress is the term used to describe damage to cellular
        components caused by ROS. Due to their characteristic unpaired electrons, ROS can set off chain reactions
        where they remove electrons from other molecules, which then become oxidized and reactive and do the
        same to other molecules, causing a chain reaction. ROS can cause permanent damage to cellular lipids,
        proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids. Damaged DNA can lead to genetic mutations and even cancer.
    · Deficiency of ACh: The loss of ACh is crucial for two reasons: (1) it is an important transmitter in the
        hippocampus and cerebral cortex, where the degeneration is occurring; and (2) this transmitter is critical in
        forming memories.
    · Genetics: Apolipoprotein E is known for its role in transporting cholesterol. One form of apolipoprotein E is
        associated with AD. Genetic research has shown that those with one or two copies of the gene that codes for
        apolipoprotein E4 (APOE-e4) are at a higher risk for developing AD. Additional genes have been identified as
        being definitively associated with AD. These include amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene, presenilin-1 (PS1)
        gene, and presenilin-2 (PS2) gene. A person who has any mutation to these genes will produce proteins that
        have neurotoxic properties, which will promote neuronal death. Additionally, these mutations can lead to the
        formation of neurofibrillary tangles and plaques.

Etiology

An underlying single cause for AD has yet to be discovered. There have been important theories and findings, but it
is not known how these pieces fit together. Interestingly, the major pathologic findings begin to develop a decade or
more before clinical manifestations are even observed. At this point, the etiology is considered multifactorial.
Current potential causes of AD include:

    · Degeneration of neurons in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex that subsequently cause cerebral atrophy
    · Formation of beta-amyloid plaques
    · Accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles and chemically altered tau protein
    · Oxidative stress forming free radicals that damage cellular components caused by ROS (This is discussed

        more in the following section.)

     Diagnostics

     Although it is impossible to definitively diagnose AD without a postmortem autopsy, the diagnosis is made based on
     symptoms and exclusion of alternative pathology. During the autopsy, the typical characteristics of senile plaques
     and neurofibrillary tangles can be visualized.

     Clinical Manifestations

     As the disease progresses, the clinical manifestations worsen to the point where the client is unable to
     independently perform their activities of daily living (ADL). They become reliant on others for assistance. Early in the
     disease, the following mild manifestations may be witnessed: confusion, memory loss, disorientation, getting lost in
     familiar surroundings, problems with routine tasks, and changes in personality and judgment. Moderate
     manifestations include difficulty with ADLs (feeding and bathing), impaired organization and planning, impaired
     mathematical ability, anxiety/agitation, sleep disturbances, wandering, and difficulty in recognizing family and
     friends. Late manifestations include loss of speech, anorexia, impaired swallowing, weight loss, difficulty with
     movement, loss of ability to appropriately respond to the environment, sense of paranoia, delusions,
     hallucinations, and inability to control bladder and bowel function. At this point, the client is completely dependent
     on caregivers. AD will eventually destroy enough brain function to cause death.

     Pharmacological Management

     Currently, there is no known cure for AD. Drugs given for AD may at best slow the loss of memory and cognition in
     hopes of affording the person extra time to be able to continue functioning independently. Unfortunately, often the
     person observes minimal and short-term clinical efficacy from these medications. The AChE inhibitors (also known
     as cholinesterase inhibitors) were the first class of drugs approved by the FDA to treat AD. There are currently three
     drugs within this class. The other drug class, which currently contains one drug, is the N-methyl-D-aspartate
     (NMDA) receptor antagonist. In 2014, a capsule containing a combination of memantine hydrochloride ER (NMDA
     receptor antagonist) and donepezil hydrochloride (AChE inhibitor) was approved for the treatment of moderate to
     severe dementia of the Alzheimer's type. This drug has the capability of targeting two different sites of action.

AChE Inhibitors

AChE inhibitors bind to and interfere with the enzyme AChE. This enzyme is responsible for the destruction of ACh.
By inhibiting this enzyme, more internally released ACh is available for use within cholinergic synapses. The result is
enhanced transmission by central cholinergic neurons that have not yet been destroyed. Elevated ACh levels in the
cortex can slow the neuronal degradation that occurs in this disease. Treatment with AChE inhibitors does not stop
the progression of AD but reduces how quickly neurons are destroyed.

Donepezil
Donepezil, a centrally acting reversible cholinesterase inhibitor, is used primarily for treatment of mild to severe
forms of AD. Centrally acting agents readily cross the blood-brain barrier. Donepezil increases ACh in the brain by
preventing its breakdown. Drug absorption is unaffected by food. Peak effects occur in 3-8 hours. Metabolism
occurs in the liver, resulting in the production of several pharmacologically active metabolites. Excretion is through
the kidneys. An important pharmacokinetic note is that donepezil is highly protein bound (96%); therefore, it has a
prolonged half-life of 70 hours. This means that it takes an estimated 15 days for the drug to reach steady state.

     SAFETY ALERT

 Similarly Named Drugs

  Do not confuse Aricept (AChE inhibitor) with Aciphex (proton pump inhibitor).

  (Source: Institute for Safe Medication Practices [ISMP], 2023)

Galantamine
Galantamine is only used in those with mild to moderate AD. The drug is prepared by extraction from daffodil bulbs.
Like donepezil, this drug is a reversible inhibitor of AChE. GI effects are greater than with donepezil but less than
with oral rivastigmine (see the next section). Adverse effects are the same as for donepezil with the addition of
potential life-threatening skin reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Clients and caregivers should stop
the drug and report any signs of a skin rash to their health care provider. As with the other AChE inhibitors, benefits
of the drug are modest and short-term. The drug is available in IR and ER tablets as well as an oral solution. Its half-
life is 7 hours.

Rivastigmine
Rivastigmine is FDA-approved for those with mild to severe AD because it enhances cholinergic function. The
manner in which it does so is not fully known. It is believed to increase the ACh concentration by reversible
inhibition of its hydrolysis by cholinesterase. Additionally, rivastigmine is used in the management of mild to
moderate dementia due to Parkinson's disease. The drug is available in capsules, oral solution, and a transdermal
patch. Peripheral cholinergic effects, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and anorexia, occur more frequently with
this drug. Blood levels are lower when using the transdermal route; therefore, the intensity of adverse effects is
decreased. The liver does not metabolize this agent, so there are no significant drug-drug interactions.

     CLINICAL TIP

 Rivastigmine and Weight

  Rivastigmine blood levels vary with weight; careful titration and monitoring should be performed in clients with
  low or high body weights.

  CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

  The client using a rivastigmine transdermal patch should:

      · Apply the patch every 24 hours to clean, dry, hairless, and intact healthy skin in a place where clothes will
          not rub against it.
286  10 · Drugs to Treat Myasthenia Gravis and Alzheimer's Disease

         · Avoid skin areas where cream, lotion, or powder has recently been applied.
         · Press down firmly for 30 seconds when applying the patch until the edges stick well.
         · Use the upper or lower back as the site of application to prevent inadvertent removal. If sites on the back

             are not accessible, apply the patch to the upper arm or chest.
         · Only wear one patch at a time. (They should remove the previous day's patch before applying a new

             patch). If a patch falls off or a dose is missed, they should apply a new patch immediately.
         · Place used patches in the previously saved pouch and discard in the trash, away from pets or children.
         · Wash hands with soap and water after removing the patch; avoid touching the eyes until hands are

             washed. In case of contact with eyes after handling the patch, rinse immediately with water.

     The client using a rivastigmine transdermal patch should not:

         · Use the patch if the pouch seal is broken or the patch is cut, damaged, or altered in any way.
         · Apply to skin that is red, irritated, or cut.
         · Use the same site for a period of 14 days.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Many of the adverse effects caused by AChE inhibitors relate to the stimulation of the PSNS. GI effects are the most
     common, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, increased salivation, and anorexia. These drugs can
     cause cardiac-suppressive effects, which can result in symptomatic bradycardia, heart block, and even cardiac
     arrest. They stimulate the contraction of the bladder muscle and relax the internal sphincter, which causes a sense
     of urinary urgency for the client. CNS cholinergic effects include miosis, blurred far vision, and difficulty seeing in
     dim light. Other CNS effects of headaches, dizziness, drowsiness, and possible seizures can also occur. AChE
     inhibitor drugs can also impair breathing in those with pulmonary disorders, such as asthma and chronic obstructive
     pulmonary disease (COPD), due to bronchoconstriction and increased bronchial secretions. Frequent monitoring of
     the breathing pattern is required. Clients with cardiac conduction disorders should be monitored carefully due to the
     suppressive effects on cardiac impulses.

     Contraindications include peptic ulcer disease because these drugs increase the secretion of hydrochloric acid in
     the stomach, which can worsen the ulcer and potentially cause perforation and/or bleeding. Because of the
     stimulatory effect on the bladder and bowel, anyone with a bladder or bowel obstruction (mechanical or neurologic)

should avoid taking these drugs to reduce the risk of rupture.

Any drugs with anticholinergic effects--such as first-generation histamine-1 receptor antagonists (H1RAs),
conventional antipsychotics, and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)--should not be used concurrently because they
will reduce or block therapeutic effects of cholinergic agonists. Other parasympathomimetics can cause a
synergistic effect if used concurrently. Frequent intake of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or
glucocorticoids (steroids) can increase the risk of peptic ulcer disease. Clients taking drugs such as beta blockers
(propranolol/metoprolol) or digoxin should be especially careful of significant bradycardia because they both cause
negative chronotropic effects.

NMDA Receptor Antagonist

Glutamate is the primary excitatory amino acid in the CNS. When glutamate binds to the NMDA receptors, it
288  10 · Drugs to Treat Myasthenia Gravis and Alzheimer's Disease

     displaces magnesium from the receptor channel and causes calcium to enter neurons, producing an excitatory
     effect. The brief period of calcium entry creates a signal in the learning and memory process. Glutamate will then
     quickly dissociate from the receptor, which permits magnesium to block the channel again. This prevents further
     calcium influx. If there is a pathological situation, glutamate will slowly but steadily leak from the presynaptic
     neuron, which prevents magnesium from reblocking the channel and allows calcium to continue entering the
     neuron. Too much neuronal calcium is toxic, causing neurodegeneration. In addition, excessive calcium overpowers
     the signal and impairs the memory and learning process.

     Memantine
     Memantine (Namenda, Namenda XR) is indicated for clients with moderate to severe dementia of the Alzheimer's
     type. This drug has been shown to exhibit neuroprotective action (slows the neurotoxicity). Memantine is an
     antagonist of the NMDA receptor subtype of the glutamate receptor. The drug blocks the influx of calcium when
     extracellular glutamate is low but permits calcium influx when extracellular glutamate is high. When the glutamate
     level is low, memantine can occupy the NMDA receptor channel. During this time, the level of intracellular calcium
     can normalize because no further calcium entry is permitted. During an action potential, a burst of glutamate is
     released, displacing memantine. This causes a short period of calcium influx. Because intracellular calcium is low,
     normal signaling of memory and learning can occur. When glutamate moves away from the receptor, memantine
     reblocks the channel, which stops further calcium entry.

     Memantine ER has a terminal half-life of 60-80 hours; therefore, it can be prescribed once a day. In contrast, the
     immediate-release form is administered at 10 mg twice daily. A target dose of 5 mg twice daily is recommended in
     clients with severe renal impairment. This drug is predominately excreted unchanged in the urine. The drug is
     available in capsule form and administered orally. Any condition or drug that raises urinary pH to 8 or more can
     reduce drug elimination by 80% (see drug interactions and caution in Table 10.7), which will result in the
     accumulation of memantine within the plasma and increase the risk of adverse effects. If a client takes too much
     memantine, acidifying the urine with K-Phos Neutral or ascorbic acid, for example, will help promote elimination of
     the drug.

     SAFETY ALERT

 Similarly Named Drugs

  Do not confuse memantine (NMDA receptor antagonist) with methadone (full opioid agonist).

AChE Inhibitor/NMDA Receptor Antagonist

This is a fixed combination dose of a cholinesterase inhibitor and an NMDA receptor antagonist (Namzaric). The
agent combines donepezil and memantine. Combining these drugs can be beneficial because each drug has a
different mechanism of action. The cholinesterase inhibitors address the cholinergic defect, and the NMDA receptor
antagonist reduces the abnormally high levels of glutamate. Essentially, the two agents confer independent
benefits, and they act synergistically to enhance each other's effects.

This is an extended-release oral agent that is administered to clients with moderate to severe AD. The combination
form is for those who are stabilized on 10 mg of donepezil daily but not taking memantine. Initial dose of memantine
ER is 7 mg combined with donepezil 10 mg daily at bedtime. The dose can be increased weekly with a maintenance
dose of memantine ER 28 mg and donepezil 10 mg daily. The nurse must monitor the client's mental status and
ability to perform activities of daily living (DailyMed, Namzaric, 2019).

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients receiving medications for AD:

    · Emphasize that treatment is not a cure and will not reverse signs or symptoms and usually will only produce
        modest benefits.

    · Obtain baseline data, such as orientation, mood/affect, and ability to carry out activities of daily living.
    · Assess client's presence of bowel sounds, urine output, muscle strength, and mental status.
    · Assess blood pressure, heart rate, electrocardiogram, respiratory status, and changes in urine and bowel

        elimination.
    · Evaluate the client's ability to swallow with ease and speech pattern.
    · Administer antiemetics to reduce nausea and vomiting.
    · Monitor client's therapeutic response to the drug, such as improved memory and mood stabilization.
    · Monitor renal and liver function periodically because this can alter the metabolism and elimination of the

        drugs.
    · Ensure that caregivers are provided additional resources to help cope with the disease of their loved one.
    · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

        teaching guidelines.

  CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

  The client taking a drug for AD should:

      · Take ER capsules whole.
      · When taking an oral disintegrating tablet, allow medication to dissolve completely on the tongue and

          follow with water.
      · Prevent possible falls due to dizziness (remove clutter and rugs, have adequate lighting, use walking

          devices, etc.).
      · Ensure they have ready access to restroom/commode due to the stimulatory effect on the GI and GU

          systems.
      · Take medication with food to decrease gastric irritation.
      · Understand GI upset is usually temporary and will subside over time.
      · Contact their health care provider immediately if there is any difficulty with swallowing, speaking,

          breathing, or increased memory loss or agitation occurs.
290  10 · Drugs to Treat Myasthenia Gravis and Alzheimer's Disease

         · Report severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, weight loss, dehydration, or signs of GI bleeding.
         · Take donepezil at bedtime.
         · Know how to manage and cope with emotional outbursts.
         · Assess for any skin rashes and notify the health care provider instantly if observed.

     The client taking a drug for AD should not:

         · Chew, break, or crush ER capsules.
         · Rise or change positions quickly due to possible orthostatic hypotension.
         · Stop drugs abruptly because symptoms will quickly reoccur.
         · If a dose of medication is missed, do not double up on the next dose--take the next dose as scheduled.

     Intravenous Alzheimer's Disease Treatment

     In July 2023, a new intravenous medication, lecanemab-irmb (LEQEMBI), received full FDA approval as a
     treatment for the mild dementia stage of Alzheimer's disease. The classification of this medication is an amyloid
     beta-directed antibody. The drug works by targeting harmful amyloid proteins and reducing existing amyloid
     plaque within the brain. An 18-month study was conducted with a sample of 1,795 people ages 50-90 years.
     The sample was diverse and included individuals from different ethnic and racial backgrounds who were
     diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment. This study concluded that treatment with lecanemab-irmb slows the
     progression of early AD. The drug helped improve participants' memory as well as their ability solve problems
     and complete daily activities. Overall, the medication's main goal is to increase the duration of independence in
     those with AD. Amyloid-related abnormalities are indicated by a temporary swelling in specific areas of the brain.
     This is seen using imaging studies. This usually resolves over time. Additional adverse effects may include an
     allergic reaction, angioedema, or an infusion-related reaction, such as fever, palpitations, dizziness, and/or
     shortness of breath. To reduce this effect, an individual may be pretreated with antihistamines, anti-
     inflammatories, or steroids (Eisai, 2023).

11.4 Drugs Used in the Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis

INTRODUCTION The brain, nerves, and skeletal muscles--collectively known as the neuromuscular system--work
together to cause movement. Purposeless and uncoordinated movements can be extremely disabling and may
result in social isolation. Long-term degenerative disorders of the neuromuscular system include conditions in which
neurologic function deteriorates over time. Such disorders are usually unpreventable, and options for treatment are
limited. This chapter discusses two disorders of the neuromuscular system: Parkinson's disease and multiple
sclerosis.

11.1 Introduction to Parkinson's Disease

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 11.1.1 Describe the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease.
    · 11.1.2 Identify the clinical manifestations related to Parkinson's disease.
    · 11.1.3 Identify the etiology and diagnostic studies related to Parkinson's disease.
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurologic condition that destroys some of the dopamine-secreting
neurons of the substantia nigra, a critical area of the brain that produces dopamine and has an important role in
controlling an individual's movements. Dopamine loss occurs in other regions of the brain as well, including the
296  11 · Drugs to Treat Parkinson's Disease and Multiple Sclerosis

     brainstem, thalamus, and cortex. Noradrenergic neurons require dopamine in order to produce norepinephrine, and
     in PD, these neurons are also adversely affected. Both dopamine and norepinephrine are necessary catecholamines
     to keep the body regulated during the stress response. The substantia nigra is one of the structures of the basal
     ganglia, also known as the extrapyramidal system (EPS). This area of the brain is responsible for voluntary motor
     movement, posture, and cognitive and emotional functions. Several neurotransmitters mediate communication in
     this region, including glutamate (excitatory), dopamine (generally excitatory), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA;
     inhibitory), and acetylcholine (ACh) (excitatory or inhibitory).

     The condition occurs predominantly in middle-aged and older adults. This disease affects approximately 1 million
     people in the United States. Furthermore, it is estimated that 90,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. The
     average life expectancy of a person with PD is generally the same as for people who do not have the disease
     (Parkinson's Foundation, 2023b). The progression of clinical manifestation varies slightly for each individual
     because the disease is highly diverse (Parkinson's Foundation, 2023e).

       SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

       Gender and Geographic Differences in the Incidence of Parkinson's Disease

           · PD affects males 1.5 times more often than females.
           · Incidence is higher in certain geographic regions: the "Rust Belt" (parts of the northwestern and

               midwestern United States previously regulated by industrial manufacturing), Southern California,
               Southeastern Texas, Central Pennsylvania, and Florida.

       (Source: Parkinson's Foundation, 2023d)

     Etiology

     The exact cause of PD is still unknown. Theories exist related to the causes of the degeneration of the basal ganglia
     including viral infections, blunt head trauma, encephalitis, atherosclerosis, and exposure to certain drugs and
     environmental factors, such as pesticides. There is also most likely an interaction between genetic predisposition
     and environmental factors. Parkinson-like symptoms may arise because of antipsychotic drugs. Antipsychotics
     block dopamine receptors, interfering with the same neural pathway and functions affected by the insufficient
     amount of dopamine. They also produce movement disorders, which involve extrapyramidal reactions, such as
     dystonia (involuntary muscle contractions causing repetitive or twisting movements), akathisia (restless, constant
     moving), tardive dyskinesia (sudden involuntary and uncontrollable movements), and parkinsonism (stooped
     posture, shuffling gait, and muscle rigidity). Antipsychotics are discussed in more detail in Psychopharmacologic
     Drugs.

     Pathophysiology

     A part of the basal ganglia called the substantia nigra (see Figure 11.2) contains nerves that secrete dopamine; this
     secretion of dopamine progressively degenerates with PD. Because the basal ganglia works with the cerebral cortex
     and thalamus, it helps with both coordination of complex patterns of motor activity and cognitive control of motor
     activity. In PD, neurons in the substantia nigra begin to atrophy, become impaired, or die; some contain Lewy
     bodies, which are alpha-synuclein protein aggregates that impair transport of dopamine and contribute to neuronal
     death. Mutations in the mitochondria, resulting in free radicals, can also damage membranes, proteins, DNA, and
     other components of the cells in PD. Furthermore, depigmentation of the dopamine-producing neurons contributes
     to an inflammatory response from the extracellular melanin (pigments produced by melanocytes that gives color to
     the skin and eyes) in surrounding brain tissue (Capriotti, 2020). Another midbrain structure, called the ventral
     tegmental area (VTA), also contains cell bodies that produce dopamine essential for movement. The VTA is also
     involved in PD and gradually degenerates as the disease progresses.

The two major neurotransmitters implicated in the disease process are dopamine and acetylcholine (ACh). The
correct ratio of these neurotransmitters is essential in regulating balance, posture, standing, walking, and writing.
People with PD have an imbalance that results in a decrease in dopamine and an excess of ACh. With the lack of
dopamine, the excitatory ACh is the dominant neurotransmitter. There are also multiple glutamate pathways that
are excitatory in this area of the brain. The result of this imbalance between excitation and inhibition of the motor
system is apparent as the manifestations of PD arise (Capriotti, 2020).

Diagnostics

Currently, no single definitive test exists to diagnose PD. The diagnosis is based on these factors:

    · Medical history and clinical manifestations
    · Blood and laboratory tests to rule out other disorders that may be causing the symptoms
    · Brain scans to rule out other disorders (Note that computed tomography [CT] and magnetic resonance

        imaging [MRI] scans of people with PD usually appear unremarkable.)
    · Positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission CT (SPECT) that show reduced uptake of

        dopaminergic markers
    · Substantial and sustained responses to medications for PD

In rare cases, where people have a clearly inherited form of PD, researchers can test for known gene mutations as a
way of determining an individual's risk of developing the disease (Capriotti, 2020; Mayo Clinic, 2023).

Clinical Manifestations

Motor symptoms of PD occur late in the disease process. Usually 60%-80% of the dopamine-releasing neurons of
the substantia nigra are already destroyed before the onset of motor symptoms (Parkinson's Foundation, 2023e).

The four primary motor manifestations of overt PD (shown in Figure 11.3) are (Capriotti, 2020; National Institute of
Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2023b):

    · Tremors: This involuntary quivering is progressive and often begins in one isolated area, such as the head or
        hands, and then often spreads to the legs. Tremors are seen when the body is at rest and disappear upon
        purposeful movement or during sleep. "Pill rolling" is a classic behavior. Clients rub the thumb and forefinger
        together as if an actual pill were between them. The tremors usually begin unilaterally but become bilateral as
        time progresses.

    · Rigidity: Rigidity involves stiffness--the resistance to movement by both flexors and extensors. During passive
        range of motion, there is resistance and the client exhibits jerky movements, also known as cogwheel rigidity.
        The tongue and throat may become involved, leading to difficulty swallowing and talking. The client's speech
        becomes soft and monotone with difficulty articulating words.
298  11 · Drugs to Treat Parkinson's Disease and Multiple Sclerosis

     · Bradykinesia: This slowed movement is the most noticeable of all the symptoms. Clients with PD have
        difficulties initiating movement, such as walking or getting up out of a chair. Additionally, they have difficulty
        controlling fine muscle movements due to the loss of dexterity. Their writing becomes small and cramped,
        which is referred to as micrographia. During ambulation, clients can be seen shuffling their feet and not taking
        normal strides. Bradykinesia may progress to akinesia, which is the inability to move. Also, clients usually
        present with an expressionless face or flat affect due to facial rigidity. Blinking of the eyes is minimal. This is
        referred to as "masked face."

     · Postural instability: Clients with PD often demonstrate a stooped posture. They have a reduced arm swing and
        take small, quick steps while walking. They also may stop suddenly while walking. They do not have postural
        reflexes, so making corrective adjustments is challenging. The result is impaired balance and increased risk of
        falls. This symptom usually occurs later in the disease progression.

     Clients with PD also lose nerve endings that usually produce norepinephrine (NE). The neurotransmitter, NE, is the
     main chemical messenger that controls many automatic bodily functions. The loss of NE may explain several
     nonmotor manifestations seen in PD, including:

         · Mood changes, such as depression and anxiety
         · Cognitive changes, such as memory loss, impaired judgment, poor decision-making, and dementia
         · Perceptual disturbances, such as hallucinations, delusions, and psychosis
         · Sexual dysfunction due to the effects on nerve signals from the brain
         · Sleep dysfunction (difficulty staying asleep, nightmares, acting out dreams that can be harmful)
         · Difficulty with chewing and swallowing

               Food and saliva may collect in the mouth and back of the throat, which can result in choking or drooling. It
                   may be difficult for the client to obtain adequate nutrition.

         · Autonomic symptoms, such as orthostatic hypotension, inability to release body heat, constipation, blurred
             vision, oily skin on the face, daytime sleepiness, and nighttime insomnia

     Pharmacologic Management

     Pharmacotherapy is essentially given to reduce distressing symptoms experienced in clients who have PD. The
     overall goal of medication is to maximize independence and mobility. With PD, there is too little dopamine and too
     much ACh, so the approach to treatment is to restore the balance between the two neurotransmitters. Drugs are
     classified into two broad categories: (1) dopamine agonists that directly or indirectly activate dopamine receptors
     through multiple mechanisms and (2) anticholinergic agents that block ACh receptors (National Institute of
     Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2023b).

include physical therapy to encourage clients to be as active as possible and prevent skeletal deformities,
occupational therapy to teach clients how to use adapted tools and methods to make activities of daily living easier,
and speech therapy to help clients swallow safely and possibly assist with speech dysfunctions. Exercise is essential
to increase strength, flexibility, and balance along with reducing depression and/or anxiety. Some alternative
therapies that also may improve muscle strength and flexibility and reduce risk of falls are yoga and tai chi. To
enhance mental well-being and reduce pain, meditation or relaxation techniques are useful (Mayo Clinic, 2023).
Deep brain stimulation has been found to be effective in reducing tremors, bradykinesia, and rigidity. A pulse
generator sends controlled electrical signals to electrodes surgically implanted in the brain. The electrodes
painlessly stimulate the brain to block signals that cause many of the motor symptoms (Mayo Clinic, 2023).

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 11.2.1 Identify the characteristics of drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease.
    · 11.2.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, contraindications, and interactions of drugs

        used to treat Parkinson's disease.
    · 11.2.3 Describe nursing implications of drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease.
    · 11.2.4 Explain the client education related to drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease.

Currently there is no cure for PD. Although pharmacologic management is a first-line treatment, drugs only provide
symptomatic relief; they do not cease or reverse the neuronal degeneration. Unfortunately, although symptoms may
significantly improve at first, the symptoms frequently reappear over time as the disease worsens and drugs
become less effective.

Drugs are given to restore the balance of dopamine and ACh in certain areas of the brain. This can be achieved by
increasing dopamine levels with dopaminergics (classes of drugs that have different mechanisms of action), such as
dopamine agonists, monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitors, and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors.
Drugs are also given to block the excitatory actions of ACh. These are cholinergic antagonists (anticholinergics).
Many times, the client is on combination therapy to prolong the therapeutic effects. Notably, administering
exogenous dopamine is not an option because it has difficulty crossing the blood-brain barrier and has an extremely
short half-life.

Anticholinergics

Anticholinergics are not as frequently used as they were in the past due to their multiple adverse effects. Several
interchangeable terms are used for the medication class of anticholinergics--cholinergic blockers, muscarinic
antagonists, and parasympatholytics--all of which have the same meaning. Anticholinergic agents produce their
effects by preventing the activation of muscarinic receptors. These drugs work in opposition to cholinergic agonists.
The two most common anticholinergics are benztropine mesylate and trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride (Parkinson's
Foundation, 2023a).

     CLINICAL TIP

     Differences in Receptor Sensitivity

     Not all muscarinic receptors are equally sensitive to blockade by most of the anticholinergic agents. At some
     sites, only a small concentration of drug is required to effectively block receptors. These drugs are considered
     high-potency agents. At other sites, a higher concentration is needed. Using higher concentrations of a
     muscarinic antagonist will result in increased risk of adverse effects.

     Benztropine mesylate possesses both anticholinergic and antihistaminic effects, although only the anticholinergic
     action has been established to be the source of therapeutic effectiveness in managing PD. Despite the ability to
     divide doses into two or three daily, clients experience greatest relief by taking the entire dose at bedtime. The
     drug's long duration of action makes it suitable for bedtime medication because its effects may last throughout the
     night, enabling clients to turn in bed during the night more easily and to rise in the morning without having much
     difficulty (DailyMed, Benztropine Mesylate, 2021).

     There are no significant differences between trihexyphenidyl and benztropine. Both are predominantly used for
     reducing tremors and dystonia in younger people. The drugs should be avoided in the older adult client due to the
     potential adverse effects.

     Table 11.1 lists common anticholinergics and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

     Drug                             Routes and Dosage Ranges

     Benztropine  Tablets (EPS except tardive dyskinesia): 1-4 mg orally once or twice daily. In some clients,
       mesylate   this will be adequate; others may require more or less.
      (Cogentin)  Intravenously (acute dystonic reaction): 1-2 mg daily, followed by 1-2 mg orally twice daily to
                  prevent recurrence.

     Trihexyphenidyl Tablets: Initial dose: 1 mg orally the first day; can be increased by 2 mg increments every 3-5

     hydrochloride days until a total of 6-10 mg is given daily. Total daily dose will depend on what is found to be

     (Artane)     the optimal level. Many clients derive maximum benefit from 6-10 mg daily.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     This drug classification can cause numerous adverse effects, which is why it is not used as commonly as it was in
     the past. Anhidrosis can occur from the decreased secretion from sweat glands. This can be dangerous because the
     body is unable to release heat, which can lead to hyperthermia or heat stroke. Dry mouth, due to the decrease in
     salivation, can become very severe, resulting in difficulty with swallowing or speaking. This increases the client's risk
     for choking and/or aspiration pneumonia. Dry mouth can also cause dental caries, halitosis (bad breath), gum
     problems, and oral infections. A slight reduction in dosage may control nausea and still give sufficient relief of
     symptoms (DailyMed, Benztropine Mesylate, 2021; Parkinson's Foundation, 2023a).

     Clients with mental disorders may experience an intensification of mental symptoms. In such cases, anti-
     Parkinsonian drugs can precipitate a toxic psychosis characterized by confusion, memory impairment, visual
     hallucinations, delusions, and nervousness. Clients with mental disorders should be kept under careful observation.

     Blockade of cholinergic receptors in the eye may precipitate or aggravate glaucoma because it increases the
     aqueous humor in the anterior chamber by disrupting the exit of the fluid. In addition, these drugs cause mydriasis
     (pupil dilation) by blocking muscarinic receptors on the ciliary muscle and sphincter of the iris; paralysis of the iris
     sphincter results, preventing pupil constriction. The eye is unable to adapt to bright light, which causes
     photophobia, or intolerance to light (DailyMed, Benztropine Mesylate, 2021; Parkinson's Foundation, 2023a).

     Blocking cardiac muscarinic receptors will eliminate parasympathetic nervous system influence on the heart.
     Anticholinergics cause an increase in heart rate, which can cause dysrhythmias in a client with preexisting
     tachycardia or a co-existing condition, such as hyperthyroidism. Urinary retention can occur due to the blockade of
     muscarinic receptors of the urinary tract. This relaxes the detrusor muscle, which reduces pressure within the
     bladder and increases the tone of the urinary internal sphincter, placing the client at risk for urinary tract infections.

     Access for free at openstax.org
11.2 · Anti-Parkinsonian Drugs                                                                                         301

Also, muscarinic antagonists block receptors in the intestine, decreasing the tone and motility of the intestinal
smooth muscle. This can result in constipation or paralytic ileus. Furthermore, because anticholinergics block
muscarinic receptors in the bronchi, they can promote bronchial dilation. This is a benefit for those who have
asthma; however, these drugs also cause drying and thickening of bronchial secretions, which can lead to mucus
plugging. Clients with asthma must be closely monitored (Capriotti, 2020).

If a client has any type of intestinal or urinary obstruction, like benign prostatic hypertrophy, these medications
should be avoided because they will worsen the condition. Those with a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis should avoid
anticholinergics because they could further reduce ACh's ability to send signals, which could worsen symptoms or
trigger a crisis.

Antihistamines, first-generation antipsychotics, and tricyclic antidepressants should not be used concurrently with
anticholinergics because these agents also possess antimuscarinic properties. The combination of multiple
anticholinergic drugs can worsen the adverse effects mentioned previously. The use of alcohol can increase the risk
of psychosis. Cholinergic agents, such as bethanechol used for urinary retention, can negate the effects of the
anticholinergic agents because these drugs stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system by mimicking the action
of ACh.

        SAFETY ALERT

     American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria ®

     Anticholinergic drugs are designated as potentially inappropriate for use in adults 65 years and older because
     older adults are very sensitive to the adverse effects like orthostatic hypotension, urinary retention, constipation,
     and tachycardia. Sedation, confusion, and blurred vision are risk factors for falls.

     (Source: American Geriatrics Society, 2023)

     Nursing Implications
     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking anticholinergics:

         · Assess for decreased rigidity and tremor.
         · Monitor client's ability to engage in self-care tasks and walk independently.
         · Assess for an increase in heart rate and/or blood pressure.
         · Monitor for any signs of respiratory distress or moist, nonproductive cough.
         · Assess level of consciousness and orientation.
         · Darken room for photophobia due to mydriasis (dilated pupils).

    · Ensure the client is receiving proper oral hygiene.
    · Encourage frequent sips of water to prevent dehydration.
    · Assess for difficulty with swallowing--if needed, request consult with occupational therapy.
    · Assess for speech impairments--if needed, request consult for speech pathologist.
    · Monitor intake and output for reduction of urine output and positive net balance.
    · Perform a bladder scan to assess for residual volume of urine due to urinary retention.
    · Assess for signs and symptoms of paralytic ileus, such as constipation, abdominal pain, diminished bowel

        sounds, and abdominal distention.
    · Assess for muscle weakness.
    · Provide frequent rest periods during the day to avoid aggravating the tremors and rigidity.
    · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

        teaching guidelines.

  CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

  The client taking an anticholinergic should:

      · Have an understanding that PD is not curable, but treatment can significantly reduce symptoms.
      · Be advised to report gastrointestinal complaints, fever, or heat intolerance promptly.
      · Minimize urinary retention by voiding just before taking the medication.
      · Keep lighting dim to avoid discomfort due to pupillary dilation. Wear dark glasses when out in the sun.
      · Engage in physical therapy to increase balance and strength.
      · Wear shoes that slip on and clothing that contains Velcro or zippers for easier handling.
      · Avoid alcohol and sedatives, including over-the-counter medications that contain these.
      · Drink water frequently.
      · Keep sugarless hard candy or gum on hand to minimize the dry mouth.
      · Maintain adequate dental/oral hygiene.
      · Visit the ophthalmologist and dentist regularly.
      · Consume adequate dietary fiber and fluid.

  The client taking an anticholinergic should not:

      · Engage in strenuous activity outside when the temperature is high.
      · Drive or perform hazardous tasks if their vision or alertness is impaired.
      · Rise or change positions quickly due to possible orthostatic hypotension.
      · Stop drugs abruptly because symptoms will quickly reoccur.
      · Overexert themselves; they should take rest periods between activities.

Dopaminergics

Dopaminergic means related to dopamine. Dopamine constitutes approximately 80% of the catecholamine content
within the brain. Dopamine is known to have an essential role in nearly all cognitive functions, including self-initiated
motor control, motivation, and learning (Costa & Schoenbaum, 2022). Dopaminergic substances increase
dopamine-related activity in the brain. These dopaminergic substances are also referred to as dopamine replacers
when dopaminergic neurons are dysfunctional or destroyed, such as what occurs in PD. Neurons that synthesize or
contain dopamine and synapses with dopamine receptors in them may also be labeled as dopaminergic. Enzymes
that regulate the biosynthesis or metabolism of dopamine, such as dopamine decarboxylase, MAO, and COMT, also
are deemed dopaminergic. In addition, any endogenous or exogenous chemical substances that affect dopamine
receptors or dopamine release can be said to have dopaminergic properties. Two prominent examples are opioids
and amphetamines.

Levodopa
Levodopa was introduced in the 1960s and has been a cornerstone of PD treatment for many years (Ovallath &
Sulthana, 2017). Levodopa is a metabolic precursor of dopamine and is inactive until it undergoes conversion to its
active state. This drug has proven to be extremely beneficial in the early stages of PD. Unfortunately, over time, the
304  11 · Drugs to Treat Parkinson's Disease and Multiple Sclerosis

     number of neurons decreases, and fewer cells are capable of converting the levodopa to dopamine. Motor
     fluctuations then develop, and the client experiences the relief of symptoms only when the drug is present.

     The purpose of this drug is to replenish the brain's reduced supply of dopamine by increasing dopamine synthesis.
     Levodopa is absorbed in the blood from the small intestine and travels through the circulation to the brain. Once it
     crosses the blood-brain barrier, it binds to dopamine receptors on GABA neurons, helping to restore the balance
     between neurotransmitters (Parkinson's Foundation, 2023b).

     Levodopa is not used as a monotherapy; given alone, it is not beneficial. It should be administered with carbidopa
     (discussed later in this chapter). Without the combination, a large majority of levodopa gets decarboxylated in the
     periphery--causing systemic effects such as nausea and vomiting, dysrhythmias, and hypotension--and resulting in
     less levodopa crossing the blood-brain barrier. The drug combination increases the amount available to cross the
     blood-brain barrier.

     Inbrija is an inhaled levodopa powder that is a dopamine precursor commonly used for early morning or sudden
     "off" episodes. These episodes are seen when levodopa's effects wear off before the next dose is due. The
     inhalation route enables a low but quicker acting boost of dopamine. Inbrija is not intended to replace a client's
     maintenance medications but is given concurrently with levodopa/carbidopa. The drug comes in a capsule and must
     be administered through the appropriate inhaler device. Inhalation-specific contraindications include asthma,
     chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or other long-term underlying lung disease (DailyMed, Inbrija, 2023).

     Carbidopa/Levodopa
     Carbidopa is a dopamine decarboxylase inhibitor; combined with levodopa, levodopa's effects are enhanced. The
     drug inhibits decarboxylation of levodopa in the intestines and peripheral tissues. Therefore, less levodopa is
     converted into dopamine within the periphery, and more is available to cross the blood-brain barrier. This is
     beneficial, not only to increase the amount of dopamine that reaches the brain, but also to diminish the adverse
     effects dopamine causes when circulating in the periphery. Combining levodopa with carbidopa allows the dosage
     of levodopa to be reduced by 75%. Carbidopa has no pharmacological effects on its own and is unable to cross the
     blood-brain barrier. This drug combination stops the motor symptoms early in the disease process but has no effect
     on the disease itself.

     Therapeutic effects may not be seen for weeks or months. This drug should be taken on an empty stomach, typically
     30 minutes before a meal. Food can significantly decrease absorption, especially a large amount of protein.
     Carbidopa decreases nausea and vomiting and the cardiovascular response by reducing the amount of dopamine in
     the periphery (DailyMed, Sinemet, 2022). Levodopa comes in multiple forms and is administered via several routes,
     including oral (immediate-release, control-release, and extended-release) tablets, intestinal gel, and inhalation.

     DUOPA is the intestinal gel form of carbidopa/levidopa delivered through a surgically implanted tube in the small
     intestine. This drug is used for clients who have advanced disease and have difficulty swallowing. The overall goal of
     this delivery method is to increase "on" time episodes. The maximum recommended daily dose of DUOPA is 2000
     mg administered over 16 hours (Parkinson's Foundation, 2023b). Distinct contraindications for this route include
     complications from the insertion of the intestinal tube or incision site inflammation (DailyMed, DUOPA, 2022).

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms that usually disappear after a few months on levodopa/carbidopa. The
symptoms are usually caused by activation of dopamine receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone, which
contains receptors that detect emetic agents in the blood and relay that information to the vomiting center. This is
reduced with carbidopa. Carbidopa can be given as a single drug (Lodosyn). If added to levodopa/carbidopa, the
extra carbidopa can reduce levodopa-induced nausea and vomiting. It also allows smaller doses of levodopa to be
used while promoting a faster response.

Conversion of levodopa to dopamine in the periphery can produce excessive activation of beta-adrenergic receptors
in the heart. Dysrhythmias can result, especially in clients with heart disease. Clients with preexisting coronary
artery disease may take propranolol to counteract cardiac dysrhythmias.

"Wearing off" develops near the end of the dosing interval, indicating drug levels have declined to a subtherapeutic
value. This can be minimized in three ways: (1) shortening the dosing interval, (2) giving a drug that prolongs
levodopa's plasma half-life (MAO-B inhibitors or COMT inhibitors), or (3) giving a direct-acting dopamine agonist.
"On-off" episodes occur any time during the dosing interval, even if drug levels are high. These episodes may last
from minutes to hours. Over time, off periods usually increase in both intensity and frequency. One reason these
episodes occur in PD is because the gastrointestinal (GI) motility decreases, delaying absorption of levodopa and
altering serum levels.

About 80% of clients treated with levodopa will experience drug-induced dyskinesias during the advanced stages
of the disease, and 30% will develop it after only 3 years of levodopa treatment (Kwon et al., 2022). Some of these
are just bothersome (head bobbing tics, grimacing), whereas others can be disabling, such as ballismus--rapid,
involuntary jerking or flinging of proximal muscle groups--or choreoathetosis--slow, involuntary, writhing
movements. Levodopa exacerbates symptoms of psychosis, possibly through the buildup of central dopamine. Urine
and sweat can become brownish because of the melanin produced from catecholamine oxidation.

This drug can cause clients to become impulsive. Clients may either begin to engage in or increase already existing
gambling/sexual urges or uncontrolled spending. This is due to the increase of dopamine in the brain.

There have been reports of clients suddenly falling asleep without warning of feeling drowsy. Before these sleep
attacks, the clients were engaged in performing activities of daily living, driving a vehicle, or conversing. If these
occur, the drug should be discontinued. Importantly, the drug should not be stopped abruptly because it could lead
306  11 · Drugs to Treat Parkinson's Disease and Multiple Sclerosis

     to the reemergence of signs and symptoms of PD, sometimes worse than the initial manifestations. It could also
     lead to confusion, muscle rigidity, autonomic instability, and hyperpyrexia, which resembles neuroleptic malignant
     syndrome (NMS).

     Narrow-angle glaucoma is a contraindication as levodopa can worsen the condition due to the potential of further
     increase of intraocular pressure.

     Epidemiological studies have shown that clients with PD have a higher risk (two- to approximately six-fold) of
     developing melanoma than the general population. It is unknown whether this is due to PD itself or the drugs used
     in the treatment of PD. Clients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis
     when using carbidopa and levodopa for any indication. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by
     appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists).

     First-generation antipsychotics block receptors for dopamine in the striatum, diminishing the therapeutic effects of
     levodopa. This may augment Parkinsonian symptoms. Low doses of atypical antipsychotics are sometimes used to
     treat levodopa-induced psychotic symptoms. Nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) can result in a
     hypertensive crisis if administered to a client taking levodopa. Nonselective MAOIs should be withdrawn at least 2
     weeks before starting levodopa. Dopamine receptor antagonists, such as phenothiazines, risperidone, or
     metoclopramide, should be avoided because they will decrease the effects due to their dopamine receptor
     antagonistic properties.

     If levodopa is administered alone, pyridoxine (B6) will decrease its effects (greater than 200 mg daily) because it
     enhances decarboxylase and increases peripheral breakdown of levodopa. If given in combination with carbide, this
     is not a concern. Other antihypertensives can exacerbate orthostatic hypotension. Iron salts can form chelates with
     levodopa and reduce its bioavailability. Because amino acids compete with levodopa for intestinal absorption and
     for transport across the blood-brain barrier, high-protein foods will reduce levodopa's therapeutic effects.

   CLINICAL TIP

Combination Drug (Stalevo)

Stalevo is a combination of levodopa, carbidopa, and entacapone. This fixed-dose combination drug enhances
the amount of levodopa that reaches the brain. Both carbidopa and entacapone prevent the breakdown of
levodopa within the periphery, decreasing the dopamine effects in the periphery. In addition, this drug can
significantly reduce the "wearing off" time experienced by levodopa. The combination form increases adherence
because the client only needs to take one drug versus two different ones. For more information about this
combination drug, please refer to each individual agent discussed above (DailyMed, Stalevo, 2021).

     Nursing Implications
     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking dopaminergics:

         · Encourage slow position changes to minimize postural hypotension.
         · Assess neurological status, such as orientation, grip strength, gait, reflexes, tremors, or spasticity.
         · Inform client that hallucinations and other psychotic behavior can occur, and these will be treated

             appropriately.
         · Evaluate therapeutic effects--decrease in drooling, tremors, bradykinesia, or rigidity and increase in facial

             expressions.
         · Space activities evenly throughout the day for adequate rest periods.
         · Monitor serum liver enzymes, hemoglobin/hematocrit, bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), Coombs tests, and

             elevated serum glucose periodically throughout treatment.
         · Monitor for involuntary movements of the tongue, mouth, and face.
         · Provide demonstration on proper technique of using the inhalation form and have client return demonstrate.
         · Look for signs of increased depression or suicidal ideations.
         · Specifically ask the client about feeling drowsy or sleepy while performing certain activities.
         · Advise clients to exercise caution while driving, operating machinery, or working at heights.
         · Ask about new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, or uncontrolled spending.
         · Monitor for melanomas frequently by performing a thorough skin assessment.
         · Explain to client that the color of the urine may become brownish orange, but this is harmless.
         · Provide dietary counseling about high-protein foods and to evenly space their intake throughout the day.
         · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

             teaching guidelines.

       CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

       The client taking a dopaminergic should:

           · Have an understanding that they will not experience immediate improvement. Therapeutic responses will
               steadily increase over the first few months.

           · Take their medications even if not experiencing symptoms.
           · Sit or lie down if dizziness occurs and wait until it subsides before standing or walking.
           · Space activities to obtain optimal benefit from the drug.
           · Immediately notify the provider at the start of involuntary movements of the face or mouth.
           · Perform a skin assessment weekly for any evidence of changes in existing lesions or an onset of lesions.
           · Understand that their urine can be a brownish organ color, but this is not something to worry about.

       The client taking a dopaminergic should not:

           · Chew, break, or crush extended-release capsules.
           · Swallow the capsules that are indicated for the inhalation route.
           · Rise or change positions quickly due to possible orthostatic hypotension.
           · Stop drugs abruptly because symptoms will quickly reoccur.
           · Eat foods with high iron content, such as red meat.
           · Take multivitamin preparations containing pyridoxine and/or iron salts.
           · Eat a high-protein meal; they should evenly space their daily protein intake throughout the day.
           · Drive or engage in activities that require alertness if experiencing sleep attacks.

     Dopamine Agonists

     Dopamine agonists are first-line drugs in the treatment of mild to moderate PD. These drugs mimic the role of
     dopamine in the brain. Their duration is longer than compared with levodopa. They are relatively selective for D2
     receptors. Activating these receptors causes increased dopamine levels in the nigrostriatal pathway, which leads to
     smooth and coordinated movements. This classification is used as a monotherapy or in combination with levodopa.
     Initial therapy is associated with less risk of developing dyskinesias and motor fluctuations compared with clients

     Access for free at openstax.org
11.2 · Anti-Parkinsonian Drugs                                                                                            309

started on levodopa. Dopamine agonists may delay the need to use levodopa in early PD and may decrease the dose
of levodopa in advanced PD. When used on a long-term basis, they have a lower incidence of response failures. In
addition, they can be used as an adjunct medication to supplement levodopa when further dopaminergic effect is
needed or if complications of levodopa treatment arise, such as dyskinesias, "wearing off," and motor fluctuations.
These drugs will be ineffective in clients who do not improve with levodopa (American Parkinson Disease
Association, 2014).

Dopamine agonists are divided into ergot and nonergot derivatives. The ergot derivatives are nonselective and block
serotonergic and alpha-adrenergic receptors. Because of this, the ergots cause more cardiovascular concerns. The
nonergot derivatives are selective for dopamine receptor subtypes. The nonergot derivatives have similar
mechanisms of actions, adverse effects, and interactions. This information can be found below. Any distinct changes
are mentioned with the specific drug sections.

    · Pramipexole: A nonergot dopamine agonist that selectively binds to dopamine-2 receptor subtypes, which
        activates CNS postsynaptic dopamine receptors in the striatum. This drug is mainly used as a monotherapy in
        the early stages of PD. As the disease progresses, it is used in combination with levodopa (DailyMed,
       Pramipexole dihydrochloride, 2023).

    · Ropinirole: Essentially the same as pramipexole. This drug should be discontinued over a 7-day period to
        prevent adverse reactions such as confusion, rigidity, or hyperpyrexia.

    · Rotigotine: Similar to pramipexole, but one main difference is the route. Rotigotine is only available as a daily
        transdermal patch. This is beneficial for those who are unable to take oral formulations due to dysphagia. This
        route provides unfluctuating drug levels over 24 hours. The other difference is this drug can cause peripheral
       edema (cause unknown) or skin reactions at the site of application (DailyMed, Neupro, 2022).

    · Apomorphine hydrochloride: Another nonergot derivative, this is a short-acting drug delivered by
        subcutaneous injection or sublingually. This drug is reserved as an acute "rescue" medication to treat "off"
        episodes in between doses or "off-on" periods that occur randomly in clients with advanced PD. Both routes
        have a rapid onset of action. Their mechanism of action is the same as for pramipexole. The injection route is
        advantageous for those unable to adequately or safely swallow. A duration of at least 2 hours between doses
        is highly recommended, and 5 doses a day is the maximum. To prevent a medication error, the prescribed
        dose needs to be written in milliliters because the multi-dose pen has markings in milliliters. This is a highly
        emetogenic drug (induces vomiting); therefore, it is routinely given concurrently with an antiemetic such as
        trimethobenzamide 300 mg three times a day starting 3 days before the first dose and continued as needed to
       control nausea and vomiting. Use should generally not exceed 2 months (DailyMed, Apomorphine
       hydrochloride, 2022).

    · Bromocriptine: An ergot derivative. Because the ergot derivatives are nonselective, they block other receptors,
        such as serotonergic and adrenergic receptors. This causes a variety of adverse effects unseen with the
       nonergot derivatives (DailyMed, Bromocriptine mesylate, 2021).

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Nonergot derivatives are known to produce unusual effects, such as compulsive gambling, hypersexuality,
     overspending, and overeating. These behaviors are dose related and will reverse when the drug is discontinued.
     Providers should screen for compulsive and addictive behaviors before starting medication. Also, clients may not be
     aware of this behavior, so they should be specifically asked about it. Another unusual effect is these medications
     can make one quickly fall asleep while performing daily activities. Often the person will not feel drowsy before
     falling asleep. This creates an elevated risk of injury and/or accidents.

     Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating unrelated to heat or exercise) is caused by the dysregulation of the autonomic
     nervous system, which could be related to PD or the dopamine agonist. Hyperhidrosis can result in dehydration and
     electrolyte loss. Older adults and clients with a history of psychiatric disorders are more sensitive and at increased
     risk of experiencing confusion and hallucinations. Dyskinesias are seen more frequently in the aforementioned
     dopamine agonists when combined with levodopa. Clinical studies have revealed this drug class has teratogenic
     effects and should be avoided in pregnancy and breastfeeding (DailyMed, Pramipexole Dihydrochloride, 2023).

     Cardiovascular disease may occur due to severe hypotension and impaired perfusion. Orthostatic hypotension
     occurs due to a dopamine-mediated blunting of the noradrenergic response to standing and subsequent decrease in
     peripheral vascular resistance. Valvular heart disease occurs due to activation of serotonin receptors on the heart
     valves.

     Antipsychotics or dopamine antagonists will cancel the dopamine agonist effects. Higher doses of estrogens reduce
     clearance of the drug. Starting or stopping hormone replacement therapy may require adjustment of dosage.
     Because significant hypotension and loss of consciousness has occurred with these drugs when taken with
     serotonin receptor antagonists, this combination should be avoided.

     Although apomorphine is a morphine derivative, this drug does not cause analgesia, euphoria, or respiratory
     depression. The most common adverse reactions specific to this drug are excessive yawning, injection-site
     reactions, rhinorrhea, and cardiac issues. It is important to monitor cardiac status due to the associated risk for
     hypotension and dose-related prolongation of the QT interval. There have been reports of chest pain, myocardial
     infarction, dysrhythmias, and cardiac arrest. Furthermore, this drug has the potential to exacerbate coronary and
     cerebral ischemia in clients with known disease. Any client with an allergy to sulfites should not receive
     apomorphine (DailyMed, Apomorphine Hydrochloride, 2022).

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking dopamine agonists:

· Measure blood pressure and heart rate in the supine and standing positions before and after dosing.
· Emphasize to the client/caregiver to maintain safety precautions because falling asleep can suddenly occur

   without feeling drowsy.
· Monitor for peripheral edema and perfusion.
· Ask about compulsive and uncontrollable behaviors.
· Assess for any involuntary movements, especially with the upper and lower extremities.
· Teach client ways to cope with the excessive sweating they may experience.
· Provide clients education about high-fiber foods to reduce risk of constipation.
· Monitor routine electrocardiogram (ECG, EKG) for prolongation of QT interval when receiving apomorphine.
· Evaluate electrolytes periodically if individual has hyperhidrosis.
· Instruct client about the correct way to administer the subcutaneous apomorphine.
· Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

   teaching guidelines.
312  11 · Drugs to Treat Parkinson's Disease and Multiple Sclerosis

       CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

       The client taking a dopamine agonist should:

           · Sit or lie down if dizziness occurs and wait until it subsides before standing or walking.
           · Notify the provider immediately if there are any signs of rashes, hives, pruritis, or facial or tongue swelling.
           · Increase their intake of water if experiencing excessive sweating.
           · Eat a high-fiber diet and obtain adequate exercise to reduce/prevent constipation.
           · Contact the provider if experiencing involuntary movements, chest pain, and peripheral edema.
           · Understand that the medication may not reach full therapeutic effect for several weeks.
           · Be able to correctly demonstrate the use of the apomorphine pen delivery device and to use a new sterile

               needle with each injection.
           · Use a different site each time they administer apomorphine.

       The client taking a dopamine agonist should not:

           · Abruptly stop the medication because this can worsen PD symptoms.
           · Chew, break, or crush extended-release formulations.
           · Rise or change positions quickly due to possible orthostatic hypotension.
           · Take if pregnant or breastfeeding.
           · Administer apomorphine intravenously due to the risk of thrombus formation or pulmonary embolism.

     Monoamine Oxidase-B Inhibitors

     MAO-B inhibitors block or reduce the activity of the enzyme MAO type B that breaks down dopamine in the brain.
     They cause dopamine to accumulate in surviving nerve cells and reduce PD symptoms. Some evidence suggests
     selegiline may delay neurodegeneration and disease progression. Despite no existing conclusive evidence, current
     guidelines suggest trying it in newly diagnosed clients because it might confer some protection (Parkinson's
     Foundation, 2023c).

         · Selegiline hydrochloride: An irreversible MAO-B agent that is used with carbidopa/levodopa to enhance and
             prolong the response to levodopa. This may reduce the wearing-off times. Three days after starting selegiline,
             the health care provider can attempt to reduce the dose of levodopa to help decrease adverse effects related
             to levodopa. Selegiline hydrochloride causes insomnia because the drug metabolizes to methamphetamine
            and amphetamine, which have stimulating properties. This should improve over time (DailyMed, Selegiline
            Hydrochloride, 2023).

         · Safinamide: A reversible MAO-B inhibitor that inhibits voltage-sensitive sodium channels and glutamate
             release. It is the prototype of a new generation of multi-active MAO-B inhibitors. Salfinamide originally was
             developed as an antiseizure agent; however, in 2017 the drug was FDA approved for the treatment of PD. This
             drug is used in conjunction with levodopa/carbidopa for those experiencing "off" episodes and to increase
            motor function and decrease motor fluctuations (DailyMed, Xadago, 2023).

         · Rasagiline: The major difference between selegiline and rasagiline is that the latter drug does not convert to
            amphetamine and methamphetamine. Therefore, insomnia is not a concern (DailyMed, Rasagiline Mesylate,
             2022).

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Because selegiline hydrochloride causes insomnia, taking it late in the day could disrupt sleep. Severe hypertension
is a possibility if administered in high doses because the drug becomes nonselective and can then inhibit both MAO-
A and MAO-B. At doses less than or equal to 10 mg/day, the drug is selective for MAO-B. It does not affect MAO-A,
which metabolizes tyramine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and serotonin, unless given above the recommended
dose. This subtype can cause excessive stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), causing severe
hypertension and possibly stroke. This crisis can be triggered by taking sympathomimetic drugs and by ingesting
foods containing tyramine. High levels of tyramine are found in foods that are aged, cured, or fermented (DailyMed,
Selegiline Hydrochloride, 2023).

Several opioids should not be used concurrently with this drug classification. Combining MAO-B inhibitors with
morphine can increase the opioid adverse reactions. Sympathomimetics, including over-the-counter medications
containing dextromethorphan, should also be avoided due to increased risk of exaggerating psychotic symptoms.
Serotonin syndrome is a life-threatening condition characterized by delirium, extreme agitation, tachycardia, labile
blood pressure, rigidity, and hyperthermia. Several medications, including meperidine, tramadol, and selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), can increase the risk of serotonin syndrome and should be avoided. SSRIs
should be stopped 2-5 weeks before the initiation of selegiline. The tapering of the SSRIs is dependent on that
particular drug's half-life. Severe CNS toxicity characterized by hyperpyrexia, seizures, changes in behavioral status,
agitation, muscle rigidity, and death have been reported with combining tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and
nonselective MAOIs (DailyMed, Selegiline Hydrochloride, 2023).

     Nursing Implications
     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking MAO-B inhibitors:

     · Perform a skin assessment to monitor for melanomas.
     · Assess cardiac monitoring periodically for prolonged QT interval and episodes of angina.
     · Evaluate therapeutic effectiveness of PD clinical manifestations.
     · Assess mood for depression, impulsivity, and psychotic behavior.
     · Monitor liver function tests routinely for elevations in liver enzymes.
     · Periodically monitor clients for visual changes.
     · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

        teaching guidelines.

    · Contact the provider with any manifestations of liver damage, such as jaundice, dark urine, clay-colored
        stools, anorexia, or right upper quadrant pain.

    · Notify health care provider of any involuntary movements.
    · Routinely have an eye examination performed.

The client taking an MAO-B inhibitor should not:

    · Exceed the recommended daily dose of 10 mg.
    · Take SSRIs, TCAs, or opioids.
    · Chew, break, or crush extended-release capsules.
    · Stop drugs abruptly because symptoms will quickly reoccur.

Catecholomethyltransferase (COMT) Inhibitors

Normally, the methylation of levodopa by COMT to 3-O-methyldopa is a minor pathway for levodopa metabolism;
however, when peripheral dopamine decarboxylase is inhibited by carbidopa, the result is a significant increase of
3-O-methlydopa and the COMT pathway becomes more significant. This then competes with levodopa for entry into
the CNS. The COMT inhibitors selectively and reversibly inhibit COMT. The inhibition of COMT leads to reduction of
3-O-methlydopa plasma concentrations. The outcome is more levodopa crossing the blood-brain barrier and
increased levels of brain dopamine. These agents are beneficial in reducing the symptoms of the "wearing off"
phenomenon seen with levodopa. The two COMT inhibitors discussed in this section differ primarily in their adverse
drug reaction profiles. Entacapone is safer than tolcapone. These drugs have no direct effects on their own; they are
only indicated for use with levodopa.

    · Entacapone: A selective, reversible COMT inhibitor for the treatment of PD. When administered with levodopa
        and a decarboxylase inhibitor (e.g., carbidopa), increased and more sustained plasma levodopa
        concentrations are reached as compared with the administration of levodopa and carbidopa given alone. It is
        believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa
        result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to a greater reduction in the
       manifestations of Parkinsonian syndrome PD (DailyMed, Entacapone, 2022).

    · Tolcapone: Tolcapone should be reserved for clients who cannot be treated adequately with safer drugs. This
        drug can cause severe, sometimes fatal, hepatocellular injury. Before treatment, clients must be fully
        informed of the risks and then sign an acknowledgment consent form confirming their understanding. Liver
        monitoring is a requirement at baseline and periodically throughout therapy. If there is any evidence of liver
        damage, tolcapone should be discontinued and not be used again. The enzymes generally decline within
       several weeks once the drug is stopped (DailyMed, Tasmar, 2020).

Table 11.9 lists common COMT inhibitors and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

Drug        Routes and Dosage Ranges

Entacapone  Initial dose: 200 mg taken with the levodopa/carbidopa dose; can increase to a maximum of 8
 (Comtan)   doses (1600 mg daily).

Tolcapone   Initial dose: 100 mg 3 times daily; increase to 200 mg 3 times daily if necessary. The first dose
 (Tasmar)   should be administered in the morning along with levodopa/carbidopa. The next 2 doses are
            taken 6 and 12 hours later.

TABLE 11.9 Drug Emphasis Table: COMT Inhibitors (source: https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/)

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Most of the adverse effects of these drugs result from the increased dopamine levels. These can be managed by
decreasing the levodopa dose. GI and urinary adverse reactions are the most common manifestations of the COMT
inhibitors themselves. Notably, only 10% of the dose is excreted in the urine; the remaining 90% is through biliary
excretion. If there is biliary obstruction, these drugs may not get eliminated adequately and will accumulate.

There are reports of clients suddenly falling asleep without warning of feeling drowsy. If this occurs, the COMT
inhibitors should be discontinued because these sleep attacks can recur.
316  11 · Drugs to Treat Parkinson's Disease and Multiple Sclerosis

     Because these drugs increase dopamine (pleasure neurotransmitter) in the brain, they can cause intense urges to
     gamble, engage in sex, or spend money uncontrollably. In these cases, it may be necessary to reduce the dose or
     stop it altogether. Diarrhea can be experienced and is thought to be caused by drug-induced microscopic colitis.
     Diarrhea can lead to associated weight loss, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalance. If this occurs, the drug should
     be discontinued.

     Dyskinesia occurs because entacapone potentiates the dopaminergic side effect of levodopa and may either cause
     or worsen preexisting dyskinesia.

     Entacapone can increase levels of methyldopa, dobutamine, and isoproterenol because they are metabolized by the
     COMT enzyme. The accumulation of these drugs results in tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and possible
     arrhythmias. Nonselective MAOIs should not be used concurrently. COMT and MAO are two major enzyme systems
     involved in metabolizing catecholamines. Combining a COMT inhibitor with a nonselective MAOI could lead to the
     inhibition of most of the pathways responsible for normal catecholamine metabolism. This leads to accumulation of
     catecholamines and sympathomimetic responses. Entacapone is a chelator of iron (DailyMed, Entacapone, 2022).

     This class is contraindicated in clients with a history of psychotic disorder who are at risk of experiencing
     exacerbation of symptoms. Also, certain medications used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of PD
     and decrease the effectiveness of the COMT inhibitor. This drug classification should not be stopped abruptly
     because it could lead to the reemergence of signs and symptoms of PD, which are sometimes worse than the initial
     manifestations. It could also lead to confusion, muscle rigidity, hyperpyrexia, and autonomic instability that
     resembles NMS.

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking COMT inhibitors:

· Monitor liver enzymes at baseline and throughout therapy as recommended.
· Monitor blood pressure with position changes due to the risk of orthostatic hypotension.
· Encourage and educate the client to be compliant with the required lab testing to identify liver disease early.
· Routinely assess level of consciousness and orientation.
· Educate the client to monitor temperature periodically due to the risk of NMS.
· Specifically ask the client about feeling drowsy or sleepy while performing certain activities.
· Advise clients to exercise caution while driving, operating machinery, or working at heights.
· Ask about new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, or uncontrolled spending.
· Monitor for melanomas frequently by performing a thorough skin assessment.
· Inform client that hallucinations and other psychotic behavior can occur.
· Explain to client that the color of the urine may become brownish orange, but this is harmless.
· Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

   teaching guidelines.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking a COMT inhibitor should:
318  11 · Drugs to Treat Parkinson's Disease and Multiple Sclerosis

         · Immediately notify the provider of the occurrence of right upper quadrant pain, persistent nausea,
             anorexia, clay-colored stools, dark urine, jaundice, fatigue, and/or lethargy.

         · Notify the health care provider if they have experienced episodes of falling asleep during activities.
         · Drink adequate fluids to maintain hydration if diarrhea occurs.
         · Perform a routine skin assessment.

     The client taking a COMT inhibitor should not:

         · Rise or change positions quickly due to possible orthostatic hypotension.
         · Stop drugs abruptly because symptoms will quickly reoccur.
         · Take any sedating medications.

       FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

       Tolcapone

       Clients who take tolcapone risk potentially fatal acute fulminant liver failure.

     Dopamine Antagonists

     Dopamine antagonists can help reduce symptoms of PD and levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Unfortunately, after
     several months, the effects of the drug wear off. This classification of drugs can be used as a monotherapy in the
     early stages of the disease and/or combined with levodopa/carbidopa during later stages to control dyskinesia.

     Amantadine
     Amantadine (Gocovri) is a second-line therapy because it is not as effective as other anti-Parkinsonian drugs.
     Although multiple drugs fit this classification, amantadine is the most used in PD. This drug falls into two drug
     classifications: antiviral and anti-Parkinsonian agent. Onset of action usually occurs within 48 hours, and it has a
     half-life of 10-25 hours. Because the medication is excreted unchanged in the kidneys, it may accumulate within
     the plasma of older adults and those with renal insufficiency. The dose should be reduced in those with renal
     impairment and in clients who are 65 years of age or older. This is one reason it is a second-line therapy, because
     older adults are more likely to have PD (DailyMed, Amantadine, 2023).

          SAFETY ALERT

      Similarly Named Drugs

       Do not confuse amantadine (dopamine antagonist) with amiodarone (antiarrhythmic).

       (Source: ISMP, 2023)

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Suicidal attempts, some of which have been fatal, have been reported. The practitioner must sufficiently assess
     suicide risk factors and suicidal ideations before medication is prescribed. Other psychiatric manifestations caused
     by this drug include delirium, hypertonia, delusions, hallucinations, anxiety, euphoria, paranoia, manic reaction, and
     tremors. This drug can cause clients to engage in compulsive behavior and to lack impulse control. In some clients,
     reduction of dose or discontinuing the drug can stop these urges. Other clients may need additional help with
     psychotherapy. CNS stimulants can exacerbate the mental and psychiatric manifestations.

     Amantadine can cause elevated levels of creatinine phosphate kinase (CPK), serum myoglobin, BUN, serum
     creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and liver enzymes. Clients who take amantadine for
     more than 1 month often develop livedo reticularis, which is characterized by purple mottling of the skin. This
     condition is benign and gradually subsides after the drug is discontinued (DailyMed, Amantadine, 2023).

     Abrupt discontinuation may precipitate agitation, slurred speech, depression, stupor, delirium, delusions, and
     hallucinations. In addition, several cases of NMS have occurred upon discontinuing the medication. This is a life-

threatening condition and immediate treatment is necessary. Clinical manifestations of this includes high fever,
muscle rigidity, involuntary movements, altered consciousness, tachycardia, tachypnea, and changes in blood
pressure.

The drug can exacerbate symptoms in clients with heart failure. The seizure threshold is lowered by this drug;
therefore, those with seizure disorders are more apt to have frequent seizures if their medications are not adjusted.

Angle-closure glaucoma is a contraindication due to the mydriasis and further narrowing of the angle between the
cornea and iris. This can worsen the glaucoma.

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking dopamine antagonists:

· Ask about suicidal ideations, plan, and accessibility of their plan.
· Measure temperature for increases because client is at risk for infection due to reduction in white blood cell

   count, or it can indicate NMS.
· Monitor for an increase in respirations and heart rate as these are related to NMS.
· Assess for decreases in blood pressure upon position changes.
· Obtain a periodic ECG to monitor the QT interval.
· Assess for any seizure activity because the drug can decrease the seizure threshold.
320  11 · Drugs to Treat Parkinson's Disease and Multiple Sclerosis

      · Perform a skin examination to monitor for melanomas.
      · Specifically ask client about new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, and uncontrolled spending.
      · Monitor intake and output for a positive net result due to risk of urinary retention.
      · Assess for peripheral edema, shortness of breath, and increased blood pressure.
      · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

          teaching guidelines.

     CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

     The client taking a dopamine antagonist should:

         · Immediately notify a support person or health care provider if having thoughts of harming self.
               Caregivers should be aware of indications that client is suicidal, such as giving treasured items away,
                   social isolation, or increased happiness (because they have made the decision to carry out their plan).

         · Move and change positions slowly due to orthostatic hypotension.
         · Sit or lie down if dizziness occurs and wait until it subsides before standing or walking.
         · Ensure lighting is dimmed to prevent light sensitivity secondary to mydriasis.
         · Maintain observation of any skin lesions to assess for changes.
         · Contact the health care provider immediately if having signs of an allergic reaction, such as urticarial rash,

             angioedema, pharyngeal/tongue edema, and difficulty breathing.
         · Gradually increase physical activity as symptoms of PD improve.
         · Notify health care provider if they notice signs of mental status or mood changes, edema of extremities,

             shortness of breath, or difficulty urinating.
         · Be observant for any impulsive spending or compulsive behavior.

     The client taking a dopamine antagonist should not:

         · Stop taking the drug abruptly to prevent Parkinsonism crisis or psychiatric manifestations.
         · Overexert themselves; they should take rest periods between activities.
         · Engage in driving or other tasks that require clear vision.
         · Eat or drink items that can cause the urine to become acidic, such as citrus juices and fruits (lemons,

             grapes, grapefruits, pineapples, oranges, and blueberries).

             CASE STUDY

     Read the following clinical scenario to answer the questions that follow.

     Marcus Bell is a 68-year-old client who arrives at the provider's office reporting a tremor in his right hand that has
     developed gradually over several months. He notices the tremors disappear when he is concentrating on it; however,
     they return quickly when he gets distracted. His wife states he has had a difficult time writing. He struggles holding
     the pen, and his writing is very small and sloppy. The client's wife also voiced her concerns that he never smiles
     anymore and he cannot keep up with her when walking. Based on the history and physical examination, the provider
     diagnoses Marcus with the early stages of PD. The provider prescribes carbidopa/levodopa (Sinemet) 25 mg/100
     mg three times daily.

     11.3 Introduction to Multiple Sclerosis

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 11.3.1 Describe the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis.
         · 11.3.2 Identify the clinical manifestations related to multiple sclerosis.
         · 11.3.3 Identify the etiology and diagnostic studies related to multiple sclerosis.

     Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating, inflammatory, immune-mediated condition. According to the National
     Multiple Sclerosis Society (2023), studies have confirmed that nearly 1 million people are living with MS in the
     United States. This disease is characterized by a progressive and irreversible demyelination and axonal
     degeneration of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. Myelin is a protective sheath that acts as an insulator of the
     electrical signal (see Figure 11.4). It allows rapid conduction of a nerve impulse down the axon. Degeneration of the
     myelin sheath results in the inability of nerves to conduct electrical impulses. As the myelin deteriorates,
     oligodendrocytes repair the damage but also form scar tissue called gliotic plaques. These plaques will begin to
     interfere with electrical impulses traveling through the axon. Over time, the myelin cannot regenerate and nerves
     eventually wither away. Typically, the client experiences remissions and exacerbations throughout the progression.
     Sensory and motor deficits become worse as the client ages. The disease is progressive and affects nerves in both
     the CNS and peripheral nervous system (PNS) (Capriotti, 2020).

     and affects muscle contraction. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

       SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
       Age, Sex, Race/Ethnicity, and Location

           · MS often presents in adults between the ages of 20 and 40 years.
           · It more commonly affects females.
           · It is seen more frequently in White clients than in Hispanic or Black clients.
           · MS more commonly affects individuals who live farther away from the equator.
       (Source: Multiple Sclerosis Foundation, 2018)

     Etiology

     MS is an autoimmune disorder that occurs when there is a malfunction of the immune system and the body
     mistakenly attacks its own tissue. In this case, it attacks the myelin sheath of the CNS. The exact cause of MS has
     not yet been fully determined; however, it is believed a combination of factors are involved. Risk factors include viral
     infections that theoretically mimic the components of the myelin sheath. The virus most associated with MS is the
     Epstein-Barr virus, which causes infectious mononucleosis. Other potential risk factors include geographic location,
     exposure to heavy metals, cigarette smoking (contributes to inflammation), lack of sunlight exposure, and deficient

vitamin D levels. It is believed that vitamin D can lower the risk of developing autoimmune disorders because it
plays a role in immune function and regulation. Moreover, obesity is a risk factor because it contributes to long-term
inflammation. Likewise, family history is shown to contribute to a person's risk of developing MS. Current research
suggests there are numerous genetic variants, most of them correlating with the immune system. Some researchers
believe the immune system attacks the CNS because it is simply destroying unhealthy brain cells (National Institute
of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2023a).

Pathophysiology

Autoreactive lymphocytes mediate the destruction in MS. T-lymphocytes are sensitized and reactive to protein on
the myelin sheath. These overactive immune cells cause inflammation, which begins to damage the myelin. The
damage occurs in diffuse patches throughout the CNS. The damage mainly affects the white matter and results in
lesions, which are called plaques because they are easily visible on imaging studies. Over time, hardened scar
tissue develops at the lesion site, which disrupts the transmission of nerve signals. The scar tissue can slow or even
stop nerve impulses altogether. Overall, signals are unable to communicate with the brain to receive information
about what the body should do in situations. Other immune involvement includes B lymphocytes, macrophages,
and immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM) as well as T-helper and T-regulator cells. The immune cells are believed to
release various cytokines, such as interleukins. The blood-brain barrier becomes disrupted and oligodendrocytes,
along with axons, are destroyed. The oligodendrocytes that have not been affected are incapable of adequately
proliferating; therefore, they are ineffective in repairing the myelin. As the disease progresses, the cerebral cortex
of the brain atrophies and scar tissue begins to develop (Capriotti, 2020).

  of MS and how Brockelsby learned to cope with this illness.

Diagnostics

Diagnosis is sometimes delayed because there is no definitive test for MS, and many early clinical manifestations
are subtle and correlate with other diagnoses. The first steps toward a diagnosis are a thorough medical history and
full neurological examination. An MRI test with contrast is the most sensitive method available to identify areas of
demyelination. The response of the CNS to peripheral sensory stimuli can be determined using evoked potential
testing--tests that measure electrical activity in response to certain stimuli--for various pathways (visual, auditory,
and sensory). Another diagnostic tool is the evaluation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from a lumbar
puncture. Clients with MS have high protein levels, oligoclonal bands (OCBs), IgG/IgM, and T and B lymphocytes in
their CSF. Blood tests may be obtained to rule out other conditions that mimic MS or to check for risk factors, such
as a vitamin D level (Capriotti, 2020).

Clinical Manifestations

The course of MS is unpredictable. Signs and symptoms vary depending on severity and the specific nerves affected
by the plaque. Some clients will have very little disability, whereas others experience a steady decline with
increasing disability. Fever, sun exposure, and stress can trigger exacerbations. Characteristic manifestations
include:

    · Sensory deficits in extremities and face (numbness and tingling sensation, itching, coldness, paralysis)
          Some clients experience Lhermitte sign, an electrical shock-like sensation that runs down the back and
              into the limbs. This mainly occurs when the client bends their head forward.

    · Visual changes (diplopia, nystagmus, unilateral vision loss, abnormal gaze, and pain with eye movement)
          The most common and earliest symptoms are associated with the eyes.
324  11 · Drugs to Treat Parkinson's Disease and Multiple Sclerosis

         · Motor spasticity, weakness, ataxia, and hyperactive reflexes
         · Elimination issues (urgency, incontinence, urinary retention, constipation)
         · Cognitive and mental changes (fatigue, reduced attention span, poor judgment, loss of recent memory,

             difficulty with abstract reasoning and solving problems--depression and anxiety are very common)
         · Sexual dysfunction (decreased libido, erectile disorder, reduced genital sensation)
         · Brainstem problems (dysarthria, dysphagia, weak cough)
         · Pain (neuropathic pain in extremities, painful muscle spasms)

     The most common form of MS is the relapsing-remitting form, which consists of brief episodes of several weeks to 3
     months. These episodes are followed by a complete or almost complete return to baseline. The primary-progressive
     form does not have any remissions or exacerbations. The onset of this form is around age 40. Those with relapsing-
     remitting form may go on to develop secondary-progressive deterioration that leads to disabilities (Capriotti, 2020;
     National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2023a). Refer to Table 11.13 for descriptions of the various
     forms of MS.

     Pharmacologic Management

     There is currently no cure for MS; however, the use of drugs has made a significant difference in the lives of those
     with MS. Most of the drugs target specific symptoms, reduce relapse rates, and delay progression. In the most
     common form (relapsing-remitting), early initiation of medications is highly recommended. Several drug
     classifications are used that work through different mechanisms: corticosteroids can reduce inflammation and
     speed recovery during acute exacerbations; beta interferons can slow damage; and disease-modifying agents and
     immunomodulators suppress the immune system to prevent the antibodies from attacking their own cells.
     Additionally, various components of the immune system are specifically targeted by medications. Some drugs
     reduce the number of T cells circulating in the periphery; others destroy target B cells or deplete B and T cells; still
     others prevent leukocyte mobilization to injured tissue. Drugs, such as antispasmodics, antidepressants, and
     antiepileptics, are prescribed to control symptoms.

     Nonpharmacologic Management

     Plasmapheresis (removal of abnormal antibodies) can be done for those who do not respond well to drugs.
     Significant nonpharmacologic management should involve teaching the client coping mechanisms, ensuring support
     systems are in place, and emphasizing proper nutrition and sufficient rest; the client should be encouraged to
     incorporate exercise into their daily routine. These actions can promote overall health, which can help the client
     better deal with symptoms of relapse as well as maintain their quality of life. Finally, physical therapy and
     occupational therapy can help to maximize functioning in various ways (National Institute of Neurological Disorders
     and Stroke, 2023a).

   TRENDING TODAY

Advances in Multiple Sclerosis Treatment

According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (2023a), researchers continue to study
the mechanism of MS to identify ways to prevent or stop the continuous decline in function seen in clients with
this progressive disease. Ublituximab (Briumvi) (https://openstax.org/r/tgtherapeutics) recently became the third
anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody approved by the FDA as a treatment for relapsing forms of MS (Cunha, 2023).
This drug is administered over 1 hour and given twice a year.

CLINICAL TIP

Treating an Acute Relapse

A short course of a high-dose intravenous (IV) glucocorticoid (e.g., 500-1000 mg of methylprednisolone daily for
3-5 days) is the preferred treatment for an acute episode. These drugs suppress inflammation and can reduce
the severity and duration of an attack. When used short-term, these drugs are safe except for a possible elevation
of blood glucose levels. In contrast, long-term use (e.g., over 3 weeks) can cause multiple adverse effects in
numerous areas of the body, including adrenal insufficiency leading to fluid and electrolyte imbalances,
osteoporosis, high risk for infections, myopathy, and psychological disturbances (agitation, anxiety, or irritability).

Acute relapse may also be treated with IV gamma globulin. This option is especially beneficial for clients who are
unable to tolerant or respond adequately to glucocorticoids.

Interferons

Interferons are proteins that are released in response to pathogens. Synthetic interferons have been made to
resemble naturally occurring ones. These agents are important for treating viral infections, neoplasms, and
autoimmune diseases such as MS. They have antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory actions and should
be used early in the disease because they have been shown to modify disease progression and reduce relapse rates.
Interferon drugs are available as interferon beta-1a (given intramuscularly) and interferon beta-1b (given
subcutaneously). This classification reduces the severity of symptoms and decreases the number of lesions
detected with MRI. There are different mechanisms of action for interferons, including inhibition of the growth of
some cells, changes in cell surface antigen expression, and induction to lymphocytic cytotoxicity.

Table 11.14 lists common interferons and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

Drug          Routes and Dosage Ranges

Interferon  30 mcg intramuscularly weekly or 7.5 mcg intramuscularly weekly, then increase dose by 7.5 mcg
 beta-1a    each week until 30 mcg once weekly is reached.
(Avonex)

   Interferon 0.0625 mg subcutaneously every other day; gradually increase dose by 0.0625 mg every 2 weeks
    beta-1b to a maximum dose of 0.25 mg every other day.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Avonex is produced by recombinant DNA technology using genetically engineered Chinese hamster ovary cells into
     which the human interferon beta gene has been introduced. Betaseron is manufactured by bacterial fermentation of
     a strain of Escherichia coli that possesses the gene for human interferon beta. In addition, the medication contains
     mannitol and albumin. Anyone with a hypersensitivity to any of these three components could develop angioedema
     or anaphylaxis (DailyMed, Betaseron, 2023).

     Flu-like symptoms on treatment days are common when first started. Symptoms experienced are fever, chills,
     myalgia, malaise, and sweating. These usually diminish over time. The symptoms can be minimized by starting with
     a low dose and then slowly titrating up to the full dose or by giving an analgesic/antipyretic medication before taking
     the interferon. Neutralizing antibodies can form against synthetic agents. This will decrease the drug's effectiveness
     but also increase the risk of anaphylaxis.

     Drug-induced lupus erythematous has been reported. Clinical manifestations include rash, polyarthritis, nephritis,
     and serositis. If this occurs, the drug should be stopped. Interferon beta can injure the liver by causing an
     asymptomatic increase in circulating liver enzymes. Liver function tests must be monitored routinely. If liver injury is
     evident, the dose can be decreased or a temporary interruption of treatment could be tried. When the liver function
     returns to baseline, treatment can resume with continued careful monitoring (DailyMed, Betaseron, 2023).

     Transient injection site reactions include redness, pain, swelling, itching, or a lump. Injection site necrosis can occur
     with this drug, and some lesions have extended to the fascia overlying the muscle. Some have developed injection
     site abscesses and cellulitis, but this is usually the result of poor technique.

     With interferon alpha, clients can develop subclinical hypothyroidism. It first causes inflammation of the thyroid
     (thyroiditis) that causes a short period of hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism. Symptoms of heart failure
     can be exacerbated. Although these drugs have no direct-acting cardiac toxicity properties, they can trigger
     symptoms to arise.

     Other immunosuppressive agents may increase the toxic effects of both immunosuppressives and elevate the risk of
     serious infection. Infections are related to the immunosuppressant effects. Many of these are opportunistic and are
     produced by microbes that do not normally cause infections unless the host is immunocompromised. Live vaccines
     should be avoided due to increased risk of vaccine-related infections. If needed, clients should receive them at least
     4-6 weeks before starting therapy, especially the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccine if one did not have chickenpox.
     Overall, the immunosuppression decreases the body's response to vaccines and renders them useless (DailyMed,
     Betaseron, 2023).

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking interferons:

· Closely examine the injection sites for redness, swelling, and/or tenderness.
· Explain to the client the importance of avoiding contact with infected or sick people.
· Monitor the following lab studies before starting the medication and periodically throughout therapy:

   complete blood cell count (CBC) with differential, thyroid function, and liver function tests.
· Assess for any signs of infection or excessive bleeding or easy bruising.
· Emphasize to the client to avoid injuries and apply direct pressure to the affected area for several minutes.
· Teach the client signs and symptoms of hypo- and hyperthyroidism.
· Medicate with analgesics-antipyretics on injection days to decrease flu-like symptoms.
· Evaluate for any indication of depression or suicidal ideations.
· Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

   teaching guidelines.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking an interferon should:

    · Report any signs of infection, such as a fever or sore throat.
    · Avoid injuries. If one occurs, direct pressure should be applied to the affected area to control bleeding.
328  11 · Drugs to Treat Parkinson's Disease and Multiple Sclerosis

           · Promote a balance of rest and exercise.
           · Have the ability to correctly reconstitute and prepare the medication using aseptic technique.
           · Rotate injection sites with each injection. The same site should not be used two consecutive times.
           · Use proper technique in administering a subcutaneous injection.
           · Notify the provider of feelings of depression or suicidal thoughts.
           · Notify the provider of right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, dark urine, anorexia, fatigue, and clay-colored

               stools.
           · Take an analgesic-antipyretic on the days of treatment to minimize the flu-like symptoms.
           · Immediately contact the provider with the first signs of a rash.
           · Contact the provider if any signs of thyroid dysfunction, such as temperature intolerances, change in

               weight, or level of energy, occur.

       The client taking an interferon should not:

           · Overexert themselves; they should take rest periods between activities.
           · Spend time with individuals who are actively sick or spend time in crowds.
           · Receive live vaccines while on therapy or within 3 months of stopping therapy.
           · Inject in a site that is red, bruised, infected, scabbed, broken, or has lumps.

     Immunomodulators

     Immunomodulators work by blocking the activity of specific cytokines, which promote autoimmune reactions and
     inflammation in MS. Immunomodulators are used for treating relapsing forms of MS (RRMS and active SPMS) and
     reducing the frequency of relapses and slowing down the accumulation of disabilities. Common immunomodulators
     include:

         · Teriflunomide: An active metabolite of leflunomide, which is a drug that was previously approved to treat
             rheumatic arthritis. It inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. The overall result is a reduction of the number
             of activated lymphocytes in the CNS. This can reduce or prevent the number of relapses a client experiences
            (DailyMed, Teriflunomide, 2023).

         · Monomethyl fumarate: This drug inhibits immune processes that damage the brain and spinal cord; it also has
             antioxidant properties. Monomethyl fumarate comes in a delayed-release capsule. Certain lab tests must be
             obtained before initiating this drug, including CBC with differential, liver enzymes, and total bilirubin levels. A
             CBC with differential also needs to be obtained 6 months after the start of the medication and then every
             6-12 months thereafter. Adverse reactions associated with this drug include flushing, anaphylaxis,
             angioedema, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), herpes zoster, lymphopenia, and
             hepatotoxicity. A non-enteric coated aspirin (325 mg or less) may be taken 30 minutes before taking the drug
             to reduce the incidence or severity of flushing. For the remaining adverse reactions, the drug is held and
            appropriate treatment given (DailyMed, Bafiertam, 2023).

         · Glatiramer acetate: This drug is thought to curb the body's attack of the myelin covering by acting as a decoy
             to T-cell attack. Also, it induces and activates suppressor T cells in the periphery, which modifies the immune
             process. This drug does not cause many of the bone suppression reactions or flu-like symptoms similar to the
             other immunomodulators. It can cause postinjection reactions including flushing, urticaria, chest tightness,
             palpitations, or dyspnea. These should last only a few minutes and subside spontaneously. If symptoms last
            longer or are more intense, the client must notify the provider immediately (DailyMed, Glatiramer Acetate,
             2023).

     The medication must be stored in the refrigerator. Before administration, allow the medication to stand at room
     temperature for 20 minutes. Syringes are single-use only--any unused portion must be discarded. Injection is
     subcutaneously in the arms, abdomen, hips, or thighs. Injection sites should be rotated to prevent lipoatrophy
     (localized loss of fat tissue). Clients who have hypersensitivity to mannitol should avoid this drug because mannitol
     is part of the drug mixture.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Teriflunomide is very hepatoxic throughout therapy. If the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) amount is three times the
upper normal limit on two consecutive tests, the drug must be immediately stopped, and an accelerated elimination
procedure will begin. This procedure includes the administration of cholestyramine or activated charcoal for 11
days. In addition, this drug is highly teratogenic, and a negative pregnancy test must be obtained before therapy.
The client should avoid pregnancy and speak with their provider if they are planning on becoming pregnant.
Teriflunomide is eliminated very slowly and can take months to be fully leave the body.

Clients should be screened for latent tuberculosis (TB) before beginning therapy with immunomodulators because
they have been found to activate latent TB, causing an active TB infection to develop. If found to be positive, the
client must be treated for the active TB before initiating immunomodulators.

This group of drugs can cause peripheral neuropathy--either mononeuropathy or polyneuropathy. Risk factors
include being older than 60 years of age, concurrent neurotoxic medications, and diabetes. Drug reaction with
eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome has been associated with the use of this drug and is
characterized by multiorgan hypersensitivity. DRESS can include symptoms like fever, rash, enlarged lymph nodes,
facial swelling, hepatitis, nephritis, myocarditis, or myositis. Blood pressure should be checked before therapy and
periodically throughout. An elevated blood pressure should be properly managed.

Concurrent use of drugs that have immunosuppressive and/or bone marrow suppressive properties should be
avoided because it can increase the risk of infections. Teriflunomide can decrease the peak international normalized
ratio (INR) by 25% in clients taking warfarin. Close monitoring of the INR is warranted to evaluate for warfarin dose
adjustments to maintain therapeutic levels. This drug can also reduce the effectiveness of some oral contraceptives;
therefore, a second barrier backup plan should be in place. In addition, the HMG-Co-A reductase inhibitors are
prevented from being metabolized and can build up in the body. Live vaccines should be avoided because they can
increase the risk of infection. These vaccines should be held until 6 months after immunomodulators have been
discontinued.

     Nursing Implications
     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking immunomodulators:

     · Monitor the following lab values at baseline and routinely during therapy: ALT, aspartate aminotransferase
        (AST), serum bilirubin levels, CBC with differential.

     · Observe for any signs and symptoms of infection and teach the client ways to prevent infection.
     · Teach clients of reproductive age that they should use an effective contraceptive barrier.
     · Monitor temperature and blood pressure during therapy.
     · Perform a tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) to rule out latent TB before drug

        therapy is initiated.
     · Obtain a pregnancy test before the start of treatment.
     · Observe for any skin rashes/reactions.
     · Monitor for any signs of bleeding, such as multiple bruises, hematuria, blood in the stool, or epistaxis.
     · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

        teaching guidelines.

     CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

     The client taking an immunomodulator should:

         · Notify the health care provider if manifestations of liver injury occur, such as dark urine, clay-colored
             stools, right upper quadrant pain, or jaundice.

         · Contact provider immediately with any evidence of infection, such as fever or sore throat.
         · Notify the provider if they want to get pregnant because this drug can be harmful to the fetus.

  Clients who take teriflunomide risk severe to fatal acute liver injury and embryofetal toxicity.

Monoclonal Antibodies

Monoclonal antibodies are derived from a single B-cell source. Cloning of individual B lymphocytes results in the
production of biologically identical antibody molecules. These drugs must be administered intravenously because
they are proteins and would get destroyed in the GI system if taken orally. A mouse or hamster is injected with the
human antigen for the rodent to produce the desired antibody. Once the antigen is administered, the rodent's
immune system mounts a response. Its B lymphocytes are stimulated to produce a specific antibody against that
particular antigen. The B lymphocytes are extracted from the animal's spleen. The antibodies can then be isolated
and prepared for clinical use. Because these antibodies originate from one single cell line, it is possible to design
them to suppress specific components of the immune system responsible for causing tissue damage in certain
conditions. The generic names of the monoclonal antibodies end in "-mab."

    · Alemtuzumab: This agent is generally reserved for people who have had inadequate responses to two or more
        MS therapies. Due to its safety profile, this drug is only available through a restricted distribution program.
        Prescribers must be certified with the program by completing training. Clients must enroll and comply with
        ongoing monitoring requirements, and pharmacies must be authorized to dispense to certified facilities
       (DailyMed, Lemtrada, 2023).

    · Ocrelizumab: This agent is indicated as a monotherapy for treating relapsing forms of MS including CIS, RRMS,
        and SSMS. In contrast to alemtuzumab and natalizumab, this medication is also used in the treatment of
        PPMS. This drug is administered via IV infusion and targets circulating CD20 markers on B lymphocytes, which
        produce antibodies. Clients must be premedicated with steroids and an antihistamine before each infusion to
        reduce infusion-related reactions. They also must be monitored during and for at least 1 hour after infusion;
        however, clients must be aware that reactions can occur up to 24 hours after the dose was received
       (DailyMed, Ocrevus, 2023).

    · Natalizumab: This drug is indicated as a monotherapy for treating relapsing forms of MS including CIS, RRMS,
        and SSMS. This drug prevents cells of the immune system from entering the brain and spinal cord. It is very
        effective but is mainly used in clients who have failed first-line therapies. Only prescribers registered in the MS
        TOUCH Prescribing Program may prescribe this drug. Clients must read the medication guide and sign the
        enrollment form. The mechanism of action for natalizumab is different and complex compared with
        alemtuzumab. Overall, this drug demonstrates reduction of leukocyte migration into the brain and reduction of
        plaque formation. This results in an increase of the number of circulating leukocytes. The drug does not affect
       the absolute neutrophil count (DailyMed, Tysabri, 2023).

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Alemtuzumab must be administered in a certified health care setting with appropriate equipment to manage
     anaphylaxis or other serious infusion reactions, such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ischemic/
     hemorrhagic stroke, and cervicocephalic arterial dissection. These can occur following any of the doses being given.
     To reduce infusion-related adverse effects, clients should be premedicated with high-dose corticosteroids for the
     first 3 days of each treatment course. They can also receive antihistamines and/or antipyretics before the dose.
     Additionally, antiviral agents should be administered for herpetic prophylaxis starting on the first day of dosing and
     continue for a minimum of 2 months after completion of alemtuzumab dosing or until the CD4+ lymphocyte count is
     less than 200 cells/microliter.

     Some autoimmune disorders caused by alemtuzumab include immune thrombocytopenia (spontaneous bleeding,
     petechiae, heavy menstrual bleeding, hemoptysis), glomerular nephropathies (edema, decreased urine output,
     hematuria), autoimmune hemolytic anemia (chest pain, jaundice, dark urine, tachycardia), and thyroiditis.

     Clients of childbearing age should consistently use effective contraception during therapy and for 4 months after a
     course of treatment. This drug can cause fetal harm.

     A few infections caused by alemtuzumab include hepatitis, human papilloma virus (HPV), TB, and fungal infections,
     especially oral and vaginal candidiasis. Any client with active disease of these infections should not take the
     monoclonal antibodies. Pregnant or breastfeeding clients should avoid monoclonal antibodies.

     The FDA recommends that 6 weeks before starting therapy, clients should be vaccinated for VZV. No live-virus
     vaccines should be received after starting monoclonal antibodies.

     Oletuzemab can cause immune-mediated colitis characterized by diarrhea (DailyMed, Ocrevus, 2023). Other ADRs,
     contraindications, and cautions are similar to alemtuzumab.

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following when administering monoclonal antibodies:

    · Obtain and analyze CBC with differential, serum creatinine levels, thyroid function, and urine cell count before
        therapy and then regularly until 48 months after last infusion.

    · Obtain urine protein to creatinine ratio before the start of therapy.
    · Assess client during and for 2 hours after each infusion, including vital signs, to identify any infusion-related

        adverse effects.
    · Educate client regarding the drug's increased risk of malignancies, including thyroid cancer, melanoma, and

        lymph disorders.
    · Teach client signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.
    · Perform a tuberculin skin test and HPV screening.
    · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

        teaching guidelines.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking a monoclonal antibody should:

    · Be compliant related to the required monthly laboratory testing.
    · Complete any necessary immunizations at least 6 weeks before treatment starting.
334  11 · Drugs to Treat Parkinson's Disease and Multiple Sclerosis

         · Be screened for TB and HPV (if applicable).
         · Understand clinical manifestations related to certain autoimmune disorders caused by therapy, such as

             hematuria, hemoptysis, easy bruising, petechiae, edema, decreased urine output, spontaneous bleeding,
             abdominal pain, and jaundice.
         · Be able to differentiate manifestations related to hypo- and hyperthyroidism.
         · Be able to verbalize possible signs/symptoms of stroke, such as facial droop, dysarthria, unilateral
             weakness, or sudden severe headache.
         · Notify the provider with any indication of infection, such as fever, fatigue, sore throat, enlarged lymph
             nodes, or coughing.

     The client taking a monoclonal antibody should not:

         · Stop drugs abruptly because symptoms will quickly reoccur.
         · Overexert themselves; they should take rest periods between activities.
         · Engage in activities that could cause injury.

       FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

       Monoclonal Antibodies

       Alemtuzumab may cause life-threatening autoimmune conditions, such as immune thrombocytopenia, serious
       infusion reactions resulting in anaphylaxis, potential fatal strokes, and an increase risk of malignancies.

       Natalizumab may cause increased risk of PML, which is a potentially fatal viral infection of the brain.

     Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor Modulators

     Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators regulate immune activity by specifically blocking the activity of
     S1P receptors found on the surface of lymphocytes. This prevents the lymphocytes from leaving the lymph nodes
     and entering the bloodstream, thus reducing their activity in the CNS. S1P receptor modulators are oral drugs
     prescribed for RRMS and active SPMS. There are currently three drugs on the market that fit into this category. This
     chapter will only focus on siponimod fumaric acid (Mayzent) because there are very few differences among them.
     The drug is associated with a CYP2C9 genotype variant that alters the dose.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Initiation of S1P drug therapy results in a decrease in heart rate, for which monitoring is recommended. The nurse
     should administer the first dose in a setting in which resources to appropriately manage symptomatic bradycardia
     are available. Before dosing and at the end of the observation period, an ECG should be obtained for all clients.
     Observation of clients overnight is necessary if they are at higher risk of symptomatic bradycardia, heart block,
     prolonged QTc interval, or if taking drugs with known risk of torsades de pointes. If post-dose symptomatic
     bradycardia occurs, appropriate management should be initiated, beginning with continuous ECG monitoring and
     continuing until the symptoms have resolved.

     Another adverse effect is macular edema. Fundoscopic examinations are essential before and 3-4 months after the
     treatment has been started. They are also performed again whenever a client reports visual disturbances. Diabetes
     mellitus and uveitis increase the risk of macular edema.

     S1P receptor modulators may also cause fetal harm. Advise clients of childbearing age of the potential risk to a fetus
     and to use an effective method of contraception during treatment and for 10 days after stopping the drug.

     Furthermore, siponimod fumaric acid can cause an increase in blood pressure readings. Blood pressure should be
     monitored routinely, and any significant changes should be reported to the provider. Suspicious skin lesions should
     be evaluated because the risk of basal cell carcinoma and melanoma is increased in clients being treated with
     siponimod fumaric acid.

     There have been reported cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) in clients receiving an S1P
     receptor modulator. This is caused by swelling and narrowing of the blood vessels within the brain. If a client

11.4 · Drugs Used in the Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis                                                                 335

complains of a sudden onset of a severe headache, altered mental status, vision changes, or seizure activity, the
provider should promptly schedule a complete physical and neurological examination and consider an MRI.
Symptoms are usually reversible but may evolve into ischemic stroke or cerebral hemorrhage. Delay in diagnosis
and treatment may lead to permanent neurological sequelae. If PRES is suspected, the drug should be
discontinued.

Before initiation of treatment with siponimod fumaric acid, clients should be tested to determine their CYP2C9
genotype. Substantially elevated siponimod plasma levels may occur in clients who are homozygous for CYP2C9*3,
so its use is contraindicated in these individuals.

This therapy can cause a dose-dependent reduction in peripheral lymphocyte count to 20%-30% of baseline values
because of reversible sequestration of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues. It is important not to start therapy in clients
with active infection.

Avoid live vaccines during therapy and for 4 weeks after to prevent the possibility of developing an infection.
Concurrently taking antineoplastics or immunosuppressive or immune-modulating therapies can elevate the client's
risk of infection. Class Ia or Class III antiarrhythmic drugs should be avoided due to the increased risk of
prolongation of the QTc interval. The administration of drugs that slow the heart rate or decrease atrioventricular
conduction (e.g., beta blockers, digoxin, diltiazem, or verapamil) can intensify the risk of dysrhythmias or
atrioventricular block or can exacerbate manifestations of heart failure. Monitor for the development of severe
increase in disability following drug discontinuation and begin appropriate treatment as needed.

     Nursing Implications
     The nurse should do the following when administering S1P receptor modulators:

     · Before starting treatment, obtain serum transaminases (ALT and AST), total bilirubin, CBC, and pulmonary
        function (e.g., spirometry) if indicated.

     · Before starting treatment, determine whether clients are taking drugs that could slow their heart rate or
        atrioventricular (AV) conduction. Obtain cardiologist consultation before concomitant use with other drugs
        that decrease heart rate.

     · Monitor all clients for 6 hours after the first dose for signs and symptoms of bradycardia with hourly heart rate
        and blood pressure measurement. Provider must assess for elevated blood pressures. Clients should know
        ahead of time they will be in the office for a minimum of 6 hours.

     · Perform a thorough skin assessment periodically for signs of malignancy, such as asymmetry, indistinct
        borders, color variations, and increased size and elevation of any lesions.

     · Assess for any neurological changes that could be related to PRES.
     · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

        teaching guidelines.

  CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

  The client taking an S1P receptor modulator should:

      · Call provider with any dizziness, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, and fatigue.
      · Notify the provider with any visual changes.
      · Inform the provider of manifestations related to liver injury, such as jaundice, nausea, right upper

          quadrant pain, dark urine, and clay-colored stools.
      · Implement measures to avoid being exposed to infection. Contact provider if signs/symptoms of infection

          are present.
      · Limit exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet light by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a

          high protection factor.

  The client taking an S1P receptor modulator should not:

      · Stop drugs abruptly because symptoms will quickly reoccur.
      · Ignore any suspicious skin changes, such as a newly developed lesion, change of appearance in a mole, a

          new darkened area on their skin, a sore that does not heal, or growths on their skin.
      · Chew, split, break, or crush medication.

Muscle Relaxants

Muscle spasticity is the result of damage to neurons within the CNS rather than injury to the peripheral structures.
Clients often report stiffness and/or heavy muscles, difficulty with movement, and pain. Because the nerve damage
originates in the CNS, the risk of this becoming permanent is high. Spasticity results in the excessive stimulation of
muscles (hypertonia) in opposing muscle groups at the same time. The different types and brands of skeletal
muscle relaxants work in different ways to affect muscle function. Most are CNS depressants and prevent the nerves
from sending pain signals to the brain. They have no direct effect on skeletal muscle. Other actions may include the
blockage of nerve impulses that cause increased muscle tone and contraction (Cleveland Clinic, 2023).

Centrally Acting Muscle Relaxant
Along with treating spasticity, baclofen is helpful in treating pain from trigeminal neuralgia that occurs in MS. This
drug is available in oral and intrathecal (within the spine) forms and can be administered through an implantable
delivery pump for treating central spasticity. The drug has no direct effect on skeletal muscle; therefore, it does not
reduce muscle strength.

Peripherally Acting Muscle Relaxant
Dantrolene acts peripherally on the muscle itself. The drug inhibits the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic
reticulum directly within skeletal muscle cells. This action prevents the muscle fibers from contracting. Dantrolene
does not interfere with neuromuscular transmission but does impair muscle strength. This drug is also used in the
treatment and prevention of malignant hyperthermia (manages muscle contraction and rigidity). This agent is not
therapeutic for treating muscle spasms associated with muscle injury or rheumatic disorders (DailyMed, Dantrolene,
2022).

Table 11.21 lists common muscle relaxants and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     The most common adverse effects for baclofen are related to CNS depression. Constipation and urinary retention
     are linked to CNS depression of the parasympathetic nervous system reflexes. This slows down peristalsis and
     relaxes the detrusor muscle of the bladder. Baclofen crosses the placenta and enters breast milk, so a fetus/infant
     may develop CNS depression.

     Cardiac concerns, such as heart failure and arrhythmias, result from the depression of the normal reflex arcs. This
     drug could exacerbate heart failure due to depressed muscle function caused by these drugs.

     If the oral version of baclofen is stopped too quickly, this can cause the development of psychoses, visual
     hallucinations, and seizures. The drug should be tapered off over a 1- to 2-week period. Abrupt withdrawal of the
     intrathecal route can be more dangerous. Possible reactions include high fever, altered mental status, rebound
     spasticity, and muscle rigidity that could lead to muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis).

     Blocking the spasticity associated with movement, posture, or balance results in loss of these functions. This places
     clients at high risk for falls.

     Some common adverse reactions for dantrolene include diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Clients with respiratory
     depression must be closely monitored because this can be exacerbated by muscular weakness. Dose-related
     hepatotoxicity is the most serious adverse effect. Baseline liver enzymes should be obtained and monitored
     periodically throughout treatment. If clients show no response within 45 days of initiating this drug, it should be
     stopped to prevent damage to the liver. Caution should be used in all clients older than 35 years of age due to their
     increased risk of potentially fatal hepatocellular disease. Supplemental estrogen increases the incidence of
     hepatocellular toxicity. This drug should be discontinued at the first indication of hepatic impairment (DailyMed,
     Baclofen, 2023).

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking muscle relaxants:

· Assess alertness, orientation, and affect.
· Evaluate muscle strength before and after administration of medication.
· Auscultate bowel sounds and monitor bowel movements due to constipation and to avoid a fecal impaction.
· Obtain baseline liver function tests and serum BUN/creatinine levels and assess these levels periodically

   during therapy to assess for changes.
· Ensure safety precautions are in place to prevent falls because of fatigue, weakness, and confusion.
· Provide additional measures to relieve discomfort such as heat, rest, NSAIDs, and positioning to augment

   effects of the drug.
· Emphasize to the client/caregiver that the drug must be gradually discontinued over a 1- to 2-week period.
· Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

   teaching guidelines.
340  11 · Drugs to Treat Parkinson's Disease and Multiple Sclerosis

       CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

       The client taking a muscle relaxant should:

           · Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains to prevent or reduce constipation.
           · Drink at least 6-8 8-oz of water daily to promote regular bowel movements.
           · Have a clear understanding of the baclofen pump if applicable, such as frequent monitoring, adjusting the

               dose, and programming the unit, to avoid complications.
           · Report painful or frequent urination, constipation, headache, insomnia, or excessive fatigue.
           · Understand various nonpharmacological comfort measures to use, such as heat, rest, or position change,

               to help relieve discomfort.
           · Notify provider if signs or symptoms of liver dysfunction appear, such as right upper quadrant pain,

               jaundice, dark urine, and clay-colored stools.

       The client taking a muscle relaxant should not:

           · Chew, break, or crush extended-release capsules.
           · Rise or change positions quickly due to possible orthostatic hypotension.
           · Drive or engage in potentially hazardous tasks that require alertness and focus until the effects of the drug

               are known.
           · Stop the drug abruptly, to prevent negative effects.

       that can result in organ failure and death.

     Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid Structural Analogs

     Seizures may be slightly more common in people with MS due to the way the condition affects the brain. MS
     damages several parts of the brain, which can lead to disruptions in signal transmission. The scar tissue of an MS
     lesion creates a barrier to the transmission of nerve signals down a path. The flow of the nerve signals gets
     redirected. If the lesions create enough barriers, the result is an abnormal discharge of excessive electrical energy
     from the nerve cells of the brain. Clinical manifestations vary depending on the area of the brain affected.

     There are various forms of seizures. Some stimulate motor nerves, whereas others affect autonomic and sensory
     nerves (Moreo & Benbadis, 2019). The form a particular seizure takes depends on the cell location that initiated the
     electrical discharge and the neural pathways stimulated by that initial impulse. In general, the three main categories
     of seizures are generalized, focal, and combined. The combined form is referred to as a focal to bilateral seizure
     where the impulse initiated in one area of the brain and then spread to both hemispheres (secondary generalized
     seizure). For a more detailed discussion on the different types of seizures and their treatment, refer to
     Anticonvulsant Drugs and Drugs to Treat Epilepsy, Migraine Headaches, and Intracranial Emergencies.

     Drugs used for seizures do not treat the underlying cause but simply control the seizure activity and modulate the
     inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA.

         · Gabapentin: FDA-approved agent used as an adjunct in treating focal seizures. It is believed to enhance the
             release of GABA. It does not bind directly to GABA receptors. It is also helpful in the treatment of central pain
             caused by damage to the brain and/or spinal cord. In addition, it is used in the management of postherpetic
             neuralgia and restless leg syndrome. It is important to know that the forms of gabapentin indicated for these
             last two conditions are not equivalent with each other or that which is used for seizures (DailyMed,
            Gabapentin, 2023).

    · Pregabalin: Approved as an adjunct in treating focal seizures, it is also FDA-approved for the management of
        neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia along with
        fibromyalgia. This drug has a high binding affinity for voltage-gated calcium channels in the cerebrovascular
        system. It does not bind to GABA or benzodiazepine receptors; therefore, its effect is indirect. Pregabalin is
       regulated under the Controlled Substances Act. It is listed as a Schedule V agent (DailyMed, Pregabalin,
        2022).

Table 11.23 lists common GABA structural analogs and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with GABA structural analogs. Angioedema is characterized by swelling of
the face, tongue, lips, gums, throat, and larynx. The drug should immediately be discontinued at the first sign of
angioedema or other hypersensitivity reaction, such as hives, rash, wheezing, or dyspnea. Weight gain, due to an
increased appetite, can be significant; some clients gain 7% or more in a few months. There is a possibility of
rhabdomyolysis, so clients should be taught to let the provider know if muscle pain/tenderness occurs. Decreased
sperm counts, reduced sperm motility, and increased sperm abnormalities can occur in male clients taking the drug.
Clients may develop a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia).

Also, it has been reported pregabalin causes subjective effects similar to diazepam, increasing the risk of physical
dependence. To avoid withdrawal symptoms, such as headache, diarrhea, or insomnia, the drug should be
discontinued over at least 1 week.

CNS depressants and alcohol can increase the depressant effects of pregabalin. Taking angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors concurrently increases the risk of swelling and hives. If taking thiazolidinediones with
pregabalin, there is a higher chance of weight gain or swelling of one's hands or feet.

     Nursing Implications
     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking GABA structural analogs:

     · Ensure the client is taking an additional antiseizure medication because these are used only as adjuncts.
     · Instruct the client not to break, chew, or crush the extended-release forms.
     · Watch for any mood or personality changes and signs of suicidal ideation.
     · Assess for seizure activity and ensure seizure precautions are in place.
     · Evaluate for CNS depression to maintain client safety.
     · Monitor weight and presence of peripheral edema.
     · Emphasize to client not to stop drug abruptly.
     · Assess client for muscle pain or tenderness.
     · Monitor platelet count and creatinine kinase enzymes if muscle pain occurs.
     · Evaluate history of drug use disorder or drug misuse.
     · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

        teaching guidelines.

     CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

     The client taking a GABA structural analog should:

         · Sit or lie down if excessive fatigue occurs and wait until it subsides.
         · Weigh themselves at the same time each day and notify provider if they gain more than 2 pounds within

             24 hours.
         · Know there is a risk of dependence.
         · Immediately stop the drug if any manifestations of hypersensitivity arise to prevent reaction from

             worsening.

    · Be aware of the increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior.
    · Notify the provider if they are experiencing muscle discomfort.
    · Contact the health care provider if they notice easy bruising, prolonged bleeding, or anemia.
    · Use condoms to prevent pregnancy.

The client taking a GABA structural analog should not:

    · Stop drugs abruptly when discontinuing because there is a risk of precipitating seizures with sudden
        withdrawal.

    · Drink alcohol due to additive sedative effects and risk for injury.
    · Drive or perform tasks requiring alertness, coordination, or physical dexterity until the effects of the drug

        are known.
    · Engage in activities or tasks that have a high risk of bleeding.

INTRODUCTION The brain, one of the most important organs of the body, controls and coordinates all bodily
functions including movement, sensation, thought, memory, and emotion. The brain receives information from
neurons, interprets that information, and then responds via either voluntary or involuntary actions. When the brain is
affected by disorders, such as epilepsy, seizures, migraines, and intracranial emergencies, the proper functioning of
the body can be severely impaired (see Figure 12.2). This chapter will delve into these disorders, their impact on the
brain, and common drugs used to treat these conditions.

     Overview of Epilepsy and Seizures

     Seizures are a sudden and temporary disturbance in the electrical activity of the brain that can cause changes in
     behavior, movement, or consciousness. Epilepsy, on the other hand, is a neurological disorder characterized by
     recurrent seizures. In epilepsy, the seizures are typically unprovoked and can occur spontaneously without any
     apparent trigger. Epilepsy is a condition that affects approximately 3.4 million people in the United States, and it can
     have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020a,
     2020c).

     Etiology
     Seizures can have various causes such as fever, head injury, brain infection, drug or alcohol withdrawal or overdose,
     electrolyte imbalances, and metabolic disorders. Seizures may also result from brain tumors or masses, stroke, or
     other neurological conditions. Sometimes the cause of a seizure cannot be identified--a condition called an
     idiopathic seizure (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020b, 2020c).

     Epilepsy, on the other hand, is a long-term neurological condition thought to be linked to abnormalities in the
     structure and function of the brain, which can be present at birth or develop later in life due to various factors such
     as brain injury, tumor, or stroke. Genetic factors may also play a role in the development of epilepsy. Understanding
     the underlying cause of epilepsy is important for effective diagnosis and treatment of the condition (Centers for
     Disease Control and Prevention, 2020a, 2020c).

     Pathophysiology
     A seizure occurs when there is a sudden and abnormal burst of electrical activity in the brain. This activity can

12.1 · Epilepsy and Anticonvulsant Drugs                                                                                 349

disrupt normal brain function and lead to a variety of symptoms, such as convulsions, loss of consciousness, and
sensory or motor disturbances (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020a, 2020c).

Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder in which recurrent, unprovoked seizures occur. The underlying
pathophysiology of epilepsy involves a disruption in the normal balance of excitatory and inhibitory activity in the
brain. This imbalance can be due to structural or functional abnormalities in the brain, genetics, or changes in
neurotransmitter activity. The abnormal electrical activity in the brain that occurs during an epileptic seizure is
thought to be caused by a sudden release of excitatory neurotransmitters or a sudden decrease in inhibitory
neurotransmitters (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020a, 2020c).

Diagnostic Testing
Diagnosis of seizures or epilepsy is multifaceted. The health care provider will obtain a thorough history and perform
a neurological examination. The health care provider may order one or more of the following diagnostic tests to
identify seizures or rule out other causes or structural abnormalities that could be contributing to the seizure
diagnosis:

    · Electroencephalogram (EEG)
          An EEG is a test that measures changes in the brain's electrical patterns that relate to seizures or other
              neurological conditions. Small metal electrodes are attached to the scalp, and the electrical impulses of
              the brain appear as wavy lines on the EEG recording.

    · Computed tomography (CT) scan
          A CT scan is a noninvasive imaging procedure that uses x-rays to produce horizontal and axial images of
              the brain.

    · Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
          An MRI of the brain is a painless imaging procedure that uses large magnetic radio waves to produce clear
              images of the structures inside the skull.

    · Positron emission tomography (PET) scan
          A PET scan is an imaging procedure that uses a radioactive tracer substance to detect disease or injury in
              the brain.

Clinical Manifestations
Clinical manifestations of seizures can vary depending on the type of seizure a person is experiencing. There are
several types of seizures, but they are generally classified into two groups: generalized seizures and focal seizures.

Generalized seizures involve abnormal activity in both sides of the brain from the beginning of the seizure. The two
types of generalized seizures are absence seizures and tonic-clonic seizures (Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, 2020a, 2020c).

    · Absence seizures, also known as petit mal seizures, cause rapid blinking or a few seconds of staring into
        space.

    · Tonic-clonic seizures involve both tonic (muscle stiffness) and clonic (muscle jerking) phases and are
        commonly known as grand mal seizures.

Focal seizures, also known as partial seizures, begin in a specific area of the brain and can cause a wide range of
symptoms depending on the area of the brain that is affected. There are three types of focal seizures: simple focal
seizures, complex focal seizures, and secondary generalized seizures (Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, 2020a, 2020c).

    · Simple focal seizures affect a small part of the brain and cause twitching movements or a change in sensation,
        such as an odd taste or smell.

    · Complex focal seizures make a person confused or dazed. The person will be unresponsive to questions or
        directions for up to a few minutes.

    · Secondary generalized seizures begin in one part of the brain but then spread to the other side. The person
        first has a focal seizure, followed by a generalized seizure.

     Drugs Used to Treat Epilepsy

     Drugs that are used to treat epilepsy and seizures are generally termed anticonvulsant drugs. Anticonvulsant drugs
     are used to either control acute seizures or as maintenance to prevent seizures from occurring. Other drug
     classifications, such as some central nervous system depressants and mood stabilizers, have also been shown to be
     effective in the treatment of seizures and epilepsy. This section of the chapter will cover commonly prescribed
     classes of drugs used to treat seizures and epilepsy: hydantoins, barbiturates, succinates, benzodiazipines,
     iminostilbenes, valproates, pyrrolidine derivatives, and other anticonvulsants.

     Importantly, numerous medications utilized for epilepsy treatment may interact with other drugs. Therefore, the
     nurse should thoroughly evaluate all the medications a client is currently taking, including over-the-counter
     products and herbal supplements. If any questions or concerns arise, the nurse should consult with a more
     knowledgeable health care provider or pharmacist to ensure the client's safety and prevent the occurrence of
     potential drug interactions.

     Hydantoins
     Hydantoins are a class of anticonvulsant drugs that are used to prevent or control seizures. Hydantoins can reduce
     the occurrence and severity of seizures by stabilizing the neuronal membrane in the brain. Some commonly
     prescribed hydantoins include phenytoin and fosphenytoin. Although hydantoins can be effective in controlling
     seizures, they can have significant adverse effects, including dizziness, drowsiness, and coordination problems.
     Long-term use can lead to complications such as osteoporosis and gingival hyperplasia (gum overgrowth).
     Contraindications of hydantoins include hypersensitivity to hydantoins or substances they contain, sinus
     bradycardia or heart block, and liver disease. They should be used cautiously in people who are pregnant or
     breastfeeding as they can be harmful to the fetus or infant (Gupta & Tripp, 2022).

     Therapeutic drug monitoring, which may be necessary for optimal treatment outcomes, is an essential task for
     nurses. Careful review of serum blood levels--trough levels and peak levels--is crucial to make appropriate dosing
     adjustments. Trough levels indicate the lowest concentration of the drug in the blood and are typically measured
     just before the client's next scheduled dose. As a valuable indicator of the clinically effective range of serum levels,
     trough levels help confirm client compliance.

     On the other hand, peak levels are indicative of an individual's threshold for potential dose-related adverse effects
     and are measured at the peak concentration time. The goal is to achieve a therapeutic effect without clinical signs of
     toxicity, which is more likely to occur when serum total concentrations range between 10 and 20 mcg/mL.
     Therefore, close monitoring of serum blood levels, including both trough and peak levels, enables health care
     providers to optimize dosing, maximize therapeutic benefits, and minimize the risk of adverse effects.

     Phenytoin (Dilantin) is the most prescribed hydantoin. Table 12.1 is a drug prototype table for hydantoins featuring
     phenytoin. It lists drug class, mechanism of action, adult and pediatric dosages, indications, therapeutic effects,

Barbiturates
Barbiturates are a class of drugs that act as central nervous system depressants, leading to sedation and relaxation.
Barbiturates work by enhancing the actions of Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the neurotransmitter that slows
down brain activity. GABA is boosted by barbiturates, making them useful as sedatives, hypnotics, and
anticonvulsants. Notably, barbiturates have a high risk of addiction, tolerance, and overdose, so their use has
declined in favor of safer alternatives. Common adverse effects of barbiturates include dyspnea, confusion,
bradycardia, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, and vomiting. This class of drugs is contraindicated in people with
hypersensitivity to barbiturates or their components, in those with hepatic insufficiency, and in those with
respiratory disorders (Skibiski & Abdijadid, 2022).

Phenobarbital is the most used barbiturate for the treatment of seizures. Therapeutic drug monitoring is required.
Phenobarbital is also a strong CYP inducer and will decrease the concentration of many other drugs. Table 12.2 is a

     Succinates
     Succinates are a class of drugs that are used to treat seizures, including petit mal seizures. Succinates reduce the
     amount of calcium available for nerve activity by blocking calcium channels in the brain; abnormal electrical activity
     in the brain is then reduced, which helps to decrease the occurrence of seizures. Adverse effects include
     gastrointestinal upset, drowsiness, lethargy, hiccups, and headaches. They are contraindicated in persons with
     hypersensitivity to succinates or their properties and should be used cautiously in clients with renal or hepatic
     insufficiency (Hanrahan & Carson, 2022).

Benzodiazepines
Benzodiazepines are a class of drug that act on the benzodiazepine receptors (BZ-Rs) in the central nervous system.
They work by enhancing the activity of the neurotransmitter GABA, which is inhibitory and slows brain activity.
Dosing is individualized and depends on the drug being used. Benzodiazepines such as clonazepam, clorazepate,
and diazepam are commonly prescribed to treat seizures.

Nurses should note that these drugs can result in sedation and use of these drugs in late pregnancy can result in
sedation (respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia) and/or withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability,
restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in newborns.

Table 12.4 lists common benzodiazepines and typical routes and dosing for adult and pediatric clients.

Drug                                                Routes and Dosage Ranges

             Adults: Initial dose: 1.5 mg/day orally divided into 3 doses.

             Increase dose by 0.5-1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled.

             Children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight): Initial dose: 0.01-0.03 mg/kg/day; do

Clonazepam   not exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in 2 or 3 divided doses.
 (Klonopin)  Dosage should be increased by no more than 0.25-0.5 mg every third day until a daily
             maintenance dose of 0.1-0.2 mg/kg of body weight has been reached and seizures are

             controlled.

             Whenever possible, the daily dose should be divided into 3 equal doses. If this is not feasible,

             give the largest dose before bedtime.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Common adverse effects of benzodiazepines include respiratory depression, drowsiness, confusion, headache,
     dizziness, tremor, and gastrointestinal upset. Benzodiazepines are contraindicated in hypersensitivity to the drug
     and its properties, in angle closure glaucoma, and with concomitant use with opioids. An increased risk of congenital
     malformations and other developmental abnormalities associated with benzodiazepine use during pregnancy has
     been identified.

     Seizure rescue with benzodiazepines is a commonly used approach to manage seizures quickly and effectively.
     Benzodiazepines suppress excessive electrical activity in the brain. When a seizure occurs, administering a
     benzodiazepine promptly can help terminate the seizure and prevent its progression These medications can be
     administered orally, intravenously, intramuscularly, and via other routes depending on the situation and available
     resources.

     The goal of seizure rescue with benzodiazepines is to provide rapid and effective control of seizures while ensuring
     the safety and well-being of the client. Benzodiazepines are a short-term solution for seizure management. Long-
     term treatment plans and adjustments should be made in collaboration with a health care provider to address the
     underlying cause of the seizure and prevent future occurrences.

     Another widely used benzodiazepine for treating seizures is lorazepam. Table 12.5 is a drug prototype table for
     benzodiazepines featuring lorazepam. It lists drug class, mechanism of action, adult dosage, indications,
     therapeutic effects, drug and food interactions, adverse effects, and contraindications.

FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

Benzodiazepines

Benzodiazepines--when used in combination with opioid drugs--may depress the central nervous system,
causing serious adverse effects including respiratory depression and death.

   CLINICAL TIP

Lorazepam Intravenous Administration

Intravenous administration of lorazepam should be via slow intravenous push (2 mg/minute) for active seizures.
If respiratory depression develops, flumazenil should be used as a competitive antagonist to reverse the effects
of the lorazepam (Ghiasi et al., 2023).

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Substance Misuse and Dependence

Barbiturates and benzodiazepines are highly addictive and can result in dependence, tolerance, and even
overdose. It is important for the health care provider to consider the client's situation and perform a thorough
medical and social history, including substance misuse or problematic use, which may also be referred to as
substance abuse.

    · Drug tolerance occurs when someone uses, misuses, or overuses a substance over a long period of time.
356  12 · Anticonvulsant Drugs and Drugs to Treat Epilepsy, Migraine Headaches, and Intracranial Emergencies

           · Dependence occurs when someone uses high doses of a substance and they cannot function normally
               without the use of the substance.

           · Substance use disorder occurs when someone is unable to control the use of the substance and they
               cannot stop using the substance.

           · Overdose occurs when someone takes in a toxic amount of a substance. Overdose can lead to coma or
               even death.

     Iminostilbenes
     Iminostilbenes are a class of anticonvulsant drug in which the compounds are structurally related to cyclic
     antidepressants. This class of drug shows efficacy in the first-line treatment for seizures. Iminostilbenes inhibit
     neuronal excitability by enhancing GABA; this drug requires therapeutic monitoring. Adverse reactions include
     urticaria, photosensitivity, congestive heart failure, edema, dyspnea, acute urinary retention, drowsiness, dizziness,
     coordination disturbances, headache, fatigue, abdominal pain, agranulocytosis, hyponatremia/SIADH, and
     leukopenia. Iminostilbenes are contraindicated in individuals with previous bone marrow depression and with
     hypersensitivity to the drug or its constituents; they should not be administered with tricyclic antidepressants,
     monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, nefazodone, and delavirdine (Magheru et al., 2022).

     The most common iminostilbene used in the treatment of seizures is carbamazepine (Tegretol). Table 12.6 is a drug

     Carbamazepine
     Carbamazepine may cause serious adverse effects including aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis.
     Carbamazepine may cause serious dermatologic reactions including toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-
     Johnson syndrome.

     Valproates
     Valproates are anticonvulsants and mood stabilizers used in the treatment of seizures and bipolar disorder.
     Valproates act on GABA levels in the central nervous system, blocking voltage-gated sodium, potassium, and
     calcium ion channels causing decreasing brain activity. Adverse reactions include headache, somnolence, dizziness,
     drowsiness, thrombocytopenia, tremor, alopecia, emotional lability, petechiae, rash, alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
     and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation, tinnitus, and photosensitivity. Valproates are contraindicated in
     individuals with hepatic disorders and in those who have hypersensitivity to components of the drug.

     Therapeutic drug monitoring measures the concentration of a valproic acid in the client's blood and ensures that the
     drug is within the therapeutic range by adjusting the dosage, if necessary. Therapeutic range for valproic acid varies
     depending on the indication being treated. Generally, the total serum concentration of valproic acid is maintained
     between 50 and 100 µg/mL for epilepsy. However, individualized target ranges may be established based on factors
     such as age, comorbidities, concomitant medications, and treatment responses.

     The most common valproate is valproic acid (Rahman & Nguyen, 2022). Table 12.7 is a drug prototype table for
     valproates featuring valproic acid. It lists drug class, mechanism of action, adult and pediatric dosage, indications,
     therapeutic effects, drug and food interactions, adverse effects, and contraindications.

     Nursing Implications
     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking anticonvulsant drugs:

         · Assess the client's medical history, current drug list, and allergies.
         · Assess client's baseline weight and vital signs.
         · Ensure the drug is prepared appropriately using aseptic technique and verify dosage before administration.
         · Monitor the client's response to the drug, including any changes in seizure patterns, neurological condition,

             and mental status.
         · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

             teaching guidelines.

       CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

       The client taking an anticonvulsant drug should:

           · Take the drug as prescribed and do not skip doses or stop therapy.
           · Do not use alcohol or smoke--alcohol can depress the central nervous system, and smoking may cause

               vasoconstriction, resulting in reduced elimination of the drug.
           · Keep a journal of symptoms and note improved or worsening symptoms.
           · Take drug with food if gastrointestinal upset occurs.
           · Have laboratory testing as scheduled by health care provider. Many anticonvulsants require titration and

               monitoring of blood levels to ensure safety and efficacy.
           · Report symptoms of dyspnea, confusion, skin rash, abnormal bleeding, and/or infections to health care

               provider as these may represent an adverse reaction to anticonvulsant drugs.
           · Speak to their health care provider if they are pregnant or plan to become pregnant before starting these

               drugs because they can impact the fetus.
           · Store out of reach children and away from heat, moisture, and light.

       The client taking anticonvulsant drugs should not:

           · Drive or operate machinery with central nervous system depressants.
           · Stop taking the drug unless directed by their health care provider, as this drug class reduces the risk of

               seizures.

different types of headaches, migraine headaches are a specific and recurring type of headache that can cause
significant debilitating symptoms. This chapter will focus specifically on migraine headaches, exploring their causes,
symptoms, and common drugs used to alleviate this condition.

Overview of Migraine Headaches

Migraine headaches are a type of headache that can be recurring and are often associated with a range of symptoms
that can greatly affect a person's quality of life. These symptoms will be explored in more detail later in this chapter.
Migraine headaches can last for several hours up to several days and can be debilitating, often interfering with daily
activities. Some people may experience a warning symptom, known as an aura, which can include visual
disturbances such as flashing lights or blind spots. Migraine headaches are a prevalent condition that affects a
significant portion of the U.S. population, with an estimated 39 million people experiencing this type of headache
(American Migraine Foundation, 2023).

Etiology
Migraines can stem from a range of factors, which may include environmental, potent odors, tobacco use, motion
sickness, hormonal fluctuations, flashing lights, inadequate sleep, heightened stress levels, and certain foods such
as aged cheeses, aspartame, and monosodium glutamate (MSG), and caffeine withdrawal (American Migraine
Foundation, 2023; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2023).

Pathophysiology
The underlying pathophysiology of migraine headaches is unclear, but a comprehensive theory proposes the
involvement of neuronal hyperexcitability, vasodilation of blood vessels--which triggers pain receptors--and
inflammation in the brain (American Migraine Foundation, 2023).

Diagnostic Testing
To diagnose migraine headaches, health care providers rely on the client's report of symptoms, a detailed medical
history, and a physical examination. Radiologic imaging, such as an MRI or CT scan, may also be performed to rule
out other potential causes of the headaches, such as brain tumors, meningitis, or ischemia (American Migraine
Foundation, 2023).

Clinical Manifestations
Clinical manifestations (symptoms) of migraine headaches include:

    · Pulsating, throbbing head pain
    · Muscle weakness
    · Language disturbances
    · Pupillary changes
    · Visual disturbances
    · Mood changes
    · Fluid retention
    · Increased urinary output

Drugs Used to Treat Migraine Headaches

Migraine headaches can be treated through two distinct courses of therapy: abortive and preventive. Abortive
therapy aims to relieve the symptoms of a migraine headache through drug administration. On the other hand,
preventive therapy involves the use of drugs to prevent the occurrence of migraine headaches altogether.
368  12 · Anticonvulsant Drugs and Drugs to Treat Epilepsy, Migraine Headaches, and Intracranial Emergencies

     Triptans
     Triptans are serotonin agonists that target the pathophysiological mechanism of migraine headaches, effectively
     eliminating symptoms. By selectively binding to serotonin receptors 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D, triptans induce
     vasoconstriction of cranial arteries that are typically dilated during migraines. The vasoconstriction helps to reduce
     the intensity and duration of migraine headaches.

     Table 12.10 lists common triptans and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

     Drug                             Routes and Dosage Ranges

     Eletriptan    Single doses of 20-40 mg orally once.
      (Relpax)     If the migraine does not resolve within 2 hours or returns after transient improvement, a second
                   dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose.
                   Maximum daily dose should not exceed 80 mg.

     Rizatriptan   The recommended starting dose is either 5 mg or 10 mg orally once, for acute treatment of
      (Maxalt)     migraines in adults.

                   Maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.

     Sumatriptan   The recommended daily doses are 25 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg orally.
       (Imitrex)   If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking sumatriptan or returns after a transient
                   improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose.
                   Maximum daily dose is 200 mg in 24 hours.
                   Subcutaneous dosing: 6 mg with a maximum dose of 12 mg/day. Maximum dosing should be 2-6
                   mg injections separated at least 1 hour apart.
                   Intranasal doses: 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg given as a single spray in one nostril.
                   The maximum daily dose is 40 mg in a 24-hour period.

                   The recommended starting dose is 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg.

     Zolmitriptan  The maximum recommended single dose is 5 mg.
        (Zomig)    If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking zolmitriptan or returns after a transient
                   improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose.

                   Maximum daily dose is 10 mg in a 24-hour period.

Ergot Alkaloids
Ergot alkaloids are alpha-adrenergic blockers, a class of drug that directly stimulates vascular smooth muscle,
thereby causing vasoconstriction. These alpha-adrenergic blockers are used in the treatment of migraine and
vascular headaches as well as other medical conditions such as hypertension. Adverse effects include coronary and
peripheral ischemia, muscle pains, nausea, vomiting, paresthesias, vertigo, weakness, and itching. Ergot alkaloids
are contraindicated in hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components, peripheral vascular disease, coronary
heart disease, hypertension, impaired hepatic or renal function, and sepsis.

The most common ergot alkaloid used in the treatment of migraine headaches is ergotamine tartrate (Cafergot).

     Nursing Implications
     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking migraine headache drugs:

     · Assess the client's medical history, current drug list, and allergies.
     · Assess client's baseline symptoms, vital signs, and pain level.
     · Ensure the drug is prepared appropriately using aseptic technique and verify dosage before administration.
     · Monitor the client's response to the drug, including any changes in pain level, neurological status, and vital

        signs.
     · Maintain a dark, calm, and quiet environment.
     · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

        teaching guidelines.

     CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

     The client taking a migraine headache drug should:

         · Get adequate sleep and rest.
         · Keep a journal of symptoms, the presence or non-presence of an aura, and improved or worsening

             symptoms.
         · Take migraine drugs as prescribed.
         · Identify food triggers, environmental triggers, hormonal triggers, and stress triggers.
         · Report worsening of symptoms such as visual changes and uncontrolled head pain to the health care

             provider immediately because these manifestations can be debilitating.

     The client taking a migraine headache drug should not:

         · Drink alcohol or smoke as these can precipitate symptoms of migraine headaches.
         · Operate heavy equipment or machinery while taking migraine headache drugs.

Intracranial Emergency Overview

In adults, the brain has a constant volume, but the amount of cerebrospinal fluid and blood in the skull changes
regularly to control pressure in the brain. Cerebrospinal fluid is produced by the brain and absorbed by the veins in
the skull. Normal cerebrospinal fluid pressure varies with age but generally should not exceed 250 mm H2O in
adults (Sharma et al., 2023). The skull has a relatively fixed volume of approximately 1400-1700 mL (Cook, 2016),
consisting of 80 percent brain parenchyma, 10 percent cerebrospinal fluid, and 10 percent blood. Any increase in
the volume of components within the skull or an addition of a pathological element, such as a brain tumor, will result
in increased pressure within the skull since the skull's volume is considered constant.

Intracranial emergencies encompass a range of sudden and serious medical conditions that affect the brain, its
surrounding structures, or blood vessels within the skull (see Figure 12.3). These conditions can result from a
variety of factors including head trauma, bleeding, blockage of blood vessels within the brain, head or sinus
infections, brain tumors, or other underlying medical conditions. Successful treatment of intracranial emergencies
requires early recognition and prompt medical intervention. Delayed treatment can lead to irreversible brain
damage or death. This chapter will specifically delve into intracranial hypertension and increased intracranial
pressure, providing an in-depth examination of their causes, symptoms, and treatment options.

     Intracranial Hypertension and Increased Intracranial Pressure
     Intracranial hypertension and increased intracranial pressure are related conditions, but they have distinct
     differences. Intracranial hypertension refers specifically to an elevated pressure within the skull that may or may not
     cause symptoms. However, increased intracranial pressure refers to a rise in the pressure within the skull that can
     cause various symptoms, such as headache, nausea, vomiting, visual changes, and altered mental status.
     Intracranial hypertension can be a cause of increased intracranial pressure, but it is not the only cause. Other
     factors that can lead to increased intracranial pressure include brain tumors, bleeding within the brain, infections, or
     trauma. Significantly, prompt recognition and management of increased intracranial pressure are critical to prevent
     irreversible brain damage and ensure the best possible outcomes for clients (Munakomi & Das, 2023).

     Intracranial pressure is typically measured at the level of the foramen of Monro and is normally between 7 mm Hg
     and 15 mm Hg in vertically positioned adults. Intracranial hypertension is a clinical condition that is associated with
     an elevation of the pressures within the cranium. The cranial vault is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg)
     and is normally less than 20 mm Hg (Pinto et al., 2022). Therapy to lower intracranial pressure should be initiated
     when increased intracranial pressure is greater than 20 mm Hg to 25 mm Hg (Munakomi & Das, 2023).

       present an educational video on increased intracranial pressure.

     Diagnostic Testing
     Intracranial hypertension and increased intracranial pressure can be diagnosed with these tests:

         · Neurologic assessment: A physical examination of the client's neurological function can provide information
             about the presence of increased pressure or fluid within the skull and brain.

         · Radiologic imaging: CT and MRI are commonly used to evaluate the brain for structural abnormalities that may
             cause intracranial hypertension or increased intracranial pressure.

         · Intracranial pressure monitoring: Direct measurement of intracranial pressure can be obtained by inserting a
             catheter into the skull and connecting it to a pressure transducer. This is the "gold standard" for diagnosing
             and monitoring increased intracranial pressure.

         · Transcranial doppler: This is a noninvasive test that uses ultrasound to measure the velocity of blood flow in
             the brain's blood vessels. It can be used to assess cerebral blood flow and help diagnose and monitor
             increased intracranial pressure.

         · Ophthalmologic examination: Increased intracranial pressure can cause swelling of the optic nerve, which
             can be detected by an ophthalmologist during an eye examination.

     The choice of diagnostic test depends on the suspected cause of intracranial hypertension and increased
     intracranial pressure, the severity of the symptoms, and the availability of resources. A combination of these tests
     may be necessary to make an accurate diagnosis and to develop an appropriate plan of treatment.

     Clinical Manifestations
     Clinical manifestations of intracranial hypertension and increased intracranial pressure can vary depending on the
     underlying cause and the individual client factors. A thorough evaluation by a health care provider is necessary to
     accurately diagnose and manage these conditions.

     Clinical manifestations of intracranial hypertension may include:

         · Headache
         · Nausea
         · Blurred vision
         · Dizziness

    · Tinnitus
    · Confusion or altered mental status

Clinical manifestations of increased intracranial pressure may include:

    · Headache
    · Seizures
    · Papilledema
    · Altered mental status, including drowsiness, confusion, or coma
    · Changes in vital signs, such as bradycardia (slow heart rate) or hypertension

In severe cases, increased intracranial pressure can lead to brain herniation, a condition in which a portion of the
brain is displaced due to increased intracranial pressure, a life-threatening condition. Symptoms of brain herniation
can include changes in breathing pattern, dilation of one or both pupils, loss of consciousness, coma, and death.

     CLINICAL TIP

 Nursing Interventions to Lower/Stabilize Increased Intracranial Pressure

  Along with administering drugs to decrease elevated intracranial pressure, the nurse must keep the head of the
  client's bed at a 30-degree angle, or as directed by the health care provider, and keep the client's neck in a
  neutral position to help stabilize and lower intracranial pressure (Faraj et al., 2022).

Drugs Used for Intracranial Emergencies

The health care provider selects drugs to treat intracranial hypertension and increased intracranial pressure based
on the underlying cause and severity of the condition. For example, in some cases of cerebral edema, osmotic
diuretics or carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) may be used to reduce brain swelling and lower intracranial
pressure. Non-pharmaceutical treatments--such as radiation or surgery--may also be needed as adjuvant
treatment, particularly if there is a mass, tumor, bleeding, or trauma to the brain. The health care provider may also
need to monitor the client's response to treatment and adjust the drug regimen accordingly. Common drugs used to
treat issues with intracranial hypertension and increased intracranial pressure include glucocorticoids,
hyperosmolar therapy (mannitol and hypertonic saline), barbiturates, sedatives, and antiepileptic drugs (Faraj et al.,
2022). This section of the chapter will focus on drugs that are aimed at reducing intracranial pressure and cerebral
edema including CAIs and osmotic diuretics.

Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors (CAIs)
CAIs are a class of drugs that are commonly used to treat a range of conditions, including intracranial hypertension,
altitude sickness, and glaucoma. In managing intracranial emergencies, CAIs work by blocking carbonic anhydrase
on the luminal membrane and inside the proximal renal tubule, which results in a reduction in the secretion of
bicarbonate ions through the sodium and hydrogen antiporter. This decrease in bicarbonate ion secretion leads to
a reduction in cerebrospinal fluid and intracranial pressure, making CAIs an important therapeutic option for
managing intracranial hypertension (Aslam & Gupta, 2022).

Adverse effects of CAIs include changes in taste, fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, blurred vision, tinnitus,
paresthesia, rash, and headache. Serious adverse effects include hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis, aplastic anemia,
fulminant hepatic necrosis, and nephrolithiasis. CAIs are contraindicated in clients with hepatic disease, in those
with certain electrolytes imbalances--such as hypokalemia and hyponatremia--and in those with hypersensitivity to
the drug or its components (Aslam & Gupta, 2022).

     SAFETY ALERT

 Aspirin and Acetazolamide

  Caution is advised for client's receiving concomitant high-dose aspirin and acetazolamide, as anorexia,
  tachypnea, lethargy, metabolic acidosis, and death have been reported.

     Osmotic Diuretics
     Osmotic diuretics are a class of drugs that primarily function by inhibiting the reabsorption of water in the proximal
     convoluted tubule, the descending loop of Henle, and the collecting duct, all of which are regions of the kidney that
     are highly permeable to water. In addition to this mechanism, osmotic diuretics also extract water from the
     intracellular compartments, thereby increasing extracellular fluid volume, which results in a reduction in edema.
     Adverse effects include dehydration, heart failure due to the shift of free water, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and
     hypocalcemia. Osmotic diuretics are contraindicated in clients with anuria due to renal disease, pulmonary edema,
     severe dehydration, progressive heart failure, and in those with hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its compounds
     (Tenny et al., 2022). More information on this topic is included in Diuretic Drugs.

     Mannitol administration preparation should include inspecting the injection for particulate matter, discoloration, or
     crystallization before and periodically during administration. Discard the mannitol solution if particulates,
     crystallization, or discoloration are present.

     Mannitol is the most prescribed osmotic diuretic indicated for decreasing cerebral edema. Table 12.16 is a drug
     prototype table for osmotic diuretics featuring mannitol. It lists drug class, mechanism of action, adult dosage,
     indications, therapeutic effects, drug and food interactions, adverse effects, and contraindications.

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients who are receiving mannitol or other intracranial emergency drugs:

· Before administering, assess the client's medical history, current drug list, and allergies.
· Administer the drug as prescribed by the health care provider.
· Observe and report symptoms of cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension to the health care provider.

   These symptoms include headache, confusion, dizziness, convulsions, unconsciousness, bradycardia, or
   failure of the pupils to react to light.
· Monitor laboratory tests to detect for possible complications of these drugs such as metabolic acidosis and
   electrolyte imbalances as hypo/hypernatremia and hypo/hyperkalemia.
· Monitor intake and output as well as urinary output in response to diuresis.
· Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client
   teaching guidelines.
378  12 · Anticonvulsant Drugs and Drugs to Treat Epilepsy, Migraine Headaches, and Intracranial Emergencies

     CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

     If alert and oriented, the client receiving an emergency drug should:

         · Be aware of signs of decreased intracranial pressure and cerebral edema, such as decreased confusion,
             improved coordination, decreased blood pressure, and increased urine output.

         · Report symptoms of fluid retention including swelling in legs and feet, weight gain, and shortness of
             breath to their health care provider as these may represent an adverse reaction to the drug.

     The client taking an intracranial emergency drug should not:

         · Stop taking the drug unless directed by their health care provider, as this drug class may cause fluid shifts
             within the body resulting in shortness of breath, peripheral edema, and bradycardia.

13.5 CNS Stimulants and Nonstimulants
INTRODUCTION Nursing care of clients includes physical, spiritual, cultural, psychosocial, and psychological care.
Many clients the nurse will work with will have current or past mental health issues that need to be considered when
addressing their needs. Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how
we think, feel, and act and also determines how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices.
When an individual is diagnosed with a mental illness, nonpharmacologic therapies such as counseling or therapy
often are used in combination with pharmacologic agents. Psychopharmacology is the use of psychotropic
medications (drugs that affect mood, behaviors, thoughts, and perceptions) to treat mental illness. Psychotropic
drugs target miscellaneous neurotransmitters and/or their receptors for effect. Drugs are mainly used to mitigate
clinical manifestations of a psychological process. This chapter will focus on several of the common mental health
disorders and their management.

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 13.1.1 Identify the characteristics of drugs used to treat depression.
         · 13.1.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of drugs used to treat

             depression.
         · 13.1.3 Describe nursing implications of drugs used to treat depression.
         · 13.1.4 Explain the client education related to drugs used to treat depression.

     Depression is an affective disorder in which the person experiences feelings of sadness, anger, frustration,
     hopelessness, and helplessness. Although most individuals can feel this way at any point in their lives, genuine
     clinical depressive symptoms significantly interfere with daily life over a sustained period. This condition does not
     discriminate and can affect all ages, races, sexes, and genders. According to the American Psychiatric Association
     (2022), the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) is having five or more symptoms present during
     the same 2-week period, and it represents a change from previous function. At least one of the symptoms is either
     depressed mood most of the day nearly every day or loss of interest or pleasure. Other depressive symptoms
     include significant changes in weight or appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, observable psychomotor agitation or
     retardation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or excessive and/or inappropriate guilt, diminished ability to think or
     concentrate, difficulty with decision making, and recurrent thoughts of death. Additionally, the symptoms cause
     clinically significant distress or impairment and are not in response to a significant loss, a medical condition, or the
     effects of substance use.

     The pathophysiology of depression is not well understood. Clients may need to try different medications before
     finding one that improves their symptoms with the fewest side effects. Research is ongoing to better understand the
     biochemical changes that occur with depression and, accordingly, which antidepressant medications are the most
     effective. Nurses who work with clients taking these medications should monitor current research and clinical
     guidelines for the most up-to-date findings and recommendations.

       SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

       Racial and Ethnic Considerations

       Studies have shown there are differences in antidepressant responses in populations of color. These differences
       are mainly related to genetic or ethnic variations in the cytochrome P450 enzyme system responsible for the
       metabolism of most drugs.

           · Black clients tend to have higher plasma drug levels for a given dose, respond more rapidly, experience a
               higher incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), and metabolize tricyclic antidepressants more slowly
               than White clients.

           · Asian clients metabolize antidepressants more slowly than White clients. Based on current studies, Asian
               clients are generally considered to not metabolize antidepressants as quickly as clients from other racial
               and ethnic backgrounds. Metabolism is important for preparing the drug for excretion. If metabolism is
               inadequate, the drug accumulates in the plasma, and elevated drug levels induce toxicity.

       (Source: Marazziti et al., 2021)

     Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)

     Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) were introduced in the late 1950s. For decades, these were the drugs of choice to
     treat depression. Although they have been very effective over the years, they have some serious adverse drug
     reactions (ADRs), including cardiotoxicity. Therefore, today they are considered second-line drugs. If a client was
     able to tolerate a TCA in the past and it was effective, this may be the basis for selecting a TCA over a different class.

     Tricyclic antidepressants, in low doses, are frequently used for other indications, such as neuropathy and insomnia.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Tricyclic antidepressants block acetylcholine (muscarinic) receptors; therefore, blurred vision, dry mouth,

constipation, and urine retention are common due to the anticholinergic properties. In addition, because they block
histamine receptors, sedation and weight gain occur. Due to the blockade of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, sedation
and hypotension are common adverse effects. TCAs decrease vagal influence on the heart secondary to muscarinic
blockade and act directly on the bundle of His to slow conduction. These drugs decrease the seizure threshold due
to the blocking of ion channels, which can lead to the occurrence of seizures. Clients with a seizure disorder may
need a dose increase for their antiseizure medication. Glaucoma is a contraindication because the anticholinergic
properties can increase intraocular pressure (IOP).

Medications that lower the seizure threshold may increase the risk of seizures in clients taking TCAs. Concurrent use
of TCAs with other anticholinergic and central nervous system (CNS) depressant drugs can worsen those effects.
Certain antipsychotics can increase amitriptyline concentrations, and use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)
should be separated by 2 weeks due to the risk for serotonin syndrome (described in the following section).
Because TCAs can prolong the heart's QTc interval, use with caution in clients who have bradycardia, who are taking
drugs that can induce bradycardia, or who have electrolyte abnormalities that could result in a life-threatening
dysrhythmia.

Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most commonly prescribed antidepressants. All are indicated
386  13 · Psychopharmacologic Drugs

     for major depression. Several of these medications are also prescribed "off-label" for other psychiatric disorders,
     meaning the prescriber is using them for purposes other than what they were approved for by the Food and Drug
     Administration (FDA) but still based upon scientific rationale (Van Norman, 2023). Normally, the actions of serotonin
     are terminated by active reuptake back into the nerve terminals from which it was released. By inhibiting the
     reuptake pump, the SSRIs cause serotonin to accumulate in the synaptic space. SSRIs have little effect on other
     neurotransmitters and accordingly cause fewer adverse effects (Chu & Wadhwa, 2023). The most common SSRIs
     include:

         · Citalopram: This drug is FDA approved only for major depression; however, it is used off-label for other
             conditions.

         · Paroxetine: In addition to major depression, this drug is used for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic
             disorder, social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and
             premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).

         · Fluoxetine: This drug is used for major depression, OCD, panic disorder, PMDD, and bulimia nervosa.
             Fluoxetine does not block receptors for histamine, NE, or acetylcholine; therefore, the drug does not cause
             sedation, orthostatic hypotension, anticholinergic effects, or cardiotoxicity.

         · Sertraline hydrochloride: This is FDA approved for major depression, PMDD, OCD, PTSD, social anxiety
             disorder, and panic disorder.

         · Escitalopram: This drug is FDA approved for GAD in addition to the indications listed for fluoxetine.

     Table 13.2 lists common SSRIs and typical routes and dosing for adult and pediatric clients.

     Drug                             Routes and Dosage Ranges

     Citalopram    Adults: Initial dose: 20 mg/day orally; maximum dose: 40 mg/day.
      (Celexa)     Older adults (>60 years): 20 mg orally daily.

     Escitalopram  Adults: 10 mg/day orally; may increase to maximum dose of 20 mg/day after a minimum of 1
       (Lexapro)   week of therapy.
                   Adolescents 12-17 years: 10 mg/day orally; may increase to maximum dose of 20 mg/day if
                   symptoms do not lessen within 3 weeks of therapy.

     Fluoxetine    Adults:
      (Prozac)     Immediate-release capsules: 20 mg orally once daily in the morning; may increase after several
                   weeks if necessary; maximum dose: 80 mg/day.
                   Delayed-release capsules: 90 mg orally weekly, starting 7 days after the last 20 mg immediate
                   dose.
                   Adolescents 12-17 years:
                   Immediate-release capsules: 10 mg/day orally; may increase to 20 mg/day after 1 week if
                   necessary.

     Paroxetine    Adults:
       (Paxil)     Immediate-release tablets: 20 mg orally once daily in the morning; increase dose at 1-week

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Sexual dysfunction is one main reason why clients may elect to stop taking SSRIs. Impotence, delayed or absent
     ejaculation or orgasm, and decreased libido can be side effects of these medications. This can be managed in
     several ways: reduction of the dose, taking drug holidays, or adding a drug that can overcome the problem. Weight
     gain can occur due to the decreased sensitivity of serotonin receptors that regulate appetite.

     MAOIs and fluoxetine should be separated at least 5 weeks apart to prevent serotonin syndrome. The remaining

SSRIs and MAOIs should be separated by 2 weeks. This is due to the long half-life of fluoxetine. Serotonin syndrome
is characterized by altered mental status, anxiety, hallucinations, hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, hyperreflexia,
diaphoresis, and tremor. Tramadol also can increase the risk of serotonin syndrome when combined with SSRIs. The
syndrome will resolve spontaneously after the drug(s) have been stopped.

Fluoxetine and other SSRIs can increase the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding either by impeding platelet
aggregation or by increasing gastric acidity (Edinoff et al., 2022). These drugs can increase the risk for bleeding, so
caution needs to be exercised for clients taking aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and
anticoagulants because these can further the risk of bleeding. Fluoxetine also has CNS stimulant effects, which can
cause insomnia and anxiety.

     Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors

     Besides blocking norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) have
     minimal effects on other transmitters or receptors. SNRIs increase the levels of serotonin and NE in the brain, which
     play an important role in mood. These drugs can also weakly inhibit dopamine reuptake. Pharmacological effects are
     similar to the SSRIs. The most common SNRIs are:

         · Venlafaxine: Used in major depression, panic disorder, social phobia, and GAD
         · Duloxetine: Used for MDD, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, GAD, social anxiety, panic

             disorder, and chronic musculoskeletal pain in adults; used for depression, GAD, and fibromyalgia in children
         · Levomilnacipran: FDA approved only for major depression but used off-label for GAD and chronic pain

             disorder

     Table 13.4 lists common SNRIs and typical routes and dosing for adult and pediatric clients.

     Drug                             Routes and Dosage Ranges

     Venlafaxine  Adults: Initial dose: 37.5 mg/day (extended release) or 25-50 mg divided into 2-3 doses
       (Effexor)  (immediate release) for 1 week; increase daily dose no faster than 75 mg every 4 days until
                  desired response is optimal; maximum dose: 225 mg/day.

     Duloxetine   MDD in adults: Initial dose: 40 mg/day orally in 2 doses; can increase to 60 mg/day in 1-2

     TABLE 13.4 Drug Emphasis Table: Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (source: https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/)

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Similar to most SSRIs, SNRIs should not be taken until the client has stopped taking MAOIs for at least 14 days. This
     is to decrease the risk of serotonin syndrome.

     Neonatal syndrome can occur when duloxetine is taken late in pregnancy. This syndrome is characterized by
     irritability, high-pitched cry, tremor, respiratory distress, and possible seizures in the neonate.

     Use with caution for clients who have bipolar disorder, unless they are treated with a concomitant mood-stabilizing
     agent.

     SNRIs have the potential to increase blood pressure; therefore, anyone with uncontrolled hypertension should avoid
     this class of drugs. Unwanted effects of insomnia, decreased appetite, increased blood pressure, and urinary
     retention can occur when the levels of serotonin and NE become elevated in certain parts of the brain and periphery
     that play no role in inducing the therapeutic effects.

Norepinephrine Dopamine Reuptake Inhibitors

Norepinephrine dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs) inhibit the reuptake of dopamine, NE, and serotonin. Several
metabolites are active, giving this class a prolonged duration of action. The most common drug in this class is
bupropion hydrochloride (Aplenzin, Wellbutrin, Zyban). It is used for depression, seasonal affective disorder (SAD),
and smoking cessation and as an adjunct to other antidepressants if the client did not obtain a full therapeutic
response with them.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
NDRIs have several CNS stimulant effects including agitation, anxiety, excitement, increased motor activity, and
restlessness. These effects usually occur during the first few days of treatment. (The client may require a sedative
for the first few days.) These effects occur because this drug is similar in structure to amphetamines. These effects
also could potentially increase the risk of misuse.

The dose must be reduced with any impaired hepatic or renal function. Clients should be screened for bipolar
disorder before starting therapy to prevent mania or hypomania. When the drug is being used for smoking cessation,
it can cause neuropsychiatric adverse effects. Postmarketing reports include serious or clinically significant changes
in mood (including depression and mania), psychosis, hallucinations, paranoia, delusions, homicidal ideation,
aggression, hostility, agitation, anxiety, and panic as well as suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and death by suicide
390  13 · Psychopharmacologic Drugs

     (DailyMed, Bupropion, 2023). This drug should be used cautiously in clients with a history of psychosis.

     Unlike other antidepressants, this class does not cause sexual dysfunction or orthostatic hypotension.

     A higher incidence of seizures was observed in clients being treated with the immediate-release formulation who
     have a current or past diagnosis of anorexia or bulimia nervosa. In addition, clients with a history of seizure
     disorders may need their drug dosages modified because bupropion decreases the seizure threshold and could
     trigger seizure activity.

     The SSRIs listed in Table 13.2 inhibit the metabolism of bupropion; therefore, bupropion levels are increased, which
     increases the risk of seizures. MAOIs can increase the risk for bupropion toxicity as well as increase the risk of
     hypertensive crisis. Clients should discontinue MAOIs at least 2 weeks before starting bupropion.

     Table 13.6 is a drug prototype table for NDRIs featuring bupropion hydrochloride. It lists drug class, mechanism of
     action, adult dosage, indications, therapeutic effects, drug and food interactions, adverse effects, and
     contraindications.

     Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors

     Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are third-line agents for treating depression. MAOIs are not often used in
     practice today, mainly because of the numerous food and drug interactions that produce severe hypertension. Blood
     pressure could be elevated enough to cause a stroke or myocardial infarction. MAOIs are used when other
     antidepressants have been unsuccessful. The most common MAOIs are:

     · Phenelzine sulfate: Used to treat major depression.
     · Selegiline hydrochloride: This is the first and only transdermal treatment for major depression. It is a potent

        irreversible MAOI with a great affinity for MAO-B in the brain at therapeutic doses. At higher doses, the drug
        becomes nonselective and can inhibit both MAO-A and MAO-B. It increases dopaminergic activity by
        interfering with dopamine reuptake at the synapse.

Table 13.7 lists common MAOIs and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

Drug                Routes and Dosage Ranges

Phenelzine sulfate  15 mg orally 3 times daily; maximum dose: 90 mg/day.
       (Nardil)

Selegiline          6 mg/24 hours transdermally; may titrate based on clinical response in increments of 3

(Emsam)             mg/day every 2 weeks; maximum dose: 12 mg/24 hours.

TABLE 13.7 Drug Emphasis Table: Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (source: https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/)

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
MAOIs are contraindicated in older adults due to their high risk of diminished hepatic, renal, and cardiac function.

Tyramine is a monoamine precursor of NE. Normally, tyramine is deactivated in the GI tract and liver by the
monoamine oxidase enzyme to avoid large amounts reaching the systemic circulation. Because these drugs block
the monoamine oxidase enzyme, tyramine is absorbed systemically. It is transported to the adrenergic nerve
terminals, where it causes a sudden release of significant amounts of NE. This NE activates the sympathetic nervous
system.

The antidepressants listed here can increase the risk of serotonin syndrome. Vasoconstrictors and
sympathomimetics can intensify the hypertensive effect. The use of opioids and MAOIs can result in hyperpyrexia
(high fever). Caffeine can also exacerbate the CNS stimulatory effect. Blood glucose levels may decrease with
MAOIs, resulting in hypoglycemic effects. In addition, MAOIs can enhance insulin receptor sensitivity, compounding
the hypoglycemic state. A decrease in dosage may be necessary.

Table 13.8 is a drug prototype table for MAOIs featuring phenelzine sulfate. It lists drug class, mechanism of action,
adult dosage, indications, therapeutic effects, drug and food interactions, adverse effects, and contraindications.

     Miscellaneous Antidepressants

     Some drugs work just as well for depressive symptoms but do not fit into the criteria of other drug classes. They
     include:

     · Mirtazapine: Used to treat major depressive disorder.
     · Trazodone hydrochloride: This drug is a serotonin 2 antagonist/reuptake inhibitor. It increases the amount of

        serotonin available. It is more frequently used for sedation and sleep than for depression. High doses are
        needed for antidepressant effects; however, these doses cause significant sedation. The drug is often
        concurrently administered with a stimulating antidepressant such as bupropion.
     · Vortioxetine: Increases the release of several neurotransmitters (serotonin, NE, dopamine, glutamate,
        acetylcholine, and histamine). In addition, it reduces the release of GABA, a neurotransmitter that inhibits
        mood-related neurotransmitters, through three different modes of action.

TABLE 13.9 Drug Emphasis Table: Miscellaneous Antidepressants (source: https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/)

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
The antihistamine effects of mirtazapine and trazodone hydrochloride cause sedation and weight gain.
Agranulocytosis is an identified adverse effect. If a client experiences generalized malaise, chills, fever, or myalgia,
similar to the flu, this may indicate a low white blood cell (WBC) count. The provider should be notified. Because
mirtazapine is associated with significant weight gain, clients should be weighed prior to starting the drug to
determine their body mass index (BMI). If they are deemed to have overweight or obesity, it is important to identify
whether the client is prediabetic or diabetic and/or dyslipidemic. If so, clients should be treated or referred for
therapy.

Any of the miscellaneous antidepressants can cause a fatal serotonin syndrome when combined with MAOIs. Do not
use with MAOIs or within 14 days after they have been discontinued. Drugs such as benzodiazepines, opioids, and
antihistamines can increase the sedative properties.

     Nursing Implications
     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking antidepressants:

     · Obtain orders for baseline testing prior to the client starting the medication and continue during treatment to
        monitor for side effects: an electrocardiogram for clients over age 50 and lab work (complete blood count
        [CBC], electrolytes, lipid panel, liver function tests, and HgbA1C). If client is on anticoagulants, such as
        warfarin, monitor PT/INR frequently.

     · Obtain baseline weight and body mass index (BMI) and monitor throughout treatment.
     · Monitor blood pressure and heart rate twice weekly during treatment.
     · Monitor for signs and symptoms of mania or hypomania.
     · Check mood and anxiety periodically during treatment.
     · Monitor for seizure activity.
     · Ensure safety precautions are in place due to sedation.
     · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

        teaching guidelines.

     CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

        effects.
    · Be informed about the high probability of sexual dysfunction and told to report any problems so they can

        be appropriately addressed.
    · Immediately notify their provider about any clinical manifestations of increased depression or suicidal

        ideations.
    · Contact their provider with signs of diabetes, such as increased thirst (polydipsia), extreme hunger

        (polyphagia), or increased urination (polyuria).
    · Report signs of sore throat and/or fever.
    · Assess for any signs of bleeding such as blood in urine (hematuria); dark, tarry stools; easy bruising;

        nosebleed (epistaxis); or bleeding gums.
    · Notify their provider if there are any signs of liver disease, such as right upper quadrant pain, light-colored

        stools, and dark urine.

The client taking an antidepressant should not:

    · Drive or engage in activities that require alertness until the effects of the medication are known.
    · Eat foods high in tyramine (milk, turkey, chicken, oats, seeds, soy products, seafood, canned tuna, aged

        cheeses, brewer's yeast, whole-wheat bread) if using an MAOI.
    · Be in direct sunlight without appropriate clothing and sunscreen.
    · Take aspirin or NSAIDs.

FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

Antidepressants

In short-term trials, antidepressant use for major depressive disorder increased the risk of suicidal thoughts and
behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults under age 24 when compared to placebos. These trials did
not show an increase in the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior in individuals over age 24. There was a
reduction in risk with antidepressant use in individuals ages 65 and older.

        CASE STUDY

Read the following clinical scenario to answer the questions that follow.

Jadalyn Sanchez is a 21-year-old female student who arrives at the university's student health center with
complaints of frequent crying throughout the day and lack of motivation or interest in being with friends or engaging
in activities she used to enjoy. She describes a sense of helplessness and inadequacy at school. Jadalyn states it
takes everything for her to get out of bed to attend classes. She has had no appetite and lost 12 pounds over the
past month. She reports that her symptoms have been present for approximately 6 weeks. She denies any recent or
past traumatic events or losses. She reports occasional dating but currently is not in any committed relationship.
She is sexually active and states that she is compliant with her prescribed oral contraceptives. She denies tobacco
or illicit drug use and says she drinks two or three 6 oz glasses of wine on the weekends. She does not recall being
this sad in the past. She states normally she is very active, meets all due dates, and takes her academics very
seriously. Her roommate talked her into coming to the center because of the drastic change.

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 13.2.1 Identify the characteristics of drugs used to treat psychosis.
         · 13.2.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, contraindications, and interactions of drugs

             used to treat psychosis.
         · 13.2.3 Describe nursing implications for drugs used to treat psychosis.
         · 13.2.4 Explain the client education related to drugs used to treat psychosis.

     Psychosis is a collection of symptoms that include some level of disconnection with reality. These symptoms can
     include hallucinations, paranoid thoughts, and illogical thinking. Psychosis can be a symptom of a mental
     illness--most commonly schizophrenia. It can also be a symptom of bipolar disorder or severe depression. Psychotic
     disorders are generally known to have a strong genetic component. The onset of psychotic symptoms can begin
     either gradually or quickly. Initial symptoms are commonly seen during adolescence or young adulthood (National
     Institute of Mental Health [NIMH], 2023c). Psychosis can also develop later in life with neurological conditions such
     as dementia or be caused by sleep deprivation, certain medications, or alcohol/substance use.

     Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder characterized by disorganized thought processes, blunted or
     inappropriate emotional responses, and bizarre behavior. In addition, it may involve social withdrawal (asociality)
     by the affected person. Eventually individuals begin to deteriorate and demonstrate a lack of self-care and
     interpersonal skills. Symptoms of schizophrenia are classified as either positive, referring to an excess of distortion
     of normal function (e.g., hallucinations), or negative, meaning diminishing or absent behaviors related to motivation

or expression (Correll & Schooler, 2020). Schizophrenia is diagnosed with at least two of the following symptoms
present (American Psychiatric Association, 2022). At least one of the symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations,
or disorganized speech. Other possible symptoms include disorganized or catatonic behavior (catatonia) or negative
symptoms (diminished emotional expression or avolition). Research suggests that clients with schizophrenia have
abnormal neurotransmission systems--primarily the dopaminergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic systems. It is
believed that positive symptoms are associated with overactivity of dopamine2 (D2) receptors in the basal ganglia,
hypothalamus, limbic system, brainstem, and medulla. It is theorized underactive dopamine1 (D1) receptors in the
prefrontal cortex account for the negative symptoms.

  SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

  Schizophrenia in Children

      · Schizophrenia in children often presents with more intense clinical manifestations and has a more chronic
          course.

      · The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry has established current practice guidelines
          that advocate for high-quality assessment of the child who is receiving antipsychotics. The purpose of the
          guidelines is to promote the appropriate use of antipsychotics and to enhance safety. Today, multiple
          antipsychotics have specific dosing for children and adolescents. These parents' medication guides
          (https://openstax.org/r/aacap) may be helpful for client education.

      · Regulating medication dosing for children is challenging. Children require lower doses to reach full
          therapeutic effects, yet they also metabolize medications more quickly.

This section of the chapter will focus on treating psychosis. Historically, first-generation or "typical" antipsychotic
agents were more effective in managing the positive symptoms versus the negative symptoms; however, the newer
second-generation "atypical" medications have shown effectiveness in treating both the positive and negative
symptoms. Antipsychotics are targeted at thought processes rather than affective states. Although they are not a
cure, they can help both adult and pediatric clients be able to adequately function in a healthier manner. In acute
psychosis, the goal is to reduce symptoms in the first week and normalize clients' eating and sleeping patterns.
Subsequent goals are to increase the ability for self-care and increase socialization. Most of these drugs take 1-2
months to reach full therapeutic effects. With adequate drug treatment, clients can engage in individual or group
psychotherapy sessions as well as return to their level of functioning prior to the illness.

     SAFETY ALERT

 Beers Criteria®

  The Beers Criteria® for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older Adults is a list published by the
  American Geriatrics Society describing medications that are potentially harmful if prescribed to clients older than
  65 years. Antipsychotics are included on the list because they are linked to higher rates of cognitive decline and
  death in persons with dementia.

     CLINICAL TIP

 Antipsychotics

  First-generation antipsychotics are frequently referred to as "neuroleptics" because of the increased risk of
  producing extrapyramidal neurologic effects, including pseudoparkinsonism, dystonia (spasms of the tongue,
  back, legs, and neck), akathisia (not being able to sit still), and tardive dyskinesia (abnormal muscle
  movements). Health care providers should monitor clients for extrapyramidal effects so they can be treated and
  the antipsychotic medication can be changed (Ameer & Saadabadi, 2023).

Antipsychotics fit into the classification of dopamine receptor antagonists (blockers). They are used to treat
398  13 · Psychopharmacologic Drugs

     disorders that involve thought processes. They help clients with organizing their thoughts and responding
     appropriately to stimuli. The therapeutic effects are most likely due to blocking dopamine receptors. Unfortunately,
     these medications can also bind to a variety of receptors, which leads to many of the ADRs. Antipsychotics are
     categorized in two main classes: first-generation agents, also known as typical or conventional, and second-
     generation agents, also known as atypical. These categories are based on their mechanism of action (described in
     the following sections). Although their names may imply that psychosis is the only condition these drugs are used
     for, there are numerous psychiatric disorders for which these drugs can be useful.

     Clients should be made aware they will usually need to remain on these drugs for years, if not for life, because there
     is a high rate of relapse when drug therapy is stopped. Most antipsychotics come in an oral form. Those clients who
     are unable or unwilling to take daily doses may receive periodic injections of a long-acting form (LAIs). The benefit
     of the LAIs is that they allow prescribers to tailor pharmacotherapy to each client's needs. The LAIs are
     administered via depot injections. This refers to the way the drug is deposited and stored in the muscle before
     being absorbed. Because the drug takes a longer time to move out of the muscle and into the bloodstream, its
     action is prolonged.

     First-Generation (Typical) Antipsychotics

     First-generation antipsychotics are classified by their potency (strength). The level of potency (low, medium, or high)
     refers to the concentration of the drug needed to produce a given response. Keep in mind that this is different from
     efficacy. All first-generation agents have the same ability to relieve symptoms of psychosis (efficacy). In addition to
     blocking dopamine receptors, they also block muscarinic, histaminergic, and alpha-adrenergic receptors, leading to
     numerous adverse effects (discussed later in this chapter). The three most common first-generation antipsychotics
     are:

         · Chlorpromazine: This is a low-potency agent and a phenothiazine. It is also used to decrease preoperative
             restlessness and apprehension, treat intermittent porphyria, as an adjunct in the treatment of tetanus, and to
             help control nausea, vomiting, and intractable hiccups.

         · Fluphenazine: This is a high-potency agent and a phenothiazine. Compared to other antipsychotics, this drug
             has a low potential for causing anticholinergic effects. It is available in oral and intramuscular forms.

         · Haloperidol: This is a high-potency nonphenothiazine. It is frequently used to treat acute psychiatric situations
             when it is given intramuscularly. Its mechanism of action, ADRs, and contraindications are the same as for
             chlorpromazine. An added contraindication is severe mental depression.

     clients.

                be increased by 20-50 mg until client becomes calm.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Most of the ADRs are related to these drugs' anticholinergic properties, including blurred vision, dry mouth,
constipation, urine retention, nasal congestion, and photophobia. Arrhythmias can be caused by the dopamine-
blocking effects or prolongation of the QTc interval, which could lead to fatal arrhythmias. Prolactin levels will
increase, causing gynecomastia and changes in libido. First-generation antipsychotics are known to cause
extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), which are involuntary, uncontrollable movements. These include
pseudoparkinsonism (muscle tremors, cogwheel rigidity, stiff facial muscles, drooling due to difficulty swallowing,
shuffling gait, and slow movements), dystonia, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia. Extrapyramidal symptoms may be
more problematic with depot injections.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare but potentially fatal condition that can develop with antipsychotic
use. The clinical manifestations include a sudden high-grade fever, fluctuations in blood pressure, dysrhythmias,
extreme muscle rigidity, and significant tachycardia. Immediate supportive management must be instituted if this
develops, which might include cooling blankets/fluids and administering antipyretics (drugs to reduce fever),
antiarrhythmics, and dantrolene to treat muscle rigidity.

The manifestations of Parkinson's disease can be exacerbated by antipsychotics due to their effect on dopamine
receptors. This can happen with any antipsychotic that causes EPS. In addition, these drugs can cause urinary
retention and constipation. Individuals who have a mechanical or neurological obstruction of the renal or GI system
should avoid these drugs, including those with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

Due to their anticholinergic properties, these drugs can increase intraocular pressure, worsening glaucoma and
possibly causing vision loss. Furthermore, those with a seizure disorder may need an increase in their antiseizure
medications because the antipsychotics tend to lower the seizure threshold.

Alcohol intake and taking medications that cause CNS depression will amplify the depressant effect.

     Second-Generation (Atypical) Antipsychotics

     The second-generation antipsychotics, also known as atypical antipsychotics, are the drugs of choice. This is
     especially true for clients who are newly diagnosed. The atypical antipsychotics block both dopamine and serotonin
     receptors. This class of antipsychotics has a broader range of action than the first-generation agents because of
     their effects on the serotonergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic systems. They seem to be more effective in
     relieving some symptoms and usually produce milder adverse effects (Ameer & Sadabadi, 2023). The most common
     second-generation antipsychotics are:

     · Aripiprazole: This is the first of a new class of atypical antipsychotic medications called the dopamine system

       stabilizers. This class is sometimes referred to as a third-generation antipsychotic. In its oral form,
        aripiprazole can be used in the management of schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder,
        irritability related to autism spectrum disorder, and Tourette syndrome. In its injectable, immediate-release
        form, it is used to treat agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar mania. This drug does not prolong
        the QTc interval; however, the FDA has issued a safety alert, confirming that compulsive or uncontrollable
        urges to gamble, binge eat, shop, and have sex with multiple partners have been reported.
    · Cariprazine: Used to treat schizophrenia or mania and depression related to bipolar disorder. It is also used to
        treat MDD.
    · Clozapine: This medication was one of the first atypical antipsychotic medications used to treat schizophrenia,
        but because of its side effects, is only used when other treatments have failed. Clozapine is available only
        through to the FDA's Approved Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) program to ensure monitoring
        of WBC count and absolute neutrophil count.
    · Lurasidone: Used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar depression in clients age 13 and older. Administering this
        drug with food can greatly increase its absorption. This drug does not prolong the QTc interval, cause
        orthostatic hypotension, or have any cholinergic effects.
    · Olanzapine: In addition to treating schizophrenia, this drug is used for manic or mixed episodes of bipolar
        disorder and can be given parenterally to treat acute agitation.
    · Paliperidone: Used in clients age 12 and over to treat schizoaffective disorders. This is a major active
        metabolite of risperidone; therefore, it has the same therapeutic and adverse effect profiles. Paliperidone is
        available in three forms: one short-acting oral and two long-acting injectables (one administered monthly and
        the other every 3 months).
    · Quetiapine: Used to treat schizophrenia and depressive disorder as well as for short-term treatment of acute
        manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder. The extended-release form is for use only in adults.
    · Risperidone: Used to treat schizophrenia and acute bipolar mania. It is also frequently used to manage
        irritability and aggression associated with autism spectrum disorder in children and adolescents. In
        schizophrenia, relief of positive and negative symptoms can occur in as little as 1 week.
    · Ziprasidone: Indicated for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     For second-generation antipsychotics, the risk of seizures is higher as the drug dose increases. Hematologic effects
     include agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and fatal agranulocytosis. Clozapine is subject to additional monitoring
     through the FDA's REMS program to decrease the risk of severe neutropenia. Metabolic effects are more common
     with these medications and include hyperglycemia and weight gain. Concerning ADRs for quetiapine include
     increased systolic and diastolic readings, decreased high-density cholesterol, and increased total cholesterol, low-
     density cholesterol, and triglycerides.

     Drugs with anticholinergic properties will potentiate these effects of clozapine. Alcohol can increase the sedative
     effect. Cimetidine and caffeine can increase the risk of toxicity for clozapine.

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking antipsychotics:

· Watch carefully for developmental progress in children.
· Monitor for symptoms of schizophrenia.
· Obtain baseline physical assessment and relevant tests including an electrocardiogram, CBC, electrolytes,

   liver and renal function tests, lipid panel, blood glucose levels, and thyroid function. Continue to monitor these
   on an ongoing basis to identify potential adverse effects.
· Obtain baseline vital signs and urinary output.
· Monitor weight for weight gain, agitation, and/or sleep disturbances.
· Evaluate for the potential effects of hyperprolactinemia (high levels of the hormone prolactin in the blood).
· Assess for any anticholinergic effects. Promote comfort measures if necessary, such as laxatives or
   catheterization.
· Measure the PR and QTc interval at baseline and during the use of thioridazine or ziprasidone.
· Obtain a detailed history for any cardiovascular conditions, glaucoma, diabetes, obstructions, seizure disorder,
   pregnancy (or thinking about getting pregnant), and breastfeeding.
· Ensure the client is not a danger to themselves or others.
· Auscultate bowel sounds every 4 hours if client is an inpatient. The constipation caused by clozapine is
   significant and can progress to intestinal ischemia and necrotizing colitis.
· To prevent any unnecessary stress, explain gynecomastia and the reason it occurs.
· Assess CNS alertness and orientation and provide safety precautions when necessary.
· Assess for any extrapyramidal effects and provide safety measures.
· Ensure client receives an annual eye exam to monitor for glaucoma or worsening of glaucoma.
· Care for the client in a holistic manner, such as proper nutrition, adequate hygiene, activity level, and social
404  13 · Psychopharmacologic Drugs

          interactions.
      · With acute psychotic episodes, observe for decreased agitation, combativeness, and psychomotor activity to

          evaluate therapeutic effectiveness.
      · Observe for decreased psychotic behaviors, such as decreased hallucinations and delusions.
      · Ensure clozapine does not get stopped abruptly because it will cause acute psychosis. This drug should be

          tapered over a 2-week period.
      · For clients taking clozapine, perform a thorough assessment of their cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary

          status.
      · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

          teaching guidelines.

     CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

     The client taking an antipsychotic should:

         · Drink adequate amounts of water (at least 64 ounces/day or other prescribed amount), especially during
             hot weather.

         · Have a total understanding that full therapeutic effects will not occur immediately; it may take several
             weeks to be able to experience effects.

         · Obtain weekly blood tests to determine safe and effective dosage.
         · Lie down for 30-60 minutes after an IM injection to prevent hypotension.
         · Take the oral form 1-2 hours prior to bedtime because the drug peaks in 2 hours.
         · Wear protective clothing when out in the sun.
         · Report dark urine, right upper quadrant pain, clay-colored stools, and yellowing of the eyes or skin to the

             provider.
         · Notify the health care provider if sore throat, fever, or flu-like symptoms arise.
         · If needed, take the drug with food to decrease gastric upset.
         · Increase fluid intake, dietary fiber, and exercise to prevent constipation.
         · Be aware that only 1 week of medicine will be dispensed at a time (clozapine).
         · Immediately notify the provider if having difficulty moving their bowels. The provider may need to

             prescribe a stool softener.
         · Practice frequent hand hygiene and wear a mask in public if white blood cell count is low to decrease risk

             of infection.
         · Practice good oral care and rinse mouth frequently or chew on sugarless gum to manage symptoms of dry

             mouth.
         · Monitor for extrapyramidal symptoms and notify the provider if they occur.

     The client taking an antipsychotic should not:

         · Allow the liquid concentrations to touch the skin because it can cause contact dermatitis.
         · Quickly change positions due to orthostatic hypotension.
         · Drive a vehicle or operate heavy machinery due to dizziness and sedation.

13.3 Mood Stabilizers

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 13.3.1 Identify the characteristics of drugs used to treat bipolar disorder.
    · 13.3.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, contraindications, and interactions of drugs

        used to treat bipolar disorder.
    · 13.3.3 Describe nursing implications for drugs used to treat bipolar disorder.
    · 13.3.4 Explain the client education related to drugs used to treat bipolar disorder.

Bipolar disorder is a complex brain-based illness with a primary characteristic of mood disturbance. Clients
alternate between episodes of depression and mania. Depression was described in the beginning of this chapter.
Mania involves a period of abnormally and persistently elevated or irritable mood and increased goal-directed
activity or energy (American Psychiatric Association, 2022). During this period, at least three of the following
symptoms are present: grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, more talkative, flight of ideas or racing thoughts,
distractibility, increased activity or agitation, and excessive involvement in risky behaviors.

Most times, clients seek help when they are in the depressed stage. However, if a client has an undiagnosed bipolar
disorder, putting them solely on an antidepressant can cause the client to experience one or more manic phases.
There are two main subtypes of this disorder. Bipolar Type 1 is characterized by the occurrence of one or more
manic episodes interspersed with major depression. Bipolar Type 2 is characterized by occurrence of one or more
major depressive episodes accompanied by at least one manic or hypomanic episode (persistent irritability without
euphoria) (NIMH, 2023a).

Lithium

Lithium is a naturally occurring metallic salt. It is used mainly to treat and prevent mania. It has historically been the
"gold standard" mood stabilizer, effectively controlling manic episodes as well as decreasing the frequency and
intensity of manic cycles (Volkmann et al., 2020). Lithium has a narrow margin of safety; even small increases in the
dose could be toxic (Hedya et al., 2023). The goal is to initially maintain the serum lithium level between 0.6 and 1.2
mEq/L (Coryell, 2022). Target maintenance drug levels are closer to 0.6 mEq/L. Table 13.16 describes levels of
lithium toxicity.

Serum Drug Levels  Clinical Manifestations

1.5-2.5 mEq/L      Lethargy, tremors, nausea, and vomiting

2.5-3.5 mEq/L      Confusion, agitation, delirium, tachycardia, and hypertonia

>3.5 mEq/L         Coma, seizures, hyperthermia, and hypotension

TABLE 13.16 Adverse Reactions Related to Serum Levels of Lithium (source: Hedya et al., 2023)

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Lithium is excreted through the kidneys unchanged; therefore, adequate renal function is essential. Because lithium
is tied to sodium resorption, any drug that affects sodium balance may alter lithium concentrations, leading to either
treatment failure or toxicity. Examples include diuretics, NSAIDs, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitors. Lithium interacts with other medications including carbamazepine (CNS toxicity), neuromuscular blocking
agents (prolonged effects), and other serotonergic drugs (serotonin syndrome). Addison's disease is a
contraindication because the person is losing more sodium through the kidneys due to the lack of aldosterone. The
kidneys then will reabsorb lithium back into the bloodstream, which can quickly cause lithium toxicity. Lithium
inhibits the synthesis and release of thyroid hormones, resulting in hypothyroidism. Theophylline increases the renal
excretion of lithium, resulting in subtherapeutic effects.

Table 13.17 is a drug prototype table for mood stabilizers featuring lithium. It lists drug class, mechanism of action,
adult and pediatric dosage, indications, therapeutic effects, drug and food interactions, adverse effects, and
contraindications.

Nursing Implications

The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking mood stabilizers:

· Obtain baseline and periodic lab work including serum carbamazepine levels or serum lithium levels if
   indicated, CBC with differential, electrolytes, liver function tests, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)
   levels.

· Evaluate client's medical history and ensure there are no renal or cardiac concerns. Obtain a baseline
   electrocardiogram.

· Assess for any indication of suicidal ideations. Institute suicide precautions for at-risk clients.
· Monitor temperature, heart rate/rhythm, respiratory status, and blood pressure periodically.
· Assess orientation, affect, reflexes, bowel sounds, amount of urine output, and lung sounds.
· Monitor client's renal function while on lithium.
· If CNS effects occur, provide safety measures to prevent client injury.
· Monitor for decreased manic behavior and impulsivity.
· Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

   teaching guidelines.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking a mood stabilizer should:

    · Contact the health care provider with the first signs of rash if taking carbamazepine or lamotrigine.
    · Notify the health care provider with unusual and easy bruising, blood in the urine or stool, fever, sore

        throat, right upper quadrant pain, and jaundice.
    · Consider an additional or alternate form of contraception because carbamazepine decreases the

        effectiveness of certain hormonal contraceptives.
    · Drink 8-12 glasses of water daily to prevent dehydration, which could cause lithium toxicity. Also,

        maintain a consistent sodium intake.
    · Be aware they can take lithium with food if they experience gastric irritation.
    · Continue taking the medication as prescribed despite their symptoms subsiding because this type of

        therapy is long term.
    · Notify the health care provider and stop taking the drug immediately if manifestations of overdose occur

        (vomiting, diarrhea, ataxia, tremor, drowsiness, and muscle weakness).
    · Notify the health care provider if thinking about getting pregnant. Studies have shown that lithium can be
408  13 · Psychopharmacologic Drugs

               harmful to the fetus.
           · Follow the prescribed schedule for lab work to check appropriate serum drug levels.

       The client taking a mood stabilizer should not:

           · Spend time in the sun without sunscreen and other coverings.
           · Drive or perform tasks requiring alertness and coordination until effects of carbamazepine are known.
           · Increase their exercise routine during hot weather because this can increase the risk of dehydration and

               lithium toxicity.
           · Abruptly stop lithium, to avoid negative manifestations.
           · Take the morning dose of lithium until a blood sample has been obtained. (Blood should be drawn about

               12 hours after the last lithium dose.)
           · Alter dietary salt intake. If decreased, lithium toxicity can result. If increased, lithium will be

               subtherapeutic.

     13.4 Anxiolytics and Sedative-Hypnotics

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 13.4.1 Identify the characteristics of drugs used to treat anxiety and sleep disorders.
         · 13.4.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, contraindications, and interactions of drugs

             used to treat anxiety and sleep disorders.
         · 13.4.3 Describe nursing implications for drugs used to treat anxiety and sleep disorders.
         · 13.4.4 Explain the client education related to drugs used to treat anxiety and sleep disorders.

     Anxiety can be described as a feeling of nervousness, apprehension, and/or worry about a future threat. Anxiety
     disorders involve excessive fear and anxiety and corresponding behaviors (American Psychiatric Association, 2022).
     Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), social anxiety disorder,
     and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are examples of anxiety disorders. Anxiety is considered pathological if it
     is (1) disproportionate to events, (2) sustained over a significant time period, (3) significantly impairing function
     during usual activities of daily living, and (4) apparently unrelated to any identifiable event or situation. Pathological
     levels of anxiety require treatment and usually will not fully resolve without therapeutic intervention. Clinical
     manifestations of anxiety are related to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system response. These include
     muscle tension, restless feeling, trembling, difficulty concentrating, irritability, tachycardia, palpitations,
     diaphoresis, dry mouth, dyspnea, and dizziness. Untreated high levels of anxiety predispose people to other
     comorbidities, such as hypertension, substance use, or depression. These high levels can impair memory,
     perception, judgment, and motor responses.

     A simplistic explanation related to the pathophysiology of anxiety involves an excess of excitatory neurotransmitters
     (norepinephrine) or a deficiency of inhibitory neurotransmitters (GABA). Most of the medications known to improve
     symptoms of anxiety act directly or indirectly on the GABA system. Benzodiazepines are widely used for short-term
     treatment until the prescribed antidepressant reaches therapeutic levels. (Antidepressants were discussed earlier
     in the chapter.)

     Sleep is essential for body restoration. During sleep, tissue repair, synthesis of skeletal muscle protein, and
     secretion of growth hormone occur. Insomnia is the inability to obtain an adequate amount of sleep needed to
     function efficiently during the day. Insomnia may be situational, lasting a few days to a few weeks. Insomnia
     disorder, however, is defined as a significant inability to initiate sleep (sleep latency) or maintain sleep, or early
     morning awakening with the inability to return to sleep (American Psychiatric Association, 2022). The occurrence is
     at least 3 nights/week and is present for at least 1 month and may persist for longer than 3 months. Insomnia
     disorder leads to increased morbidity (such as psychosis) and mortality. Many clients with insomnia have high rates
     of depression and anxiety.

     Drug therapy includes benzodiazepines and the nonbenzodiazepine sedatives. Anxiolytics (antianxiety drugs) and
     sedative-hypnotics (drugs to invoke relaxation and produce sleep) are CNS depressants that have similar effects.
     The difference between the effects depends largely on the dose. Large doses of antianxiety and sedative-hypnotic

13.4 · Anxiolytics and Sedative-Hypnotics                                                                              409

agents produce sleep, and small doses of sedative-hypnotics have anxiolytic or sedative effects.

Benzodiazepines

Benzodiazepines are usually prescribed on a short-term basis for disabling anxiety and are considered second-line
therapy due to the risk of dependence. They quickly reduce or prevent anxiety without causing extreme sedation.
Benzodiazepines are classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance due to their potential for misuse and physical
dependency. Benzodiazepines work in the limbic system and the reticular activating system (RAS) to make GABA
more effective. GABA stabilizes the postsynaptic cells, which results in the interference of neuron firing.

When treating anxiety, a lower dose is necessary compared to when using it for sedative purposes. In addition to
anxiety, these medications can be used for alcohol withdrawal, agitation, and seizure disorders. These drugs must
be tapered slowly when discontinuing them or the client will experience withdrawal symptoms.

     SAFETY ALERT

 Reversal Agent for Benzodiazepine Toxicity

  Flumazenil is a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist and is beneficial in reversing the effects of
  benzodiazepine. It should be available for use as needed to reverse the effects of benzodiazepines administered
  for sedation. It is also used emergently to treat benzodiazepine overdose.

  (Source: Shoar et al., 2023)

The most commonly used benzodiazepines are:

    · Diazepam: Children are more sensitive to diazepam, especially related to mood and/or mental changes. They
        may experience paradoxical medication effects of CNS stimulation and excitation instead of getting a
        calming effect. Older adults are more sensitive to diazepam's effects of drowsiness and poor coordination.

    · Alprazolam: This drug is preferred over diazepam due to its rapid onset of action.
    · Clonazepam: Monitor for suicidal ideations, liver function, and CBC.
    · Lorazepam: This drug is most likely the benzodiazepine of first choice. It provides rapid tranquilization of

        agitated clients. When administered IV, it can induce procedural amnesia. When administered orally, it can
        help combat anxiety disorders and depression-associated anxiety along with stress-related insomnia.
    · Midazolam: This drug is a short-acting medication. It is commonly used prior to surgery or procedures. It can
        be continuously administered via IV to maintain sedation. In addition, it is considered a valuable adjunct in

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Due to the prolonged half-life, both therapeutic and adverse effects are more likely to occur after 3 days of therapy.
     A client with a history of psychosis should avoid taking benzodiazepines due to the potential exacerbation of
     symptoms. Acute narrow-angle glaucoma is also a contraindication because this drug class can increase the
     intraocular pressure. Acute alcohol intoxication or opioid use can intensify the CNS depressant effects. Anyone who
     is pregnant or breastfeeding should avoid these drugs because they can easily cross the placenta and mammary
     glands, causing significant sedation in the fetus or infant. Benzodiazepines may produce paradoxical excitement and
     aggression in adults older than age 50 who have a history of psychosis. Likewise, clients with impaired hepatic
     function should avoid taking these medications because they are metabolized by the liver. Clients with renal
     impairment should avoid this drug because the active metabolites may accumulate, resulting in excessive sedation
     and respiratory depression. Calcium channel blockers decrease the benzodiazepine's drug metabolism, leading to
     increased adverse drug effects. Cimetidine is a hepatic enzyme inhibitor. If the dose of the sedative-hypnotic is not
     decreased, it will accumulate and become toxic. Taking disulfiram concurrently can potentiate the effects of
     benzodiazepines.

  SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

  Age

      · Children: Great caution needs to be given when administering benzodiazepines or sedative-hypnotics to
          children because their response to the drug is very unpredictable. Of the benzodiazepines, only
          chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, lorazepam, midazolam, and diazepam have established pediatric dosages.
          Children must be monitored for both CNS depression and excitability.

      · Older adults: Older adults may be more susceptible to adverse drug reactions, especially the CNS effects
          of sedation, dizziness, and possible hallucinations. Reduced doses should be implemented, and safety
          precautions should be in place. Older adults should be screened for physical conditions, neurological
          deterioration, or depression, which could be contributing factors to insomnia or anxiety.

     FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

     Benzodiazepines

     Concomitant use of benzodiazepines with opioids can result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma,
     or death.

     Midazolam, when given intravenously, can cause significant respiratory depression that may lead to hypoxia,
     brain damage, or death.

     Nonbenzodiazepine Sedative-Hypnotics

     This classification produces sleep. Clients may receive nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotics prior to diagnostic or
     surgical procedures or take them for sleepless nights. These drugs should only be taken when insomnia is causing
     distress and nonpharmacologic measures have been ineffective. They should not be taken every night unless
     absolutely necessary. Intermittent administration can help maintain the drug's effectiveness and also prevent
     dependence. Additionally, it reduces disturbances of normal sleep patterns.

The loss of awareness to and reaction of environmental stimuli is termed sedation. This may be a desirable
characteristic for some clients who are restless, nervous, or overreactive to certain stimuli. A sedative is a drug that
depresses the central nervous system (CNS). Although a sedative is used more as an anxiolytic, it frequently leads to
drowsiness. A hypnotic causes extreme sedation and is used in individuals to promote sleep. These drugs act on the
RAS and block the brain's response to incoming stimuli:

    · Eszopiclone (Schedule IV): Eszopiclone is one of two drugs used long-term (12 months or longer) for chronic
        insomnia. Studies have shown that clients did not experience tolerance to the hypnotic benefits over a
       6-month period (DailyMed, Eszopiclone, 2022). Its mechanism of action is due to an interaction with GABA
        receptors close to or coupled with benzodiazepine receptors. Adverse effects associated with this drug
        include reduced inhibition, aggression or bizarre behavior, worsening depression and suicidal ideations,
        hallucinations, and anterograde amnesia (memory loss). Many clients report an unpleasant taste of the drug.
        Clients who take eszopiclone should allow for 8 hours of sleep because it increases total sleep time and
        reduces sleep latency. It has no effect on reducing nighttime awakenings. Clients should take the drug
        immediately prior to going to bed due to its rapid onset. The medication should not be taken immediately
        following a high-fat meal because it can delay the onset by 1 hour.

     SAFETY ALERT

 Beers Criteria®

  Eszopiclone should be avoided in older adults.

  (Source: American Geriatrics Society, 2023)

    · Ramelteon (not a controlled substance): Ramelteon is a melatonin receptor agonist used long-term for chronic
        insomnia. This drug is beneficial for decreasing sleep latency. ADRs specific to this drug include hormonal
        effects due to increased levels of prolactin, reduced cortisol levels, and decreased testosterone. Other ADRs
        include headaches, dizziness, myalgia, arthralgia, abnormal thoughts and/or behaviors, impaired mental
        alertness, and alteration in taste. This drug should not be taken following a high-fat meal because it will delay
        the onset of action. Caution must be used in clients with depression and respiratory conditions, such as sleep
        apnea, because the drug can worsen these. This drug is contraindicated in clients with severe hepatic
        impairment.

    · Zaleplon (Schedule IV): Zaleplon is used for short-term treatment (7-10 days) for insomnia. It can help
        people initiate sleep (decreases sleep latency). The drug does not increase total sleep time or decrease the
        number of awakenings due to its short half-life. Severe hepatic insufficiency is a contraindication. Clients with
        mild to moderate hepatic impairment can receive lower doses with frequent follow-up to assess worsening
        liver failure.

    · Zolpidem (Schedule IV): Zolpidem is a CNS depressant used for short-term treatment of insomnia associated
        with difficulties with sleep initiation.

    · Suvorexant (Schedule IV): Suvorexant belongs to a new class of drugs used to treat insomnia called orexin
        receptor antagonists. The orexin signaling system is thought to be a central promotor of wakefulness. Blocking
        these sites suppresses the drive to wake up. For safety purposes, the client should be in bed within 30
        minutes of taking the drug. The client should anticipate being in bed for 7 hours.

    · Lemborexant (Schedule IV): Lemborexant is an orexin receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment of adult
        clients with insomnia, characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance. It can cause
        the same adverse effects as zolpidem. Sleep onset may be delayed if lemborexant is taken with or soon after a
        meal.

    · Daridorexant (Schedule IV): Daridorexant is also an orexin receptor antagonist. It has the same mechanism of
        action and indications for use as lemborexant. Food also can delay the onset of its effect.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Clients can experience angioedema if they are allergic to any of the components in the drug. These drugs are
     metabolized by the liver, so they should be avoided by anyone with severe hepatic failure. Lower doses should be
     administered for those with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency and in the older adult. Glaucoma, psychosis, and
     acute alcohol intoxication can be exacerbated by the CNS depression of these drugs. Due to the potential for
     respiratory depression, clients with a history of COPD or sleep apnea should use caution. If taking a
     nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic for at least 1 week, gradual tapering is crucial when discontinuing. If stopped
     abruptly, withdrawal syndrome can occur including nausea, headache, vertigo, nightmares, and seizures. Rebound
     insomnia can potentially occur but only lasts a few days after the drug has been stopped. Essentially, it resolves on
     its own.

     Lemborexant and daridorexant are both contraindicated for the use in narcolepsy. It has been advised that these
     two drugs should not be used in the presence of hepatic disease. The safety and effectiveness in those under age 18
     has not been established.

     Concurrently taking another CNS depressant or drinking alcohol with this medication can intensify CNS depression
     and cause excessive drowsiness along with respiratory depression. Both of these can increase the risk for injury.

     If a client takes the medication directly after consuming a high-fat meal, it can significantly delay absorption of the
     drug. Herbal supplements should be avoided.

         · Monitor injection sites for local reactions and institute care immediately.
         · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

             teaching guidelines.

       CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

       The client taking drugs for anxiety and sleep disorders should:

           · Understand the drug will reduce the symptoms but does not cure the underlying problem.
           · Verbalize the importance of attending counseling to learn ways to manage their anxiety.
           · Identify nondrug measures to manage stress and promote sleep, such as relaxation techniques and

               hobbies.
           · Limit the daily consumption of caffeine and avoid caffeine close to bedtime.
           · Establish a bedtime routine to consistently follow.
           · Increase physical activity.
           · Take the sedative-hypnotic just before going to bed so the client is lying down when the drug begins to

               work.
           · Notify the provider if experiencing any hallucinations or thoughts of suicide.
           · Avoid daytime naps.
           · Place sublingual tablets under the tongue and allow them to dissolve.
           · Only use as needed and for the shortest duration.

       The client taking drugs for anxiety and sleep disorders should not:

           · Stop any drug abruptly due to withdrawal syndrome and the risk of seizures in epileptic clients.
           · Chew, crush, or break in half any extended-release tablets/capsules.
           · Use these on a long-term basis.
           · Take any stimulant drugs, such as cold remedies or appetite suppressants.
           · Engage in activities that require alertness until the effects of the drug are known.
           · Take nonbenzodiazepines with a high-fat meal due to delayed absorption.
           · Consume any caffeinated beverages/foods or excess water during evening hours.
           · Swallow the sublingual tablets or take with water.
           · Consume any alcohol.

children. ADHD is more prevalent among males than females (NIMH, 2022). Various theories have been proposed
regarding the actual etiology; however, no single theory has been accepted. This condition is characterized by
persistent behavior demonstrating inattention, impulsivity, and/or hyperactivity that generally presents during
childhood but can persist into adulthood (American Psychiatric Association, 2022). ADHD can be divided into three
subcategories: predominantly inattentive type, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type, or combined type (NIMH,
2022).

The goal of drug therapy is to control symptoms, facilitate learning, and promote social development. Commonly
used agents are CNS stimulants, which are considered the first-line treatments for ADHD. These work by increasing
the brain chemicals dopamine and norepinephrine, which play essential roles in thinking and attention. If a client is
unable to tolerate the stimulant agents, nonstimulating drugs can be tried. Treatment includes a combination of
medications, cognitive behavioral therapy, support groups and other therapies, stress management, and academic
accommodations (NIMH, 2022).

Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and sudden periods of
sleep attacks at inopportune times. The cause is not completely understood but is possibly caused by several
factors including autoimmune disorders, family history, or brain trauma (National Institute of Neurological Disorders
and Stroke, n.d.). This condition affects males and females equally and usually begins during the teenage or young
adult years. Most clients verbalize that the excess sleepiness substantially interferes with their daily lives, including
work, school, home, and social life. Cataplexy is another common feature of narcolepsy. This condition is exhibited
by loss of muscle function, ranging from slight weakness to complete body collapse. These episodes are frequently
triggered by strong emotional reactions, such as laughing, anger, surprise, or fear, and last a duration of a few
seconds to minutes. Cataplexy can occur several times per day to a few times a year. Other clinical manifestations of
narcolepsy include hypnagogic hallucinations (sleep-related hallucinations that occur when falling asleep) and
sleep paralysis (temporary inability to move when falling asleep or waking). Medications and lifestyle changes can
manage the symptoms of narcolepsy (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, n.d.).

Central Nervous System Stimulants

CNS stimulants are the mainstay of ADHD therapy. Although treating ADHD with a stimulant seems paradoxical,
these drugs give the client the ability to maintain attention and focus on one activity for a longer period of time.
These drugs redirect and excite the arousal stimuli from the RAS. They also help clients increase goal-oriented
behavior. The impulsiveness and hyperactivity decline because clients are now able to concentrate on the task at
hand. These drugs work by increasing the release of catecholamines from presynaptic neurons. In addition,
amphetamines block the reuptake of NE and dopamine, which further increases their concentration so more of the
drug can bind to the postsynaptic neuron. It is valuable to know that if one stimulant is ineffective, another should
be tried before considering a nonstimulant.

The dosing schedule is important and is determined by the time course of the formulation selected. Most of these
are available in immediate-release (IR), sustained release (SR), and 24-hour formulations. Most are controlled
substances, and education should be provided to ensure these are not inappropriately used or distributed.

The most common CNS stimulants are:

    · Methylphenidate (Class II controlled substance): This medication is a first-line treatment for ADHD and a
        second-line treatment for narcolepsy.

    · Amphetamine/dextroamphetamine (Class II controlled substance): This is a mixed-salt drug available in IR
        and ER formulations. The mechanism of action is to mediate CNS stimulation through the release of
        norepinephrine and dopamine. This is the only FDA-approved stimulant for use in children under age 3.

    · Dextroamphetamine: This drug releases NE from nerve terminals and increases the amounts of NE, dopamine,
        and serotonin.

    · Lisdexamfetamine: This is a prodrug of dextroamphetamine. It is used only in the treatment of ADHD and,
        recently, binge-eating disorders among adults. It is not approved for use in narcolepsy or as a weight-loss
        measure.

    · Methamphetamine: This is a highly addictive drug used to treat ADHD and narcolepsy. It is frequently used
        recreationally, and it is at high risk of being obtained and distributed for nontherapeutic uses.

    · Dexmethylphenidate: This drug is used to treat ADHD in clients age 6 and older. As with all stimulants,
418  13 · Psychopharmacologic Drugs

             pediatric clients taking this medication should be monitored for evidence of hindered growth and
             development.
         · Modafinil (Class IV controlled substance): This drug improves wakefulness in clients with excessive daytime
             sleepiness associated with narcolepsy or shift-work sleep disorder and is used as an adjunctive therapy for
             obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome. The drug can also be used to treat ADHD. Clients need to be
             aware that this drug can decrease the effectiveness of oral contraceptives.
         · Pitolisant: This is an H3 (histamine) blocker, not a controlled substance. It is used to treat excessive daytime
             sleepiness caused by narcolepsy and to treat cataplexy in adults with narcolepsy.

     Table 13.23 lists common CNS stimulants and typical routes and dosing for adult and pediatric clients.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
A client must use CNS stimulants with caution when pregnant and taking stimulants. Premature delivery and low
birth weight have occurred in infants born to a parent taking these drugs.

Stimulants are contraindicated in glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, and the spectrum of cardiovascular diseases because
they can exacerbate these conditions. Individuals with a history of drug or alcohol use disorder/dependence should
avoid these drugs because they have a high potential for physical and psychological dependence. Sudden cardiac
arrest has occurred with the use of CNS stimulants. Studies have shown that the majority of these cases occurred in
children with an undocumented cardiac defect. It is now recommended to obtain a baseline electrocardiogram
(ECG, EKG) before beginning this therapy. To reduce the risk of insomnia, these medications should be taken in the
morning or early afternoon. If a client has been diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder, they should avoid the CNS
stimulants because they can worsen the preexisting psychiatric disorder. Motor and verbal tics can be intensified
with the CNS stimulants, so it is essential to identify if there is a family history or personal diagnosis of Tourette
syndrome.

The effects of phenytoin and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are increased by the CNS stimulants. Also,
lisdexamfetamine should not be used concurrently with TCAs or meperidine because it can potentiate the effects of
these drugs, increasing the risk of adverse effects. MAOIs are contraindicated if currently taking or within 14 days of
receiving the last dose because both CNS stimulants and MAOIs can drastically increase blood pressure. The effects
of alpha-1 adrenergic blockers can be reduced or negated by the CNS stimulants.

     CNS Nonstimulants

     These alternative drugs for ADHD and narcolepsy are not associated with the many cardiac and systemic stimulatory
     effects experienced with the CNS stimulants. They are preferable in clients who are unable to tolerate the
     stimulatory effects of the other drugs. The most common CNS nonstimulants are:

     · Atomoxetine: This is an SNRI with anticholinergic effects used to treat ADHD. It inhibits reuptake of NE in
        nerve synapses. It has little risk for abuse and dependence; therefore, it is not a controlled substance.

     · Guanfacine: This is a selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist. It is not a controlled substance. Guanfacine does

        sympathetic nerve impulses are reduced. Furthermore, it binds specifically to postsynaptic alpha-2A
        adrenoreceptors in the prefrontal cortex. As a result, working memory and behavioral inhibitions are affected,
        which improves symptoms associated with ADHD.
    · Clonidine: This is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist. The mechanism of action in ADHD is unknown.
    · Viloxazine: This drug is a selective NE reuptake inhibitor for the treatment of ADHD in adults and pediatric
        clients age 6 and older.
    · Solriamfetol: This drug is a dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (DNRI) that improves daytime
        wakefulness in adult clients with narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
    · Sodium oxybate (Class III controlled substance): This is the first once-at-bedtime medication for people with
        narcolepsy. The extended-release formulation treats cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in
        adults with narcolepsy. It has not been tested in children or pregnant individuals; therefore, it must be avoided
        in these populations. This CNS depressant drug is the sodium salt of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB). Abuse or
        misuse of illicit GHB is associated with CNS adverse reactions, including seizure, respiratory depression,
        decreased consciousness, coma, and death. It is available only through a restricted program called the
        Lumryz REMS. It is contraindicated in combination with sedative-hypnotics or alcohol. Adverse effects include
        depression and suicidality, confusion/anxiety, and parasomnias. Ingesting high sodium content while taking
        this drug can exacerbate heart failure or hypertension or further impair renal function.

Table 13.25 lists common CNS nonstimulants and typical routes and dosing for adult and pediatric clients.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Adverse effects seen with atomoxetine are mainly related to its anticholinergic effects. These include dry mouth,
blurred vision, nausea, constipation, and urine retention. Guanfacine and clonidine can cause sedation, severe
hypotension, and bradycardia. Antihypertensives and CNS depressants are contraindicated with these due to the
additive effects they can have on blood pressure and sedation. Taking guanfacine with a high-fat meal can cause

     increased absorption of the drug.

     TCAs can increase blood pressure and may counteract clonidine's hypotensive effects. Monitor blood pressure and
     adjust as needed. Antihypertensive agents will potentiate the hypotensive effects of clonidine. CNS depressants can
     potentiate sedating effects. It is recommended to avoid concomitant use. Digoxin, calcium channel blockers, and
     beta blockers should not be used in conjunction with clonidine because they can exacerbate bradycardia and AV

     Nursing Implications

     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking CNS stimulants and nonstimulants:

     · Screen and monitor client's cardiovascular risk factors, such as family history, smoking, elevated lipids,
        hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity.

     · Assess client's psychiatric history.
     · Measure and document blood pressure readings, heart rate, weight, food intake, and amount of uninterrupted

        sleep.
     · Obtain a baseline ECG prior to beginning therapy and during episodes of chest pain or palpitations.
     · Provide drug holidays to children for the purpose of determining the need for continued treatment and allow

 · Ensure nutritional needs are being met.
 · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

     teaching guidelines.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking a CNS stimulant or nonstimulant should:

    · Report chest pain, difficulty breathing, fainting, abnormal thinking or behavior, increased aggression,
        hallucinations, and unintended weight loss.

    · Take immediate-release tablets, chewable tablets, and solution 30-45 minutes before meals.
    · Drink at least 8 oz of water with chewable tablets to avoid choking.
    · Weigh self at least once a week.
    · Be cognizant of caloric and nutrient intake to avoid excessive weight loss.

The client taking a CNS stimulant or nonstimulant should not:

    · Chew or crush sustained- or extended-release formulations.
    · Take a CNS stimulant after 6 p.m or less than 6 hours before bedtime.
    · Take less than 1 tablet per day.
    · Take guanfacine with a high-fat meal.
    · Take more than prescribed or distribute to others.
    · Drive or participate in any activities that require alertness until the effects of nonstimulants are known.

FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

CNS Stimulants and Nonstimulants

Atomoxetine, viloxazine: In clinical studies, higher rates of suicidal thoughts and behavior were reported in
clients with ADHD treated with atomoxetine or viloxazine than in clients treated with placebo.

Dextroamphetamine, lisdexamfetamine, and dexmethylphenidate have a high misuse potential.

Sodium oxybate has a risk of causing clinically significant respiratory depression. This medication also has a
high risk of abuse or misuse.

CHAPTER OUTLINE
14.1 Introduction to Pain
14.2 Nonopioid Analgesics
14.3 Opioid Agonists and Antagonists

INTRODUCTION Pain is one of the most common reasons individuals seek medical treatment, and it can arise from
a number of sources, including trauma, cancer, and autoimmune and other diseases. When pain and its underlying
causes are not managed well, chronic problems such as disability, lost wages, and mental health issues can result.
In addition to nonpharmacologic options, pain is often managed with nonopioid analgesics, which include several
medications that clients can acquire without a prescription, and opioid agonists, which are reserved for more severe
forms of pain and require a prescription. This chapter will review the definition of pain, explain how pain occurs in
the body, and describe some ways to treat pain with pharmacologic therapies.

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 14.1.1 Define pain.
    · 14.1.2 Differentiate between acute pain and chronic pain.
    · 14.1.3 Explain the pain threshold.

Pain

Pain is generally defined as "an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential
tissue damage or described in terms of such damage" (Raja et al., 2020). Pain is, by nature, a subjective experience
that the client describes to the health care provider, so many health care professionals practically define pain as
428  14 · Pain Response Drugs

     "whatever the client says it is." This makes assessing and treating pain a challenge for many health care
     professionals. This is especially true considering that many health care providers do not receive sufficient training in
     pain management to always address a client's needs adequately.

     Acute pain is typically sudden in onset and will usually have a duration of less than a month. Acute pain is
     commonly caused by events such as trauma, injury, or certain medical treatments such as surgery. Chronic pain
     typically lasts longer than 3 months. Common causes of chronic pain include inflammation and medical treatments,
     or the cause can be entirely unknown (idiopathic pain). Because of the chronic nature of this type of pain, affected
     individuals are more likely to develop long-term complications such as depression, anxiety, substance use
     disorders, and chronic disability. The Institute of Medicine Committee on Advancing Pain Research, Care, and
     Education estimates that more than 100 million people in the United States live with some form of chronic pain and
     that chronic pain costs more than $600 billion each year in terms of medical treatment and lost productivity (Smith
     & Hillner, 2019).

     In addition to acute and chronic classifications of pain, pain can be characterized in ways that can help determine
     the most appropriate plan for managing it. Nociceptive pain is pain that arises from injury to bodily tissue, such as
     pain related to traumatic injury, surgery, or infection. This type of pain may be described as a sharp, dull, or stabbing
     sensation. Nociceptive pain can be further classified as either somatic or visceral pain. Somatic pain typically occurs
     in parts of the body such as the skin, bones, and muscles. It tends to be easily pinpointed, may be described as
     sharp, and is localized to the injured tissue. Visceral pain affects internal organs such as the stomach and liver. It
     may be described as deep, dull, aching sensations that can be more difficult to localize. In some cases, deep
     visceral pain may cause pain elsewhere in the body, which is known as referred pain (e.g., pancreatic injury causing
     back pain, myocardial infarction causing jaw and shoulder pain; see Figure 14.2).

     In contrast to nociceptive pain, neuropathic pain is pain that arises from the nerves of the peripheral and central
     nervous systems. Neuropathic pain can result from various neurologic conditions, such as diabetic neuropathies,
     stroke, multiple sclerosis, herpes zoster (shingles), and phantom limb pain related to an amputation. Neuropathic
     pain is often described as burning, tingling, or shooting pains that radiate from one location to another.

     whereas others are perceived as affecting areas quite distant from the involved organ. (credit: modification of work from Anatomy and

Pain can also be characterized based on its intensity, such as by describing it as mild, moderate, or severe or rating
it on a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain imaginable. These types of scales may
not be appropriate when clients do not understand the question or cannot communicate their pain. In cases such as
these, other tools are available. For instance, the nurse can display drawings of different faces expressing various
levels of pain and ask the client to point to the face that best represents what they are experiencing.

Health care professionals also assess clients for physical signs of pain, which can be indicated by facial expressions,
muscle tension, and body movements. Another important way to assess pain is to observe or ask about any
functional impairments. It is useful to know what the client is functionally capable or incapable of doing--such as
going to work, gardening, or playing with their children--and how these abilities change with pain and pain
treatment. Generally, when a client's pain status improves, they should be able to do more of the things they wish to
do. This provides more objective evidence than relying solely on client self-reporting.

Nurses are a critical link in the chain of appropriate pain management. They are frequently the health care
professionals on the front line in assessing pain, administering pain medication, and monitoring for pain relief and
any adverse effects the client may develop. It is critical for nurses to have a solid understanding of what pain is and
how it may present differently in a variety of client populations such as children, older adults, and individuals from
various ethnic and racial backgrounds. Cultural values and beliefs as well as individual differences can frequently
affect how clients will talk about and show their pain, so it is important for nurses to be open-minded to the fact that
pain is a subjective experience. Some people may live with a great deal of chronic pain but are stoic and do not
exhibit outward signs of it. All individuals are equally deserving of adequate pain management, and nurses should
advocate for their clients to ensure they receive the care they deserve.

     LINK TO LEARNING

 The Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale (https://openstax.org/r/wongbakerfaces)

  The Wong-Baker FACES pain rating scale uses pictures to illustrate different severities of pain. It is especially
  useful when the client is too young to understand a pain-scale question or when a language barrier exists.

Pathophysiology of Pain

Nociception is the term used to describe the processing of noxious stimuli by both the peripheral and central
nervous systems. Pain is the client's subjective experience of this nociception. Nociception is a complex process
that involves five steps: transduction, conduction, transmission, modulation, and perception.

Transduction is the first step leading to the sensation of pain and begins with activation of specialized nerves known
as nociceptors. Activation of these nociceptors can arise from a variety of stimuli, including direct tissue injury,
extremes in temperature, and certain chemicals. Upon exposure to one of these stimuli, several types of small
proteins called cytokines are released, which sensitize and activate the nociceptors. Conduction and transmission
occur when the nociceptors are activated and turn a chemical signal into an action potential, which transmits the
stimuli to the spinal column to eventually be received by the brain. Modulation controls how strong a painful signal
will be when the brain receives it. Pain signals can be made more intense by substances such as substance P.
Conversely, painful signals can be inhibited by substances such as the body's own natural opioids (enkephalins and
beta-endorphins). The first four steps of nociception culminate in perception of pain by the brain. At this point, the
individual experiences the subjective sensation of pain and can respond to it, such as by pulling their hand away
from a hot surface.

Another major player in nociception is the immune system, which is activated when tissue is injured. Once
inflammatory cytokines are released, the immune system is signaled to start recruiting immune cells, such as
macrophages and neutrophils, to the site of injury. A complex cascade of chemical signaling is set in motion,
including activation of the cyclooxygenase pathway, which leads to the characteristic hallmarks of inflammation:
swelling, redness, and heightened sensations of pain.

Pain Threshold

The pain threshold is the point at which someone perceives a stimulus to be painful. It is highly variable and unique
430  14 · Pain Response Drugs

     to each person. Individuals can have different pain thresholds for a variety of reasons, including differences in
     genetic makeup, psychosocial support, and the neurochemicals that affect the modulation step of nociception, to
     name a few. The pain threshold can be affected by the use of nonpharmacologic strategies, including distraction
     techniques (e.g., meditation or listening to music), and pharmacologic agents such as nonopioid analgesics and
     opioid agonists.

       SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

       Pain in Various Populations

       It is important to consider how biases may play a role in pain assessment of clients from various racial, ethnic,
       and social backgrounds. Researchers have found that health care providers often carry implicit biases that may
       cause them to underestimate pain in clients due to false perceptions of physiologic differences between people
       of different ethnicities. These biases can lead to undertreatment of these clients and cause unnecessary pain
       and suffering. In addition, clients driven to self-medicate because of untreated pain may be at risk for substance
       misuse and addiction.

       One example of such bias is that Black clients often have their pain underestimated and undertreated due to a
       variety of false beliefs about physiologic differences between different racial groups. This is why education of
       health care professionals at all levels is necessary to root out these false assumptions.

     14.2 Nonopioid Analgesics

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 14.2.1 Identify the characteristics of nonopioid analgesic drugs used to treat pain.
         · 14.2.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and contraindications of nonopioid analgesic

             drugs used to treat pain.
         · 14.2.3 Describe the nursing implications of nonopioid analgesic drugs used to treat pain.
         · 14.2.4 Explain the client education related to nonopioid analgesic drugs used to treat pain.

     A nonopioid analgesic refers to any pharmacologic agent that treats the symptoms of pain and does not involve
     activation of opioid receptors. These agents generally work by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX), a major pro-
     inflammatory enzyme that causes many signs and symptoms of inflammation, including redness, swelling, and
     sensitization of nociceptors, thereby increasing the transmission of painful signals to the brain. COX causes this
     increase in inflammation and pain by increasing the production of cytokines such as prostaglandins, prostacyclin,
     and thromboxane. It is also partly responsible for the pyrexia that occurs with infection, which is why many
     nonopioid analgesics that block the activity of COX also work as antipyretics to reduce fever.

     Cyclooxygenase has two major isoforms: COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 helps with normal homeostatic functions in the
     body, including maintaining normal platelet and renal functions. It also is important for producing prostaglandins
     that stimulate production of the mucosal barrier that protects the stomach from its own acids. If COX-1 is inhibited
     through the actions of medications such as glucocorticoids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), this
     protective barrier can erode, which is a major cause of peptic ulcers. COX-2 is responsible for much of the
     inflammation and pain brought about by tissue injury.

     Other nonopioid analgesics may serve as adjunctive agents for treating neuropathic sources of pain. These include
     antidepressant drugs (e.g., duloxetine, amitriptyline), antiseizure drugs (e.g., carbamazepine, pregabalin), and local
     anesthetics (e.g., lidocaine and bupivacaine). These are useful because they target the abnormal neuronal function
     that is the source of neuropathic pain. These medications are covered in their respective chapters, and health care
     professionals should keep these additional tools in mind to ensure adequate management of this type of pain.

     Acetaminophen

     Acetaminophen is a common over-the-counter nonopioid analgesic. It is one of the most popular analgesics due to
     its low cost, efficacy in treating mild to moderate pain, and excellent safety profile when used within the

     Access for free at openstax.org
14.2 · Nonopioid Analgesics                                                                                              431

recommended dosages. Acetaminophen's complete mechanism of action to relieve pain is not currently known.
Some experts theorize that it inhibits COX in the central nervous system (CNS), providing analgesic and antipyretic
actions, but notably it does not inhibit COX peripherally, meaning it has no anti-inflammatory action as compared
with other nonopioid analgesics.

Acetaminophen comes in a variety of dosage forms, including intravenous and rectal options, to aid clients who
cannot take medications by mouth. Acetaminophen is commonly found in combination products with opioid
agonists, antihistamines, and medications for coughs and colds. Because acetaminophen is present in so many
products, and because its overuse can lead to serious adverse events, nurses must be alert for all sources of
acetaminophen that clients may be taking.

     CLINICAL TIP

 Check for All Sources of Acetaminophen

  Many over-the-counter and prescription medications include acetaminophen, including many cough and cold
  products. Clients should be aware that they need to count all sources of acetaminophen to ensure they do not
  exceed the limit of 4000 mg per 24 hours and put themselves at risk for liver injury.

Aspirin, Ibuprofen, and Naproxen Sodium

Aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen sodium are classified as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This
classification means they possess analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory actions without belonging to the
group of medications known as the glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone and dexamethasone, which are discussed in
Introduction to the Immune System and the Inflammatory Response). NSAIDs are often preferred over
glucocorticoids as anti-inflammatory agents because they cause fewer adverse drug reactions such as
hyperglycemia, hypertension, and increased risk for infection. NSAIDs work by inhibiting the enzyme COX centrally
and in peripheral tissues to decrease inflammation and reduce pain. NSAIDs are also very popular analgesics
because they are readily available over the counter.

Aspirin is notable for its antiplatelet actions, so it can be used during myocardial infarctions to aid in maintaining
coronary blood flow by inhibiting platelet aggregation. (See Cardiac Emergency and Shock Drugs for more about
aspirin's use in cardiovascular emergencies.) The reason for aspirin's unique actions is that it is an irreversible
inhibitor of COX in platelets, preventing them from aggregating and initiating the clotting cascade. Aspirin's
irreversible inhibition of COX means that platelets are affected for their entire lifetime, which is approximately 7-10
days. Nurses should instruct clients taking blood thinners (e.g., warfarin, apixaban) to be cautious about using
aspirin to treat pain because of increased risk for bleeding and bruising.

     SAFETY ALERT

 NSAIDs

  Clients reporting severe abdominal pain, dark tarry stools, or vomiting or coughing up of blood should stop using
  any NSAIDs immediately and be assessed by a health care provider for possible stomach ulcers.

Tramadol

Tramadol is a partial opioid receptor agonist and inhibitor of reuptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and
serotonin. These characteristics make tramadol a potential analgesic option for clients with neuropathic pain
because they benefit from both the partial opioid effect and the pain-modulating effects of increased
norepinephrine and serotonin. However, due to its actions at the opioid receptors, tramadol has been linked to cases
of misuse and addiction, leading the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to categorize tramadol as a Schedule
IV medication (CIV). The DEA scheduling of a medication puts certain restrictions on who can prescribe the
medication and how much of the medication can be prescribed at a time.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications

     Nonopioid analgesics as a class are relatively safe to use for many clients but do carry some notable adverse effects
     in susceptible individuals. Acetaminophen is a preferred analgesic for mild to moderate pain because it has
     relatively few adverse effects, but it must not be taken in amounts greater than those recommended by the drug's
     manufacturers. This limit is 4000 mg per 24 hours; taking acetaminophen in doses beyond that increases the
     chances of developing potentially fatal hepatotoxicity. Clients with a history of liver disease will have lower
     recommended dosages because they are at greater risk for liver injury when using acetaminophen. Hepatotoxicity
     from acetaminophen can present as nausea, fatigue, and jaundice (yellowish skin and sclera) and may require
     antidotal therapy with the drug n-acetylcysteine to help prevent further liver injury.

     NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen sodium are known to increase the risk for bleeding and bruising
     and can cause kidney injury in older adults and in clients with a history of chronic kidney disease. NSAIDs taken at
     high doses for long periods of time can also potentially cause stomach ulcers that can progress to bleeding and
     perforation by eroding the protective stomach lining over time.

     Due to its opioid receptor activity, tramadol can cause CNS and respiratory depression in overdose or when mixed
     with other CNS depressants such as alcohol. It is associated with risk for problematic use and addiction, and
     individuals with a history of substance use disorder should avoid it. Tramadol can lower the seizure threshold and
     should be used with caution in clients with a history of seizure disorder.

     NSAIDs carry a risk for asthma exacerbations in clients with a history of aspirin-induced asthma. Aspirin should be
     avoided in children younger than 16 years old with a recent history of viral illness because the medication may
     cause a potentially fatal condition called Reye's syndrome.

     All of these agents should be avoided in clients with a known allergy to the individual agents or any of their
     components.

Nursing Implications

The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking a nonopioid analgesic:

· Assess the client for pain by using a pain scale before and 15-20 minutes after a dose of a nonopioid
   analgesic to determine its efficacy.

· Ensure that the client does not receive more than the recommended amount of acetaminophen in 24 hours.
· Check for any contraindications, allergies, or potential drug interactions before beginning therapy with a

   nonopioid analgesic.
· Ask the client when they last used an analgesic medication.
· Ask the client about any types of nonpharmacologic pain treatment they may be using, such as ice, stretching,

   or heat/cold therapy.
· Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

   teaching guidelines.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking a nonopioid analgesic should:

    · Alert their health care provider about any signs of allergic reactions, including throat swelling, severe
        itching, rash, or chest tightness.

    · Alert their health care provider about any signs of bleeding, including black tarry stools, coffee-ground
        emesis, or blood-streaked sputum.

    · Alert their health care provider that they are taking this medication, including the dose and frequency.
    · Avoid drinking alcohol while using acetaminophen.
434  14 · Pain Response Drugs

     · Take the drug with food if it causes upset stomach.
     · Take a missed dose as soon as they remember it; however, they should not take double doses.
     · Contact their health care provider for further advice if pain persists longer than 3 days.

     FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

     Nonopioid Analgesics

     Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in death or the need for
     liver transplantation.

     NSAIDs increase the risk for serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and
     stroke, which can be fatal. This risk may occur early in treatment and may increase with duration of use.

     NSAIDs increase the risk for serious gastrointestinal adverse events, including bleeding, ulceration, and
     perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. These events can occur at any time during use and
     without warning symptoms. Older adults and individuals with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease or
     gastrointestinal bleeding are at greater risk for serious gastrointestinal events.

Opioid Agonists

Opioid agonists have been in use for thousands of years. Opioids originated from the opium poppy, Papaver
somniferum, from which naturally occurring opioids such as heroin, codeine, and morphine are derived. Since the
discovery of the potent analgesic effects of these medications, other opioids have been developed, including
hydrocodone and oxycodone. The term opiate strictly refers to agents that come from the opium poppy (e.g., heroin,
morphine), but is often used interchangeably with the term opioid. Opioid agonists are some of the most potent
analgesics available and are used for treatment of moderate to severe pain. However, opioids carry a risk for misuse
and addiction that has led to one of the most notable public health crises to date, the opioid epidemic. Because of
these risks, the DEA categorizes all opioids as controlled substances. Most opioids fall under the strict
categorization of Schedule II (CII), meaning they have an acceptable medical use but are associated with a high risk
for misuse and addiction.

Opioids produce many of their desired therapeutic effects and potentially life-threatening adverse effects via the
opioid receptors, including the mu, delta, and kappa receptors. When activated, these receptors located throughout
the CNS help modulate painful signals from peripheral tissues to alter pain perception and heighten the pain
threshold. These same receptors are also known to cause many of the notable adverse effects of opioids, including
the CNS and respiratory depression that can be seen in overdose. Opioid agonists also suppress the cough receptors
in the brain and can be used as cough suppressants. However, due to the risk for misuse and addiction, opioid
agonists are usually considered last-line treatments for cough.

Codeine
Codeine is one of the naturally occurring opioids derived from the opium poppy. It is most often given orally for mild
to moderate pain. For codeine to be effective, it must be converted to morphine in the liver via the enzyme
cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). Because individuals may produce more or less CYP2D6, clients receiving codeine
may experience unpredictable therapeutic and adverse effects. Clients who produce too little CYP2D6 (slow
metabolizers) do not convert enough codeine into morphine and thus may not receive adequate analgesia. Clients
producing many copies of CYP2D6 (rapid metabolizers) may convert too much codeine into morphine, causing
enhanced analgesic effects and a greater risk for life-threatening respiratory depression. Due to this variability in
client metabolism and potential risks, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not currently recommend codeine
for use in children (Silva et al., 2021). Similarly, codeine should be used with caution in older clients.
436  14 · Pain Response Drugs

     Fentanyl
     Fentanyl is a potent synthetic opioid that is frequently used intravenously to treat severe pain related to trauma or
     surgery. It is also available in patches to help provide long-lasting analgesia in clients with chronic pain conditions.
     Fentanyl is considered a synthetic opioid because it shares no chemical resemblance to naturally occurring opioids
     such as morphine, which means it can be a safe alternative for clients who have a documented morphine allergy.
     Because of its potency, fentanyl is often used by clients with opioid use disorders, and it has become a major
     contributor to opioid-related deaths in the past several years (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2023).

     Hydromorphone
     Hydromorphone is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine, meaning it shares some chemical structure similarities
     with naturally occurring opioids. It is a potent analgesic and is most frequently used for cases of moderate to severe
     pain. Hydromorphone is available in both intravenous and oral forms, so it is frequently used for clients with severe
     pain both in and outside the hospital setting.

     Meperidine
     Meperidine is a synthetic opioid that is not routinely used as an analgesic. This is because it produces a toxic
     metabolite that can accumulate in older adults with poor renal function, leading to risk for delirium and seizures.
     Instead, the most common use for meperidine is to interrupt the severe shivering with chills (also known as rigors)
     that may occur postoperatively in clients who received general anesthesia.

     Methadone
     Methadone is a synthetic opioid that is most frequently used to treat opioid use disorders. Because of its long half-
     life, up to 59 hours, it persists in the body longer than many other opioids. This long half-life helps prevent the
     opioid withdrawal symptoms that can occur when individuals stop using opioids entirely. Methadone's long half-life
     also means that it has utility in providing long-lasting pain relief in clients with chronic pain. In addition, it has some
     efficacy in treating neuropathic pain because it can block the reuptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and
     serotonin, which helps reduce painful signals from being transmitted to the brain.

     Morphine
     Morphine is a naturally occurring opioid that has been in widespread use since its discovery in the 1800s. It is
     considered to be the prototypical opioid to which all others are compared. It is used to treat both acute and chronic
     types of pain and is available in a wide variety of dosage forms, including intravenous and oral options. Oral forms
     come in immediate and extended-release formulations, making morphine suitable for breakthrough and around-
     the-clock types of pain. Because of its high degree of efficacy, morphine is used for moderate to severe pain.

     Oxycodone
     Oxycodone is a semisynthetic opioid commonly used orally to treat moderate to severe pain. It is frequently used
     because of its favorable side effect profile compared with other agents such as morphine (for instance, oxycodone
     causes less itching).

     Oxycodone comes in a variety of dosage forms, including immediate- and extended-released preparations, making
     it useful for acute and chronic pain therapy in outpatient settings. The extended-release formulation, sold under the
     brand names OxyContin and Xtampza ER, is used to provide around-the-clock pain relief. Clients with chronic pain
     often need long-acting medications for their basal levels of pain (i.e., the baseline level of pain that is always
     present) as well as short-acting agents for breakthrough episodes of pain (i.e., pain above the basal level brought on
     by injury or activity).

     Oxycodone is often coformulated with acetaminophen, which nurses should consider when totaling a client's total
     daily acetaminophen intake.

     Table 14.4 lists common opioid agonists and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Adverse effects of opioid therapy can range from general gastrointestinal upset to life-threatening respiratory
depression. The most common are gastrointestinal effects, including nausea, vomiting, and constipation. Nearly all
clients receiving chronic opioid therapy will develop constipation, so nurses should assess for this to help determine
which type of constipation treatment (laxatives, stool softeners, stimulants, fiber supplements) the client needs to
ensure regular bowel movements. A handy mnemonic for adverse effects is NARCS U: nausea, acute toxicity/
addiction, respiratory depression, constipation, sedation, and urinary retention.

Morphine is known to cause significant histamine release in susceptible clients and may manifest as flushing,
pruritis, and hypotension. This situation is normally managed by using an alternative opioid that does not cause
histamine release (e.g., hydromorphone or oxycodone) or treating the client with an antihistamine such as
diphenhydramine to combat the actions of histamine release. (Antihistamines are discussed in Upper Respiratory
Disorder Drugs.)

In overdose or in combination with other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, muscle relaxants, alcohol), the
most dangerous effects seen with opioids include CNS and respiratory depression. The individual may appear
sedated or can be completely unresponsive, and their breathing may be slow, shallow, or absent. These signs
constitute a medical emergency and necessitate the use of an opioid antagonist such as naloxone hydrochloride
(discussed in the following section) along with the response of emergency medical services.

Opioids should be avoided in clients with any known hypersensitivities to them or to any of their constituent
components. Clients with documented allergies to naturally occurring opioids such as morphine are generally able
to safely receive synthetic opioids such as fentanyl because the chemical structures differ enough that there is low
cross-sensitivity between these agents. Clients with significant respiratory depression or gastrointestinal
obstruction should also avoid opioids because these conditions can worsen when opioids are present in the body.

CLINICAL TIP

Assess for Constipation

Opioid agonists are well known to cause significant constipation when taken chronically. Constipation can cause
or worsen abdominal pain and may distress the client. The nurse should recommend to most clients that they
438  14 · Pain Response Drugs

     consume more water and fiber in their diet. Many clients will need to use laxatives such as senna and docusate to
     ensure normal stooling habits.

     Nursing Implications
     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking an opioid:

     · Assess the client's pain before and after administering an opioid to determine its efficacy in treating the
        client's pain.

     · Watch for adverse effects, including sedation, ataxia, slurred speech, and shallow breathing, which could
        require the use of antidotal therapy or respiratory support.

     · With chronic use of opioids, ask about the client's bowel movements because constipation is very common
        with these medications and could be a source of abdominal pain.

     · Ensure that naloxone is readily available in the event of opioid toxicity or overdose.
     · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

        teaching guidelines.

     SAFETY ALERT

     Opioid Agonists

14.3 · Opioid Agonists and Antagonists                                                                                   439

relaxants, because this interaction will increase the risk for potentially fatal respiratory failure. Naloxone
hydrochloride should be coprescribed to clients who are at greater risk for opioid overdose.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking an opioid agonist should:

    · Alert their health care provider before starting opioid agonist therapy if they have any breathing
        difficulties, asthma, or sleep apnea.

    · Alert their health care provider about any signs or symptoms of allergic reactions, including throat
        swelling, severe itching, rash, or chest tightness.

    · Take the lowest dose needed, if prescribed as as-needed (prn) use, to control pain to reduce the risk of
        dependence.

    · Alert all health care providers that they are taking opioids, including the dose and frequency.
    · Take a missed dose as soon as they remember it; however, they should not take double doses.
    · Keep all medication out of the reach of children and pets.

The client taking an opioid agonist should not:

    · Crush or chew the product if taking an extended-release drug.
    · Mix opioids with other CNS depressants, including sedatives, alcohol, and muscle relaxants, because their

        interaction increases the risk for potentially fatal respiratory failure.
    · Share opioids with family or friends because this practice can lead to harm or even death.

  FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

  Opioid Agonists

  Opioid agonists expose clients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can
  lead to overdose and death. Assess each client's risk prior to prescribing and reassess all clients regularly for the
  development of these behaviors and conditions.

  Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of opioid agonists. Monitor for
  respiratory depression, especially during initiation of opioid agonists or following a dose increase. To reduce the
  risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of opioid agonists is essential.

  Accidental ingestion of opioid agonists, especially by children, can be fatal.

  Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, may result in
  profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of tramadol and
  benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in clients for whom alternative treatment options are
  inadequate. Limit treatment to the minimum effective dosages and durations. Follow clients for signs and
  symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.

  Prolonged use of opioid agonists during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which
  may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated and requires management according to protocols
  developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant client, advise
  the client of the risk for neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be
  available.

Tolerance and Addiction
Tolerance and addiction are two important topics concerning the use of opioid medications. Clients and health care
professionals can misunderstand the definitions of these terms and how likely the conditions are to occur. It is
important for nurses to understand these terms and how they apply to clients using opioids.
440  14 · Pain Response Drugs

     Tolerance
     Tolerance is a phenomenon that occurs in clients taking opioid agonists chronically. As the body adapts to the
     presence of the drug, the client will become accustomed to some of the side effects, including sedation, and it may
     appear as if the dose that previously treated the client's pain is no longer adequate. Therefore, the opioid dose may
     need to be increased to treat the client's pain adequately. In fact, clients can develop so much tolerance that the
     dose that is appropriate for them would be potentially dangerous to someone who has never taken an opioid
     agonist. This tolerance is a normal phenomenon that occurs in nearly all clients receiving chronic opioid agonists
     and should not be confused with addiction.

     Clients who have developed a significant amount of tolerance to the effects of opioids are at risk for developing
     withdrawal symptoms when the medication is discontinued. Opioid withdrawal can be extremely distressing to the
     client and may result in agitation, sweating, diarrhea, and severe dysphoria. Fortunately, opioid agonist withdrawal
     is not associated with significant mortality, in contrast to withdrawal from CNS depressants such as alcohol or
     benzodiazepines, which can cause seizures and is associated with greater mortality risk.

     Addiction
     Opioid addiction (also called opioid use disorder) is a condition characterized by compulsive use of opioids,
     increased opioid tolerance, and withdrawal symptoms if the client does not continue taking an opioid agonist. This
     compulsion can be so strong in susceptible individuals that they will continue using opioids despite the known
     physical, financial, and social harms that it may be causing. It is estimated that in the United States, 2.1 million
     individuals have opioid use disorders and 47,000 deaths are attributable to opioid agonists each year (Wilson et al.,
     2020).

     Addiction typically occurs as a result of dopamine release in the reward pathway of the brain, also known as the
     dopaminergic pathway. This causes an intense euphoria that often leaves the client wanting more opioids to feel
     that same elation repeatedly. Risk factors for developing an opioid use disorder include genetic and environmental
     factors. Clients with a history of certain mental health disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder and
     depression, have been shown to be at risk for various substance use disorders as well (National Institute on Drug
     Abuse, 2022).

     It is important to determine how clients are obtaining their opioids because not all opioids are obtained legally.
     Nurses also should ask about the illicit use of opioids, such as heroin, that may not be documented in the medical
     chart.

     Not all clients who use opioids will develop opioid use disorders; however, this possibility is a concern for many
     clients who may have pain but refuse all opioids based on the small risk of addiction. It is important to counsel
     clients about the differences between tolerance and addiction to ensure they feel comfortable getting the best care
     that is right for them. Tolerance and physical dependence will occur in nearly all clients receiving chronic opioid
     therapy, but only some will go on to develop an opioid use disorder.

Opioid Antagonists

Opioid analgesics are extremely effective when used to manage moderate to severe forms of pain but can cause
potentially life-threatening CNS and respiratory depression when the recommended dosage is exceeded or when
individuals use them along with other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol). It is critical that agents are available to
reverse the effects of opioids to avoid severe injury and potential death. This section will cover these opioid
antagonists.

Naloxone Hydrochloride
Naloxone hydrochloride is an opioid receptor antagonist that is used as an antidote in people experiencing signs and
symptoms of opioid agonist overdose, including severe CNS and respiratory depression. Overdose may present as
shallow or absent breathing, and the person may be unresponsive to any type of stimuli. Naloxone works by
blocking the opioid receptors, thus causing a rapid reversal of opioid agonist effects. Because the individual will be
too sedated to administer the medication themselves, it will often be given by emergency medical services, law
enforcement officers, or bystanders with access to naloxone. Naloxone can be given intravenously, intramuscularly,
or intranasally.

Importantly, naloxone has a duration of action of only approximately 20-30 minutes. This short duration means the
individual may resedate because many opioids have a longer duration of action than naloxone does. This is why it is
critical that those who respond to naloxone receive medical care as quickly as possible to prevent delaying more
definitive therapy. The only major adverse effect of naloxone is that it can induce severe opioid withdrawal in
442  14 · Pain Response Drugs

     individuals who chronically use opioids; they may become very agitated, develop diarrhea, and experience intense
     dysphoria. To avoid these consequences of sudden withdrawal, smaller doses may be administered in quick
     succession until the individual is able to breathe on their own.

     Naltrexone Hydrochloride
     Naltrexone hydrochloride is an opioid receptor antagonist. It is not often given for emergency reversal of opioid
     intoxication but is instead used for clients who want to abstain from opioid use. It is orally bioavailable, and when a
     client has been taking it orally, it will blunt the effects of opioids if the client relapses and begins to use opioids
     again. Long-acting formulations of naltrexone can also be administered intramuscularly every 4 weeks to ensure
     client compliance during this period. Adverse effects of naltrexone are similar to those of naloxone in that it can
     induce opioid withdrawal in clients who are actively using opioids.

     Recent research suggests that naltrexone can be used in combination with other medications to treat a variety of
     addictive conditions, such as eating disorders (Stancil et al., 2019). See Substance Use Disorder Treatment Drugs
     for more information on naltrexone.

     Nalbuphine Hydrochloride
     Nalbuphine is a mixed opioid agonist/antagonist. On its own, it can serve as an alternative to other opioid agonists
     when treating pain. At lower doses, it acts as an antagonist and can reverse the depressant effects of other opioid
     agonists.

     Table 14.7 lists common opioid antagonists and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

Over-the-Counter Naloxone

In March 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved naloxone hydrochloride nasal spray to be sold
over the counter to increase access to this life-saving medication (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2023). This
change in the status of naloxone has paved the way to making it available in a variety of locations outside of
pharmacies, including Internet retailers, gas stations, and grocery stores. This change is a crucial step to address
the number of opioid overdose deaths that occur in the United States every year, as getting naloxone even a few
minutes before emergency medical services arrive could mean the difference between life and death. A New York
Times podcast (https://openstax.org/r/narcan) describes the importance of naloxone becoming available over the

CHAPTER OUTLINE
15.1 Introduction to Substance Use Disorders
15.2 Opioid Use Disorder Drugs
15.3 Alcohol Use Disorder Drugs
15.4 Nicotine Use Disorder Drugs

INTRODUCTION Substance use disorders are a major public health concern in the United States and affect millions
of people around the world. The consequences of substance use disorders can be catastrophic for the client, their
family, and society at large. As frontline health care providers, nurses play a crucial role in the prevention,
identification, and treatment of clients with substance use disorders. This chapter will review the definition of
substance use disorders, how to identify clients with substance use disorders, and how to manage their condition.
In addition to nonpharmacologic treatment options for substance use disorders, this chapter will also review
medication therapy to assist in the treatment of opioid, alcohol, and nicotine use disorders.

15.1 Introduction to Substance Use Disorders

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 15.1.1 Define intoxication, physical dependence, and psychological dependence.
    · 15.1.2 Distinguish between tolerance, addiction, and withdrawal.
    · 15.1.3 Describe treatment approaches for substance use disorders.

Introduction to Substance Use Disorders

The standard definition of a substance use disorder (SUD), from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5), is that it involves patterns of symptoms caused by using a substance that an
448  15 · Substance Use Disorder Treatment Drugs

     individual continues taking despite its negative effects (McNeely & Adam, 2020). This chapter will primarily focus on
     opioid, alcohol, and nicotine use disorders, which are three of the most prevalent SUDs in the world, but this
     definition pertains to many other substances, including caffeine, marijuana, and stimulants (e.g., cocaine and
     amphetamines), to name a few.

     Substance misuse disorders are quite prevalent in the United States. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health
     estimates that in 2021, 46.3 million people (16.5% of the population) over the age of 12 met the DSM-5 criteria for
     having an SUD in the past year. Of those people, 29.5 million were classified as having an alcohol use disorder and
     24 million had a drug use disorder. Unfortunately, it has been estimated that 94% of individuals with SUDs felt they
     did not need treatment and therefore did not receive any (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
     Administration, 2023a). Several populations by age should also be considered as being at risk for SUDs that may be
     overlooked by health care providers. These include the nearly 1 million adults over age 65 who live with an SUD and
     the 2 million teenagers ages 12-17 who reported drug use (NIH, 2020; National Center for Drug Abuse Statistics,
     n.d.).

     The consequences of SUDs should not be understated. It has been shown that SUDs are associated with over 200
     types of chronic conditions or injuries, including cardiovascular disease, hepatitis, communicable diseases (e.g.,
     human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV), and motor vehicle accidents. In addition to the physical harm that may
     come to the client with an SUD, it is important to also consider the additional consequences of SUDs, including
     decreased quality of life, strain on the client's family and friend network, legal consequences, and the risk for
     overdose and death (see Figure 15.2). This is why it is so critical for the nurse to be vigilant for SUDs in clients, as
     they may be the first health care provider to assess and identify an SUD. (See this Nurse Journal list
     (https://openstax.org/r/nursejournal) for additional resources.)

     Overview of Substance Use and Abuse

     To understand the different aspects of SUDs and their treatments, it is important for the health care provider (HCP)
     to understand how these disorders begin and the physiologic changes that occur when using these substances. Key
     concepts for the HCP to understand are the early euphoric aspects of intoxication, leading to the physical and

15.1 · Introduction to Substance Use Disorders                                                                          449

psychological dependence that can make it so difficult for clients with SUDs to discontinue their habits despite the
known harms.

Substances of abuse all increase the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain, which causes more
pleasure and euphoria than other naturally rewarding activities. Drugs of abuse change the reward circuitry that is
associated with a cycle of dependence, craving, addiction, and tolerance. This change, referred to as
neuroadaptation, causes the transition from being able to control the use of the substance to chronic misuse that
can be difficult to control. It is difficult to determine which individuals will be susceptible to which substances or
behaviors. Ongoing research is looking into the role that one's genetics plays in the genesis of these disorders.

This section will introduce the reader to the various aspects of substance use disorders, including intoxication,
physical and psychological dependence, tolerance, and withdrawal. It will include discussion about the subsequent
physiological and psychological changes that lead clients to develop substance use disorders.

Substance Use Disorders and Terminology
Addiction is a historical term that has been replaced by the term "substance use disorder" but can technically refer
to behaviors outside of substance use such as gambling, internet use, and shopping. The term "addiction" has a
negative stigma and is no longer recommended. Substance use disorder is the term now used in the DSM-5-TR (the
standard classification of mental disorders used by professionals) because tolerance and physical dependence are
so often mislabeled as simply addiction. SUD is a more descriptive and accurate term that does not currently carry
the same stigma. When used clinically, "addiction" should be reserved for cases of severe SUD. In short, substances
may be addictive, but people are not addicted; they have a substance use disorder.

  SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

  Stigmatizing Language

  Negative labels are a significant barrier to many clients with substance use disorders. Negative experiences lead
  clients with SUDs to avoid health care encounters, to discharge themselves from the health care environment,
  and to be less likely to call emergency services due to perceived ridicule and maltreatment from health care
  providers. This includes stigmatizing language to refer to these clients, including the term addict. A study has
  found that when health care providers are given special training to expose them to the realities of opioid use
  disorder, they experience a significant decrease in the number of stigmatizing views they hold. It is important for
  health care providers to develop a greater sense of empathy and avoid stigmatizing language to ensure that
  clients with SUDs feel welcome and remain willing to seek out the care they require.

Intoxication
Intoxication refers to the substance-specific physiologic effects that occur after exposure to a psychoactive
substance (American Psychological Association, 2023). The effects of intoxication can vary widely depending on the
mechanism of action of the specific substance the client is exposed to. For example, someone consuming alcohol
will develop impaired decision-making capability, impaired memory, and general central nervous system (CNS)
depression. Contrast this to the client exposed to cocaine, who may experience increased energy, hallucinations,
and seizures. The intoxicating effects a client will develop are generally predictable based on the mechanism of
action of the substance used. However, the effects may be unpredictable if the client is unable or unwilling to tell
health care providers what they used or if the substance was contaminated with an entirely different agent (e.g., the
opioid fentanyl is found in many other substances of abuse, such as cocaine).

The level of intoxication that someone will experience is extremely variable and is determined by the substance
used along with the dose, frequency, and route of administration. For example, someone using the opioid heroin will
have a much stronger and faster degree of intoxication after injecting the drug intravenously as opposed to ingesting
it. Because of tolerance to drugs, to be discussed later, the amount of drug necessary to achieve the desired level of
intoxication will often increase with time.

Physical Dependence
Physical dependence refers to the homeostatic adaptation that occurs when the body is exposed to certain
450  15 · Substance Use Disorder Treatment Drugs

     substances over a prolonged period (American Psychological Association, 2023). This adaptation means that the
     body becomes used to having the effect of the drug, and when that drug is removed, the body will develop a
     withdrawal reaction, known as abstinence syndrome. Physical dependence is not just a phenomenon that occurs
     with substances of abuse; it can also be seen with pharmacologic agents such as certain antihypertensives and
     corticosteroids. Generally, all clients with opioid, nicotine, and alcohol SUDs will develop some degree of physical
     dependence that is determined by the duration and amount of drug used. Health care professionals should not
     confuse physical drug dependence with substance use disorders, because physical dependence can occur during
     routine medical care and is not always indicative of an SUD. To put it another way, not all clients with physical
     dependence will develop an SUD, but nearly all clients with an SUD will have physical dependence to their drug of
     choice.

     Psychological Dependence
     While physical dependence deals with the physiologic reactions to the presence of substances of abuse,
     psychological dependence deals with the cognitive and behavioral aspects of SUDs that develop over time. While
     the body has a physical withdrawal reaction to the removal of a substance of abuse, the brain can also have a
     cognitive reaction. The effects of psychological dependence can include cravings to use the substance in question
     as well as effects that occur if the client is attempting to, or being made to, stop using the substance, including
     anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and irritability. The client may also exhibit cognitive effects, including
     inability to concentrate, impaired memory, and poor critical thinking skills.

     Tolerance
     Tolerance refers to the decrease in response to a drug after continuous use. Clients with SUDs may not develop the
     same degree of intoxication with the dose that they were using previously, which leads to escalations in drug dose
     used over time. When escalation in dose is not sufficient or practical to achieve the desired level of intoxication, the
     client with an SUD may substitute with stronger substances (e.g., going from using beer to hard liquors) or
     alternative routes of administration (e.g., going from oral use of opioids to intravenous injection). Like physical
     dependence, tolerance can occur with a variety of different substances during their normal course of use and should
     not be seen as a definitive sign of an SUD (e.g., a client with a terminal illness needing escalating doses of opioids for
     their chronic pain).

     Withdrawal
     Withdrawal refers to physiologic and psychological consequences of discontinuation or reversal of a substance that
     the client has been using for a sufficient period. The degree of withdrawal symptoms that are experienced is
     determined by the substance used, dose, duration of use, and last time of exposure to the substance in question.
     For example, intoxication can manifest itself in many ways based on the pharmacology of the substance used, and
     withdrawal will manifest, usually, as the opposite effects of the substance used. Alcohol use can cause CNS
     depression, whereas alcohol withdrawal can manifest as severe anxiety, hallucinations, and seizures. Withdrawal
     effects can vary in severity from very mild (e.g., marijuana withdrawal) to potentially life-threatening (e.g., alcohol or
     sedative withdrawal). Due to the potential for morbidity and mortality, the risk for withdrawal must be assessed in
     the client and prompt treatment administered if warranted. Withdrawal can often be a major reason that clients will
     either be unable to stop use of their substance of choice or relapse during periods of sobriety.

     Treatment Approaches for Substance Use Disorders

     Treatment of substance use disorders is complex and challenging. Unfortunately, no single approach will work for
     every client. It is important to not manage a substance use disorder in a vacuum but instead consider all the unique
     circumstances that may affect the ultimate success of treatment. These circumstances can include the nature of the
     client's substance use, the client's ability to secure stable housing, legal concerns, and concomitant mental and
     health conditions. Often, any one of these concerns can undermine a client's ability to adhere to a safe and effective
     treatment plan. This is why it often requires a multidisciplinary team of health care providers to devise and
     implement a plan of care that will work for the individual client to achieve long-term recovery. This chapter focuses
     on medication therapy for SUDs, but it is important to understand that the synergy of using multiple treatment
     modalities will increase the chances for a successful result.

     One approach to treatment of substance use disorders includes behavioral therapy, such as cognitive behavioral
     therapy (CBT). This approach helps clients evaluate and change their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors related to

their substance use. It can also be helpful for dealing with concomitant mental health disorders that may contribute
to the client's SUD, including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.

Support groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous can be another avenue for approaching
treatment of an SUD. These groups allow for clients to connect with other individuals with similar conditions to
share their stories and receive encouragement and accountability to continue sticking with their individual plan of
care.

Finally, medications can be utilized to help individuals with SUDs achieve long-term success by helping reduce
cravings, minimize withdrawal effects, or otherwise make using a substance of choice less appealing than simple
abstention from use. Upcoming sections will discuss the mechanism of action and rationale for use of these
medications in detail.

Opioid Use

Opioids are a class of drugs that activate the opioid receptors in the CNS. Opioids have been widely used for
thousands of years and are derived from the opium poppy, Papaver somniferum. Opioids include many agents,
including naturally occurring opioids such as heroin, codeine, and morphine, along with synthetically derived agents
such as hydrocodone, oxycodone, and fentanyl. Opioids are well known to be powerful analgesics and antitussive
agents but have also been shown to carry risk for physical dependence and opioid use disorder (OUD).

The United States is dealing with one of the biggest health crises that it has ever faced--the opioid epidemic. It is
estimated that OUDs affect more than 16 million people worldwide, with over 2.1 million of those individuals
residing in the United States. The biggest risk seen with use of opioids is the chance of overdose and death, which
accounts for 120,000 deaths annually worldwide (Dydyk et al., 2023). This is true despite the fact that opioids are
tightly regulated by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Most prescription opioids (e.g., morphine,
hydrocodone) are designated as Schedule II (CII) medications, meaning they carry a substantial risk for misuse but
still have an acceptable medical use. Heroin, on the other hand, is used illicitly, as it is scheduled as Schedule I (CI),
meaning that it has a high abuse potential and no acceptable medical use. This means that if clients with an OUD are
using CII medications without a valid prescription or any CI medications, there may be legal complications (e.g.,
felony arrest), which can further complicate their road to long-term recovery.

Opioid Intoxication

Opioids produce many of their desired therapeutic effects and potentially life-threatening adverse effects via the
opioid receptors, including the mu, delta, and kappa receptors. Opioid intoxication is classically described as a triad
of symptoms consisting of reduced consciousness, slow and/or shallow breathing, and miosis (i.e., pinpoint pupils).
In addition, opioids will cause analgesia and euphoria depending on the dose and route used. Tolerance will rapidly
develop to the analgesic and euphoric properties of the opioids, which leads to a rapid dose escalation to achieve
the same effects that the client had been experiencing at lower doses. Clients receiving treatment for an OUD that
includes abstention from opioids (e.g., stays at rehabilitation facilities) may lose tolerance over time. It is vital to
educate clients about this, since clients who go on to relapse and use opioids at their previous doses may
experience more opioid effects than they were intending, leading to accidental overdose and risk for death due to
respiratory depression.
452  15 · Substance Use Disorder Treatment Drugs

     The presence of opioids in a client is not routinely measured in the blood but rather is detected using urine drug
     screens. Most traditional urine drug screens will test reliably for naturally occurring opioids such as heroin, codeine,
     and morphine but will potentially miss opioids that do not share the same chemical resemblance. Specific tests
     must be performed to detect the presence of agents such as oxycodone or fentanyl. For the clinician, it is important
     to keep in mind that a negative urine opioid screen does not always rule out the possibility that someone is
     experiencing opioid intoxication.

     Opioid Withdrawal

     Opioid withdrawal occurs in clients using opioids for a chronic period who have abruptly discontinued the drug, or
     from rapid reversal of the drug's effect with an opioid antagonist (e.g., naloxone). The onset of opioid withdrawal will
     vary from a few seconds to minutes after administration of a dose of a reversal agent like naloxone, or from hours to
     days if using an agent with a longer half-life (e.g., methadone).

     The effects of opioid withdrawal may include a variety of symptoms that may be present in some clients but not
     others. These effects fit into several categories. Gastrointestinal effects of opioid withdrawal include severe
     abdominal cramping, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Flu-like symptoms can occur including rhinorrhea, shivering,
     myalgias, and piloerection (i.e., goosebumps). Symptoms of excessive sympathetic and CNS activation include
     dilated pupils, tachycardia, anxiety, irritability, agitation, and tremor. Fortunately, withdrawal from opioids is rarely
     life-threatening, but there are rare reports of seizures occurring, so health care providers should be prepared in case
     these consequences arise.

     Drugs Used to Treat Opioid Use Disorders

     There are several drugs available to assist in the management of opioid use disorders. They include medications to
     reduce withdrawal symptoms and to help reduce clients' desire to begin using opioids again, such as methadone
     and buprenorphine. It is also important to be able to rapidly reverse the life-threatening effects of opioids in case of
     overdose; thus opioid antagonists, such as naloxone, are also used.

     Naloxone
     Naloxone is the prototypical mu opioid receptor antagonist used to rapidly reverse the life-threatening effects of
     opioid overdose. While naloxone is not used directly in the treatment of opioid use disorders, it is important that
     clients at risk for opioid overdose have quick and easy access to naloxone in case of accidental or intentional
     overdoses. This was made easier when naloxone was designated as an over-the-counter drug in March 2023.

     Naloxone may be administered in several ways but will most commonly be given intravenously in the hospital
     setting and intranasally when administered by non-health care practitioners (e.g., family members, law enforcement
     agents). Because of the nature of opioid overdoses, clients will be too sedated to administer naloxone to
     themselves. Those who are most likely to be around the client should an overdose occur (e.g., family members,
     roommates) need to be educated on proper recognition of an opioid overdose and how to administer naloxone
     should the need arise. See this video for a demonstration of intranasal naloxone administration
     (https://openstax.org/r/demonstration).

     A key limitation of naloxone is its short duration of action. While naloxone rapidly reverses the effects of opioids
     within seconds to minutes, it only lasts approximately 20-30 minutes, which is less than the duration of action of
     many opioids. It is imperative that whoever administers naloxone to a client should promptly call emergency
     services to provide definitive treatment to the client prior to the re-sedating effects of the opioid.

     Naltrexone
     Naltrexone is like naloxone in that it is a pure mu opioid receptor antagonist. The key difference between the two is
     that naltrexone is orally bioavailable. Because of this, naltrexone is not used as a rescue medication in case of opioid
     overdose but is used as a preventative agent. Once a client is abstinent from opioids for 5-7 days, they can then
     begin taking naltrexone daily. The purpose of this waiting period is to prevent an immediate withdrawal syndrome.
     Naltrexone will prevent the euphoric effects of opioids should the client relapse and begin using opioids again. As
     there are concerns about client compliance with taking a daily medication, naltrexone also comes as a long-acting,
     once-monthly injectable form to ensure compliance for this period.

Buprenorphine-Naloxone
Buprenorphine is a partial mu opioid receptor agonist that is designed to reduce the symptoms of opioid withdrawal
and cravings in clients abstaining from opioid use. The inclusion of naloxone with oral preparations of buprenorphine
may seem nonsensical given that naloxone has poor oral bioavailability, but this is done to discourage intravenous
abuse of buprenorphine, as the naloxone would cancel out the euphoric effects of buprenorphine upon injection.
The inclusion of naloxone in these oral dosages is a form of abuse deterrence. Buprenorphine by itself also comes
in a variety of dosage forms, including long-acting injectables and transdermal patches. Buprenorphine has a high
affinity for the opioid receptor and can displace other opioids that can cause opioid withdrawal to occur. Because of
this, buprenorphine should be initiated once withdrawal symptoms begin to occur to reduce these symptoms to aid
in opioid abstention.

Methadone
Methadone is a full mu opioid receptor agonist that has been used for many years to wean clients off opioids. Being
a full agonist, methadone can help reduce or prevent opioid withdrawal symptoms and allow for a gradual tapering
down of the methadone dose until the client no longer requires it. Methadone is used over other opioids because it
has a long half-life of up to 59 hours. Since methadone is a full opioid agonist and carries the same risk for abuse as
other opioids (e.g., morphine, heroin), clients are not given a full month's worth of methadone at a time like a typical
prescription. Instead, methadone must be given in a monitored setting as a part of direct observed therapy. The
long half-life of methadone allows for levels of the drug to build up in the client's body throughout the week. When
the clinic where the client receives their methadone is closed on the weekend, they still have high enough drug
levels in the body to reduce or prevent withdrawal symptoms until the clinic opens again on Monday. This is the
most traditional way for methadone to be used, but in recent years, clinicians have realized the potential for
methadone to be an effective agent to treat chronic pain, so it is important for health care providers to not assume
that all clients using methadone have an OUD.

Table 15.1 lists common medications used to treat opioid use disorders and typical routes and dosing for adult
clients.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
The primary adverse effect of opioid antagonists like naloxone and naltrexone is the risk of inducing opioid
withdrawal in clients chronically taking opioids. Clients generally should be abstaining from opioids prior to initiation
of naltrexone therapy and should be under medical supervision in the case of severe withdrawal reactions.

Since buprenorphine is a partial opioid receptor agonist, it can still cause symptoms of opioid intoxication including
CNS and respiratory depression. This is especially true for accidental ingestions of buprenorphine by children and
animals. Like other full opioid agonists, methadone carries the same risk for problematic use and risk for overdose
causing life-threatening CNS and respiratory depression. Methadone can prolong the QTc interval on an
electrocardiogram (ECG, EKG), and clients should be monitored if taking multiple medications that prolong the QTc
454  15 · Substance Use Disorder Treatment Drugs

     interval due to risk for the ventricular dysrhythmia torsades de pointes.

     Nursing Implications
     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking a medication for OUD:

     · Determine the client's last use of an opioid prior to starting naltrexone or buprenorphine-naloxone to avoid
        withdrawal reactions.

     · Advise the client and those close to them how to recognize an opioid overdose and how to administer
        intranasal naloxone.

     · Advise the client and those close to them to call emergency services any time that naloxone is given.
     · Observe for withdrawal symptoms, including anxiety, diarrhea, piloerection, and sweating.
     · Assess for changes in level of consciousness and respirations.
     · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for additional

        client teaching guidelines.

     SAFETY ALERT

     Methadone

     Methadone can have variable pharmacokinetics in clients based on their individual genetics, along with
     interacting medications that can affect its metabolism. Prior to adding any new medications to a client's regimen,
     it is imperative to check for any interactions and monitor for increased or reduced effects of methadone and

     Access for free at openstax.org
15.2 · Opioid Use Disorder Drugs                                                                                      455

adjust its dose accordingly. Clients should be educated to disclose that they are on methadone to prescribing
health care providers to ensure that these interactions are monitored. This information should include the
indication for the client's methadone use and current dose. Most current dosing information should be obtained
from the clinic where the client receives methadone. Methadone can also prolong the client's QTc interval as
measured on an ECG and can increase the risk of fatal dysrhythmias. Use cautiously in clients with a history of
congenital prolonged QT syndrome or who are taking multiple medications that prolong the QTc interval.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking a medication for OUD should:

    · Alert their health care provider about any signs of allergic reactions, including throat swelling, severe
        itching, rash, or chest tightness.

    · Alert their health care provider about any recent opioid medication use prior to starting therapy.
    · Alert other health care providers that they are taking these OUD medications, including the dose and

        frequency.
    · Take the drug with food if it causes an upset stomach.
    · Take a missed dose as soon as they remember; however, they should not take double doses.
    · Avoid abrupt discontinuation of medications used to treat OUD to avoid withdrawal symptoms.
    · Seek out care from their health care provider if they notice dark urine, light-colored stools, right upper

        quadrant pain, nausea, or yellow sclera.
    · Seek out community services to aid in SUD treatment, including organizations such as Narcotics

        Anonymous.
    · Increase intake of fluid to prevent constipation.

   TRENDING TODAY

X-Waiver Requirement

In the United States, there is a severe lack of specially trained health care practitioners able to provide OUD
treatment with agents such as methadone. There has been a push recently to increase the ability for health care
practitioners to treat clients with OUD in the primary care setting with agents such as buprenorphine.
Buprenorphine has a greater safety margin than methadone, so it can be prescribed with relative safety by
physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. In the past, nurse practitioners and physician assistants
who wanted to prescribe buprenorphine needed a DEA license in addition to specialized training to receive
authorization to prescribe buprenorphine. This authorization was known as an X-waiver. As of 2023, this X-waiver
requirement has been removed, opening the door to a much wider number of prescribers who can manage OUDs
and increasing access for those clients with an OUD. Thus, you may see a wider adoption of buprenorphine for
treatment of OUDs.

   CLINICAL TIP

Assess for Most Recent Opioid Use

When initiating therapy with buprenorphine or naltrexone, it is important to assess the client's most recent opioid
use. If therapy is initiated and the client has recently used an opioid, it is likely the client will experience
moderate to severe withdrawal symptoms. This can be difficult due to clients commonly being hesitant to share
recent drug use, so fostering an open and nonjudgmental environment will help to promote honest
communication with the client.

acceptable substance for recreational use, it is also a major contributor to significant morbidity and mortality. In the
United States alone, alcohol has been causally linked to over 200 different chronic health conditions (e.g., hepatitis,
diabetes, heart disease) and contributes to 18.5% of emergency department visits (Rehm et al., 2021). Annually,
alcohol contributes to 95,000 deaths, making it one of the leading causes of preventable death in the United States.
Despite the known harms of alcohol, it is estimated that there are 29.5 million people over age 12 in the United
States with an alcohol use disorder (AUD) (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2023a).

Alcohol works by increasing the actions of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter
in the brain. When GABA activates GABA-A receptors, it leads to an influx of chloride into the neuron,
hyperpolarizing it and making the generation of action potentials more difficult. When enhanced by the actions of
alcohol and other sedative drugs, this leads to an overall slowing of neuronal transmission and produces the
characteristic effects of alcohol intoxication (e.g., slurred speech, stumbling gait, memory impairment).

Alcohol Intoxication

Alcohol intoxication follows a predictable dose response in clients with low or no routine alcohol consumption. At
low doses, alcohol lowers inhibitions and can cause a mild euphoria. At moderate doses, ethanol will cause ataxia
(e.g., gait instability), slurred speech, and impaired memory. At higher doses, alcohol can cause total memory loss
(i.e., blackouts), CNS depression, and risk for respiratory depression. The risk for respiratory depression and death
increases significantly if consumed along with other CNS depressants (e.g., opioids, benzodiazepines). Alcohol
intoxication may also lead to nausea and vomiting. If the client is sufficiently CNS depressed and vomits, there is a
risk for the client to aspirate their stomach contents, leading to respiratory failure and death. Another concern with
alcohol intoxication is the risk for trauma, including fatal head traumas because of falls. Certain clients may be
prone to violence under the effects of alcohol, leading to altercations. Impaired decision making can lead clients to
operate motor vehicles, leading to motor vehicle accidents.

The degree of alcohol intoxication can be determined objectively by measuring the blood alcohol level directly with
a blood sample or indirectly, such as with a device that measures alcohol content in the expired air of the intoxicated
client (i.e., a breathalyzer). The legal definition of drunkenness can vary by location but is considered in many places
to be a blood alcohol level of 0.08% or 80 mg/dL.

     Alcohol Withdrawal

     Alcohol withdrawal occurs when the client who chronically uses alcohol has an abrupt discontinuation of the
     substance. Because of the chronic increase in GABA effects in the CNS, GABA receptors become downregulated.
     When alcohol is removed, the client will experience a shift toward the actions of glutamate, the major excitatory
     neurotransmitter in the CNS. This leads to the opposite actions of alcohol where clients may develop anxiety,
     restlessness, piloerection, hallucinations, and seizures. Severe alcohol withdrawal is commonly referred to as
     delirium tremens. Withdrawal from alcohol may begin as soon as a few hours after the last consumption of alcohol
     but may take 2-3 days to fully manifest. As compared to the minimal risk of death seen with opioid withdrawal,
     alcohol withdrawal can be fatal and should be managed promptly to avoid withdrawal-related delirium and seizures.

     Drugs Used to Treat Alcohol Use Disorders

     This section covers medications used in the treatment of alcohol use disorders, including agents to treat the
     potentially life-threatening withdrawal symptoms as well as agents to deter the client from further use of alcohol.
     Indications for when to use these medications, along with their own precautions, are also given to ensure the safe
     and appropriate use in clients with alcohol use disorders.

     Chlordiazepoxide
     Chlordiazepoxide falls into the category of drugs known as benzodiazepines. These drugs, like alcohol, work to
     enhance the actions of GABA to cause a general CNS depression. Benzodiazepines bind to the benzodiazepine
     receptor to allow GABA to bind to the receptor more readily, increasing its effects. Benzodiazepines are used for a
     variety of conditions, including anxiety and seizures, but in the case of AUD, they serve as a replacement for alcohol
     to treat and/or prevent withdrawal symptoms. Clients with significant AUD should be monitored for seizures with
     rescue medications, including chlordiazepoxide, available at a moment's notice. Historically, chlordiazepoxide has
     been used to treat AUD because of its long half-life. This long half-life means chlordiazepoxide stays in the body
     longer, thus preventing abrupt withdrawal symptoms from occurring. Chlordiazepoxide is still available
     commercially but has been replaced with newer benzodiazepines because of their more favorable
     pharmacokinetics. The downside of chlordiazepoxide's long half-life is that it tends to accumulate in the client's
     body, leading to oversedation, especially when combined with alcohol should the client relapse during treatment.

     Disulfiram
     Disulfiram is a drug that works by inhibiting the actions of the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. In the liver,
     alcohol is first metabolized by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase, which converts it to acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde
     is then further metabolized by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. Acetaldehyde itself is a very irritating substance that in
     excess will cause facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and headaches. Interestingly, an inherited deficiency of
     acetaldehyde dehydrogenase is found in 8% of people in the world overall, and in 36% of Asian people, leading to a
     familiar flushing reaction upon consuming alcohol (Jeon et al., 2022). Disulfiram is used to intentionally inhibit
     acetaldehyde dehydrogenase to cause a client to develop this uncomfortable reaction should they relapse and
     consume alcohol. In this way, it serves as a deterrent to alcohol consumption rather than a means to replace alcohol
     to manage withdrawal symptoms. As disulfiram is only available as an oral tablet, client compliance with disulfiram
     therapy may be poor, as they may opt to just not take the medication. To initiate disulfiram therapy, clients should
     abstain from alcohol for at least 12 hours since their last drink to avoid a flushing reaction. Clients should also be
     educated that disulfiram reactions can occur up to 2 weeks after drug discontinuation and that they should avoid
     alcohol consumption during this time to avoid flushing reactions.

     Haloperidol
     Haloperidol is in the category of medications known as first-generation antipsychotics and is traditionally used to
     treat the symptoms of schizophrenia. It works by blocking dopamine-2 (D2) receptors that cause hallucinations and
     agitation. Haloperidol is sedating, and this is thought to help manage the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal in
     conjunction with benzodiazepine therapy.

     Lorazepam
     Like chlordiazepoxide, lorazepam is a benzodiazepine used to treat anxiety and seizures and to control the
     symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Replacement of alcohol with lorazepam helps prevent and/or minimize withdrawal
     symptoms, and it is the drug of choice to treat alcohol withdrawal-induced seizures. In the hospital setting,

validated scales such as the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-Revised (CIWA-Ar) use a
symptoms-based approach to manage the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal as they occur and allow for a more
customized approach based on which withdrawal symptoms manifest in the client and their severity. These scores
are recorded by the client's nurse initially every 4 hours and can be checked less frequently as the client's
withdrawal symptoms improve. This allows providers to determine the most appropriate dose of lorazepam needed
to manage the client's current withdrawal symptoms.

Table 15.4 lists common medications used to treat alcohol use disorders and typical routes and dosing for adult
clients.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Like alcohol, the main adverse effects of chlordiazepoxide and lorazepam are sedation and memory impairment.
Clients should be educated to avoid operating heavy machinery while using these medications. Use of
benzodiazepines is contraindicated in pregnancy.

The main adverse reactions seen with disulfiram occur when clients drink alcohol while taking the medication and
include nausea, vomiting, skin flushing, and feeling hot.

Haloperidol can lower the seizure threshold, which increases the risk of the client developing alcohol withdrawal-
related seizures. Because of this, haloperidol is not routinely recommended for this indication. Other side effects
associated with haloperidol include sedation and the rare risk of sudden cardiac death (Dar et al., 2020).

     Nursing Implications
     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking a medication for AUD:

     · Advise the client to avoid consuming alcohol with any of these medications due to the risk for adverse
        reactions. Even small amounts of alcohol may cause a reaction.

     · Monitor for seizure activity in clients receiving haloperidol for treatment of alcohol withdrawal.
     · Monitor the client's liver function tests to assess for liver toxicity.
     · Use the CIWA-Ar scale to assess alcohol withdrawal symptoms to determine appropriate dosing of lorazepam.
     · Advise clients to not take multiple CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, lorazepam, and chlordiazepoxide) at the

        same time to avoid excessive CNS and respiratory depression.
     · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for additional

        client teaching guidelines.

     SAFETY ALERT

     Benzodiazepines

     Benzodiazepines such as lorazepam and chlordiazepoxide should generally not be used at the same time as
     other CNS depressants such as alcohol, muscle relaxants, or opioids, as these effects can synergize and increase
     the risk of severe CNS and respiratory depression. Concomitant use of any combination of these agents should be
     done under the direction of a skilled clinician.

  CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

  The client using a medication to treat AUD should:

      · Alert their health care provider about any signs of allergic reactions, including throat swelling, severe
          itching, rash, or chest tightness.

      · Alert other health care providers that they are taking these medications, including the dose and frequency.
      · Take the drug with food if it causes an upset stomach.
      · Take a missed dose as soon as they remember; however, they should not take double doses.
      · Avoid consuming these medications with alcohol.
      · Avoid taking other medications that cause sedation.
      · Avoid consuming nontraditional sources of alcohol, including mouthwashes, cough syrups, hand

          sanitizers, and any other product that contains alcohol.
      · Seek out community organizations such as Alcoholics Anonymous to aid in the treatment of AUD.

     CLINICAL TIP

 Assess for Cognitive Impairment in Older Adults

  Older adult clients receiving benzodiazepines such as chlordiazepoxide and lorazepam to treat an AUD should be
  assessed for cognitive impairment (e.g., memory impairment, executive dysfunction), because this client
  population is more sensitive to the sedative effects of the medications.

  FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

  Benzodiazepines

  The use of benzodiazepines, including chlordiazepoxide and lorazepam, exposes users to risks of abuse,
  misuse, and addiction (dependence), which can lead to overdose or death.

  Disulfiram should never be administered to a client when they are in a state of alcohol intoxication or without
  their full knowledge. The provider should instruct relatives accordingly.

Nicotine Use

Nicotine is derived from the tobacco plant and has been in use for thousands of years. It is a highly addictive
substance that facilitates great harm in clients who have nicotine use disorder (NUD). It is estimated that in the
United States, more than 480,000 deaths are attributable to tobacco products, making it the number-one cause of
preventable death in the country. While tobacco use has declined over the past several decades, it is estimated that
50.6 million people in the United States currently use tobacco products (Cornelius et al., 2020). Tobacco products
come in a variety of forms, including cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco, and vaping devices. Nicotine itself is not
462  15 · Substance Use Disorder Treatment Drugs

     necessarily that toxic in doses used in clients with NUDs, but it is often the other components found in tobacco
     products (e.g., formaldehyde, lead, arsenic, benzene, carbon monoxide) that the client is exposed to that lead to a
     variety of chronic health conditions such as cancer, respiratory disease, and cardiovascular disease.

     Nicotine works as an agonist at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. At high doses, nicotine can stimulate dopamine
     release in the reward center of the brain, leading to many of the craving symptoms clients experience when
     attempting to treat NUD. Nicotine also can increase alertness and provide a feeling of pleasure and relaxation.
     Additionally, nicotine is an appetite suppressant, leading to some weight loss. Nicotine at extremely high doses (e.g.,
     a child ingests unsecured vaping solution or swallows chewing tobacco) can cause significantly more toxic effects,
     including risks for dysrhythmia, seizures, and respiratory failure, and should be treated as a medical emergency. A
     relatively recent development in the consumption of nicotine is the development of vaping devices that can provide
     nicotine without the need to inhale hot gases as one would with a traditional cigarette. Some clients may harbor the
     idea that vaping devices do not contain nicotine or are safer than other sources of nicotine, but the health care
     provider should educate clients that these devices can be just as addictive as smoking. Vaping devices provide an
     additional challenge as this market is not as tightly regulated as other forms of tobacco, so there are no child-
     resistant safety features required on these products. Poor regulation also means that vaping solutions have been
     found to contain contaminants such as heavy metals, which may cause their own health risks. Vaping device
     malfunction has also led to device explosion, causing trauma to the hands and face.

     Nicotine Withdrawal

     After chronic use of tobacco-containing products, the body will develop a degree of tolerance and physical
     dependence. Discontinuation results in nicotine withdrawal that makes treatment of a NUD extremely difficult with
     exceedingly high relapse rates. Reactions that occur during nicotine withdrawal include anxiety, difficulty
     concentrating, irritable mood, and severe cravings for nicotine. The onset of nicotine withdrawal depends on how
     much nicotine is built up in the client's body. It usually begins within 24 hours after discontinuation of nicotine-
     containing products and can last from days to weeks, making relapse rates quite high without the assistance of
     behavioral and pharmacologic intervention. Like opioid withdrawal, nicotine withdrawal is not expected to be fatal.

     Drugs Used to Treat Nicotine Use Disorders

     This section covers medications used to treat nicotine use disorders. These include medications that are able to
     replace the nicotine that a client was previously using along with agents that help reduce the withdrawal symptoms
     and feelings of craving that may lead to clients relapsing and using nicotine again.

     Bupropion
     Bupropion is traditionally used for the treatment of anxiety and depression, but it has also been found to help aid in
     the treatment of NUDs. Bupropion's mechanism of action is that it inhibits the reuptake of dopamine and
     norepinephrine. How bupropion works to treat NUDs is unclear currently, but it is theorized that bupropion reduces
     craving symptoms for nicotine by increasing dopamine activity in the reward center of the brain. Bupropion can be
     advantageous in those individuals with concomitant NUD and depression and/or anxiety. Since bupropion does not
     have any actions at the nicotinic receptor, it is safe if clients relapse and begin using nicotine-containing products
     while taking bupropion.

     Nicotine (NicoDerm/Nicorette)
     Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is designed to replace the nicotine products that a client is currently using with
     products only containing nicotine. This helps reduce withdrawal symptoms and aids in the successful transition to
     using no nicotine. These come in a variety of dosage forms, including gums, patches, nasal sprays, lozenges, and
     inhalers. The appropriate dose to start a client on is highly dependent on the amount of nicotine being used by the
     client prior to quitting, due to physical and psychological dependence developed at higher doses.

     While clients have successfully treated NUDs with vaping devices, it is important to recommend using FDA-approved
     products first, as these are highly regulated products and are held to a high standard for manufacturing and
     packaging. This is different from unregulated nicotine-containing vaping solutions, which have no FDA oversight and
     have been found to contain unadvertised products such as the heavy metals chromium, nickel, and lead. It is also
     important for clients who relapse and start using nicotine-containing products again to discontinue their NRT. This
     prevents the client from being exposed to even higher doses of nicotine than they were originally using and reduces

the risk for adverse effects.

Varenicline
Varenicline is a partial nicotine receptor agonist that has a greater affinity for the receptor than nicotine itself. Just
as buprenorphine partially activates opioid receptors to reduce withdrawal symptoms and prevent other opioids
from working as well, varenicline possesses the same actions for nicotine. Nicotine is safe to use if the client
relapses and begins using nicotine-containing products again. In fact, it is recommended that varenicline be
initiated 1 week prior to the chosen quit date to ease the transition into nicotine abstinence.

Table 15.6 lists common medications used to treat nicotine use disorder and typical routes and dosing for adult
clients.

Drug                  Routes and Dosage Ranges

Bupropion             150 mg orally twice daily. Maximum dose: 300 mg/day.

                      Days 8-84: 1 mg orally twice daily.

TABLE 15.6 Drug Emphasis Table: Medications Used to Treat Nicotine Use Disorder (source: https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/)

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Bupropion should be used cautiously in clients with a history of seizures, as this can be worsened in the presence of
bupropion. Bupropion, like other antidepressant medications, can increase risk for suicidal ideation, so it is
important to educate the client to monitor for depressed mood and suicidal thoughts. Bupropion can also induce
manic symptoms if the client has bipolar disorder. Bupropion should be avoided if the client is taking any other
drugs that increase norepinephrine actions, such as selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (e.g.,
duloxetine, venlafaxine).

Side effects of nicotine replacement products generally occur when using doses exceeding what the client was
using in their previous choice of nicotine-containing product. Common adverse effects include headache, oral
irritation, dyspepsia, and cough.

Common adverse effects seen with varenicline include nausea, vomiting, and abnormal dreams. Varenicline should
be used cautiously in clients with a history of depression and suicidal ideation or suicide attempts, as it has been
shown to increase these symptoms in some clients.

     Nursing Implications
     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking a medication for NUD:

     · Monitor for all sources of nicotine exposure other than just cigarettes, such as chewing tobacco and vaping
        devices.

     · Screen for history of seizures in clients receiving bupropion.
     · Advise discontinuing NRT if the client decided to begin using nicotine-containing products again.
     · Screen for use of nicotine vaping solutions when asking about nicotine use.
     · Monitor for signs and symptoms of worsening depression/suicidal thoughts while clients are taking bupropion

        or varenicline.
     · Provide positive reinforcement to clients attempting to stop their nicotine use to help encourage compliance

        with their NUD therapy.
     · Monitor sleep patterns.
     · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for additional

        client teaching guidelines.

   SAFETY ALERT

Nicotine Replacement Therapy

Clients should discontinue all nicotine replacement therapies if tobacco product consumption resumes. If not,
excessive nicotine toxicity (e.g., tachycardia, dizziness) may occur. Nicotine-containing products should also be
secured in a manner to avoid accidental pediatric exposures, as nicotine exposures in young children can cause
severe toxicity, including the risk for respiratory failure and death. Avoid nicotine sprays in clients with a history
of asthma, as this can lead to asthma exacerbations.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking a medication to treat nicotine use disorder should:

    · Alert their health care provider about any signs of allergic reactions, including throat swelling, severe
        itching, rash, or chest tightness.

    · Notify their health care provider if palpitations, chest pain, anxiety, insomnia, and/or unintended weight
        loss occurs.

    · Inform other health care providers that they are taking these medications, including the dose and
        frequency.

    · Take the drug with food if it causes an upset stomach.
    · Take a missed dose as soon as they remember; however, they should not take double doses.
    · Avoid using nicotine-containing products while using nicotine replacement therapy.
    · Apply nicotine patches to clean, dry areas of skin.
    · Remove nicotine patches prior to undergoing MRI procedures and resume after the procedure is complete.
    · Alert their health care provider if they feel any worsening depression or suicidal thoughts.
    · Increase their fluid intake to avoid constipation.
    · Have sugar-free hard candy or gum on hand to alleviate dry mouth.
    · Reach out to support groups to receive additional encouragement and motivation to remain compliant

        with NUD therapy.

   CLINICAL TIP

Assess for Changes in Dreaming in Clients Receiving Varenicline

Clients receiving varenicline are known to develop particularly vivid dreams, which can include nightmares.
Clients should be educated about this possibility and report back about any dream changes, as this may require a
change in therapy.

CHAPTER OUTLINE
16.1 Introduction to the Heart, Circulation, and Blood Flow
16.2 Pumping Action of the Heart
16.3 Conduction of Electrical Impulses

INTRODUCTION Cardiovascular diseases are a group of conditions related to the heart and vasculature. It includes
coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, dysrhythmias, valvular heart disease, and others
(World Health Organization, 2021). Approximately 127 million people in the United States have cardiovascular
disease (Tsao et al., 2023). In 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that 1 in every 5
deaths in the United States is due to heart disease, and the estimated cost of heart disease is $239.9 billion per year
(CDC, 2022).
Nurses are integral to the treatment of clients with cardiovascular disease and have many roles, including
cardiovascular recovery and rehabilitation (Zhang et al., 2021). The heart is at the center of the cardiovascular
system, which is a complex organ system in the human body. The heart receives deoxygenated blood from venous
circulation, delivers deoxygenated blood to the lungs for gas exchange, and pumps newly oxygenated blood to the
tissues for use. The reception and pumping of blood is conducted via a coordinated cardiac cycle and is regulated by
an electrical conduction system. This chapter will serve as an introduction to the heart and cardiovascular system
and will lay the foundation for subsequent chapters focused on the pharmacology of cardiovascular-active drugs.

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 16.1.1 Describe the anatomy of the heart.
         · 16.1.2 Discuss the function of the heart.
         · 16.1.3 Explain circulation and blood flow within the body.
         · 16.1.4 Differentiate between systemic arterial pressure and venous pressure.

     Anatomy of the Heart

     The heart is a fist-sized organ positioned in the central thoracic cavity, with the bulk of the heart to the left of the
     sternum. The heart is surrounded by a fibrous, layered sac called the pericardium. The pericardium protects the
     heart and provides a low-friction environment for the heart to pump in. The pericardium has two layers: the outer
     fibrous layer and the inner serous layer. The serous layer is made up of the parietal pericardium (which faces the
     fibrous layer of the pericardium) and the visceral pericardium (which lines the external heart wall). Between the
     parietal and visceral pericardium, there is fluid that decreases friction as the heart pumps.

     The heart walls are composed of three layers: endocardium (inner layer), myocardium (middle layer), and
     epicardium (outer layer). The epicardium is identical to, and another term for, the visceral pericardium. The
     myocardium is the heart muscle that contracts to pump blood throughout the circulatory system. The cells of the
     myocardium are called cardiac myocytes, which are cardiac muscle cells. The endocardium is the layer that lines the
     inner chambers and structures of the heart, including the valves.

     Figure 16.2 depicts the structure of the heart. The heart is comprised of four chambers. The two upper chambers
     are called the right and left atria (singular: atrium), which are positioned above the right and left ventricles,
     respectively.

     FIGURE 16.2 The human heart is structured to pump oxygenated blood to the body for use by the tissues. (credit: modification of work
     from Anatomy and Physiology 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

     Within the heart, valves direct blood flow and prevent the backflow of blood into the heart. These valves open and
     close based on pressure gradients at coordinated times within the cardiac cycle. Atrioventricular valves are
     positioned between the atria and ventricles. the tricuspid valve separates the right atrium and ventricle, and the
     mitral valve separates the left atrium and ventricle. There are also two valves positioned between the ventricles and
     the blood vessels they pump into. The aortic valve is positioned between the left ventricle and the aorta, and the
     pulmonary valve (also known as the pulmonic valve) is situated between the left ventricle and the pulmonary artery.
     These valves are referred to as semilunar valves because their leaflets resemble crescent moons.

The right side of the heart receives deoxygenated blood via the inferior and superior venae cavae (plural term).
These are large veins that bring blood from the body and empty into the right atrium. The inferior vena cava (singular
term) returns blood from the lower portions of the body, and the superior vena cava returns blood from the upper
parts of the body. The heart delivers blood to and receives blood from the lungs via pulmonary arteries and
pulmonary veins. The pulmonary veins carry oxygenated blood from the lungs back to the left atrium of the heart.

Although the heart pumps oxygenated blood to all tissues, the cardiac tissue also needs a supply of oxygenated
blood. This is accomplished via coronary arteries that branch off of the aorta, which fill with blood during systole
(when the heart pumps). Atherosclerotic plaques can form over time in the coronary arteries. This can eventually
block blood flow to the heart, leading to ischemia (oxygen deprivation) and tissue death. This is known as a
myocardial infarction, or heart attack (see Lipid-Lowering Drugs).

  The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute provides this video showcasing a three-dimensional image of the
  chambers of the heart.

Function of the Heart

The main function of the heart is to pump oxygenated blood to the body for use by the tissues. To accomplish this,
the heart receives deoxygenated blood from the venous vasculature and pumps the deoxygenated blood to the
lungs, where gas exchange occurs. Gas exchange consists of carbon dioxide leaving the blood via exhalation from
the lungs and oxygen moving from the lungs into the bloodstream. Oxygenated blood then returns to the heart and is
pumped to the body for use by all the tissues. More information on the cardiac cycle is provided in the next section.

Blood is pumped via the ventricles. The right ventricle pumps against a relatively low pressure in the pulmonary
system, whereas the left ventricle must pump against systemic arterial pressure to deliver oxygen. Because of this,
the left ventricle is more muscular and powerful than the right ventricle.

Circulation and Blood Flow

Blood circulates from the heart to every tissue of the body. This occurs through a network of arteries, capillaries,
and veins. Generally, arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart and to the tissues (Arteries = Away).
Arteries are thicker-walled blood vessels and give rise to systemic arterial pressure (described in the following
section). Arteries branch into arterioles (small arteries), which subdivide into even smaller branches called
capillaries. Capillaries are tiny, thin-walled blood vessels that facilitate the exchange of nutrients and oxygen
between blood and tissues. Venules (small veins) then collect deoxygenated blood from capillaries, channeling it
into larger vessels known as veins, which return deoxygenated blood to the heart.

As mentioned previously, there is a separate circuit by which deoxygenated blood is delivered to and from the lungs
for oxygenation (see Figure 16.3). This demonstrates an exception to the previously described system for arteries
and veins. In the pulmonary circuit, deoxygenated blood is pumped from the right ventricle into the pulmonary
artery (in systemic circulation, arteries carry only oxygenated blood). Once the deoxygenated blood is delivered to
the lungs, gas exchange occurs. Carbon dioxide leaves the blood and is exhaled, and oxygen enters the blood. Once
oxygenated, the blood returns to the heart via the pulmonary veins and is then pumped to the rest of the body for
use.

     just referred to as blood pressure. It is the pressure that can be measured in the arteries. It is dependent on both
     cardiac output (the amount of blood pumped from the left ventricle per unit of time) and systemic vascular
     resistance (the resistance to blood flow within the artery, determined by the arterial diameter, which changes based
     on physiologic conditions). A higher cardiac output or higher arterial resistance increases systemic arterial pressure.
     Systemic arterial pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and often is communicated in a clinical
     setting by systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure. Systolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries
     during systole, or ventricular contraction (heart pumping). Diastolic blood pressure is lower and is the pressure in
     the arteries during diastole, or ventricular filling/relaxation (between each pump).

     Mean arterial pressure (MAP) also provides a measure of systemic arterial pressure throughout the cardiac cycle. A
     typical MAP is 70-100 mm Hg. It is calculated using the following formula:

     Arterial blood pressure facilitates the delivery of nutrients and oxygen to the tissues (perfusion) and, as such, is
     highly regulated. It must be high enough to maintain perfusion, but chronically high blood pressure has both acute
     and chronic risks.

     Regulation of blood pressure occurs through several interdependent mechanisms. A summary of these mechanisms
     follows:

         · Baroreceptor reflex: Baroreceptors function as sensors and can sense changes in blood pressure and blood
             volume. When baroreceptors sense low blood pressure or volume, they cause compensatory physiologic
             changes in the body to raise the blood pressure or volume. One of these changes is net increased activity of
             the sympathetic nervous system (the fight-or-flight response mediated by epinephrine and norepinephrine,
             leading to increased vasoconstriction and, thus, increased arterial pressure). This immediate effect on the
             sympathetic nervous system is responsible for maintaining blood pressure upon abrupt changes, such as
             when someone moves from a recumbent position to standing quickly. Other changes that occur in response to

        baroreceptor activation are increased secretion of the hormones renin and aldosterone, which increase
        circulating volume.
    · Antidiuretic hormone: Antidiuretic hormone (also known as vasopressin) is released in response to low blood
        pressure (among other triggers). It facilitates passive water reabsorption in the collecting duct of the kidneys,
        which increases circulating blood volume and cardiac output and thus systemic arterial pressure. Vasopressin
        can be administered therapeutically to maintain blood pressure in clients with vasodilatory or septic shock
        (Evans et al., 2021).
    · Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS): In the RAAS system, renin facilitates the conversion of
        angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting
        enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II causes vasoconstriction, which 1) increases vascular resistance and thus
        systemic arterial pressure; 2) increases the amount of sodium and water resorption in the kidneys, which
        increases circulating blood volume, cardiac output, and thus systemic arterial pressure; 3) increases secretion
        of antidiuretic hormone, described above; and 4) increases the release of aldosterone. Aldosterone is a
        hormone that upregulates a pump called the sodium-potassium-ATPase. This pump facilitates the transport of
        sodium (and water) back into the body, which increases blood volume and cardiac output and thus systemic
        arterial pressure. Aldosterone also causes increased potassium excretion. Many drugs work on the RAAS
        system to regulate blood pressure and will be discussed in Heart Failure Drugs. These include angiotensin-
        converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and aldosterone
        antagonists such as spironolactone (Unger et al., 2020).

Normal blood pressure is generally less than 120/80 mm Hg (American Heart Association, 2022). Hypertension
refers to clients with blood pressure greater than 130-140/80-90 mm Hg (Unger et al., 2020; Whelton et al., 2018),
and hypotension refers to clients with low blood pressure (systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg). Any blood
pressure higher than 180/120 mm Hg is considered a hypertensive crisis and requires immediate medical attention
to prevent or mitigate acute end-organ damage (Whelton et al., 2018). Antihypertensive and Antianginal Drugs
includes a detailed description of hypertension.

Venous Pressure

Venous pressure is the pressure within the veins. Venous pressure is much lower than arterial pressure. While
arterial blood is driven by pumping of the muscular heart (left ventricle), venous circulation is powered by
contraction of the muscles surrounding the veins that squeeze the blood through. Veins have one-way valves that
direct blood toward the heart and prevent backflow. Veins deliver deoxygenated blood to the right atrium, which is
then pumped to the pulmonary circuit for oxygenation, returned to the heart, and then is pumped throughout the
body again. A normal central venous pressure (measured using an invasive technique in the vena cava) is 8-12 mm
Hg (Shah & Louis, 2022).

     An Introduction to the Pumping Action of the Heart

     The heart pumps in a complex and coordinated cycle to move blood between the chambers of the heart, the lungs,
     and the associated blood vessels.

     Ventricular systole (or just systole if not specified) refers to the active pumping or contraction of the ventricles. The
     contraction of the heart muscle increases pressure within the ventricles. When the pressure in the ventricles
     exceeds the pressure in the attached blood vessel (right ventricle: pulmonary artery; left ventricle: aorta), it causes
     the connected semilunar valve to open, and blood is ejected into the vessel. On the right side of the heart,
     contraction of the right ventricle during systole causes the pulmonary valve to open, and blood then flows through
     the open valve into the pulmonary artery. On the left side of the heart, contraction of the left ventricle during systole
     causes the aortic valve to open, and blood then flows through the open valve and into the aorta. After systole, the
     ventricular heart muscle relaxes, and the chamber refills with blood. This phase of relaxation and filling is referred to
     as ventricular diastole, or just diastole.

     Note: When reading the terms systole and diastole, it is reasonable to assume this is referring to ventricular systole
     and diastole. Typically, atrial systole and atrial diastole will be noted as such.

     Generally, the right and left sides of the heart pump simultaneously, with the two ventricles contracting nearly in
     tandem. While the ventricles are contracting during ventricular systole, both of the atria are filling with blood (which
     will next travel to the associated ventricles during ventricular diastole or filling). The atria undergo systole
     (contraction) and diastole (relaxation/filling) as well.

     The left and right sides of the heart have similar functions but vary considerably in their pumping ability. For
     example, the left ventricle must pump blood into the high-pressure arterial circulation (~90 mm Hg), whereas the
     right ventricle pumps blood only through the low-pressure pulmonary circulation (8-20 mm Hg). Accordingly, the
     left ventricle must work harder as compared to the right. When clients experience heart failure, it is commonly an
     issue with the left ventricle's ability to pump (e.g., heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; see Heart Failure
     Drugs). One way to alleviate heart failure symptoms is by reducing systemic arterial pressure with drugs, making it
     easier for the left ventricle to pump blood out.

     Cardiac Cycle

     The cardiac cycle is a complex cycle that relies on pressure gradients and valves to direct blood through the heart
     and pulmonary circuit and into the systemic circulation. Blood flows from areas of higher pressure to areas of lower
     pressure based on pressure gradients, or differences in pressure among different spaces. The phases of the cardiac
     cycle are systole (contraction/pumping) and diastole (relaxation/filling), as described in the previous section. This
     section will follow the path of blood through the heart, pulmonary, and circulatory system (see Figure 16.4):

         · Right atrial diastole (i.e., filling the right atrium): Blood enters the heart via the superior and inferior venae
             cavae. Blood flows directly into the right atrium. The right atrium fills with blood, and during this time the
             tricuspid valve is closed. Concurrently, the right ventricle is pumping a different portion of blood.

         · Right atrial systole/right ventricular diastole (i.e., pumping blood from the right atrium to fill the right
            ventricle): The atria are then triggered to contract by the electrical conduction system of the heart. During
             atrial contraction (known as atrial systole or atrial kick), the pressure increases within the cavity of the atrium
             and eventually exceeds the pressure in the right ventricle. This causes the tricuspid valve to open, and blood
             flows into the right ventricle (ventricular diastole). The pulmonary valve is closed.

         · Right ventricular systole (i.e., pumping blood from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery): The ventricles
             are triggered to contract by the electrical conduction system of the heart, starting ventricular systole. During
             ventricular systole, the pressure in the ventricle increases and becomes greater than the pressure within the
             pulmonary artery, causing the pulmonary valve to open. Blood flows into the pulmonary artery and then the
             lungs for gas exchange. Concurrently, atria are refilled with a new portion of blood.

         · Left atrial diastole (i.e., filling the left atrium): Blood returns from the lungs via the pulmonary vein and flows
             directly into the left atrium. The mitral valve is closed.

         · Left atrial systole/left ventricular diastole (i.e., pumping blood from the left atrium to fill the left ventricle): The
             atria are then triggered to contract by the electrical conduction system of the heart. During atrial contraction
             (known as atrial systole or atrial kick), the pressure in the left atrium eventually exceeds that of the left

   ventricle. This causes the mitral valve to open, and blood flows into the left ventricle (ventricular diastole). The
   aortic valve is closed.
· Left ventricular systole (i.e., pumping blood from the left ventricle to the body): The ventricles are triggered to
   contract by the electrical conduction system of the heart, starting ventricular systole. During ventricular
   systole, contraction of the left ventricle causes the pressure within the cavity to increase. It eventually
   exceeds the pressure within the aorta, and the aortic valve opens. Blood flows into the aorta and then the
   lungs for gas exchange. Concurrently, the atria are refilling with a new portion of blood.
· Systemic circulation: Oxygenated blood is delivered to the tissues via arteries and capillaries, and
   deoxygenated blood returns to the heart via veins and the venae cavae to restart the cycle with right atrial
   diastole.

Cardiac Output and Hemodynamics

Cardiac output is the amount of blood being pumped from the heart into the systemic circulation per unit of time.
Cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, and mean arterial pressure are related by the following formula:

As shown by this formula, cardiac output contributes to the mean arterial pressure. Cardiac output is dependent on
the heart rate (the number of times the ventricle contracts per unit of time) and stroke volume (the volume of blood
ejected with each contraction). The stroke volume (and thus cardiac output) is dependent on multiple variables:
478  16 · Introduction to the Cardiovascular System

         · Preload: This is the volume of blood that fills the left ventricle at the end of diastole. A higher preload leads to
             a higher stroke volume. Preload is sometimes referred to as left ventricular end diastolic volume or measured
             by left ventricular end diastolic pressure because pressure and volume correlate. Preload is dependent on the
             volume of circulating blood and the degree of venous vasoconstriction. A higher circulating blood volume or
             less venous vasoconstriction increases preload. Diuretics are drugs that decrease circulating blood volume,
             thus decreasing preload.

         · Afterload: This is the amount of systemic pressure the heart must overcome to eject blood during systole.
             Higher afterload decreases stroke volume. Drugs that decrease systemic vascular resistance, such as
             antihypertensive medications, decrease afterload.

         · Contractility: Cardiac contractility refers to the strength of the force of left ventricular contraction. Increased
             activation of the sympathetic nervous system increases cardiac contractility via the actions of epinephrine and
             norepinephrine. Ischemia can decrease cardiac contractility. Increased calcium levels can increase cardiac
             contractility. Various drugs can affect myocardial contractility. A class of drugs called inotropes increase
             cardiac contractility. Some drugs can actually decrease cardiac contractility as a side effect.

             the heart.

     Electrical Conduction System of the Heart

     The heart's rate and rhythm are controlled by a conduction system that uses electrical impulses to cause the heart
     to pump blood throughout the body.

     The conduction system of the heart generates and carries the impulses that initiate and regulate the heart rate. The
     heart rate can be measured by palpation of the pulse on an artery such as the radial artery (known as a peripheral
     pulse) or by auscultation on the chest at the apex of the heart (known as an apical pulse). Each beat correlates with
     ventricular contraction. The pacemaker of the heart is the sinoatrial (SA) node in the atrium, which possesses
     automaticity, or the ability to spontaneously generate an electrical impulse that initiates the heartbeat. The impulse
     from the sinoatrial node is conducted through a specialized pathway down through the ventricles and eventually
     reaches the cardiac muscle cells, or cardiac myocytes, to trigger coordinated contraction of the heart chambers at
     their respective times in the cardiac cycle.

      The Conduction System of the Heart

       impulses)
       The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute provides a video with information about the heartbeat and a video
       with an image of the conduction system, including the pacemaker of the heart.

     The origination of the impulse from the sinoatrial node in the atrium and the pathway of conduction is what leads to
     a normal heart rate (60-100 beats per minute) and rhythm, which is called normal sinus rhythm.

     Impulse generation and conduction work through depolarization of the cells in the conduction system.
     Depolarization is the cell membrane potential increasing or becoming more positive as compared to its
     surroundings. The cells of the cardiac conduction system maintain a negative resting voltage (i.e., ionic charge), also
     known as membrane potential. An action potential describes rapid depolarization of the cell, followed by
     repolarization (the cell membrane potential decreasing back to the resting voltage).

     The mechanisms for depolarization and repolarization vary, but in general, they rely on electrolytes or electrically

charged ions. Positively charged ions such as sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), or calcium (Ca2+) entering the cell make
it less negative and mediate repolarization. Ions or substances entering the cell is referred to as influx. Positively
charged ions such as Na+, K+, or Ca2+ leaving the cell make it more negative and mediate repolarization. Ions or
substances leaving the cell is referred to as efflux. Given how central electrolytes are to cardiac function and the
electrical conduction system of the heart, it is important to monitor clients' blood levels to ensure they are
sufficient. Hypokalemia, or a low potassium blood level, is a risk factor for dysrhythmias and should be avoided.

Automaticity
Automaticity describes a cell's ability to spontaneously generate an electrical impulse that allows it to function as
the pacemaker of the heart. In a healthy heart, the sinoatrial node has an intrinsic rate of spontaneous impulses of
60-100 beats per minute (Kashou et al., 2022). The atrioventricular node, bundle of His, and Purkinje fibers also
possess automaticity; however, their lower rate of spontaneous impulses (varying at 20-40 beats per minute) are
suppressed by the higher rate of the sinoatrial node. In a healthy heart, the atrioventricular node, bundle of His, and
Purkinje tissues do not demonstrate their automaticity.

Automaticity in the pacemaker cells is a result of a spontaneous current, called the pacemaker or "funny" current.
This current spontaneously and slowly raises the membrane potential of the pacemaker cell until it reaches a
threshold level. At the threshold, an action potential is triggered. In pacemaker cells, the rapid depolarization phase
of the action potential is mediated by calcium influx, and repolarization is mediated by potassium efflux (i.e., leaving
the cell).

Conductivity
The cells of the cardiac conduction system receive the spontaneous impulses from the sinoatrial node and conduct,
or carry, the signal through the atrioventricular node and then the bundle of His, which then splits into the left and
right bundle branches. Each bundle branch gives rise to Purkinje fibers, which conduct the impulse into the cardiac
muscle to facilitate contraction. Depolarization spreads from cell to cell via gap junctions, which are membranous
connections between the cells. Figure 16.5 depicts the structures of the cardiac conduction system.

Conductivity is mediated by action potentials. The resting membrane potential is negative. During conduction, rapid
depolarization is mediated by sodium influx. The cell remains depolarized for a time period while calcium influx
(through L-type calcium channels) and potassium efflux are relatively balanced, and then repolarization occurs via
potassium efflux. A refractory period follows depolarization when the sodium channels that usually mediate
depolarization are inactive. During the refractory period, the cell cannot be depolarized until the refractory (or
inactive) period is over.

     Myocardial Contractility
     The cardiac myocytes receive the electrical impulse from the conduction tissue and are stimulated to contract in a
     process called excitation-contraction coupling. During an action potential, calcium enters the cardiac myocyte via L-
     type calcium channels and then interacts with receptors called ryanodine receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum,
     which is a tubular structure found within the cell that stores calcium. This causes release of comparatively massive
     amounts of calcium into the cytoplasm from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in a process called calcium-induced
     calcium release. The high levels of calcium cause downstream contraction of the cardiac myocytes.

     Myocardial contraction occurs due to the interaction of two proteins called actin and myosin that each form
     separate long filaments. At rest, the interaction between actin and myosin is blocked by a protein called
     tropomyosin. Calcium causes changes in tropomyosin (via a protein called troponin), rendering it unable to inhibit
     the interaction of actin and myosin. Uninhibited, filaments of actin and myosin attach and slide past each other,
     which is the basis for myocyte contraction.

     Electrocardiography

     Electrocardiography (EKG or ECG) is a common diagnostic tool that allows health care professionals to monitor
     various aspects of the client's heart including rate, rhythm, and the presence of ischemia. It is also used for
     monitoring medications. In a typical ECG, 12 leads are placed on the client's chest and limbs in a specific orientation
     that allows them to detect the electrical activity of the cardiac conduction system. The client's heart rate and rhythm
     are recorded visually through waves and intervals, which represent various aspects of conduction through the heart.
     Figure 16.6 shows an example of an electrocardiogram and its components.

Waveforms
When the cardiac electrical impulse is conducted in the direction of a lead, it creates an upward deflection; when
traveling away, it causes a downward deflection. These are called waveforms. A segment on an ECG is the space
between two waves and does not include a waveform. An interval, on the other hand, includes the space between
two waves and a waveform. The final ECG represents the summation of the impulses from all leads. This creates a
pattern of waves for each cardiac cycle (heartbeat) that repeats for the duration of monitoring.

In a healthy heart, each cardiac cycle consists of a P wave, followed by a QRS complex (a combination of a Q wave, R
wave, and S wave), and lastly a T wave. The P wave represents atrial depolarization, which is when the electrical
impulse travels from the sinoatrial node through the atria to cause atrial contraction. After the P wave, the tracing
comes back to baseline as the signal is transmitted through the AV node. The QRS complex represents ventricular
depolarization, which is the electrical conduction signal that causes ventricular contraction or ventricular systole.
Finally, the T wave represents ventricular repolarization. (Atrial repolarization is not visualized.) The interval from
the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave is called the QT interval. Segments are the regions
between two waves.

intervals, plus the P-R and S-T segments. (credit: modification of work from Anatomy and Physiology 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice
University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

Dysrhythmias
Normal sinus rhythm is the normal rhythm of a healthy heart. This describes the scenario where the sinoatrial node
causes the heart to beat at 60-100 beats per minute and at regular intervals (equal time between each heartbeat or
ventricular contraction). On the electrocardiogram of a client in normal sinus rhythm, every P wave is followed by a
QRS complex, which is followed by a T wave. Dysrhythmias describe when there is a problem with the heart rate
and/or rhythm. They are also known as arrhythmias.

If the heart rate is too fast, it is known as tachycardia. If the heart rate is too slow, it is known as bradycardia. If the
heart rhythm is irregular, it can be described as regularly irregular, meaning the time between heartbeats varies in a
pattern, or irregularly irregular, meaning the time between heartbeats varies without any identifiable pattern.
Dysrhythmias can occur when another part of the heart acts as the pacemaker or if conduction of the current occurs
through a pathway other than the standard pathway described previously. For more about common dysrhythmias
encountered in clinical practice, see Anti-Dysrhythmic Drugs.

INTRODUCTION Normal sinus rhythm is the normal rhythm of a healthy heart. In this rhythm, the sinoatrial (SA)
node causes the heart to beat at 60-100 beats per minute and at regular intervals (equal time between each
heartbeat or ventricular contraction). The impulse from the SA node is conducted across the atria and then follows a
specialized pathway through the atrioventricular (AV) node and ventricles, eventually reaching the cardiac myocytes
(muscle cells) to trigger coordinated contraction of the heart chambers at their respective times in the cardiac cycle.
On the electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG) of a client in normal sinus rhythm, every P wave is followed by a QRS complex,
which is followed by a T wave. Introduction to the Cardiovascular System provides an overview of the cardiac
conduction system that facilitates the heart rate and rhythm.
The heart rate and rhythm are regulated by a balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic input. Sympathetic input
is the "fight or flight response" mediated by catecholamines such as epinephrine at beta-1 receptors in the heart.
Stimulation of beta-1 receptors results in increased cardiac contractility (strength of contraction) and chronotropy
(effect on heart rate). Parasympathetic input is often referred to as "rest and digest" and affects the heart through
vagal innervation of the SA and AV nodes. Increased vagal tone leads to decreased heart rate and electrical
conduction. Various conditions can interfere with heart rate and rhythm leading to serious and potentially life-
threatening conditions. This chapter will explore how different medications affect the heart to treat these
conditions.

     17.1 Introduction to Dysrhythmias

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 17.1.1 Describe specific cardiac dysrhythmias and their significance to cardiac function.
         · 17.1.2 Discuss the principles of managing dysrhythmias to improve cardiac functioning.

     Dysrhythmias

     Dysrhythmias, also known as arrhythmias, occur when there is abnormal automaticity (spontaneous impulse
     generation) or abnormal conduction that results in a problem with the heart rate and/or rhythm. Medications
     address dysrhythmias by manipulating the electrolytes and other receptors involved in the cardiac conduction
     system to either treat the manifestations of the underlying arrhythmia or restore a normal heart rate, suppress the
     dysrhythmia, and thus restore normal sinus rhythm in a process known as cardioversion. When cardioversion is
     accomplished via drug administration, may be referred to as chemical cardioversion.

     Dysrhythmias can be classified in multiple ways. One way is according to the ventricular contraction rate, or heart
     rate. A heart rate less than 60 beats per minute is considered bradycardia. Bradycardia can occur due to the SA
     node incorrectly pacing too slowly or to the AV node conducting incorrectly, leading to AV block. Bradycardia can
     lead to problems because it decreases cardiac output, which is affected by both stroke volume and heart rate. A
     heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute is called tachycardia. Tachycardia can further be categorized as
     supraventricular tachycardia (the stimulus physically originates above the ventricle but not from the sinus node) or
     ventricular tachycardia (the origin of the stimulus is physically located in the ventricle). Tachycardia is problematic
     because at very high heart rates, the ventricles do not have enough time to fill with an adequate amount of blood in
     between contractions. Thus, the stroke volume and cardiac output are both decreased. Tachycardia also increases
     the workload of the heart and can lead to a type of heart failure called tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.

     Sinus Bradycardia
     In sinus bradycardia, although the heart rate is less than 60 beats per minute, the rhythm is regular, and the SA
     node acts as the pacemaker for the heart. Aside from the slow heart rate, there is no other problem with conduction.
     On an ECG, every P wave is followed by a QRS complex, which is followed by a T wave.

     Sinus Tachycardia
     In sinus tachycardia, although the heart rate exceeds 100 beats per minute, the rhythm is regular, and the SA node
     acts as the pacemaker for the heart. Aside from the rapid heart rate, there is no other problem with conduction.
     Every P wave is followed by a QRS complex, which is followed by a T wave. Sinus tachycardia is often caused by
     exercise, pain, stress, anxiety, or dehydration.

     Atrial Fibrillation
     Atrial fibrillation is described as an irregularly irregular rhythm in which multiple areas of the atria generate
     spontaneous impulses such that the atria quiver at 400-600 beats per minute. Only some of the impulses are
     conducted through the AV node, resulting in a variable ventricular contraction rate or heart rate. When the heart rate
     is high, it is called atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Because the atria are quivering because so
     many impulses are being formed, the individual's ECG will show no distinguishable P waves; however, the baseline
     will appear wavy due to the presence of "fibrillatory" waves (Figure 17.2).

     There are two overall strategies for treating atrial fibrillation: rhythm control and rate control. The aim of rhythm
     control is to cardiovert and then maintain normal sinus rhythm. Rate control is a strategy that allows the client's
     rhythm to remain in atrial fibrillation but slows the rate of conduction through the AV node, thereby slowing the
     ventricular rate/heart rate.

     Atrial Flutter
     Atrial flutter is a dysrhythmia closely related to atrial fibrillation. The atria quiver at rates of 250-400 beats per
     minute. As with atrial fibrillation, abnormal impulses are generated in the atria. Commonly, there is 2:1 conduction
     through the AV node, meaning that for every two impulses from the atria, one conducts through the AV node and
     leads to ventricular contraction. This process commonly leads to a ventricular rate of approximately 150 beats per
     minute (assuming an average atrial rate of 300 beats per minute). It is noteworthy that the conduction is not always

2:1; it may be 3:1, 4:1, or 5:1. As in atrial fibrillation, there are no typical P waves on the ECG of a client with atrial
flutter. Instead, there are "flutter waves" in a characteristic sawtooth pattern between QRS complexes.

Premature Ventricular Contraction
A premature ventricular contraction (PVC) represents the ventricle contracting earlier than it should during the
cardiac cycle due to a spontaneous impulse from the Purkinje fibers (rather than from an impulse carried from the
SA node).

Ventricular Tachycardia
When multiple PVCs occur consecutively, it is known as ventricular tachycardia. Sustained ventricular tachycardia
(lasting more than 30 seconds) can be serious and cause hemodynamic compromise necessitating advanced
cardiac life support. Ventricular tachycardia can occur due to abnormalities of electrolytes such as magnesium or
potassium or to myocardial ischemia (oxygen deprivation in the heart muscle). It can devolve into ventricular
fibrillation, described next. On an ECG, ventricular tachycardia has multiple wide QRS complexes (Figure 17.2).
Torsade de pointes is a dangerous ventricular tachycardia associated with medications that prolong the QT interval
(the time it takes the heart to contract and recover).

Ventricular Fibrillation
Ventricular fibrillation is a medical emergency that necessitates advanced cardiac life support (ACLS). This is
another ventricular arrhythmia, meaning it originates from spontaneous impulses from the Purkinje fibers (rather
than from an impulse carried from the SA node), causing the ventricles to quiver erratically rather than pump, which,
in turn, causes cardiac arrest. On an ECG, ventricular fibrillation appears as multiple and varied wide complexes,
without any pattern or discernable P waves, QRS complexes, or T waves (Figure 17.2).

Asystole
In asystole, the heart has no electrical activity and thus does not pump. This is a medical emergency that
necessitates advanced cardiac life support. On an ECG, asystole has no waveforms, which is why it is often
informally called "flatlining."

Pulseless Electrical Activity
In pulseless electrical activity (PEA), the client's ECG shows electrical activity (possibly even sinus rhythm);
488  17 · Antidysrhythmic Drugs

     however, it does not lead to ventricular contraction, and the client does not have a pulse. This is a medical
     emergency that requires advanced cardiac life support.

     Management of Cardiac Dysrhythmias

     Management of cardiac dysrhythmias is extremely diverse and is based on client-specific factors, the particular
     dysrhythmia being treated, the setting of the dysrhythmia (acute vs. chronic), and the client's comorbidities. Many
     therapies for dysrhythmias are managed by an electrophysiologist, a cardiologist who specializes in the treatment of
     dysrhythmias.

     Nonpharmacologic Management
     Nonpharmacologic management of dysrhythmias depends on the specific dysrhythmia being treated and the clinical
     scenario. Lifestyle changes, procedures, and vagal maneuvers are all examples of nonpharmacologic management
     that can be attempted, depending on the client. In terms of lifestyle changes, clients can avoid or manage triggers of
     their arrhythmias. Some lifestyle-related triggers of dysrhythmias include anger, physical activity and exercise,
     alcohol, caffeine, lack of sleep, and use of illicit stimulant drugs such as cocaine (Groh et al., 2019; National Heart,
     Lung, and Blood Institute, 2022).

     Depending on the specific dysrhythmia and clinical scenario, various procedures, such as an ablation, can be
     performed to manage an arrhythmia. An ablation uses radiofrequency to create scar tissue, which does not conduct
     electrical impulses, in the irregular heart tissue that is causing the arrhythmia (El Baba et al., 2020). Vagal
     maneuvers are physical manipulations that can increase parasympathetic activation to treat various arrhythmias.
     One example of a vagal maneuver is the Valsalva maneuver. The Valsalva maneuver is commonly referred to as
     "bearing down" and is the process of forced expiration against a closed glottis (Niehues & Klovenski, 2022). Vagal
     stimulation leads to a decreased rate of pacing from the SA node and decreased conduction through the AV node.

     Pharmacologic Management
     Antidysrhythmic drugs treat abnormal heart rates and rhythms. They are often classified using the Vaughan
     Williams classification system, which differentiates drugs by their major mechanism of action (Table 17.1).
     However, this system is far from perfect. Many of the antidysrhythmic drugs have multiple mechanisms of action, so
     there is overlap among the categories; many drugs do not fit perfectly into a single category. Still, this is the most
     conventional way to classify the drugs. The categories include:

         · Class I: Sodium channel blockers
         · Class II: Beta-adrenergic blockers
         · Class III: Potassium channel blockers
         · Class IV: Calcium channel blockers
         · Unclassified (also called miscellaneous): Drugs that work by alternative mechanisms

     The choice of which antidysrhythmic drug to use is nuanced and requires in-depth knowledge and experience. It is
     noteworthy that the Institute for Safe Medication Practices considers the majority of antidysrhythmic drugs
     discussed in this chapter to be high-alert drugs due to their propensity for causing client harm when administered
     incorrectly. Drugs used in advanced cardiac life support that are not traditional antidysrhythmic medications (such
     as epinephrine and calcium carbonate) are discussed in Cardiac Emergency and Shock Drugs.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Older Adults

The risk of being diagnosed with dysrhythmia skyrockets after age 60. Not only does the risk for dysrhythmias
increase, but older adults have a higher risk for concomitant disease states that interfere with the action of
antidysrhythmic drugs. For example, beta-adrenergic blockers, quinidine, and procainamide can exacerbate the
postural hypotension that is particularly prevalent in older adults, leading to falls. Clients with heart failure (who
are usually older adults) can experience exacerbation of their underlying condition when treated with flecainide
or sotalol. Furthermore, older clients are more likely to be on multiple medications, increasing the likelihood of
experiencing drug interactions. Age-related decreases in metabolic processing and excretion of drugs can
increase antidysrhythmic plasma levels, putting these individuals at higher risk for adverse effects. Thus,
antidysrhythmic drugs require extra vigilance to prevent harm in the older adult population.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Pediatrics

Pediatric clients may experience arrhythmias that must be treated with antidysrhythmic therapy. Some of this
use is off-label. Off-label prescription drug use means that the drug may not be specifically approved for a
particular client or diagnosis, but health care providers may choose to use the drug anyway because the
potential benefit outweighs the potential risks. In these circumstances, drug dosing and administration may not
be standardized. The nurse should consult institutional protocols to avoid medication errors, especially

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 17.2.1 Identify the characteristics of the sodium channel blocker drugs used to treat dysrhythmias.
         · 17.2.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of the sodium channel blocker

             drugs used to treat dysrhythmias.
         · 17.2.3 Describe the nursing implications of the sodium channel blocker drugs used to treat dysrhythmias.
         · 17.2.4 Explain the client education related to the sodium channel blocker drugs used to treat

             dysrhythmias.

     Class I antidysrhythmic drugs are known as sodium channel blockers. They block sodium channels in conduction
     tissue and myocytes. Sodium channels are responsible for the depolarization of cardiac cells, and blocking these
     channels leads to slower conduction and a longer refractory period between impulses. Class I antidysrhythmic
     drugs are further broken down into classes IA, IB, and IC.

     Class IA drugs cause moderate blockade of sodium channels. They also have an additional mechanism of action and
     block potassium channels. Blockage of potassium channels leads to a property called proarrhythmia, meaning the
     drugs have a propensity to cause other arrhythmias. Drugs that block potassium channels prolong the QT interval,
     which increases the risk for torsade de pointes.

     Class IB drugs block sodium channels with mild intensity. These drugs are exclusively used for ventricular
     arrhythmias.

     Class IC drugs strongly block sodium channels but do not block potassium channels; thus, they are less
     proarrhythmic than class IA agents (King et al., 2023).

     Various sodium channel antidysrhythmic drugs exist. This chapter will cover the following drugs in more detail:
     quinidine, procainamide, lidocaine, mexiletine, flecainide, and propafenone.

     Quinidine

     Quinidine is a class IA antidysrhythmic drug. It is available as an oral immediate-release tablet and an extended-
     release tablet. These tablets are different salt forms of quinidine; the immediate-release form is quinidine sulfate,
     and the extended-release form is quinidine gluconate. It is important to note that these are not interchangeable.

     Quinidine is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for cardioversion of atrial fibrillation and
     flutter to sinus rhythm and then for maintenance of sinus rhythm after cardioversion. It is also approved for
     suppression of recurrent ventricular arrhythmias.

     Quinidine can easily be confused with quinine; nurses must be careful to avoid mixing up these drugs. Clients should
     be educated on the potential for diarrhea and contact their provider if this occurs because it can lead to electrolyte
     abnormalities that can exacerbate arrhythmias. Clients who take quinidine should avoid grapefruit and grapefruit
     juice because of potential interactions.

     Procainamide

     Procainamide is a class IA antidysrhythmic drug that is available only in an intravenous form. It is FDA approved for
     life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias but is used off-label for other arrhythmias as well, including atrial
     fibrillation. Procainamide is metabolized to N-acetyl procainamide, which is also active.

     Lidocaine and Mexiletine

     Lidocaine is a class IB antiarrhythmic drug. It has various uses as an anesthetic; however, in terms of dysrhythmias,
     it is used exclusively for treating ventricular arrhythmias. It can be used both for acute treatment of a primary
     arrhythmia and in advanced cardiac life support when clients have sudden cardiac arrest due to ventricular

arrhythmias. When used for treating arrhythmias, lidocaine is administered only intravenously.

     CLINICAL TIP

 Lidocaine

  Because lidocaine may cause central nervous system toxicity, the nurse should assess the client frequently.
  Signs and symptoms to watch for include sedation and irritability (twitching), which could progress to
  convulsions and respiratory depression/arrest.

SAFETY ALERT

Lidocaine

Lidocaine is available in many formulations, some of which are not suitable for intravenous administration.
Lidocaine with epinephrine is one such dosage form. The Institute for Safe Medication Practices
(https://openstax.org/r/ismporgresources) reported a death that occurred when a client was administered topical
lidocaine with epinephrine instead of the intravenous form of lidocaine with epinephrine, causing fatal cardiac
arrhythmias. Lidocaine with epinephrine should never be used as an antidysrhythmic agent.

Mexiletine is like lidocaine in that it is a class IB drug. It is FDA approved for managing ventricular arrhythmias and is
available as an oral capsule for long-term use.

Flecainide and Propafenone

Flecainide is a class IC antidysrhythmic drug that is available as an oral tablet. It is used for clients with paroxysmal
symptomatic supraventricular tachycardias, including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. It can also be used for life-
threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias.

Propafenone is also a class IC drug. It is available as an oral immediate-release tablet and an oral extended-release
capsule. It is FDA approved to treat life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and to prolong time to recurrence of
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter in clients without structural heart disease. Propafenone is used off-label in a
technique informally called "pill in a pocket." This technique refers to a scenario in which a client who has
symptomatic recurrent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation can keep propafenone on hand and take it as needed when they
detect symptoms of atrial fibrillation. The medication will convert them back to sinus rhythm without their needing
to visit a health care provider. They do not take the medication daily, just when they need it.

Table 17.2 lists common class I antidysrhythmic drugs and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

Drug          Routes and Dosage Ranges

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications

     All sodium channel blockers have some propensity to cause heart blocks; however, the adverse effect profile of
     sodium channel blockers varies greatly depending on the drug.

     Quinidine is associated with many serious risks. Trials have shown increased mortality risk compared with placebo
     and other antiarrhythmic drugs, and for this reason the drug has a boxed warning (DailyMed, Quinidine gluconate,
     2021). Quinidine has a high incidence of diarrhea as an adverse effect (greater than 20%). It is hepatotoxic and has
     been associated with serious liver problems, including granulomatous hepatitis, so it should be used with caution in
     clients with hepatic impairment. It can be associated with thrombocytopenia and therefore should not be used in
     clients with baseline thrombocytopenia. In addition to acting as a sodium channel blocker, it blocks potassium
     channels and prolongs the QT interval, which leads to a proarrhythmic effect. The nurse will need to monitor the
     client's ECG, complete blood count (CBC), and liver and kidney function.

     Many serious risks associated with the use of procainamide have led to several boxed warnings. It has the potential
     to cause drug-induced lupus erythematosus-like syndrome as well as blood dyscrasias such as potentially fatal
     agranulocytosis, and it has been associated with increased mortality compared with placebo in certain populations.
     In addition to acting as a sodium channel blocker, it blocks potassium channels and prolongs the QT interval, which
     leads to a proarrhythmic effect. It should not be used in clients with certain heart blocks or in those with systemic
     lupus erythematosus or torsade de pointes. Procainamide can cause hypotension, so the nurse must be mindful of
     maximum infusion rates to minimize this possibility. The nurse will also need to monitor the client's ECG, CBC, and
     drug levels of procainamide and its active metabolite, N-acetyl procainamide.

     Lidocaine can cause central nervous system toxicity. The nurse will need to monitor the client's ECG continuously
     and may need to monitor the client's blood levels for the drug, depending on how long it will be administered.

     Flecainide carries a warning because it can cause 1:1 AV conduction in atrial fibrillation/flutter. This means that the
     ventricles will beat once for each impulse in the atria, which is so fast that it can cause hemodynamic collapse. The
     nurse should monitor the client's ECG and any blood levels ordered.

     Contraindications vary based on the drug. Some of the most noteworthy contraindications include:

     · Quinidine and procainamide should not be used in clients with baseline prolonged QT interval, given their
        effect on the QT interval. They also should not be used with other drugs that strongly prolong the QT interval.
        Procainamide is contraindicated in clients who have systemic lupus erythematosus.

     · Lidocaine is contraindicated in individuals with an arrhythmia called Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and in
        those with certain heart blocks.

     · Flecainide and propafenone are contraindicated in clients with structural heart disease, such as heart failure
        or myocardial infarction, due to potentially fatal proarrhythmic effects and worsening of heart failure.

Nursing Implications

The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking sodium channel blockers:

· Recognize and monitor for serious and potentially dangerous adverse effects of these drugs.
· Monitor the ECG of any client who takes antiarrhythmic drugs, paying careful attention to the QT interval.
· Monitor blood levels of drugs and relevant metabolites.
· Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

   teaching guidelines.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking quinidine should:
    · Report excessive diarrhea to their health care provider.

The client taking mexiletine should:
    · Report signs and symptoms of hepatic toxicity, such as jaundice.

The client taking propafenone should:
    · Report signs of infection due to agranulocytosis, such as fever or sore throat.

FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

Quinidine
494  17 · Antidysrhythmic Drugs

       Active antiarrhythmic therapy has resulted in increased mortality; the risk of active therapy is greatest in clients
       with structural heart disease.

       Procainamide

       Prolonged administration of procainamide often leads to the development of a positive antinuclear antibody
       test, with or without symptoms of lupus erythematosus-like syndrome. If a positive antinuclear antibody titer
       develops, the benefits versus the risks of continued procainamide therapy should be assessed. In addition,
       agranulocytosis, bone marrow depression, neutropenia, hypoplastic anemia, and thrombocytopenia in clients
       receiving procainamide HCl have been reported at a rate of approximately 0.5%.

       Mexiletine

       In postmarketing experience, abnormal liver function tests have been reported, some in the first few weeks of
       therapy.

       Flecainide

       A review of the world literature revealed reports of ventricular tachycardia in 0.4% of clients receiving flecainide.
       Of 19 clients reported in the literature with chronic atrial fibrillation, 10.5% experienced ventricular tachycardia
       or ventricular fibrillation. Flecainide is not recommended for use in clients with chronic atrial fibrillation.

       Flecainide, Propafenone, Mexiletine, Procainamide

       In the CAST trial, there was excessive mortality in post-myocardial infarction clients who were administered
       flecainide or another similar drug, encainide.

     17.3 Class II: Beta Adrenergic Blockers

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 17.3.1 Identify the characteristics of the beta-adrenergic blocker drugs used to treat dysrhythmias.
         · 17.3.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of beta-adrenergic blocker

             drugs used to treat dysrhythmias.
         · 17.3.3 Describe the nursing implications of beta-adrenergic blocker drugs used to treat dysrhythmias.
         · 17.3.4 Explain the client education related to beta-adrenergic blocker drugs used to treat dysrhythmias.

     Beta-adrenergic blockers (informally called beta blockers) are known by their generic names, which end with "olol."
     They can be used for many disease states, including heart failure, myocardial infarction, angina, and hypertension.
     Beta-adrenergic blockers block adrenergic beta-1 receptors in the heart (among other actions, depending on the
     drug), which leads to decreased heart rate from the SA node. It also leads to a decreased rate of conduction through
     the AV node and decreased cardiac contractility. There are other types of beta-adrenergic receptors, such as beta-2
     receptors in the lungs that mediate bronchoconstriction. Some beta-adrenergic blockers can also affect alpha
     receptors in the vasculature, causing vasodilation and decreased blood pressure. Many beta-adrenergic blockers are
     used in practice; however, it is most common to use the ones that are cardioselective for treatment of arrhythmias.
     Clients should avoid stopping beta-adrenergic blockers abruptly because sudden discontinuation can exacerbate
     arrhythmias.

          SAFETY ALERT

      Beta-Adrenergic Blockers

       Beta-adrenergic blockers can cause bradycardia. The nurse should monitor the client's heart rate before
       administration and not give the drug to bradycardic clients who do not have a functioning pacemaker.

     Many beta-adrenergic blockers are available, and several can be used as antidysrhythmic drugs. This chapter
     discusses two of the most common beta-adrenergic blockers: esmolol and metoprolol.

Esmolol

Esmolol is an intravenous beta-adrenergic blocker that is selective for the beta-1 receptors in the heart. Esmolol is
very fast acting and slows the heart rate within 2-10 min of administration. It also has a short duration; the half-life
of esmolol in adults is only 9 min. For this reason, esmolol is often administered as a short-term treatment (used
less than 48 hours) via continuous infusion when acute control is needed or for ease of titration. It is approved for
sinus tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and intraoperative and postoperative
tachycardia and hypertension. It is used off-label for ventricular tachycardia. Frequent blood pressure monitoring is
required. An arterial line provides the best method for continuous monitoring of blood pressure, although it is an
invasive procedure and not always done (Pevtsov & Fredlund, 2023).

CLINICAL TIP

Administration of Esmolol

Esmolol is a vesicant, and extravasation can lead to skin necrosis and sloughing. The nurse should ensure proper
needle/catheter placement. If extravasation occurs, the infusion should be stopped, the line aspirated, and the
limb elevated.

Metoprolol

Metoprolol is a beta-adrenergic blocker with selective activity at beta-1 receptors in the heart. It is available as an
immediate-release tablet (metoprolol tartrate) and an extended-release tablet (metoprolol succinate). It is also
available in an intravenous form. It is approved for various cardiac conditions, including heart failure, angina,
hypertension, and myocardial infarction. It is used off-label for treating atrial fibrillation/flutter, other
supraventricular arrhythmias, and ventricular arrhythmias.

Table 17.4 lists common cardioselective beta-adrenergic blockers and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications

Cardioselective beta-adrenergic blockers do not have direct hypotensive effects on the vasculature but can still
cause hypotension through decreased cardiac output. Beta-adrenergic blockers can mask hypoglycemia due to their
effects on heart rate, so clients with diabetes should be aware that they will not necessarily experience their typical
hypoglycemic symptoms. Beta-adrenergic blockers can cause central nervous system adverse effects, especially
fatigue. They also can be associated with bronchospasm; however, cardioselective beta-adrenergic blockers have a
lower risk for this. Sexual side effects are also common.

Although beta-adrenergic blockers are indicated to treat heart failure long term, starting beta-adrenergic blockers
too quickly or at too high a dose can lead to heart failure exacerbations because of their effect on cardiac

     contractility.

     Beta-adrenergic blockers can cause bradycardia and are contraindicated in clients who have severe bradycardia
     unless they have a pacemaker and in clients in cardiogenic shock. They should also be used cautiously in clients
     with acute exacerbations of heart failure.

     Nursing Implications

     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking beta-adrenergic blockers:

         · If the baseline heart rate is less than 60 beats per minute, consider checking with the health care provider
             before giving the drug.

         · Monitor the client's blood pressure.
         · Recognize differences in dosing regimens between IV and oral forms of the drugs.
         · Take care to avoid and recognize extravasation of esmolol.
         · Be careful not to confuse the different forms of metoprolol.
         · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

             teaching guidelines.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking a beta-adrenergic blocker should:

    · Avoid orthostatic hypotension by moving slowly when standing up from a sitting or lying position. Extra
        caution is advised after dose increases.

    · Not stop their medication abruptly because this can cause arrhythmias and produce withdrawal effects.
    · Alert their health care provider if they feel very dizzy.
    · Understand that beta-adrenergic blockers can worsen respiratory symptoms of asthma and chronic

        obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
    · Be aware that beta-adrenergic blockers can mask symptoms of hypoglycemia. (This is particularly

        important for clients with diabetes.)

     17.4 Class III: Potassium Channel Blockers

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 17.4.1 Identify the characteristics of the potassium channel blocker drugs used to treat dysrhythmias.
         · 17.4.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of potassium channel blocker

             drugs used to treat dysrhythmias.
         · 17.4.3 Describe the nursing implications of potassium channel blocker drugs used to treat dysrhythmias.
         · 17.4.4 Explain the client education related to potassium channel blocker drugs used to treat

             dysrhythmias.

     Potassium channel blockers are class III drugs. They work by blocking the potassium channels that facilitate
     potassium transport and mediate repolarization of the cardiac cells. They extend the action potential and slow
     repolarization. All antidysrhythmic drugs that block potassium channels are proarrhythmic. They lead to a prolonged
     QT interval, which increases the risk for torsade de pointes. Because of this, all drugs within this class require ECG
     monitoring for QT interval assessment. The nurse must also be vigilant to consider concomitant drugs that increase
     the QT interval because concomitant use can have additive effects. Although all drugs within this class block
     potassium channels, many have additional antidysrhythmic mechanisms.

          CLINICAL TIP

      Monitor Potassium Channel Blockers Using the Corrected QT Interval

       The QT interval changes depending on the client's heart rate. To standardize assessment, the QT interval can be
       corrected (adjusted) for heart rate using various methods. This correction is referred to as the QTc and is usually
       used in drug titration and safety algorithms. The most common formula for QTc is known as the Bazett formula.
       Various websites have QTc calculators (https://openstax.org/r/mayoclinicorga), and some ECG software
       calculates the QTc automatically.

     The following medications are all classified as potassium channel blockers; however, it is important to note their
     additional mechanisms of action as well.

     Amiodarone and Dronedarone

     Amiodarone is a class III antidysrhythmic drug; however, it has all four Vaughan Williams mechanisms: It blocks
     sodium channels (class I), functions as a beta-adrenergic blocker (class II), blocks potassium channels (class III),
     and blocks calcium channels (class IV). It is available in both intravenous and oral dosage forms. Amiodarone is
     known for having a very long half-life (greater than 1 month); thus, the duration of action can be several months
     after chronic therapy ends. The nurse should be aware that even after amiodarone administration is discontinued,

     Access for free at openstax.org
17.4 · Class III: Potassium Channel Blockers                                                                              499

its effects will be apparent for several weeks to months.

Amiodarone has many notable drug interactions. When metabolism occurs in the liver, it does so by the hepatic
microsomal enzyme system. A key component of this system is an enzyme complex known as cytochrome P450 or
CYP450. This enzyme metabolizes drugs, nutrients, and other substances such as steroids and cholesterol. CYP3A,
CYP2C8, and others are isoenzymes of CYP450 and perform slightly different metabolic functions. The thing to
remember is that these enzymes determine the speed of the metabolism of drugs and affect many drug-drug
interactions. Amiodarone is a substrate for CYP3A and CYP2C8, so inducers and inhibitors of those enzymes affect
the client's exposure to amiodarone. Amiodarone is also an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein and CYP1A2, CYP2C9,
CYP2D6, and CYP3A; this can increase the client's exposure to other drugs that are substrates of those enzymes.
Some drug interactions include:

    · Digoxin: Amiodarone can increase digoxin concentrations. Therefore, it is recommended that digoxin doses be
        decreased (with careful monitoring) or discontinued altogether if amiodarone is initiated.

    · Warfarin: Concomitant administration of warfarin and amiodarone increases the anticoagulant effect of
        warfarin. It is recommended to decrease the warfarin dose by one-third to one-half and to monitor
        prothrombin time.

    · Statin medications: Concomitant administration of certain statin medications with amiodarone can result in
        increased concentrations of the statin drug. Lower starting doses of statin medications may be required; the
        maximum recommended dose for lovastatin is 40 mg and for simvastatin is 20 mg during concomitant use
        with amiodarone.

Dronedarone is like amiodarone in that it is categorized as a class III drug with all four Vaughan Williams
mechanisms of action. It is approved to treat clients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation. Because of the
potential for teratogenicity, dronedarone is also classified as a hazardous drug; nurses should wear gloves when
handling or administering it and follow institutional policies for hazardous drugs (Institute for Safe Medication
Practices, 2018).

Dronedarone interacts with many drugs because it is an inhibitor of CYP3A and CYP2D6. Medications it interacts
with include digoxin, calcium channel blockers, and statins.

Dofetilide and Ibutilide

Dofetilide and ibutilide are both pure class III antidysrhythmic medications with no additional mechanisms of
action. Dofetilide is an oral medication used for atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. It has a high risk for causing
proarrhythmia, specifically torsade de pointes. Therefore, dofetilide must be initiated in a health care setting
capable of providing cardiac resuscitation services and continuous ECG monitoring for a minimum of 3 days. The
manufacturer's labeling provides detailed guidance for dosing and monitoring. Dofetilide is contraindicated in
clients with a baseline QTc greater than 440 msec, and the drug should either be dose-adjusted or discontinued if
the QTc rises above 500 msec during therapy, depending on the circumstance. Before starting dofetilide, clients
should have electrolyte levels checked (potassium, magnesium), and electrolyte supplements should be
administered to maintain adequate levels. Renal function must also be monitored because dofetilide is excreted by
the kidneys.

Ibutilide is an intravenous class III antidysrhythmic medication. It is used almost exclusively for conversion of
recent-onset atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter to sinus rhythm and given as only one or two doses (no chronic
maintenance dosing). Ibutilide has a high risk for causing torsade de pointes (1.7% in registry studies; DailyMed
Ibutilide fumarate, 2020) and should be prescribed by health care providers who are familiar with identifying and
treating acute ventricular arrhythmias. It requires continuous ECG monitoring and observation for at least 4 hours
after administration. Clients with atrial fibrillation for more than 2-3 days require anticoagulation for 2 weeks before
administration to mitigate the risk for stroke upon cardioversion. Clients with chronic atrial fibrillation are not
candidates for cardioversion using ibutilide because it is less effective than in paroxysmal (i.e., intermittent) atrial
fibrillation and is associated with high risks.

Sotalol

Sotalol is another class III antidysrhythmic drug; however, in addition to its mechanism as a potassium channel
blocker, it also has beta-adrenergic blocking effects. (Note that the name ends in "lol" like other beta-adrenergic
500  17 · Antidysrhythmic Drugs

     blockers.) Sotalol is available in both oral and intravenous dosage forms and is approved for the treatment of
     symptomatic atrial fibrillation/flutter and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.

     As with all potassium channel blockers, sotalol prolongs the QTc interval and can cause torsade de pointes.
     Therefore, sotalol requires inpatient initiation in a facility that can provide cardiac resuscitation services and
     continuous ECG monitoring. If the client's baseline QTc interval is longer than 450 msec, sotalol should not be
     initiated. The manufacturer's labeling provides detailed directions for initiation and monitoring. During initiation, the
     client's ECG is monitored after every dose; once stable, it is monitored periodically for the duration of therapy. If the
     QTc interval increases to more than 500 msec during therapy, the dosing interval must be lengthened or the drug
     discontinued.

     Sotalol is eliminated via the kidneys; thus, clients with severe renal dysfunction should not take sotalol, and renal
     function should be monitored periodically in all clients who take sotalol.

     Table 17.7 lists common potassium channel blockers and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications

     All class III drugs are proarrhythmic and can cause QT prolongation, leading to torsade de pointes. Aside from that,
     the adverse effect profile depends on the agent being used.

     Amiodarone has many potential toxicities and adverse effects, which include:

     · Optic neuropathy and/or optic neuritis, which can lead to permanent blindness; corneal microdeposits that
        may be reversible

     · Photosensitivity resulting in a bluish-gray discoloration of the skin
     · New arrhythmias, including torsade de pointes
     · Hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism
     · Hepatotoxicity
     · Acute and chronic pulmonary toxicity, including acute respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary fibrosis

     Because of these toxicities, amiodarone requires baseline monitoring as well as follow-up monitoring at least every
     3-6 months. Clients should minimally receive the following tests at baseline and periodically after initiation:

     · Cardiac monitoring, including an ECG to assess heart rate, medication efficacy, and the QT interval
     · Pulmonary function tests and a chest x-ray
     · Liver function tests

· Thyroid function tests
· Ophthalmic exams

As with all beta-adrenergic blockers and calcium channel blockers, amiodarone can cause bradycardia,
hypotension, and fatigue. Amiodarone carries multiple boxed warnings from the FDA related to arrhythmias,
pulmonary toxicity, and hepatotoxicity. It is on the Beers Criteria® list of high-risk medications for older adults
because of its potential for toxicity (American Geriatrics Society, 2019). Amiodarone should not be used in clients
with bradycardia at baseline unless they have a pacemaker. Amiodarone has iodine within its chemical structure;
thus, it is contraindicated in clients with iodine hypersensitivity.

Dronedarone has many of the same adverse effects as amiodarone, including heart failure, hepatotoxicity, QT
prolongation/torsade de pointes, and pulmonary toxicity. Because of a particularly high risk for adverse reactions,
including death, it is contraindicated in clients with heart failure and those in atrial fibrillation who cannot be
converted to sinus rhythm; these contraindications are listed as boxed warnings from the FDA. Dronedarone is
contraindicated in pregnant clients due to the potential for teratogenicity.

Dofetilide and sotalol are contraindicated in clients with severe kidney disease.

Sotalol, like all beta-adrenergic blockers, can cause bradycardia, hypotension, and fatigue and should be used
cautiously in clients with asthma and heart failure.

Nursing Implications

The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking potassium channel blockers:
502  17 · Antidysrhythmic Drugs

      · Perform a complete medication history to assess for relevant drug interactions, including other drugs that also
          prolong the QTc interval.

      · Monitor ECG (including QTc interval), vital signs, and electrolyte levels.
      · Be prepared to perform cardiac resuscitation on any client starting on a class III antidysrhythmic drug.
      · Follow the specific dosing and monitoring protocols described in the manufacturer's labeling for a client

          initiating sotalol or dofetilide.
      · Observe the client closely for at least 4 hours after administration of ibutilide for maintenance of sinus rhythm

          and adverse effects such as ventricular arrhythmias.
      · Conduct in-depth education for any client being started on amiodarone.
      · Monitor for amiodarone-related toxicity in any client taking the drug and for several months after amiodarone

          discontinuation.
      · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

          teaching guidelines.

     CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

     The client taking a potassium channel blocker should:

         · Communicate their baseline medication list and any new medications (such as antibiotics) to their
             prescribing health care provider.

         · Seek emergency medical attention if they experience symptoms of torsade de pointes (dizziness,
             palpitations, lightheadedness, syncope).

         · Keep appointments for laboratory testing to monitor for potential toxicities.

     The client taking amiodarone should:

         · Avoid direct sunlight and wear sunscreen and protective clothing.
         · Report symptoms of hyperthyroidism (heat sensitivity, anxiety, weight loss) or hypothyroidism (fatigue,

             weight gain, cold sensitivity).
         · Report any vision changes or breathing difficulties.
         · Avoid eating grapefruits or drinking grapefruit juice.

     FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

     Amiodarone

     Amiodarone can cause pulmonary toxicity (hypersensitivity pneumonitis or interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis)
     that has resulted in clinically manifest disease at rates as high as 17% in some series of clients. Pulmonary
     toxicity has been fatal about 10% of the time. The client should have a baseline chest x-ray and pulmonary
     function tests, including diffusion capacity, when amiodarone therapy is initiated. The medical history, physical
     exam, and chest x-ray should be repeated every 3-6 months.

     Amiodarone also can cause hepatotoxicity, which can be fatal. Baseline and periodic liver transaminase levels
     should be obtained, and the medication should be discontinued or reduced in dose if the level exceeds three
     times the normal level or doubles in a client with an elevated baseline. Amiodarone should be stopped if the
     client experiences signs or symptoms of clinical liver injury.

     Amiodarone is intended for use only in clients with indicated life-threatening arrhythmias because its use is
     accompanied by substantial toxicity.

     In addition, amiodarone can exacerbate arrhythmias. Amiodarone must be initiated in a clinical setting where
     continuous ECG monitoring and cardiac resuscitation are available.

     Dronedarone

     Dronedarone is contraindicated in clients with symptomatic heart failure with recent decompensation requiring

  hospitalization or in clients with New York Heart Association class IV heart failure. Dronedarone doubles the risk
  of death in these clients. Dronedarone is contraindicated in clients in atrial fibrillation who will not or cannot be
  cardioverted into normal sinus rhythm. In clients with permanent atrial fibrillation, dronedarone doubles the risk
  of death, stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure.

  Dofetilide

  To minimize the risk for induced arrhythmia, clients initiated or reinitiated on dofetilide should be admitted for a
  minimum of 3 days into a facility that can provide calculations of creatinine clearance, continuous ECG
  monitoring, and cardiac resuscitation.

  Sotalol

  To minimize the risk of drug-induced arrhythmia, clients should be initiated, reinitiated, or up-titrated in a facility
  that can provide cardiac resuscitation and continuous ECG monitoring. Sotalol can cause life-threatening
  ventricular tachycardia associated with QT interval prolongation. A client whose baseline QTc is longer than 450
  msec should not start sotalol therapy. If the QT interval lengthens to 500 msec or more, the dose should be
  reduced, the dosing interval lengthened, or the drug discontinued. The creatinine clearance should be
  calculated to determine appropriate dosing.

Calcium has several roles within cardiac tissue. It flows into the cells of the SA node (the pacemaker of the heart)
and AV node to mediate the heart rate and conduct electrical signals from the atria to the ventricles. Calcium also
facilitates contraction of the cardiac myocytes when stimulated by the cardiac conduction system. Outside the
heart, calcium facilitates arterial vasoconstriction, which in turn maintains blood pressure.

Antidysrhythmic calcium channel blockers are class IV Vaughan Williams drugs and are also known as
nondihydropyridine (non-DHP) calcium channel blockers. They inhibit calcium channels in cardiac cells, resulting in
a slower heart rate, slower conduction through the AV node, and a decreased force of contraction. Calcium channel
blockers are useful for slowing the heart rate in clients with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response because
they slow down the conduction of abnormal impulses through the AV node, thus decreasing the rate at which the
ventricles are prompted to contract.

Many calcium channel blockers have drug interactions, which warrant vigilant assessment. Specific drug
interactions will be discussed for the agents in the following sections.

     SAFETY ALERT

 Calcium Channel Blockers

  Calcium channel blocker antidysrhythmic drugs reduce heart rate and blood pressure. The nurse must monitor
  the baseline heart rate and blood pressure before administering a calcium channel blocker and then monitor
  them frequently during therapy. If the baseline heart rate is less than 60 beats per minute, consider checking
  with the health care provider before administration.

Another class of calcium channel blockers, the DHP calcium channel blockers, block calcium channels only within
arteries, not within the heart. Therefore, DHP calcium channel blockers are useful for treating hypertension but not
for treating dysrhythmias. See Antihypertensive and Antianginal Drugs for more information about hypertension
504  17 · Antidysrhythmic Drugs

     treatment.

     The most common non-DHP calcium channel blockers are diltiazem and verapamil.

     Diltiazem

     Diltiazem is a non-DHP calcium channel blocker antidysrhythmic. It is available in both oral and intravenous dosage
     forms; oral options include immediate-release and extended-release products. It is FDA approved for hypertension
     and angina. The intravenous form is also FDA approved for heart rate control in atrial fibrillation. Although oral
     diltiazem is not FDA approved for this condition, national guidelines do recommend its use for this indication
     (January et al., 2014).

     Many different companies manufacture oral diltiazem as similar but not bioequivalent generic products, which can
     lead to confusion during prescribing and administration. Some examples are Cardizem, Cartia XT, Dilt-XR, Taztia XT,
     Tiadylt ER, and Matzim LA. The nurse should take an accurate medication history with the specific medication the
     client takes and be careful to avoid confusing the various products.

     Diltiazem has a notable drug interaction with simvastatin. The FDA recommends limiting the dose of simvastatin to
     10 mg daily with concomitant use because it can result in increased plasma levels of simvastatin, leading to adverse
     events (Hopewell et al., 2020; U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2017).

     Verapamil

     Verapamil is a non-DHP calcium channel blocker approved for the treatment of angina, atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter,
     hypertension, and supraventricular tachycardia. It is available in both oral and intravenous dosage forms. As with
     diltiazem, the FDA recommends limiting the dose of simvastatin to 10 mg daily with concomitant use because it can
     result in increased plasma levels of simvastatin, leading to adverse events (Hopewell et al., 2020; U.S. Food and
     Drug Administration, 2017).

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications

     Calcium channel blockers can cause bradycardia as an extension of their therapeutic effect. They also decrease
     arterial vasoconstriction, which reduces blood pressure and can cause hypotension. Additionally, they can cause
     swelling and edema.

     Because calcium is important for facilitating ventricular contraction, calcium channel blockers can decrease
     contractility of the heart. This can be particularly troublesome in clients with heart failure with reduced ejection
     fraction or acute myocardial infarction, who already have decreased contractility. For this reason, non-DHP calcium
     channel blockers should be used cautiously or avoided in those clients. They should also be avoided in clients who
     have bradycardia or AV blocks without a pacemaker or those receiving beta-adrenergic blockers.

Nursing Implications

The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking calcium channel blockers:

· Obtain a complete medication list to check for any drug interactions.
· Measure heart rate and blood pressure before administering a non-DHP calcium channel blocker.
· Notify the health care provider if the client has baseline bradycardia and does not have a pacemaker.
· Use continuous cardiac/hemodynamic monitoring in clients on intravenous calcium channel blockers.
· Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

   teaching guidelines.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking a calcium channel blocker should:

    · Contact their health care provider if they experience signs or symptoms of therapeutic failure, such as
        racing heart, lightheadedness, or fatigue (signs and symptoms of the dysrhythmia).

    · Contact their health care provider if they experience signs or symptoms of adverse effects of the
        medication, such as dizziness or lightheadedness (which could indicate hypotension) or edema.

    · Avoid drinking grapefruit juice.
    · Keep an accurate and up-to-date medication list and provide it to their providers at each appointment in
506  17 · Antidysrhythmic Drugs

               order to avoid drug interactions.
           · Monitor their heart rate and blood pressure as directed by their health care provider.

     17.6 Unclassified Antidysrhythmics

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 17.6.1 Identify the characteristics of unclassified drugs used to treat dysrhythmias.
         · 17.6.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of unclassified drugs used to

             treat dysrhythmias.
         · 17.6.3 Describe the nursing implications of unclassified drugs used to treat dysrhythmias.
         · 17.6.4 Explain the client education related to unclassified drugs used to treat dysrhythmias.

     Some antidysrhythmic drugs do not have a mechanism that fits into in the Vaughan Williams classification. These
     heterogeneous drugs do not have a unifying mechanism or treatment indication; they vary in their properties, and
     each will be discussed separately in the following sections.

     Atropine

     Atropine is an anticholinergic agent approved for symptomatic bradycardia, among other indications. It works as an
     acetylcholine receptor antagonist, thus decreasing parasympathetic or vagal regulation of the heart rate. It is
     important to note that heart transplant recipients lack vagal innervation, so atropine does not work to treat
     bradycardia in these clients.

     Atropine should be administered by rapid intravenous injection. Slow administration of atropine has been
     associated with paradoxical bradycardia (McLendon & Preuss, 2022) and should be avoided.

     Digoxin

     Digoxin is an older antidysrhythmic drug that was first approved in 1954 and is used for rate control of atrial
     fibrillation or atrial flutter. As an antidysrhythmic drug, it works by suppressing conduction through the AV node,
     slowing the rate of conduction and, thus, the ventricular heart rate. It does this by enhancing vagal
     (parasympathetic) stimulation of the heart. It is also approved for treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection
     fraction. Clients with heart failure and concomitant atrial fibrillation have few treatment options because many of
     the antidysrhythmic drugs are contraindicated. Therefore, given its approval for both disease states, digoxin is
     sometimes used for these clients.

     Digoxin is available in both oral and intravenous dosage forms. Because it is eliminated by the kidneys and can
     accumulate in individuals with decreased kidney function, nurses must monitor renal function in clients who are
     taking digoxin.

     Digoxin serum levels can be monitored; the reference range is 0.5-2.0 ng/mL. However, serum levels greater than or
     equal to 1.2 ng/mL may be associated with higher rates of mortality (Lopes et al., 2018). For clients who present
     with toxicity and particularly high digoxin serum levels (greater than 6-10 ng/mL), an antidote called digoxin
     immune fab (Digibind) can be administered to bind the digoxin and facilitate excretion. Many health care providers
     monitor the apical heart rate before administering digoxin, withholding it if the apical heart rate is less than 60 beats
     per minute.

     Adenosine

     Adenosine is another unclassified antidysrhythmic drug that is approved for treating paroxysmal supraventricular
     tachycardia. It works by enhancing potassium efflux and suppressing calcium influx into the cells of the AV node,
     slowing its conduction and extinguishing arrhythmias that originate there. Adenosine is available in an intravenous
     dosage form. It has an extraordinarily short half-life--less than 10 seconds. This short half-life necessitates specific
     administration to ensure that the drug will reach the systemic circulation before it is metabolized: It must be given
     as a rapid IV bolus by the peripheral intravenous route, either administered directly into a vein or into an IV injection
     port as close to the client as possible. It must be immediately followed by a rapid saline flush. Using a stopcock can
     help facilitate quick administration.

After administration of adenosine, clients will frequently experience a brief period of asystole on the ECG while
concurrently experiencing a sensation of their heart stopping. This occurs because for a short period, conduction
through the AV node (and thus the stimulus for ventricular contraction) is blocked. The nurse should tell the client
about this expected effect to mitigate anxiety when the effect occurs. It is short lived due to the short half-life;
prolonged asystole is very rare. Still, adenosine should be given only with continuous ECG monitoring at a facility
with resuscitation measures available.

Table 17.11 lists common unclassified antidysrhythmics and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

Drug                                   Routes and Dosage Ranges

Atropine     Symptomatic bradycardia: 0.5-1 mg IV (may be repeated every 3-5 minutes to a maximum dose
(AtroPen)    of 3 mg).

 Digoxin     Rate control of atrial fibrillation: Dosing is individualized based on client-specific factors (e.g.,
(Lanoxin)    body weight, renal function, age), indication, and serum levels.

 Adenosine   Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia: 6 mg via rapid IV bolus; if therapeutic failure after 1-2
(Adenocard)  minutes, 12 mg should be given.
             This 12 mg dose may be repeated a second time if required.

TABLE 17.11 Drug Emphasis Table: Unclassified Antidysrhythmics (sources: https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/; Kusumoto et al.,
2019)

Adverse Effects and Contraindications

Atropine can cause anticholinergic adverse effects as an extension of its therapeutic effect. Some of the more
serious adverse effects include tachycardia, acute glaucoma, pyloric obstruction, complete urinary retention in
clients with benign prostatic hyperplasia, and formation of respiratory mucus plugs. Other common adverse effects
include dry mouth, constipation, and blurred vision. Clients who cannot tolerate anticholinergic effects should avoid
atropine. This caution includes individuals with myasthenia gravis or those with urinary retention because atropine
can exacerbate their disease. Clients who have had a heart transplant should not rely on atropine to treat
bradycardia because it may not have a therapeutic effect.

Digoxin should not be used in clients with baseline bradycardia or certain heart blocks because it can cause
bradycardia as part of its therapeutic effect. Digoxin therapy has a propensity for toxicity, which is characterized by
gastrointestinal upset, vision changes, dizziness, fatigue, and cardiovascular symptoms such as palpitations from
premature ventricular contractions (Cummings & Swoboda, 2023).

Adenosine has a very short half-life, so adverse effects beyond the immediate period of administration are rare.
However, immediately upon administration it is typical for clients to report skin flushing, sweating, nausea, and an
impending sense of doom. It also can cause dyspnea (shortness of breath) and bronchoconstriction in susceptible
individuals. Adenosine should not be administered to clients with second- or third-degree AV block or to those with
bradycardia who do not have a pacemaker. Adenosine can cause AV block as an extension of its therapeutic effect.

INTRODUCTION Hypertension, a common health condition, increases a person's risk for myocardial infarction
(heart attack), heart failure, renal disease, and stroke. Angina is chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the
heart. Antihypertensive drugs are used to treat hypertension. Antianginal drugs, such as nitrates and calcium
channel blockers, are commonly used to treat angina. This chapter will explore hypertension and angina, and the
pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for these disease processes.

     Hypertension

     The cardiovascular system transports blood and oxygen throughout the body. Blood flows from a system of higher
     resistance to one of lower resistance--from arteries to capillaries to veins. Blood pressure (see Figure 18.2)
     represents the force that blood flow exerts on arterial walls.

     FIGURE 18.2 The walls of the arteries are much thicker than those of the veins because of the higher pressure of the blood that flows
     through them. (credit: modification of work from Anatomy and Physiology 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY
     4.0 license)

     The two elements that determine blood pressure are cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance. Cardiac
     output (CO) is the volume of blood pumped by the heart per unit of time, usually measured in liters per minute. The
     CO is determined by the heart rate (HR), the number of times the heart beats per minute, and stroke volume
     (SV)--the amount of blood ejected with each heartbeat--and is represented by the following equation:

                           .

     Blood pressure is determined by examining both systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings. The systolic blood
     pressure reading represents the amount of pressure within the arteries when the heart contracts, whereas the
     diastolic blood pressure reading reflects the amount of pressure when the heart is at rest between beats. The
     diastolic blood pressure reading, which is the lower pressure within the arteries and vessels, determines the
     peripheral vascular resistance (also known as systemic vascular resistance) by measuring blood flow and the level
     of constriction or dilatation within the arteries and vessels. Blood pressure (BP) is measured in millimeters of
     mercury (mm Hg) and is expressed as the systolic pressure over the diastolic pressure (for instance, 125/90 mm
     Hg).

     Hypertension occurs when an individual's blood pressure is above normal limits for a sustained period of time.
     Hypertension can be either primary (essential) hypertension or secondary hypertension. Primary hypertension is
     caused by unknown elements; however, some studies have implicated genetics and behavioral and environmental
     factors, including age, high salt intake, insulin resistance, obesity, high alcohol intake, sedentary lifestyle, smoking,
     and stress (Aggarwal et al., 2023; Iqbal & Jamal, 2022). According to the Centers for Disease Control and
     Prevention (n.d.), approximately 116 million adults in the United States have hypertension.

     Importantly, hypertension is not limited to adults; it can also affect children and adolescents. In the United States
     and other countries, primary hypertension affects up to 5% of individuals in this younger age group. Developing high
     blood pressure during childhood can have long-term consequences, potentially leading to hypertension in
     adulthood and increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and kidney damage. Certain modifiable risk factors can be
     addressed for this population to improve blood pressure levels, including obesity, physical activity, and nutrition.
     Health care providers should always assess blood pressure in the pediatric population to promote preventive
     measures within families and foster healthy lifestyle habits (American Heart Association, 2023).

     Secondary hypertension results from other conditions involving the central nervous system, endocrine system, and
     renal system and is treated along with the underlying condition. Secondary hypertension may be cured if the

treatment for the underlying condition is successful.

Hormones also impact blood pressure regulation. The Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and
vasopressin are the main physiologic regulatory systems or pathways affecting blood pressure homeostasis. RAAS,
as illustrated in Figure 18.3, is a compensatory mechanism the body activates during hypotension (when blood
pressure is low). Renin is released from the kidneys in response to low blood pressure. Renin interacts with
angiotensinogen and converts it to angiotensin I. The angiotensin-converting enzyme in the pulmonary blood vessel
endothelium is then triggered to produce angiotensin II, which constricts arterioles, increasing peripheral
resistance and increasing blood pressure. Angiotensin II also stimulates the adrenal medulla to produce
catecholamine, which yields aldosterone. Aldosterone causes the kidneys to retain water and sodium, which leads
to water retention and results in an increased blood volume, cardiac output, and blood pressure. Vasopressin is an
antidiuretic hormone that regulates reabsorption of water by the kidneys; it is released by the pituitary gland in
response to low blood volume. Vasopressin causes retention of body fluids, vasoconstriction, and increased blood
pressure.

     Grades of Hypertension
     The American Heart Association (AHA) (n.d-a) reports that prolonged elevation of blood pressure leads to the
     deterioration of blood vessels. The deterioration of blood vessels is measured by grades of hypertension. Normal
     blood pressure is a systolic reading of less than 120 mm Hg and a diastolic reading of less than 80 mm Hg. Elevated
     blood pressure and hypertension increase the risk of vascular damage and decrease oxygenation. The chart below
     from the American College of Cardiology and AHA (see Table 18.1) demonstrates the blood pressure categories and
     the readings associated with them.

     Disease Control and Prevention, https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/facts.htm)

     Diagnostics
     A physical examination by a health care provider with a sphygmomanometer (blood pressure cuff or device) will
     identify an elevated blood pressure, and a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG, EKG) can assist in determining if the
     heart has a normal or abnormal rhythm. The health care provider also obtains blood work to determine factors that
     contribute to the client's hypertension as well as how the body is reacting to elevated blood pressure. These
     laboratory tests include a complete blood cell count (CBC), basic electrolyte panel, cholesterol panel, and renal
     function. An echocardiogram--an ultrasound of the heart--is not typically included in diagnostic procedures to
     determine hypertension; however, the health care provider may add this diagnostic study to visualize the heart's
     chambers, valves, and pumping action to determine the effect of hypertension on the heart, which may cause other
     disorders such as hypertrophy of the heart. The health care provider bases the diagnosis for hypertension on the
     findings of the physical examination and the diagnostic study results.

     Clinical Manifestations
     Symptoms of hypertension may not occur for years, and most of the time, the symptoms can be silent. Symptoms
     typically associated with hypertension include elevated blood pressure readings, headaches, dizziness, nausea,
     vomiting, visual disturbances, and neurological disturbances such as disorientation or a decreased level of
     consciousness. Over time, uncontrolled hypertension can lead to organ damage. Clients can experience symptoms
     related to the specific organ that is damaged; for example, if hypertension is left untreated, it may cause renal
     insufficiency, which may then continue to deteriorate, causing kidney damage and leading to end-stage renal
     disease that requires dialysis.

     Nonpharmacologic Treatment for Hypertension
     Nonpharmacologic measures used to treat hypertension center around lifestyle changes. Lifestyle changes focus on
     the client's personal, social, and cultural influences. These changes may include diet modification, increased
     physical activity and exercise, smoking cessation, alcohol consumption reduction, relaxation techniques, and self-
     monitoring.

     TRENDING TODAY

 Gender and Racial Bias in Cardiovascular Disease Treatment

  The AHA conducted a critical assessment of research and clinical knowledge on cardiovascular disease across
  the United States specifically addressing women's health. In its report to the president (https://openstax.org/r/
  heartorgennews), gaps were identified and actions outlined to optimize cardiovascular health in women across
  their lifespans, with the goal of reaching health equity in health care (Wenger et al., 2022). The AHA has deployed
  awareness campaigns that are culturally sensitive and focus on the optimization of preventive and clinical care.
  Community engagement and advocacy in policy change at the legislative level have been encouraged.

  Access multimedia content (https://openstax.org/books/pharmacology/pages/18-1-hypertension-and-angina)
 In a fireside video chat, The Heart of the Matter: Racial and Gender Bias in Cardiovascular Care, presented by
  Abbott Cardiovascular, an expert panel of health care providers and representatives discusses cardiovascular
  care. The panel identifies gender and racial bias as negatively impacting the client experience for persons with
  coronary and peripheral artery disease. The chat covers not only cardiovascular health but also technologies that
  may be utilized to bridge the critical gaps identified.

Dietary Modification
Clients with hypertension should eat a low-sodium diet consisting of whole grains, vegetables, and fruits. Other
recommendations include low-fat dairy products and limiting meat intake to about two servings daily of lean meat,
such as fish and poultry (Challa & Ameer, 2023). Reducing sweets and red meat is also important. The AHA (n.d.-b)
recommends 1500 mg to no more than 2300 mg of sodium intake daily. Dietary patterns and nutritional therapy
should focus on food preferences, social and cultural influences, and appropriate caloric intake.

Physical Activity and Exercise
The AHA (n.d.-d) recommends 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic
activity weekly. Average time for exercise should be at least 30-40 minutes per session to assist in decreasing blood
pressure. If the client cannot do 30-40 minutes of moderate exercise four times a week, the nurse should suggest
an alternate exercise plan, emphasizing that some physical activity is better than no physical activity. Physical
activity and exercise enhance weight reduction and promote a healthy lifestyle.

Smoking Cessation and Reducing Alcohol Consumption
Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of coronary artery disease. Smoking increases sympathetic nervous
system activity, which causes vasoconstriction and, therefore, increases blood pressure, heart rate, and myocardial
contractility. Although smoking has been established as a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease, its
relationship to high blood pressure is still being investigated. Nevertheless, smoking and exposure to secondhand
smoke contribute to increased accumulation of fatty deposits within the arteries, which high blood pressure is
known to accelerate (AHA, n.d.-c).

Alcohol consumption increases blood pressure by increasing the level of the hormone renin in the blood. Renin
decreases fluid elimination, causing higher fluid volume in the body and arterial vasoconstriction that results in an
increase in blood pressure. Reducing alcohol consumption has been shown to decrease systolic and/or diastolic
blood pressure by 5-12 mm Hg (Wake, 2021).

Relaxation Techniques
According to Harvard Health Publishing (2022), meditation has been associated with reducing blood pressure.
Herawati et al. (2023) adds that slow breathing can be used as a nonpharmacological treatment to lower blood
pressure. The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (2021) reviewed research on relaxation
and blood pressure control that showed relaxation techniques resulted in small reductions in blood pressure and
demonstrated yoga may be used as an adjunct intervention for the management of hypertension.

          CLINICAL TIP

      Assessing Client Lifestyle Modifications

       The nurse should work closely with the client to promote lifestyle changes--such as diet modifications and
       weight loss, increase in exercise, smoking cessation, and use of relaxation techniques--that will improve baseline
       blood pressure readings.

     Self-Monitoring of Hypertension
     Home blood pressure monitoring (Figure 18.4) contributes to the comprehension of hypertension and facilitates the
     awareness of the importance of blood pressure management. Clients are now able to monitor their blood pressure
     with electronic blood pressure devices. Home blood pressure monitoring leads to awareness of one's blood
     pressure, better blood pressure control, and adherence to lifestyle changes and drug therapies (Verma et al., 2021).

     FIGURE 18.4 Daily blood pressure monitoring at home allows clients to better manage their blood pressure. (credit: "Arm Band Blood
     Pressure Monitor" by Alabama Extension/Flickr, Public Domain)

     Pharmacologic Treatment of Hypertension
     Pharmacologic treatment of hypertension centers on the individual client and takes into consideration their lifestyle
     as well as their personal, social, and cultural preferences. The objectives of pharmacological treatment are to
     reduce blood pressure and reduce the long-term effects of hypertension like organ damage. Angiotensin-converting
     enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta-adrenergic blockers, calcium channel blockers, and
     thiazide-like diuretics (Khalil & Zeltser, 2022) are the primary antihypertensive drugs used to treat high blood
     pressure. These drugs are discussed in detail later in this chapter.

          CLINICAL TIP

      Assessing Therapeutic Effects

       The nurse should monitor the client's blood pressure to assess for drug efficacy. If blood pressure remains
       elevated despite antihypertensive treatment, the health care provider may adjust antihypertensive drugs to
       better control the client's blood pressure.

     Angina

     Angina (also called angina pectoris) is characterized by discomfort in the front of the chest, neck, shoulders, jaw, or
     arms that is precipitated by physical exertions and relieved by rest within 5 minutes or sublingual nitrates (Ueng et
     al., 2023). Angina is caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. The four types of angina (AHA, 2022a) are:

         · Stable angina is the most common form. It often occurs during activity and may sometimes occur at rest.
             Stable angina is predictable and follows a pattern of similar episodes of chest pain.

         · Unstable angina is unpredictable and considered a medical emergency. Unlike stable angina, unstable angina

18.1 · Hypertension and Angina                                                                                           517

        usually occurs during rest and does not follow a pattern of similar episodes of chest pain; episodes may last
        longer than stable angina episodes. If blood flow to the heart does not improve, a myocardial infarction (heart
        attack) may occur.
    · Variant (Prinzmetal) angina, unlike the other forms of angina, is not caused by coronary artery disease but
        rather by a spasm in the heart's arteries that temporarily decreases blood flow and almost always occurs at
        rest.
    · Microvascular angina is frequent episodes of angina that occur due to coronary microvascular disease.

Risk factors for stable, unstable, and microvascular angina include age, family history, tobacco use, diabetes,
hypertension, high cholesterol, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Risk factors for Prinzmetal angina may be caused
by anything that leads to spasms of the coronary arteries including certain medications such as decongestants, use
of substances such as cannabis and cocaine, smoking tobacco, and stress (AHA, 2022a).

Pharmacologic Treatment of Angina
Pharmacologic treatment for angina is individualized. Client lifestyle, as well as social and cultural influences,
impact the health care provider's treatment choice. The goal for pharmacologic treatment of stable angina is to
prevent an ischemic event--like myocardial ischemia or infarction (heart attack)--from occurring. Nitrates are the
first line of treatment for angina along with beta-adrenergic blockers and calcium channel blockers (Rousan &
Thadani, 2019). Both types of blockers will be discussed further in this chapter.

        UNFOLDING CASE STUDY

Part A

Read the following clinical scenario to answer the questions that follow. This case study will evolve throughout the
chapter.

Hahn Tran is a 53-year-old client who presents to her health care provider's office with reports of a headache and
dizziness. When questioned, she describes her headache as throbbing and that it is worse in the morning when she
awakens. She is unable to identify any triggers for the headaches but states they are relieved with acetaminophen.

Hahn reports trying to follow a healthy diet but states that she does not really know what that means and that she
uses a lot of salt in her cooking. She smokes about 6-8 cigarettes daily, which is down from one pack daily 3 months
ago. Hahn does not exercise regularly and reports having 1-2 glasses of wine on the weekend. She lives with her
husband and two teenage children and works in the kitchen at the children's school.

             hypertension.

     Introduction and Use

     Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are a classification of drugs that block the body's production of
     angiotensin II. Angiotensin II induces oxidative stress and inflammation of cardiac tissue, which contributes to
     adverse remodeling processes. Angiotensin II also causes vasoconstriction and inhibits the reuptake of
     norepinephrine, stimulating catecholamine release. The release of catecholamine decreases urinary excretion of
     sodium and water, which then causes the release of aldosterone. Aldosterone stimulates the hypertrophy of the
     vascular smooth muscles, causing thickening of the vascular smooth muscle wall and restricting blood flow. ACE
     inhibitors (see Figure 18.5) are used to treat hypertension and cardiovascular diseases by reducing the release of
     aldosterone as part of the first line of treatment for clients who have hypertension (Goyal et al., 2022).

  SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

  ACE Inhibitors

  Some clients with hypertension demonstrate a lower response to ACE inhibitor monotherapy. ACE inhibitors
  interfere with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which causes high blood pressure when renin levels
  are high. Black clients often have hypertension, but also have lower levels of renin. Therefore, concomitant
  therapy may be required to increase response to antihypertensive therapies.

   SAFETY ALERT

ACE Inhibitors

Taking ACE inhibitors with potassium-containing salt substitutes or consuming large amounts of high potassium
foods increases the risk of hyperkalemia. Having a blood potassium level above 6.0 mmol/L is considered a
medical emergency and can result in cardiac arrest.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking an ACE inhibitor should:

    · Avoid foods high in potassium and salt substitutes (because these are high in potassium) due to the
        aldosterone release.

    · Report side effects such as low blood pressure, cough, heart palpitations, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills,
        sore throat, swelling of the eyes and lips, or difficulty breathing to their health care provider.

    · Notify their health care provider if pregnant, planning on getting pregnant, or breastfeeding before starting
        an ACE inhibitor.

    · Report symptoms such as chest pain, slurred speech, hemiparesis, and difficulty speaking or walking to
        their health care provider immediately because these may be symptoms of a heart attack or stroke.

    · Be aware that a persistent cough may develop when taking ACE inhibitors.

  FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

18.3 Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs)

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 18.3.1 Identify the characteristics of the angiotensin II receptor blocker drugs used to treat
        hypertension.

    · 18.3.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of the angiotensin II receptor
        blocker drugs used to treat hypertension.

    · 18.3.3 Describe nursing implications of angiotensin II receptor blocker drugs used to treat hypertension.
    · 18.3.4 Explain the client education related to angiotensin II receptor blocker drugs used to treat

        hypertension.

Introduction and Use

Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are a classification of drug that binds to and inhibits angiotensin II type I
receptors. Renin secretion catalyzes the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin in the liver where it is then
converted to angiotensin II by the angiotensin-converting enzyme.

ARBs resemble ACE inhibitors in how they affect blood pressure and the cardiovascular system. However, there are
three notable differences: ARBs are less likely than ACE inhibitors to cause a chronic cough (Carter, 2022); the risk
of angioedema is decreased with ARBs as compared with ACE inhibitors; and ARBs have been shown to be effective
in the treatment of chronic kidney disease and heart failure.

Table 18.5 lists common ARBs and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

     TABLE 18.5 Drug Emphasis Table: ARBs (source: https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/)

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications

     Adverse effects of ARBs include dizziness, muscle cramps, weakness, heartburn, diarrhea, leg swelling, headaches,
     and weight loss. Serious adverse effects include angioedema, hypotension, hepatic impairment, and hyperkalemia.

     SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

     ARBs

     The renin-angiotensin system has been associated with increased risk of mood disorders. The use of ARBs may
     be associated with an increased risk of suicide compared with other antihypertensive therapies (Sanches &
     Teixeira, 2021). Hypertensive clients with low renin (sometimes seen more often in Black clients) demonstrate a
     lower response to ARB monotherapy. Concomitant therapy may be required to increase response to
     antihypertensive therapies. Older adults (65 years and older) and clients with hepatic impairment should start
     on a low initial dose because ARBs are metabolized by the liver.

     (Source: Colvin et al., 2020)

     ARBs should not be taken during pregnancy. Clients with hepatic impairment should use ARBs cautiously. Clients
     with a previous hypersensitivity reaction or angioedema to an ARB should not be prescribed this classification of
     drug. Clients with a history of mood disturbances or who are at risk for mood disturbances should be monitored
     closely for suicidal ideation.

          SAFETY ALERT

      ARBs

       ARBs can have teratogenic effects (causing harm to the embryo or fetus), so clients should avoid being pregnant
       while taking an ARB.

     18.4 Beta-Adrenergic Blockers

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 18.4.1 Identify the characteristics of the beta-adrenergic blocker drugs used to treat hypertension.
         · 18.4.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of the beta-adrenergic blocker

             drugs used to treat hypertension.

         · 18.4.4 Explain the client education related to beta-adrenergic blocker drugs used to treat hypertension.

     Introduction and Use

     Beta-adrenergic blockers (beta blockers) are a classification of drugs that inhibit chronotropic, inotropic, and
     vasoconstrictor response to catecholamine--such as epinephrine and norepinephrine--by exerting effects on
     adrenergic receptors beta 1, beta 2, and alpha.

     Beta 1 receptors are found primarily in the heart and kidneys, and they increase the heart rate, myocardial activity,
     and release of renin. Beta 2 receptors are found in the smooth muscle tissue of the heart, lungs, and nervous system
     and increase myocardial contractility and cause muscle tremors. Alpha receptors stimulate vasoconstriction.

     Beta blockers are classified as either nonselective or cardio-selective. Nonselective beta blockers affect both beta 1
     and beta 2 and act on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Cardio-selective beta blockers, in contrast, affect
     beta 1, which impacts the cardiovascular system (Tucker et al., 2022).

     Beta blockers decrease heart rate, decrease myocardial contractility, and decrease the rate of conduction through
     the atrioventricular (AV) node, thereby lowering blood pressure and heart rate. Beta blockers also cause
     vasodilation and decrease the release of renin and angiotensin II, promoting excretion of sodium and water from the
     body. Beta blockers are relatively safe for use. Beta blockers treat clients with hypertension, heart failure,
     arrhythmias, myocardial infarctions, migraines, glaucoma, and certain types of tremors. Beta blockers have also
     been used by health care providers as anxiolytics (to reduce anxiety).

     Most beta blockers are taken orally. Labetalol, metoprolol, and propranolol can be administered intravenously.
     Extended-release beta blockers should not be crushed. Nurses should monitor blood pressure and pulse rate of
     clients using beta blockers. Beta blockers should not be administered if the client is hypotensive or has a heart rate
     of less than 60 (Farzam & Jan, 2022).

       SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

       Beta Blockers

       Beta blockers pose an ethical dilemma for health care providers because they cause anxiolytic effects. The FDA,
       however, does not support this use for beta blockers. The health care provider may prescribe beta blockers off-
       label (against FDA-approved labeling indications for drug use) for anxiety. Therefore, the prescribed use of beta
       blockers for anxiolysis should be weighed against standards of practice as well as risks and benefits to the
       client.

Beta blockers may mask low blood sugar levels in clients with diabetes due to sympathetic nervous system
inhibition.

(Source: Dungan et al., 2019)

Asthmatic clients and clients with chronic lung diseases should be monitored carefully while taking beta
blockers because lung function can decrease due to beta 2 inhibition.

(Source: Huang et al., 2021)

Table 18.7 lists common beta blockers and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

Drug                                   Routes and Dosage Ranges

 Atenolol    50 mg orally daily, either alone or with diuretic therapy. If optimal response is not achieved, the
(Tenormin)   dosage should increase to 100 mg orally daily. Dosage beyond 100 mg a day is unlikely to produce
             any further benefit.

Carvedilol   6.25-25 mg orally twice daily; maximum dose 25 mg daily.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications

Adverse effects of beta blockers are dizziness, fatigue, weight gain, constipation, cold hands and feet,
hypercholesterolemia, shortness of breath, depression, nausea, dry mouth, and dry eyes. Serious adverse effects
include bradycardia, arrhythmias, hypoglycemia, and hypotension. Rare side effects include sexual and erectile
dysfunction.

Beta blockers are contraindicated in clients with moderate to severe asthma and/or chronic lung diseases due to the
potential for causing an exacerbation. Beta blockers should be used cautiously in clients with AV node and sinus
bradycardia because they can aggravate these conditions. Beta blockers may exacerbate symptoms of Raynaud's
phenomenon or cause this disease process in clients. People with diabetes should use beta blockers cautiously
because they can mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia, causing confusion, fainting, or seizures.

     CLINICAL TIP

     Assessing Comorbidities: Asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, and Diabetes

     Nurses should always assess a client's comorbidities--such as asthma, COPD, and diabetes--before
     administering beta blocker drugs. To prevent a pharmacological drug interaction, the nurse must assess whether
     clients are taking short-acting beta agonists (SABAs) because beta blockers can reduce their effectiveness.
     Additionally, nurses should be aware that beta blockers can mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia in clients with
     diabetes.

Nursing Implications

The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking beta-adrenergic blockers:

    · Assess the client's blood pressure and pulse on an ongoing basis with initial dosing and intermittently during
        drug therapy.

    · Do not administer the drug if the client's heart rate is less than 60 beats per minute and notify the health care
        provider.

    · Assess and monitor the client for adverse effects, drug and food interactions, and contraindications.
    · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

        teaching guidelines.

  CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

  The client taking a beta-adrenergic blocker should:

      · Take their pulse as directed before taking a beta-adrenergic blocker and do not administer the drug if the
          pulse is less than 60 beats/minute or as directed by their health care provider.

      · Understand that beta-adrenergic blockers can induce hyperglycemia. Clients with diabetes should monitor
          blood glucose levels closely.

      · Take this medication without regard to meals.
      · Report side effects such as bradycardia, hypotension, fatigue, dizziness, constipation, or sexual

          dysfunction to their health care provider.
      · Monitor for symptoms of worsening heart failure such as fatigue, weight gain, and peripheral edema.

  The client taking a beta-adrenergic blocker should not:

      · Take beta-adrenergic blockers with over-the-counter (OTC) drugs or herbal supplements such as ma-
          huang, ephedra, black cohosh, hawthorn, or licorice without consulting their health care provider because
          these supplements may interfere with the action of the beta-adrenergic blocker.

      · Discontinue use without speaking with the health care provider first because this may cause exacerbation
          of angina and myocardial infarction.

  FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

  Beta-Adrenergic Blockers

  Beta blocker therapy should not be abruptly stopped but gradually tapered to avoid exacerbation of angina and
  myocardial infarction. Seek health care provider advice before discontinuing use.

18.5 Calcium Channel Blockers

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 18.5.1 Identify the characteristics of the calcium channel blocker drugs used to treat hypertension and
        angina.

    · 18.5.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of the calcium channel
        blocker drugs used to treat hypertension and angina.

        angina.

    · 18.5.4 Explain the client education related to calcium channel blocker drugs used to treat hypertension
        and angina.

Introduction and Use

Calcium channel blockers are a classification of drug that blocks calcium from entering cells by binding to long-
528  18 · Antihypertensive and Antianginal Drugs

     acting voltage-gated calcium channels in the heart, smooth muscle, and pancreas. Calcium causes vasoconstriction.
     Calcium channel blockers inhibit calcium and allow for vasodilation, thereby causing the heart rate to slow and
     blood pressure to lower. Calcium channel blockers are commonly used to treat hypertension, angina, and
     arrhythmias.

     Calcium channel blockers are classified as dihydropyridines or nondihydropyridines. Dihydropyridines are peripheral
     vasodilators that lower blood pressure and heart rate; they are used to treat post-intracranial hemorrhage,
     vasospasm, and migraines. In addition to their action on the peripheral vasculature, nondihydropyridines inhibit the
     sinoatrial and AV nodes, slowing cardiac conduction and heart rate and decreasing oxygen demand.

     Calcium channel blockers may be used alone or in combination with other drugs. They are highly protein bound,
     which increases the volume of distribution within the body. Calcium channel blockers are available in long- and
     short-acting formulas.

       SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

       Calcium Channel Blockers

       Calcium channel blockers are among the most effective antihypertensive classifications of drugs for use in non-
       Hispanic Black adults.

     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 18.6.1 Identify the characteristics of the diuretic drugs used to treat hypertension.
         · 18.6.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of the diuretic drugs used to

         · 18.6.3 Describe nursing implications of diuretic drugs used to treat hypertension.
         · 18.6.4 Explain the client education related to diuretic drugs used to treat hypertension.

     Introduction and Use

     Diuretics are a classification of drug that induces sodium loss and increases urine flow. They are typically used to
     treat hypertension, heart failure, and volume overload states. This chapter will cover diuretics as they are prescribed
     for hypertension and coronary heart disorders, thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics, and potassium-sparing diuretics.
     (Loop diuretics, which are also prescribed for heart failure, are discussed in Heart Failure Drugs.)

Thiazide and Thiazide-Like Diuretics
Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics inhibit the reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the distal renal tubules. These
diuretics increase the excretion of sodium and water by the kidneys, producing diuresis in the client, and also create
a potassium loss within the body. Along with ACE inhibitors, thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics are often the first
line of treatment for clients diagnosed with hypertension and may be used in conjunction with other
antihypertensive drugs (Akbari & Khorasani-Zadeh, 2022).

Potassium-Sparing Diuretics
Potassium-sparing diuretics antagonize aldosterone. These drugs reduce aldosterone-induced sodium and water
retention in the late distal tubules of the kidneys. These types of diuretics retain potassium within the body;
therefore, potassium does not need to be supplemented. Potassium-sparing diuretics are commonly used to treat
hypertension and heart failure but should be used cautiously in clients with impaired renal function.

Table 18.11 lists common diuretics and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

Drug                                           Routes and Dosage Ranges

Chlorthalidone       25-100 mg orally daily; maximum dose 100 mg daily.

Hydrochlorothiazide  12.5-50 mg orally daily.
      (Microzide)

Amiloride            5-20 mg orally daily; maximum dose 20 mg daily.
(Midamor)

Spironolactone       25-100 mg orally daily
  (Aldactone)

Triamterene          Individualized based on client need. When used alone, the starting dose is 100 mg orally

(Dyrenium)           twice daily. Maximum dose should not exceed 300 mg orally daily.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications

Diuretics are used to treat various disorders. Common adverse effects include mineral loss, weakness, fatigue,
muscle cramps, palpitations, dizziness, and electrolyte imbalances. Adverse effects from hypokalemia (with thiazide
and thiazide-like diuretics) and hyperkalemia (with potassium-sparing diuretics) are potentially severe and/or fatal.
Clients with a hypersensitivity to diuretics or their components should not take this classification of drugs. Diuretics
should be used cautiously in older clients and clients with hepatic or renal impairment, arrhythmias, or gout.

causes the dilation of coronary vessels. Vasodilation improves oxygen supply to the heart, decreases oxygen
demand within the body, reduces cardiac workload (preload and afterload), and lowers blood pressure. Nitrates
have been used to treat chest pain and angina since the early 1800s. Nitrates come in different forms including oral,
sublingual, translingual spray, intravenous, topical, and transdermal and can be short-acting or long-acting. Nitrates
are commonly used to treat angina, acute coronary syndrome, arterial hypertension, and heart failure (Lee &
Gerriets, 2022).

  SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

  Nitrates

  Older clients using nitrates are at a higher risk for postural hypotension and should rise from a lying or sitting
  position slowly to prevent falls and injuries.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications

     Adverse effects for nitrates include headache, lightheadedness, flushing, syncope, reflex tachycardia, and dizziness.
     Serious adverse effects include hypotension.

     Contraindications include allergies to nitrates, concomitant use of phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors such as
     tadalafil and sildenafil, history of right ventricular infarction, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Nitrates should be
     used cautiously in clients on long-term diuretic therapy, with low systolic blood pressure, with autonomic nervous
     system dysregulation, and who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

     SAFETY ALERT

     Nitrates

     Nitrates can induce hypotension. They should not be taken with PDE inhibitors because they can cause severe
     hypotension and cardiac decompensation.

Nursing Implications

The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking nitrates:

· Carefully assess the client for drug and herbal supplement interactions because they may cause profound
   hypotension.

· Assess and monitor the client's blood pressure during initial dosing and intermittently throughout drug
   therapy, especially if administering nitrates intravenously, because they may cause severe hypotension.

· Do not administer nitrates if the client's systolic blood pressure is less than 90 mm Hg and if the heart rate is
   greater than 100 beats/minute. Notify the health care provider.

· Adhere to health care provider instructions on how and when to administer this classification of drug or when
   to hold the drug.

· Assess adverse effects and therapeutic effects.
· Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client
536  18 · Antihypertensive and Antianginal Drugs

          teaching guidelines.

     CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

     The client taking a sublingual nitrate should:

         · Take sublingual nitrates if chest pain occurs. They should take one sublingual nitrate every 5 minutes
             times three doses if chest pain persists. If chest pain continues, the client should call 911.

         · Store sublingual nitrate bottles away from the light in a dry place and in the original amber glass bottle.

     The client using nitrate patches should:

         · Apply patches once daily as a maintenance medication.
         · Avoid hairy areas when applying nitrate patches.
         · Remove nitrate patches for 10-12 hours before placing a new one to prevent tolerance.
         · Rotate sites of nitrate patches to prevent skin irritation.

     The client using a nitrate should not:

         · Use patches for acute chest pain.
         · Take erectile dysfunction medications because this may cause profound hypotension.

     Other Concerns

         · Headaches may occur with the use of nitrates. Acetaminophen may help in relieving these headaches.
         · If low blood pressure develops, the client should lie on their back with legs elevated and notify their health

             care provider.

     FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

     Nitroprusside

     Nitroprusside can cause precipitous decreases in blood pressure which can lead to irreversible ischemic injuries
     or death.

     Nitroprusside produces dose-related cyanide which can be lethal. Limit infusions at the maximum rate to as
     short as duration as possible.

             UNFOLDING CASE STUDY

     Part C

     Read the following clinical scenario to answer the questions that follow. This case study is a follow-up from Case
     Study Parts A and B.

     Hahn Tran is following up with the health care provider 3 months after her initial diagnosis of hypertension stage 2.
     She reports her headaches and dizziness have improved; however, she is now reporting chest pain when she walks
     1-2 miles. The chest pain is relieved by resting on a park bench. Hahn states she experiences a burning in her chest
     that does not radiate to other areas. She denies nausea, diaphoresis, shortness of breath, or dizziness with chest
     pain.

     The nurse performs a 12-lead ECG on Hahn, as ordered. The health care provider notes that there are no ischemic
     changes and diagnoses Hahn with stable angina. The health care provider prescribes verapamil 40 mg orally three
     times daily and nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingually for chest pain. The nurse is developing a teaching care plan for
     Hahn.

INTRODUCTION Heart failure is a complex syndrome that occurs when the heart is no longer able to generate
adequate cardiac output. Anything that affects left ventricular filling or pumping can lead to heart failure, and it is
often the result of prolonged untreated hypertension or acute myocardial infarction. This chapter will review heart
failure and the pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for this syndrome.

Pathophysiology of Heart Failure

The importance of cardiac output cannot be stressed enough; it is necessary for every organ in the body. Cardiac

output is a function of heart rate (HR) and stroke volume (SV):  . Normal resting CO is 4-5 liters

per minute. Heart rate is the number of times the heart beats per minute. Stroke volume is the amount of blood
542  19 · Heart Failure Drugs

     pumped out of the left ventricle with each heartbeat. Stroke volume is a function of preload, afterload, and
     contractility. Preload is the volume of blood returning to the heart, afterload is the amount of pressure that the left
     ventricle must push against, and contractility is the ability of the left ventricle to squeeze or pump blood. Stroke
     volume is often measured by ejection fraction, or the percentage of blood that is pumped out of the left ventricle
     with each beat (Hajouli & Ludhwani, 2022). It is important to note that the entire volume of the left ventricle is not
     pumped out with each beat; a small portion remains in the chamber. Factors affecting cardiac output can be seen in
     Figure 19.2.

     FIGURE 19.2 Cardiac output is influenced by heart rate and stroke volume, both of which are variable. (Note: EDV: End diastolic volume;

     In order for the heart to produce adequate stroke volume, the left ventricle must be able to fill well (preload) and
     squeeze well (contractility). Contractility requires adequate muscle tissue (adequate cardiac myocytes), which must
     receive an adequate blood supply. So, the heart itself is dependent on cardiac output.

     Heart failure occurs when the heart is no longer able to generate an adequate cardiac output. Heart failure is a
     result of ventricular dysfunction; something has affected ventricular preload or contractility in such a way that the
     ventricle is no longer able to expel blood effectively (Malik et al., 2022). This leads to decreased perfusion of all
     tissues. There are two ways in which the heart is not able to maintain cardiac output. One is caused by a reduced
     ejection fraction and is called heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The other, called heart failure
     with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), occurs when the actual ejection fraction is not reduced but cardiac
     output is still decreased.

     Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction
     Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is a problem stemming from inadequate contractility. It is the most
     common type of heart failure. There are multiple causes of HFrEF, including coronary artery disease and acute
     myocardial infarction (AMI). Both cause decreased oxygenation to the individual cardiac muscle cells or cardiac
     myocytes. Because the cardiac myocytes have less oxygen than they need, they are not able to contract well. In the
     case of an AMI, the myocytes have had their oxygen supply cut off, and so there is cell death. Dead myocytes don't
     contract at all.

     Hypertension is also a common cause of HFrEF. Long-standing untreated hypertension increases afterload and
     causes the left ventricle to work harder to eject blood. Initially, the left ventricle can hypertrophy (thicken) to push
     against the increased resistance (see Figure 19.3). After many years, the left ventricular hypertrophy can't keep up
     with the increased resistance, and the heart is unable to maintain an adequate cardiac output. Because contractility
     and afterload are considered part of systole, this was traditionally referred to as systolic heart failure.

Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction
Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction stems from muscle stiffness. As people age, muscles can become stiff
and not move as well as they did in younger years. This also can happen to the left ventricle; the muscle tissue can
become stiff, which does not allow for adequate ventricular opening. If the ventricles cannot open well, then they
cannot fill well. If the ventricle cannot fill well, this decreases preload, which then decreases stroke volume.

Recall that ejection fraction (EF) is the percentage of blood pumped from the heart with each beat (EF is defined as
blood ejected from the left ventricle divided by total volume of blood in the left ventricle at the end of diastole). In
HFpEF, less blood fills the ventricle during diastole (thus there is lower total volume at the end of diastole/lower
preload, the denominator in the above equation), and less blood is pumped out of the left ventricle (lower stroke
volume and thus lower cardiac output, the numerator in the above equation). Therefore, both the denominator and
numerator of the equation change proportionally and the ratio, or ejection fraction, remains the same despite
cardiac output being lower. Hence the name heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Because preload is
considered part of diastole (or ventricular filling), this type of heart failure traditionally was referred to as diastolic
heart failure.

The main treatment for HFpEF is control of hypertension and other comorbidities, if present. (Hypertension is
discussed in more detail in Antihypertensive and Antianginal Drugs.) Nearly all pharmacologic treatments for heart
failure are specific to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The Pharmacologic Treatment of Heart Failure
section will pertain to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

Classification and Staging of Heart Failure

Heart failure is diagnosed based on ejection fraction and symptoms. The American Heart Association
(AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC)/Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) Guidelines state that a normal
ejection fraction is between 50% and 70% (Heidenreich et al., 2022). If a person has an ejection fraction of less
than 40%, a diagnosis of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is made. Heart failure with mildly reduced
ejection fraction means that a person has symptoms of heart failure but the ejection fraction is between 41% and
50%. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is diagnosed when there are symptoms of heart failure but the
ejection fraction is still in the normal range (see Table 19.1).

     Diagnostics

     It can be difficult to diagnose heart failure because it is based on symptom recognition. People often have
     symptoms but don't recognize them as a manifestation of heart failure. In order for heart failure to be diagnosed, a
     health care provider must do a thorough history and physical exam. If there are signs and symptoms of heart failure,
     the provider will order an echocardiogram. In an echocardiogram, sound waves are used to assess how well the
     heart is pumping and to determine the heart's ejection fraction. Other tests that may be performed include an
     electrocardiogram to assess cardiac rhythm and blood work. Typical blood work includes a basic metabolic profile,
     which will include information on electrolytes and kidney function. One other blood test that is often included is a
     brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) to determine whether the heart is undergoing increased stretch. When cardiac
     myocytes are stretched too far, they release BNP (Novack & Zevitz, 2022). This test often helps providers determine
     the stage of heart failure.

     Clinical Manifestations

     Heart failure often occurs after another disease process has damaged the cardiovascular system. The most common

     causes of HFrEF are coronary artery disease, acute myocardial infarction, and prolonged hypertension. The most

     common cause of HFpEF is aging. Therefore, heart failure is often a disease of older clients, though it is not

     exclusive to that age group. Symptoms associated with heart failure include shortness of breath, edema, exercise

     intolerance, and fatigue. Often people with heart failure have an increased heart rate due to the body's

     compensatory mechanisms. Remember:                       . If stroke volume is decreased, then the body will

     compensate by increasing heart rate.

     Nonpharmacologic Treatment of Heart Failure

     Nonpharmacologic treatments for heart failure include sodium restriction. A sodium-restricted diet (less than 2000
     mg of sodium per day) may help maintain euvolemia (normal blood volume) and prevent clients from becoming
     overloaded with fluid (which presents as pitting edema in the extremities, abdominal edema, and/or pulmonary
     edema). It is also important for people with heart failure to eat a healthy diet and exercise as well as they are able.
     Additionally, smoking cessation, reduced or no use of alcohol, and self-monitoring of signs and symptoms may be
     helpful.

     Dietary Modification
     Dietary modification for clients with heart failure are similar to those for clients with hypertension (see

     Access for free at openstax.org
19.1 · Heart Failure                                                                                                    545

Antihypertensive and Antianginal Drugs). Clients with heart failure should follow a 2000 mg/day sodium-restricted
diet and are often instructed to record the amount of sodium they consume daily. Clients should be instructed on
how to read Nutrition Facts labels on food in order to determine the amount of sodium per serving or per container.
Clients should be made aware that most processed foods are very high in sodium. Fast food, processed frozen
meals, and canned foods all have very high sodium content. The client can be referred to the American Heart
Association's recipe collection (https://openstax.org/r/recipesheart) for low-sodium, heart-healthy meals.

Clients who take certain medications for heart failure (discussed later in this chapter) should be instructed to avoid
foods high in potassium, such as bananas and watermelon, as well as salt substitutes because most substitute
potassium for sodium.

Physical Activity and Exercise
Clients with heart failure often experience shortness of breath and fatigue with exercise; however, they should be
encouraged to exercise as much as they are able. Many clients with heart failure are not able to fully follow the
exercise recommendations of the American Heart Association (see Antihypertensive and Antianginal Drugs), but
they can be encouraged to follow an individualized exercise plan. As an alternative, the health care provider may
enroll them in cardiac rehabilitation to build their exercise tolerance.

Smoking Cessation and Reducing Alcohol Consumption
Clients should be encouraged to stop using any tobacco products and/or alcohol. Both can cause heart failure
exacerbations. For more information on smoking cessation and decreasing alcohol consumption, see
Antihypertensive and Antianginal Drugs.

Self-Monitoring of Heart Failure Symptoms
Clients with heart failure should monitor their symptoms daily. This includes weighing themselves every day,
monitoring how well they are breathing, assessing for lower extremity swelling, and determining their level of
fatigue. Clients should notify their health care provider if they gain 2-3 pounds in one day or 5 pounds in one week
or if they notice increased swelling in their extremities, difficulty breathing, and/or chest pain. The American Heart
Association website (https://openstax.org/r/heartorgen) (n.d.) has many interactive resources available to help
clients monitor their symptoms, including a phone app.

Pharmacologic Treatment of Heart Failure

The primary goal of treatment for clients with heart failure is to reduce morbidity and mortality. Another goal is to
decrease the cardiac workload and the heart's demand for oxygen. There are five guideline-directed classifications
of medications for HFrEF (Heidenreich et al., 2022):

  1. Medications affecting the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system:
          Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors)
          Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)
          Angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs)

  2. Mineralocorticoid receptor agonists (MRAs)
  3. Beta-adrenergic blockers (beta blockers)
  4. Sodium-glucose cotransport inhibitors (SGLT2Is)
  5. Diuretics

ACE inhibitors, ARBs, ARNIs, and MRAs all affect some component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
(RAAS) and are grouped together in Section 19.2. Beta blockers are discussed in Antihypertensive and Antianginal
Drugs, but this chapter will highlight the use of them in the management of heart failure. SGLT2Is were primarily
used to treat type 2 diabetes but recently were found to be useful in heart failure. Clients with heart failure often
have volume overload, so it is also important to control symptoms that are caused by volume overload. Diuretics are
part of first-line treatment and are used to modify symptoms of fluid volume overload.

Other drugs are also used in the treatment of heart failure. Adjunct medication therapy will be discussed in Section
19.6.

       CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

       The client taking a heart failure medication should:

           · Take heart failure medications as prescribed by their health care provider.
           · Monitor their symptoms of heart failure daily or as directed by their health care provider and keep a record

               of the symptoms.
           · Call their provider if they experience increased ankle swelling, difficulty breathing, and/or chest pain.
           · Monitor their weight daily or as directed by the health care provider and keep a record.
           · Notify their health care provider if their weight fluctuates 2 pounds in one day or 5 pounds in one week.
           · Avoid alcohol, caffeine, and tobacco because these may interfere with the action of cardiovascular drugs.

       The client taking heart a failure medication should not:

           · Take a double dose of the heart failure drug. If the client misses a dose of their drug, they should take it as
               soon as they remember--unless it's almost time for the next dose. In that case, they should wait and take
               the next dose at the normal time.

           · Abruptly discontinue a heart failure drug without consulting with the health care provider because with
               some drugs this may cause rebound elevated blood pressure and an elevated pulse rate.

           · Take over-the-counter (OTC) drugs and/or herbal supplements without consulting with their health care
               provider or pharmacist.

       Other concerns:

           · Heart failure drugs may cause orthostatic hypotension (a form of low blood pressure that occurs when
               going from a sitting or lying position to a standing position). The client should change positions slowly to
               prevent dizziness and fainting.

           · If low blood pressure develops (feeling dizzy or lightheaded, having blurred vision, feeling weak, or
               fainting), the client should lie on their back with legs elevated and notify their health care provider.

           · If the client is unsure about how to take their heart failure drug, they should call their health care provider
               or pharmacist.

           · If the client is vomiting or otherwise unable to take their medications for more than one day, they should
               notify their health care provider.

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 19.2.1 Identify the characteristics of drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that are
             used to treat heart failure.

         · 19.2.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of drugs affecting the renin-
             angiotensin-aldosterone system that are used to treat heart failure.

         · 19.2.3 Describe nursing implications of drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that
             are used to treat heart failure.

         · 19.2.4 Explain the client education related to drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
             that are used to treat heart failure.

     Angiotensin-Converting (ACE) Enzyme Inhibitors

     As mentioned in Antihypertensive and Antianginal Drugs, Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are a
     classification of drugs that block the body's production of angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is one of the products of the
     renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) (see Figure 19.4), and it stimulates multiple end-organ effects. Two
     of these effects that are important in heart failure are constriction of arterioles and sodium and water retention of
     the kidneys. Vasoconstriction causes increased afterload, and sodium and water retention cause increased preload.
     In heart failure, the heart is already struggling to maintain an adequate cardiac output. Both increased afterload and
     increased preload will make this task more difficult. ACE inhibitors have been shown to decrease morbidity and

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

ACE Inhibitors

Black clients with hypertension demonstrate a lower response to ACE inhibitor monotherapy. ACE inhibitors
interfere with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which causes high blood pressure when renin levels
are high. Black clients often have hypertension but also have lower levels of renin. Therefore, concomitant
therapy may be required to increase response to antihypertensive therapies.

(Source: Astra Zeneca, 2012)

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
ACE inhibitors are relatively safe to use and have a low incidence of serious adverse effects. Adverse effects include
angioedema, non-productive cough, neutropenia (low neutrophils in the blood), agranulocytosis (low granulocytes
in the blood), proteinuria (protein in the urine), and rash. Hypotension may develop. Clients may develop an ACE
inhibitor-associated cough (a persistent, dry, itchy cough). Hyperkalemia (elevated potassium level in the blood)
548  19 · Heart Failure Drugs

     may develop.

     ACE inhibitors cause fetal toxicity and should be immediately discontinued if pregnancy occurs. Clients with renal
     impairment should use cautiously. Clients with a previous hypersensitivity reaction to an ACE inhibitor should not be
     prescribed this classification of drug.

     Nursing Implications
     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking ACE inhibitors:

     · Assess the client's blood pressure and pulse on an ongoing basis with initial dosing and intermittently during
        drug therapy.

     · Assess and monitor the client for adverse effects, drug and food interactions, and contraindications.
     · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

        teaching guidelines.

     SAFETY ALERT

     ACE Inhibitors

     Taking ACE inhibitors with potassium-containing salt substitutes or consuming large amounts of high-potassium
     foods increases the risk of hyperkalemia. Having a blood potassium level above 6.0 mmol/L is considered a
     medical emergency and can result in cardiac arrest.

Clients of childbearing age should take measures not to become pregnant while taking ivabradine due to
teratogenic effects (causing harm to embryo or fetus).

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking an ACE inhibitor should:

    · Avoid foods high in potassium and salt substitutes (because these are high in potassium) due to the
        aldosterone release.

    · Report side effects such as cough, angioedema, or anaphylactic reactions to their health care provider.
    · Notify their health care provider if they experience abdominal pain, joint or muscle aches, muscle

        weakness, change in the amount of urine produced, or trouble breathing.
    · Be aware that a persistent cough may develop when taking ACE inhibitors.
    · Notify their health care provider if pregnant, planning on getting pregnant, or breastfeeding prior to

        starting an ACE inhibitor.
    · Report symptoms such as chest pain, slurred speech, hemiparesis, and difficulty speaking or walking to

        their health care provider immediately because these may be symptoms of a heart attack or stroke.
    · Notify their health care provider about symptoms such as dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting because

        these could be related to low blood pressure.

Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers

Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are a classification of drugs that bind to and inhibit angiotensin II type I
receptors. ARBs work directly at the receptor site to block angiotensin II from binding with receptors on the cells
(see Figure 19.4). The effect of ARBs is similar to that of ACE inhibitors; however, the side effects are lessened. This
means that the potential for angioedema is decreased. Also, there is no side effect of cough.

Angiotensin II receptor blockers decrease blood pressure and therefore decrease afterload. This is beneficial in
treating heart failure since decreased afterload means the heart does not have to work as hard to generate stroke
volume.

Table 19.5 lists common ARBs used in the management of heart failure and typical routes and dosing for adult
clients. A comprehensive list of ARBs can be found in Antihypertensive and Antianginal Drugs.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Adverse effects of ARBs include dizziness, muscle cramps, weakness, heartburn, diarrhea, leg swelling, headaches,
and weight loss. Serious adverse effects include angioedema, hypotension, hepatic impairment, and hyperkalemia.

ARBs cause fetal toxicity and should not be taken during pregnancy. Clients with hepatic impairment should use
ARBs cautiously. Clients with a previous hypersensitivity reaction or angioedema to an ARB inhibitor should not be
prescribed this classification of drug. Clients with a history of mood disturbances or who are at risk for mood
disturbances should be monitored closely for suicidal ideation.

     SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

     ARBs

     The RAAS has been associated with increased risk of mood disorders. The use of ARBs may be associated with
     an increased risk of suicide compared with other antihypertensive therapies.

     Black clients with hypertension demonstrate a lower response to ARB monotherapy. Concomitant therapy may
     be required to increase response to antihypertensive therapies.

     Older adults and clients with hepatic impairment should start on a low initial dose because the drug is
     metabolized by the liver.

     (Source: Colvin et al., 2020)

     Nursing Implications
     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking ARBs:

         · Monitor the client's blood pressure as prescribed.
         · Monitor the client for interactions because many medications and herbal supplements interact with ARBs.
         · Monitor the client for adverse effects, including electrolyte imbalances and alterations in liver and renal

             function.
         · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

             teaching guidelines.

  CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

  The client taking an ARB should:

      · Avoid foods high in potassium and salt substitutes (because these substitute potassium for sodium) due to
          the aldosterone release.

      · Report side effects such as cough, angioedema, or anaphylactic reactions to the health care provider.
      · Notify their health care provider if they experience abdominal pain, joint or muscle aches, muscle

          weakness, change in the amount of urine produced, or trouble breathing.
      · Notify their health care provider if pregnant, planning on getting pregnant, or breastfeeding prior to

          starting an ARB.
      · Notify their health care provider about symptoms such as dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting because

          these could be related to low blood pressure.

Angiotensin Receptor/Neprilysin Inhibitors

Recently, a new classification of heart failure medication was developed, angiotensin receptor/neprilysin
inhibitors (ARNIs). This combination medication is a first-line medication for many classifications of heart failure. It
is a combination of an ARB and a new type of medication, a neprilysin inhibitor. There currently is only one
medication in the ARNI class: sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto).

In heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, there is a lot of stress on the left ventricle as well as left ventricular
dilation. This is due to an increased preload. When the ventricle dilates to a point that is no longer helpful to the
heart, the myocytes release brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). BNP stimulates a compensatory mechanism that leads
to vasodilation and decreased sodium and water absorption. Vasodilation and diuresis decrease afterload and
preload, which makes the workload of the heart decrease.

Neprilysin is an enzyme that breaks down BNP. The inhibition of neprilysin means that BNP can stay in the body's
circulatory system longer. If BNP stays in the system longer, then vasodilation and decreased sodium and water
reabsorption will last longer, which will decrease afterload and preload. This will decrease the workload of the heart.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Adverse effects of ARNIs include angioedema, hypotension, renal impairment, and hyperkalemia.

ARNIs contain ARBs and cause fetal toxicity; they should not be taken during pregnancy. Clients with hepatic
impairment should use ARNIs cautiously. Clients with a previous hypersensitivity or angioedema reaction to an ARB
inhibitor should not be prescribed this classification of drug. Clients with a history of mood disturbances or who are
at risk for mood disturbances should be monitored closely for suicidal ideation.

     CLINICAL TIP

 Reviewing Medications

  It is important for the nurse to review all of a client's medications. Clients should not take ACE inhibitors, ARBs,
  or ARNIs at the same time. Clients should be prescribed only one of these classifications of medication at a time.

     Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists

     Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) (also known as aldosterone antagonists) are often categorized as
     diuretics because they ultimately do cause diuresis. When the RAAS is activated, one of the end results is the
     stimulation of the adrenal glands to secrete aldosterone. (See Figure 19.4 earlier in the chapter.) Aldosterone binds

to receptors on cells in the distal tubule of the nephron, which then causes them to reabsorb sodium and water.
During this process, potassium secretion increases. Aldosterone antagonists block the receptor so that aldosterone
can't bind there. The end result is increased sodium and water excretion into the urine, and potassium reabsorption.
Aldosterone antagonists are referred to as potassium-sparing diuretics.

MRA medications have been found to reduce the risk of all-cause mortality in clients with heart failure (Heidenreich
et al., 2022).

     19.3 Beta-Adrenergic Blockers

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 19.3.1 Identify the characteristics of beta-adrenergic blocker drugs used to treat heart failure.
         · 19.3.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of beta-adrenergic blocker

             drugs used to treat heart failure.
         · 19.3.3 Describe nursing implications of beta-adrenergic blocker drugs used to treat heart failure.
         · 19.3.4 Explain the client education related to beta-adrenergic blocker drugs used to treat heart failure.

     As presented in Antihypertensive and Antianginal Drugs, beta-adrenergic blockers (beta blockers) are a
     classification of drugs that inhibit chronotropic, inotropic, and vasoconstrictor response to catecholamine,
     epinephrine, and norepinephrine. They do this by exerting effects on adrenergic receptors beta 1, beta 2, and alpha.

     When the body is presented with a stressor, the sympathetic nervous system is activated. Catecholamines
     (norepinephrine and epinephrine) are released with the primary purpose of enhancing the fight-or-flight response.
     Catecholamines interact with beta-1, beta-2, and alpha receptors. Beta-1 receptors are found in the heart and
     kidneys, beta-2 receptors are found in cardiac tissue, and alpha receptors are found on arteries and veins.

     Beta blockers can inhibit catecholamines from binding to beta-1, beta-2, and/or alpha receptors. This means that

     Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                 19.3 · Beta-Adrenergic Blockers  555

the sympathetic response (or the fight-or-flight response) is decreased. Part of the sympathetic response is to
increase heart rate and contractility, increase blood pressure, and dilate bronchioles so that the body can run away
or fight the threat. In general, beta blockers decrease heart rate and contractility, decrease blood pressure, and may
cause some bronchoconstriction.

Select beta blockers have been found to decrease mortality in clients with heart failure (Heidenreich et al., 2022).
Metoprolol and bisoprolol are two cardio-selective beta blockers, and carvedilol is a nonselective beta blocker that
is used in the management of clients with heart failure.

Cardio-selective beta blockers affect the heart by reducing heart rate and contractility. Nonselective beta blockers
affect the heart in the same way, but they also cause vasodilation due to their effects on alpha receptors of the
arteries.

In heart failure, either cardio-selective beta blockers (bisoprolol, metoprolol succinate) or nonselective beta
blockers (carvedilol) are used to decrease heart rate and contractility. Nonselective beta blockers also decrease
blood pressure, which decreases afterload. If the heart rate is decreased, there is more time for diastole, or
ventricular filling. Recall that coronary arteries deliver blood to the cardiac myocytes of the ventricles during
diastole. This means that the ventricles themselves are getting more oxygen-rich blood. Also, if contractility is
decreased, there is less demand for oxygen. Nonselective beta blockers also decrease afterload, which means the
heart does not have to produce as much force to generate stroke volume.

Beta blockers are used to treat clients with hypertension, heart failure, arrhythmias, myocardial infarctions,
migraines, glaucoma, and certain types of tremors. Beta blockers have also been used by health care providers as
anxiolytics (to reduce anxiety).

Table 19.10 lists the beta blockers that are commonly used for heart failure and typical routes and dosing for adult
clients. A complete list of beta blockers can be found in Antihypertensive and Antianginal Drugs.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications

Adverse effects of beta blockers include dizziness, fatigue, weight gain, constipation, cold hands and feet,
hypercholesterolemia, shortness of breath, depression, nausea, dry mouth, and dry eyes. Serious adverse effects
include bradycardia, arrhythmias, hypoglycemia, and hypotension. Rare side effects include sexual and erectile
dysfunction.

Blood pressure and pulse rate should be monitored prior to administration. Beta blockers should not be
administered if the client is hypotensive or has a heart rate less than 50-60 beats per minute, or as directed by the
health care provider.

Nonselective beta blockers are contraindicated in clients with moderate to severe asthma and/or chronic lung
diseases due to the potential for causing an exacerbation. Beta blockers should be used cautiously in clients with AV
node and sinus bradycardia because they can aggravate these conditions. Beta blockers may exacerbate symptoms
of Raynaud's phenomenon or cause this disease process in clients. Clients with diabetes should use beta blockers
cautiously because they can mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia, causing confusion, fainting, or seizures.
556  19 · Heart Failure Drugs

     SAFETY ALERT

     Beta Blockers

     Nonselective beta blockers should not be used in clients with asthma who are taking a short-acting beta agonist
     because they may cause worsening bronchospasm.

     Beta blockers block aspects of the sympathetic nervous system, which is activated when blood sugar is too low.
     Beta blockers may mask symptoms of hypoglycemia.

     CLINICAL TIP

 Assessing Comorbidities

  As a nurse, it is important to assess a client's comorbidities prior to administering drugs. When administering
  beta blockers, the nurse should assess whether the client has asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
  and is taking a short-acting beta agonist because this may cause a pharmacodynamics drug interaction.

Nursing Implications

The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking beta-adrenergic blockers:

    · Assess the client's blood pressure and pulse on an ongoing basis with initial dosing and intermittently during
        drug therapy. The beta-adrenergic blocker should be withheld if the client's heart rate is less than 50-60
        beats/minute or as directed by the health care provider.

    · Assess and monitor the client for adverse effects, drug and food interactions, and contraindications.
    · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

        teaching guidelines.

  CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

  The client taking a beta-adrenergic blocker should:

      · Take their pulse as directed prior to taking a beta-adrenergic blocker and do not administer the drug if the
          pulse is less than 50-60 beats/minute or as directed by their health care provider.

      · Take this medication without regard to meals.
      · Report side effects such as bradycardia, hypotension, fatigue, dizziness, constipation, or sexual

          dysfunction to their health care provider.
      · Monitor for symptoms of worsening heart failure such as fatigue, weight gain, and peripheral edema.
      · Monitor blood glucose levels closely because beta blockers can mask symptoms of hypoglycemia.
      · Notify their health care provider about symptoms such as dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting because

          these could be related to low blood pressure and/or low heart rate.

  The client taking a beta-adrenergic blocker should not:

      · Take beta-adrenergic blockers with OTC drugs or herbal supplements, such as ma-huang, ephedra, black
          cohosh, hawthorne, or licorice, without consulting their health care provider because these supplements
          may interfere with the action of the beta-adrenergic blocker.

FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

Beta-Adrenergic Blockers

Beta blocker therapy should not be abruptly stopped, but gradually tapered to avoid exacerbation of angina and
myocardial infarction. Clients should seek health care provider advice prior to discontinuing use.

     19.4 Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors (SGLT2Is)

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 19.4.1 Identify the characteristics of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor drugs used to treat heart
             failure.

         · 19.4.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of the sodium-glucose
             cotransporter 2 inhibitor drugs used to treat heart failure.

         · 19.4.3 Describe nursing implications of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor drugs used to treat
             heart failure.

         · 19.4.4 Explain the client education related to sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor drugs used to
             treat heart failure.

     Initially, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2I) medications were introduced as pharmacologic
     therapy for clients with type 2 diabetes. After years of use in clients with type 2 diabetes and comorbid heart failure,
     the benefits of SGLT2Is were noted and researched for all clients with heart failure (regardless of whether they also
     had type 2 diabetes). Subsequently, SGLT2Is were found to reduce mortality in clients with heart failure, and a new
     class of medications for heart failure was introduced (Heidenreich et al., 2022).

     The nephrons in the kidneys actively reabsorb glucose. Nearly all glucose is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule by
     "piggybacking" it with sodium reabsorption. Sodium is actively reabsorbed (requires energy expenditure), and
     during the process, glucose is also reabsorbed via a cotransporter system. If the cotransporter is inhibited, then less
     sodium and glucose are reabsorbed. That means that more sodium and glucose will pass through the nephron into
     the collecting duct and ultimately into the urine. Since sodium and glucose are solutes, or osmotically active, more
     water will also end up in the urine, which will result in diuresis.

     The diuretic effect of SGLT2Is helps to reduce preload. If preload is reduced, then the heart does not have to work
     as hard. There also appear to be direct benefits that help the left ventricle pump more effectively, which is most
     likely the reason these drugs have become first-line therapy for clients with heart failure (Shah & Fang, 2022).

     Table 19.12 lists the two SGLT2Is that are FDA-approved for heart failure and typical routes and dosing for adult
     clients.

SAFETY ALERT

SGLT2Is

Clients must be assessed for volume status prior to initiating an SGLT2I. When administering SGLT2Is, it is
important to assess whether the client has signs of dehydration such as sunken eyes, skin tenting, or rapid heart
rate. The nurse should notify the provider if these signs are noted prior to administering an SGLT2I. Low fluid
volume can lead to significant hypotension with this drug.

Clients' renal status also must be assessed prior to initiating SGLT2Is.

Nursing Implications

The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking SGLT2Is:

    · Assess the client's blood pressure and pulse on an ongoing basis with initial dosing and intermittently during
        drug therapy.

    · Monitor the client for interactions because many medications and herbal supplements interact with SGLT2Is.
    · Assess and monitor the client for adverse effects, drug and food interactions, and contraindications.
    · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

        teaching guidelines.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking an SGLT2I should:

    · Inform their health care provider if they have diabetes and take insulin. Both insulin and SGLT2Is lower
        blood glucose. The client may be prescribed a lower dose of either of the two drugs.

    · Inform their health care provider if they have been told they have renal insufficiency.
    · Monitor for signs and symptoms of dehydration such as dry mouth or lightheadedness. SGLT2Is can cause
560  19 · Heart Failure Drugs

        significant hypotension in the presence of hypovolemia.
     · Inform their health care provider if they are pregnant or intend to become pregnant.

     19.5 Diuretics

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 19.5.1 Identify the characteristics of the diuretic drugs used to treat heart failure.
         · 19.5.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of the diuretic drugs used to

             treat heart failure.
         · 19.5.3 Describe nursing implications of diuretic drugs used to treat heart failure.
         · 19.5.4 Explain the client education plan related to diuretic drugs used to treat heart failure.

     Diuretics were introduced in Antihypertensive and Antianginal Drugs. This chapter discusses diuretics that are used
     in heart failure, specifically loop diuretics and thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics. Typically, potassium-sparing
     diuretics, except for mineralocorticoid receptor agonists, are used sparingly in the treatment of heart failure
     because the combination of ACE inhibitor or ARB with a potassium-sparing diuretic can lead to increased potassium
     levels.

     Loop Diuretics

     Loop diuretics block the reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the loop of Henle, which is located in the renal
     tubule. Due to the way the sodium pump works, loop diuretics also block the reabsorption of potassium. Loop
     diuretics in general are more potent than thiazide diuretics since the majority of sodium and chloride reabsorption
     occurs in the loop of Henle. Loop diuretics are often the first choice of diuretics in treating heart failure.

          CLINICAL TIP

      Potassium Supplements

       Clients should be informed they may have to take prescribed potassium supplements when taking loop diuretics.

     SAFETY ALERT

     Diuretics

     Loop diuretics are potent diuretics that can lead to profound dehydration and electrolyte loss.

     Thiazide and Thiazide-Like Diuretics

     As discussed in Antihypertensive and Antianginal Drugs, thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics block the reabsorption
     of sodium and chloride in the distal renal tubule. Due to the nature of sodium reabsorption, thiazide and thiazide-
     like diuretics cause potassium loss as well as sodium loss.

     Table 19.14 lists common loop diuretics and thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics used in heart failure and typical routes
     and dosing for adult clients.

CASE STUDY

Read the following clinical scenario to answer the questions that follow.

Anna Rodriguez is an 85-year-old client who presents to her health care provider with an exacerbation of heart
failure. Anna reports increasing shortness of breath with self-care activities. She also shares that she is no longer
going to the senior center because getting in and out of the car leaves her short of breath and fatigued. She also
reports that her feet feel "heavy" and that she has gained 3 pounds in the last 1-2 weeks. Anna sleeps on two
pillows and does not awaken during the night with shortness of breath. She has also had a persistent itchy, dry
cough and asks if she has a respiratory infection. The cough is nonproductive, and Anna reports no fever, chills, achy
feeling, congestion, or chest pain.

Anna reports following a low-sodium diet and does not engage in exercise. She is a nonsmoker and does not drink
alcohol.

         · 19.6.1 Identify the characteristics of adjunct medications used to treat heart failure.
         · 19.6.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of adjunct medications used

             to treat heart failure.

     Hydralazine and Isosorbide Dinitrate

     Hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate (BiDil) are administered as a combination drug in clients with heart failure who
     have optimized therapy with other medications but still have a low ejection fraction and/or symptoms. This drug
     combination has been shown to reduce mortality in Black clients with heart failure (Heidenreich et al., 2022).
     Research has not shown a decreased mortality in clients with heart failure who are not Black, but there may be
     some benefit to adding hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate or to using this therapy if clients are not able to tolerate
     first-line therapy.

     The combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate causes vasodilation, which decreases afterload, or the
     amount of force that the heart must pump against. Hydralazine directly vasodilates arterioles. Although the
     mechanism of action is not well understood, it is thought to decrease calcium release in the smooth muscles around
     arterioles. Because calcium is an essential component of muscle contraction, if less calcium is available, then the
     smooth muscle will contract less and the arteriole will not be constricted.

     Isosorbide dinitrate is a part of the nitrate drug classification that was discussed in Antihypertensive and Antianginal
     Drugs. Nitrates cause the release of nitric oxide within the endothelium of blood vessels. Nitric oxide causes a series
     of events that ultimately lead to vasodilation.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Adverse effects include orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, paradoxical bradycardia, flushing, peripheral edema,
     nausea/vomiting, headache (nitrates), blurred vision, drug-induced lupus erythematosus, hemolytic anemia, and
     glomerulonephritis.

     Contraindications include allergy to nitrates and use with phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors.

     action, adult dosage, indications, therapeutic effects, drug and food interactions, adverse effects, and

SAFETY ALERT

Hydralazine

Nitrates can cause hypotension; nitrates in combination with hydralazine can cause significant hypotension. This
medication should not be taken with PDE5 inhibitors because this can lead to profound hypotension.

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate:

    · Assess the client's drug and herbal supplements because significant hypotension may occur when used in
        conjunction with nitrates.

    · Monitor the client's blood pressure when initiating hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate, and do not administer the
        medication if systolic blood pressure is less than 90 mm Hg.

    · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client
        teaching guidelines.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate should:

    · Monitor for signs and symptoms of low blood pressure such as dizziness or lightheadedness.
    · Get up slowly during the first couple of days of taking the medication in case of orthostatic hypotension.
566  19 · Heart Failure Drugs

       The client taking hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate should not:

           · Take erectile dysfunction medications with this medication because they also contain a nitrate.

     Cardiac Glycosides

     Cardiac glycosides used to be a first-line therapy in heart failure. Over the years, medications that are safer and
     more efficacious have been introduced on the market. However, cardiac glycosides may be used as adjunct therapy
     if first-line medications for heart failure have been optimized and the client still has a reduced ejection fraction and/
     or symptoms.

     Digoxin is the only cardiac glycoside used in heart failure. It affects the sodium-potassium ATPase pump in such a
     way that causes more calcium to enter the cardiac myocyte. If there is more calcium, then the force of contraction is
     stronger. Because of this, digoxin is referred to as a positive inotrope. Digoxin also stimulates the parasympathetic
     nervous system, which affects the electrical conduction system of the heart. Parasympathetic stimulation causes
     the heart to beat less often. This means that there is a longer time for ventricular filling (longer diastole). This helps
     the heart since the cardiac myocytes receive oxygenated blood during diastole.

     Digoxin can have complicated dosage instructions. There often is a loading dose and then a maintenance dose, and
     factors such as body weight, age, renal function, and concomitant drugs are part of the dosing consideration.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Adverse effects include fatal cardiac arrhythmias, sinus bradycardia, sinoatrial block, visual disturbances (yellow or
     green halo around lights), atrial tachycardia, and rash.

     Digoxin has a narrow therapeutic index and a high potential for toxicity. Signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity
     include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, visual changes, and cardiac arrhythmias.

     Contraindications include acute myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome,
     myocarditis, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia.

     Table 19.18 is a drug prototype table for cardiac glycosides featuring maintenance dosing for digoxin. It lists drug
     class, mechanism of action, adult dosage, indications, therapeutic effects, drug and food interactions, adverse
     effects, and contraindications.

SAFETY ALERT

Cardiac Glycosides

Cardiac glycosides can cause fetal death in the second trimester. Clients of childbearing age should not become
pregnant while taking cardiac glycosides.

Digoxin has a high potential for toxicity with life-threatening consequences.

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking digoxin:

    · Assess pulse for 1 minute prior to administering digoxin. If heart rate is less than 60 beats per minute, do not
        administer the dose.

    · Monitor serum digoxin levels and for signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity. Also monitor serum potassium
        levels.

    · Assess and monitor for adverse effects, drug and food interactions, and contraindications.
    · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

        teaching guidelines.
568  19 · Heart Failure Drugs

       CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

       The client taking digoxin should:

           · Monitor their pulse prior to taking digoxin and contact their health care provider if their pulse is <60 beats
               per minute.

           · Monitor for signs of digoxin toxicity (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, green/yellow halos around lights). They
               should contact their health care provider immediately if they experience these symptoms.

           · Notify their health care provider about symptoms such as dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting because
               these could be related to low blood pressure.

     Ivabradine

     Ivabradine (Corlanor) was introduced fairly recently as an adjunct therapy for clients who are optimized on first-line
     heart failure medications but still have a reduced ejection fraction and/or symptoms.

     Ivabradine is an If current inhibitor that affects the cardiac pacemaker current (If) directly, causing a decreased
     heart rate and longer diastole. A decreased heart rate lowers the heart's demand for oxygen, and longer diastole
     allows for increased oxygenation of cardiac myocytes.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Adverse effects include bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, elevated blood pressure, heart block, prolonged QT segment,
     torsade de pointes, and luminous phenomena (enhanced brightness of light or halo around light). Fetal toxicity has
     occurred in animal studies.

     Contraindications include acute decompensated heart failure, hypotension, history of conduction problems (such as
     sick sinus syndrome), bradycardia, and liver dysfunction. Ivabradine has been shown to cause fetal toxicity in animal
     studies; therefore, clients should not be pregnant or become pregnant while taking ivabradine.

     Table 19.19 is a drug prototype table featuring ivabradine. It lists drug class, mechanism of action, adult dosage,
     indications, therapeutic effects, drug and food interactions, adverse effects, and contraindications.

Drugs

CHAPTER OUTLINE
20.1 Introduction to Clotting and Coagulation

20.3 Antiplatelets
20.4 Thrombolytics

INTRODUCTION Blood moves through the cardiovascular system to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the various
tissues, including those that make up the body's organs. It is pumped by the heart into arteries, which carry
oxygenated and nutrient-rich blood to each tissue. Arteries branch into smaller arteries called arterioles, then into
capillaries. Capillaries are thinned-walled blood vessels that facilitate gas exchange, or the exchange of oxygen for
carbon dioxide in the tissues. Blood is collected into small veins called venules, which drain into larger veins that
eventually bring blood back to the heart for oxygenation. See Heart Failure Drugs for more information on the
circulatory system.
Blood is made up of many components, such as erythrocytes (red blood cells), leukocytes (white blood cells, which
are important in the immune system), and platelets. Erythrocytes contain hemoglobin, which is the substance that
binds with oxygen and facilitates its transport in the blood. Platelets are the sticky substances in the blood that form
a scab when a client has a cut or injury. More information on platelets will be discussed later in this chapter. Blood
also contains plasma, which is the fluid surrounding the cellular components of blood and is made up of water,
electrolytes, and proteins.
The amount of the various components of blood can be monitored by a laboratory blood test called a complete
blood count (CBC). The CBC measures the amount of red blood cells, white blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit,
574  20 · Anticoagulant, Antiplatelet, and Thrombolytic Drugs

     and platelets. Hematocrit is another way to assess the amount of red blood cells by measuring the ratio of red blood
     cells to the overall volume of blood. Low hemoglobin and/or hematocrit can signal blood loss or anemia, among
     other etiologies.

     20.1 Introduction to Clotting and Coagulation

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 20.1.1 Explain the pathophysiology of thrombus formation.
         · 20.1.2 Identify the clinical manifestations of thrombus formation.
         · 20.1.3 Identify the etiology and diagnostic studies related to thrombus formation.

     The ability of the blood to form clots in response to tissue damage is essential for hemostasis, or the body's ability
     to stop bleeding. However, clot formation also underpins many thrombosis-related diseases such as acute
     myocardial infarction, stroke, and deep vein thrombosis. A client with naturally occurring decreased clotting times is
     described as hypercoagulable.

     Blood Coagulation

     Human blood moves as a fluid; however, when injury occurs, hemostasis is accomplished in two major ways:
     primary hemostasis and secondary hemostasis. Primary hemostasis is the process of platelet adhesion to form a
     platelet plug, or platelets that are aggregated on the injured vessel wall or tissues. Platelets can be activated in
     response to collagen released during tissue damage or by a number of other substances. A few of the substances
     most important for pharmacology are highlighted below and are shown in Figure 20.2:

         · Thromboxane A2, synthesized by the cyclooxygenase pathway
         · Adenosine diphosphate, which interacts with P2Y12 receptors on the platelet surface
         · Thrombin, produced in the coagulation cascade described below
         · Von Willebrand factor and fibrinogen, which bind to the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIbIIIa) receptor to facilitate

             platelet adhesion to other platelets and to the blood vessel wall

     Each of these activation steps represents a potential drug target in treatment of pathologic thromboses; they will be
     expanded upon within the text for the relevant drugs.

fibrinogen, among other substances. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

Upon tissue injury, secondary hemostasis can be activated via the coagulation cascade. The coagulation cascade
can be thought of as a chain reaction. The coagulation cascade is made up of clotting factors, which are proteins
that work to activate different parts of the coagulation cascade. The factors are named numerically with Roman
numerals (e.g., factor X, factor VII). An activated form of a factor is denoted by "a" suffix (e.g., factor Xa, factor VIIa).
Figure 20.3 depicts the clotting cascade; it may be helpful to follow the figure simultaneously while reading through
the text.
576  20 · Anticoagulant, Antiplatelet, and Thrombolytic Drugs

     FIGURE 20.3 The coagulation cascade can be activated by either the intrinsic or extrinsic pathways. Clotting factors form a chain reaction
     and converge on a common pathway that ends in formation of a stable fibrin clot. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under
     CC BY 4.0 license)

     The coagulation cascade can be activated by either the intrinsic pathway or extrinsic pathway, which converge on a
     common final pathway. Although they are discussed as separate pathways, the physiology is less linear and more
     complex, with significant crossover and both pathways being activated in response to tissue damage.

         · The extrinsic pathway is activated by injury to blood vessels, which release tissue factor when damaged.
             Tissue factor works with factor VIIa to activate factor X to factor Xa, which is part of the common pathway.

         · The intrinsic pathway is activated by collagen that is exposed when there is endothelial damage. Collagen
             facilitates the activation of factor XII. Factor XIIa then facilitates the activation of factor XI, which in its
             activated form facilitates the activation of factor IX. Factor IXa and factor VIIIa work together to facilitate
             activation of factor X.

         · The common pathway begins with factor X. Recall from above that factor X is activated by both the intrinsic
             and extrinsic pathways. Factor Xa facilitates the activation of factor II, which is also known as thrombin.
             Thrombin facilitates the activation of fibrinogen to fibrin. Thrombin also has other roles within the clotting
             cascade; it activates factor VIII in the intrinsic pathway and factor V in the common pathway. Thus, activation
             of thrombin contributes to increased upstream activation as well, which continues down the cascade and
             activates more thrombin. Fibrin monomers link together to form fibers and branches that make up a solid
             fibrin clot.

     It is noteworthy that many other substances are involved in synthesis and regulation of the clotting cascade. Vitamin
     K, a vitamin present in foods such as green, leafy vegetables, is a cofactor needed for synthesis of clotting factors II,
     VII, IX, and X. Calcium is also necessary for activation of several clotting factors.

     Coagulation is in homeostatic balance with fibrinolysis, or breakdown of fibrin, as shown in Figure 20.4. This is
     accomplished when the enzyme tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) facilitates conversion of plasminogen to
     plasmin, which degrades fibrin. Other natural anticoagulants include proteins C and S, which work together to inhibit
     the activation of many clotting factors including factors VIIIa, Va, X, and prothrombin; antithrombin, which inhibits
     the action of many clotting factors including factor Xa and thrombin; and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI),
     which inhibits the action of factor Xa.

  SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

  Factor V Leiden

  Factor V Leiden is a blood-clotting disorder that increases the client's risk of thrombosis. It results from a
  genetic mutation that causes a change in factor V, making it less susceptible to inactivation. Clients with Factor V
  Leiden cannot change their genetics, but they can work to minimize their other risk factors for thrombosis by
  maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, and avoiding smoking. These clients should also be vigilant
  about moving and taking breaks during travel. If these clients experience a clot, they will likely need
  anticoagulant therapy for the remainder of their life. The National Blood Clot Alliance website
  (https://openstax.org/r/stoptheclot) provides more information.

Thrombus Formation

The pathologic formation of thrombi (plural of thrombus) occurs as the result of endothelial injury,
hypercoagulability, and stasis of blood flow; this is known as Virchow's Triad and is depicted in Figure 20.5.
Endothelial injury activates clotting as described above and occurs due to events such as catheter placement,
surgery, or trauma (Ashorobi, 2022). Hypercoagulability refers to a prothrombotic state due to circumstances such
as an excess of clotting factors or relative insufficiency of natural anticoagulants. Abnormal blood flow can occur
due to prolonged immobility (such as during travel, surgeries, or hospitalization), atherosclerosis within a blood
vessel, or an abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation, where blood pools in the atria because there is no
organized contraction of the chambers.
578  20 · Anticoagulant, Antiplatelet, and Thrombolytic Drugs

     FIGURE 20.5 Virchow's Triad describes the causes of clot formation. (See Kushner, et al., 2022, and McLendon, et al., 2023; attribution:
     Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

     While formation of a clot can be lifesaving during bleeding events, formation of a thrombus can occlude a blood
     vessel, prohibiting the delivery of blood to downstream tissues. The most common types of thrombi are described
     below, although this list is not all-inclusive.

     Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism
     A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot that forms within a vein. It most commonly occurs within the legs but
     can occur elsewhere, such as the pelvis and arms. The clot can break off, travel through the circulatory system, and
     lodge within the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism (PE), which can be life-threatening. Risk factors for DVTs
     include stasis of blood flow caused by confinement to a bed, limited movement, sitting for a long time (such as
     during travel), or paralysis; increased estrogen caused by oral contraception or pregnancy; certain medical
     conditions such as cancer; personal or family history of DVT; increased age; obesity; catheter placement; or genetic
     clotting disorders. Clients with a DVT may experience swelling, pain, redness, and tenderness at the site of the clot
     (usually in the leg). Clients with a PE often describe chest or back pain and have difficulty breathing, tachycardia,
     hemoptysis (coughing up blood), and if severe, hemodynamic instability (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
     [CDC], 2020). Clients who experience a deep vein thrombosis typically need to be treated with anticoagulant
     medications. A pulmonary embolism is commonly diagnosed with a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram
     (CTPA), a specialized type of x-ray that allows visualization of the pulmonary vessels. A ventilation/perfusion scan
     (also known as a VQ scan) is another type of imaging test that can help diagnose a pulmonary embolism by
     assessing air flow (ventilation) and blood flow (perfusion) in the lungs.

     Ischemic Stroke (Cerebral Infarction)
     When a clot obstructs blood flow to the brain, it can cause an ischemic stroke. Two types of ischemic stroke are
     atherosclerotic and embolic. An atherosclerotic ischemic stroke can be caused by a buildup of fatty substances,
     cholesterol, and other substances that can narrow the artery and cause blood clots to form. Risk factors for
     atherosclerotic stroke include male sex, family history of premature cardiovascular disease, hypercholesterolemia,
     cigarette smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and physical inactivity. Clients who experience an
     atherosclerotic ischemic stroke may also need antiplatelet therapy in addition to treatment of any contributing
     disease states.

     An embolic ischemic stroke (also known as a cerebral embolism) occurs from a blood clot that forms elsewhere in
     the body. It can be caused by a dysrhythmia called atrial fibrillation (American Stroke Association, 2021) or by clots
     that form on prosthetic heart valves. In atrial fibrillation, abnormal blood flow within the left side of the heart can
     lead to clot formation, which can travel out the aorta and lodge within the blood vessels of the brain, occluding
     blood flow. In clients with atrial fibrillation, the CHA2D2-VASc score (Parsons et al., 2017) can help estimate stroke
     risk. The scale includes a point system for the following variables: age, sex, heart failure, hypertension, personal

history of thromboembolism, vascular disease, and diabetes. It can be calculated by hand or by using an online
stroke risk calculator (https://openstax.org/r/mdcalc). Clients who have atrial fibrillation or certain prosthetic heart
valves usually are treated with an anticoagulant to decrease the risk of embolic stroke. A computed tomography (CT)
scan of the brain with contrast allows visualization and diagnosis of both types of stroke.

Myocardial Infarction and Coronary Artery Disease
Clients with atherosclerosis in their coronary arteries are said to have coronary artery disease. The disease states of
coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction are expanded upon in the chapters Antihypertensive and
Antianginal Drugs and Cardiac Emergency and Shock Drugs. Clients with acute myocardial infarction and coronary
artery disease usually are treated with antiplatelet medications. This is especially true after a coronary artery stent
is placed. A coronary artery stent is a wire caging that props open a narrowed coronary artery. These require
treatment with two concomitant antiplatelet medications for a period of time after stent placement to prevent clots
from forming on the stent. While there are many ways to detect a myocardial infarction or coronary artery disease,
clots can be directly visualized using coronary angiography during a left-heart catheterization.

    · 20.2.1 Identify the characteristics of the anticoagulant drugs used to treat thrombus formation.
    · 20.2.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of the anticoagulant drugs

        used to treat thrombus formation.

    · 20.2.4 Explain the client education related to anticoagulant drugs used to treat thrombus formation.

Anticoagulants Used as Blood Thinners

Anticoagulants are commonly referred to as blood thinners. They work in different parts of the coagulation cascade
to decrease the propensity of the blood to form a clot. There are many types of anticoagulants that work in various
ways and can be administered by intravenous, subcutaneous, or oral routes, depending on clients' circumstances
and needs. One important note is that anticoagulants do not dissolve existing clots. Instead, they prevent further
clot formation and allow the body to naturally dissolve any existing clots over time. Thrombolytics, or drugs that
dissolve existing clots, will be discussed later in this chapter.

Many anticoagulants have a narrow therapeutic index, meaning that the dose must be individualized, monitored,
and controlled to ensure that clients do not experience therapeutic failure (e.g., a clotting complication from their
disease) or adverse events. Because of this, anticoagulants are classified as high-alert medications (Institute for
Safe Medication Practices, 2018). High-alert medications often have specific nursing precautions during use. Many
hospitals require manual independent double-checks and utilize automated alerts to ensure safe use. Additionally,
extra monitoring is often required to ensure the drug levels are appropriate and the blood is not "too thin" (over-
anticoagulated) or "too thick" (under-anticoagulated). The specific anticoagulant used and the clinical scenario
determine which drug-specific monitoring may be required. Some of the monitoring parameters are:

    · Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT): A PTT is a laboratory
        test obtained via venous blood sample that measures how much time the blood takes to clot. A PTT of a non-
        anticoagulated client without a clotting disease is 25-35 seconds (Rountree & Lopez, 2018). A higher PTT
        indicates that the blood is thinner, less likely to form a clot, and the client is more prone to bleeding. An aPTT
        is considered a more sensitive version of a PTT.

    · International normalized ratio (INR): This is a laboratory test obtained via venous blood sample that
        provides another measurement of the time it takes for the blood to clot, calculated using the prothrombin
        time (PT). The INR of an un-anticoagulated client without a clotting disease is 1. It should be noted that point-
        of-care machines are available for INR monitoring so that clients can obtain results in real time, either in a
        clinic or at home. A higher INR indicates that the blood is thinner and less likely to form a clot, and the client is
        more prone to bleeding.

    · Anti-factor Xa level (Anti-Xa): The anti-Xa level provides a measurement of the concentration of drugs that
        inhibit factor Xa in the clotting cascade. A higher anti-Xa level indicates that there is more drug in the blood,
580  20 · Anticoagulant, Antiplatelet, and Thrombolytic Drugs

             the blood is thinner and less likely to form a clot, and the client is more prone to bleeding.
         · Activated clotting time (ACT): The ACT is another way to measure clotting time. This test is frequently done

             as a point-of-care test and can be done during procedures or surgeries where immediate knowledge of
             anticoagulant effect is necessary. This is often used in the cardiac catheterization laboratory and during
             cardiopulmonary bypass in open-heart surgery. A higher ACT indicates that the blood is thinner and less likely
             to form a clot, and the client is more prone to bleeding.

     There are many different anticoagulants, available as injectable or oral medications.

     Injectable Anticoagulants
     Injectable anticoagulant medications have the advantage of avoiding the oral route of administration, which may be
     important for clients who are unable to take oral medications or have issues with gastrointestinal absorption. The
     most common injectable anticoagulants are heparin and the low molecular weight heparin, enoxaparin.

     Heparin
     Heparin is an injectable anticoagulant used primarily in the hospital setting. It is FDA approved for the treatment
     and prevention of thromboembolism. Heparin works by inactivating clotting factors in the coagulation cascade. It
     binds to antithrombin and the complex inactivates IIa (thrombin), Xa, IXa, XIa, and XIIa. Heparin is primarily
     administered via an intravenous or subcutaneous route. Subcutaneous use is limited because the absorption by that
     route is erratic and the bioavailability, or amount of drug that makes it into systemic circulation, is low. The dosing
     for heparin is complicated. For treatment of a thromboembolism, it is typically given as a weight-based continuous
     infusion that is titrated based on client response. Response is measured using either the PTT or anti-Xa level,
     depending on the institutional protocol.

     The goal level of heparin varies based on the institution, indication, and client-specific doses. The goal level typically
     corresponds to 1.5-2.5 times the baseline PTT. Typically, monitoring of the anti-Xa level or PTT level is completed
     every 6 hours during an infusion. If the PTT or anti-Xa level is lower than the goal, it is described as subtherapeutic,
     meaning the blood is "too thick." In this situation, a bolus dose may be given and/or the infusion rate increased with
     subsequent monitoring. If the PTT or anti-Xa level is higher than the goal, it is described as supratherapeutic,
     meaning the blood is "too thin." The infusion may be held for a period of time and/or the infusion rate decreased.
     Some institutions have protocols for nurse-driven management of heparin. In these protocols, the nurse monitors
     the PTT or anti-Xa level as directed in the protocol, then adjusts the dose as directed without a new order from the
     provider.

     An example of a heparin dosing protocol is shown in Table 20.1, utilizing PTT monitoring and potential dose
     adjustment every 6 hours.

     PTT                              Dosing

                                      Initial dose: 80 units/kg bolus, then 18 units/kg/hr.

     PTT <35 seconds                  80 units/kg bolus, then increase rate by 4 units/kg/hr.

     TABLE 20.1 A Sample Heparin Dosing Protocol (source: Hirsh et al., 2001)

     Heparin can also be monitored using the ACT, although less frequently. This is typically limited to monitoring during
     procedures and surgeries by a point-of-care device. It allows for quick fine-tuning of the heparin dosage in real time.

     If long-term anticoagulation is needed, an oral anticoagulant is usually started. The transition to oral anticoagulation
     depends on the agent being initiated. For example, warfarin takes several days to achieve therapeutic
     anticoagulation, so overlap with a parenteral agent (e.g., continuation of heparin or initiation of enoxaparin) is
     warranted until then. Other chronic agents may take action immediately; thus, heparin can be discontinued without
     overlap.

     Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a rare although major complication of heparin therapy. It is

characterized by an immune-mediated decrease in platelets, often with concomitant thrombosis. Although the
platelets are decreased, the client is in a highly hypercoagulable state. Heparin must be discontinued immediately,
and alternative anticoagulation with a non-heparin-based anticoagulant is required. Argatroban, an intravenous
direct thrombin inhibitor anticoagulant, is FDA approved to treat HIT. Bivalirudin is another intravenous direct
thrombin inhibitor anticoagulant that has been studied for off-label use in treating clients with HIT. After the acute
phase of HIT, clients can be transitioned to a long-term oral or subcutaneous non-heparin anticoagulant. Clients
with a history of HIT should not receive heparin in the future. Other adverse effects of heparin include hyperkalemia
and osteoporosis with prolonged use.

     CLINICAL TIP

 Assess for Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT)

  It can be difficult to predict which clients are experiencing HIT. The 4T scoring system estimates the risk for HIT
  based on the degree, timing, and potential etiology of the client's platelet decrease, and the presence of
  thrombosis. Online calculators for the 4T score (https://openstax.org/r/mdcal) are available. The diagnosis of HIT
  is more likely and should be considered when the platelet count drops by 50% or more.

     SAFETY ALERT

 Heparin Concentrations

  There are many different heparin products and strengths available, which can lead to medication errors
  (https://openstax.org/r/ismp) if the incorrect concentration or formulation is selected.

Enoxaparin
Enoxaparin is a derivative of heparin and is referred to as a low molecular weight heparin. It is FDA approved to treat
thromboembolism and acute coronary syndromes. It is also approved to decrease the rate of thromboembolism
after surgery and during prolonged immobilization. It works similarly to heparin; however, it targets factor Xa
specifically. Enoxaparin can be administered intravenously and subcutaneously. A major advantage to using
enoxaparin as compared to heparin is that it has more reliable subcutaneous absorption and a longer half-life; thus,
it can more reliably be administered as an intermittent subcutaneous injection without continuous titration. It can
be self-administrated by the client at home using a pre-filled syringe. Under most circumstances, specific
monitoring is not required. A major disadvantage of enoxaparin is that it is eliminated by the kidneys and therefore
the dose must be adjusted or the drug must be avoided in those with kidney dysfunction. Although enoxaparin can
cause HIT, the incidence is less than therapy with heparin.

As enoxaparin can be self-administered by the client, there are many client education points to emphasize with its
use. The client should:

    · Learn appropriate injection technique. The manufacturer for Lovenox provides a client-education video
        (https://openstax.org/r/lovenox) for injection. The product labeling also includes pictorial representations of
        injection technique.

    · Inject into subcutaneous abdomen and alternate injection sites between the left and right anterolateral and
        left and right posterolateral abdominal wall.

    · Inject into a skin fold held between the thumb and forefinger, holding the skin fold throughout the injection.
    · Avoid injecting through clothing or into skin that is bruised or scarred.
    · Avoid ejecting the air bubble from the syringe.
    · Avoid rubbing the injection site after administration.

Oral Anticoagulants
As their name indicates, oral anticoagulants are administered by the oral route. They have the benefit of
convenience for home administration and can be helpful for clients with a fear of needles. Warfarin was the first oral
anticoagulant medication, approved in 1954. Newer oral anticoagulant medications, referred to as direct-acting oral
anticoagulants (DOACs), came on the market in 2010 and have supplanted much of warfarin use. These newer
582  20 · Anticoagulant, Antiplatelet, and Thrombolytic Drugs

     medications include dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban.

     Warfarin
     Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant that is FDA approved to treat and prevent thromboembolism disorders. Warfarin
     inhibits the production of vitamin K in the body. Vitamin K is needed for production of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and
     X. When warfarin is administered, the production of those clotting factors is decreased, which leads to an
     anticoagulated state. It is available as an oral tablet in many strengths to allow for individualized dosing. Each tablet
     of the same dose is the same color regardless of manufacturer. For example, all warfarin 1 mg tablets are pink. (For
     more information, see this online chart of standard warfarin tablet colors and strengths (https://openstax.org/r/
     ucsd). Dosing of warfarin is individualized, variable, and complicated by pharmacokinetic properties and food and
     drug interactions. Doses are titrated based on INR. The therapeutic goal INR varies per indication but is usually 2-3.
     Some clients with mechanical heart valves have an INR goal of 2.5-3.5. Clients are typically started on anywhere
     from 1-10 mg of warfarin depending on client-specific factors including genetic polymorphisms, if known. The full
     effect of warfarin is not apparent until 5-7 days after administration; thus, dose adjustments based on INR are
     limited before that time frame. Warfarin also has a long half-life, and effects can persist for 5 or more days after
     discontinuation. Many clients who take warfarin attend clinics that specialize in warfarin dose adjustments. For most
     clients, the INR is monitored frequently during initiation and during any lifestyle or medication changes.

     Warfarin has numerous drug and food interactions. Drugs interacting with warfarin can cause an increase in bleeding
     risk via effects on the metabolism of warfarin through the cytochrome P450 enzyme or through a decrease in
     production of vitamin K. Some notable interacting drugs/drug classes are listed in Table 20.3; however, this list is
     not inclusive and merely points out a few examples. It is important for clients who take warfarin to maintain a
     consistent amount of vitamin K intake. Since warfarin decreases vitamin K production, dietary intake of vitamin K
     opposes the anticoagulant effect and can decrease warfarin's effect. Conversely, if a client regularly consumes
     vitamin K foods but abruptly stops, their blood can quickly become over-anticoagulated.

     Because of all the extra monitoring and food and drug interaction, warfarin requires in-depth client education. The
     nurse should instruct the client to:

         · Maintain a consistent amount of vitamin K in their diet. It does not need to be avoided altogether, but a
             consistent amount is important. Green, leafy vegetables are known for their high vitamin K content. Some of
             these foods are broccoli, brussels sprouts, coleslaw, kale, and collard greens, and they should not be eaten in
             excess. The American Heart Association provides a list of foods that are high and low in vitamin K
             (https://openstax.org/r/heart).

         · Be educated on drug interactions that can occur. Any time a new medication is started, all involved providers
             should be notified so that the warfarin dose and monitoring can be proactively addressed. This is especially
             important with acute antibiotics that may otherwise go unnoticed when prescribed by a new provider.

         · Send for a guide similar to this AHA warfarin guide (https://openstax.org/r/arrhythmia) to help them manage
             their medication.

         · Have their liver enzymes monitored for early signs of hepatotoxicity and jaundice.
         · Have their hemoglobin and hematocrit levels checked regularly.
         · Abstain from alcohol to reduce risk of bleeding, as alcohol can thin the blood.
         · Wear a medical alert bracelet indicating warfarin use.
         · Use a soft-bristle toothbrush and an electric razor.

     Direct-Acting Oral Anticoagulants
     Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have the advantage of more standardized dosing than warfarin without
     the need for regular INR monitoring. They also have minimal food and drug interactions in comparison.

     The first DOAC, dabigatran, was approved in 2010. It works by directly inhibiting thrombin in the coagulation
     cascade. It is an oral drug used for the treatment of DVT (deep vein thrombosis)/PE (pulmonary embolism), stroke
     prevention in atrial fibrillation, and thromboembolism prophylaxis after hip arthroplasty. The capsules must be
     swallowed whole and cannot be crushed, opened, or chewed. It also must be stored in the original packaging and
     discarded four months after opening. It has a high risk of gastrointestinal side effects. When treating a DVT/PE, an
     initial period of parenteral anticoagulation is required before initiating dabigatran. The other DOACs are all selective
     factor Xa inhibitors. These drugs include apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban.

                                       20.2 · Anticoagulants                                                                         583

Apixaban is FDA approved to reduce stroke risk in clients with atrial fibrillation, to treat DVT/PE both acutely and to
reduce the risk of recurrent thromboembolism after the initial treatment period, and for prevention of DVT after hip
or knee replacement surgery. It is administered twice daily, whereas the other anti-Xa DOACs are administered only
once daily. When treating atrial fibrillation, the dosing must be adjusted if the client meets certain thresholds based
on renal function, age, and weight. When treating an acute DVT, a higher dose of apixaban is required for the first
week of therapy.

Rivaroxaban is FDA approved for several thromboembolic-related indications. Some of the approved indications are
reduction of stroke risk in clients with atrial fibrillation, stable coronary artery disease, treatment of DVT/PE,
reduction of risk for recurrent DVT/PE, prophylaxis of DVT in clients undergoing hip or knee surgery, treatment of
peripheral artery disease, and venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in acutely ill medical clients. For most
indications, rivaroxaban must be taken with food to improve absorption.

Edoxaban is the newest anti-Xa DOAC, approved in 2015. It is FDA approved for stroke prevention in clients with
atrial fibrillation and treatment of DVT/PE. When treating an acute DVT, an initial period of parenteral anticoagulation
for 5-10 days is required before initiation of edoxaban. The most noteworthy aspects of edoxaban treatment are the
renal considerations. Edoxaban carries a black box warning because it should not be used in clients with a creatinine
clearance over 95 mL/min. It also should not be used in clients with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance
under 15 mL/min). Dose adjustments should be made based on moderate renal dysfunction or low body weight.

Table 20.2 lists common anticoagulants and typical routes and dosing for adult clients. Dose adjustments may be
necessary for renal or hepatic impairment. Package inserts should be consulted accordingly.

     Anticoagulant Reversal Agents

     Sometimes clients who have been administered anticoagulant medications experience serious bleeding
     complications or need urgent surgery that should not be performed while the blood is anticoagulated. In those
     cases, reversal agents may be administered to counteract the effect of the anticoagulant. The decision to administer
     a reversal agent is individualized and must consider the risk of continued bleeding (or potential surgical bleeding) as
     compared to the client's underlying thrombotic risk. The reversal agents do not work perfectly; they may not
     completely reverse the anticoagulant effect and additional risks may be present. This section will focus on
     protamine (reversal agent for heparins), vitamin K (reversal agent for warfarin), and monoclonal antibody reversal
     agents for the DOACs.

     Protamine
     Protamine is a protein that neutralizes heparin. It works via electrostatic interactions; it is a positively charged
     molecule that attracts and forms a salt with the negatively charged heparin molecules. Protamine has weak
     anticoagulant activity when given alone, but not when it forms a complex with heparin. Thus, dosing of protamine is
     important to neutralize the effect of heparin without allowing excess protamine to exert its anticoagulant effect. It is
     FDA approved to treat heparin overdose and is used off-label to partially neutralize low molecular weight heparins.
     An example of when this might be used is a client who has an intracranial hemorrhage and who cannot wait for the
     effect of heparin to wear off over time.

        SAFETY ALERT

     Protamine

     Protamine is administered by slow IV push, no faster than 50 mg per 10 minutes, because faster infusion causes
     hypotension. It also can cause severe hypersensitivity reactions, so the nurse should have resuscitation
     equipment and epinephrine available during administration for potential emergency response. The nurse should
     also monitor for heparin rebound, which can occur several hours later (typically 8-9 hours but can be as long as
     18 hours later). Checking a PTT or anti-Xa level can help to monitor for this potential complication.

     Vitamin K (Phytonadione)
     Vitamin K is also known as phytonadione. It is the same substance present in food and is an antidote for the effect
     of warfarin. It is FDA approved for the reversal of anticoagulation due to warfarin, vitamin K deficiency, and for
     prophylaxis and treatment of vitamin K deficiency-related bleeding in newborns. It is available in oral and
     intravenous forms. The dose given and route of administration varies based on clinical need. Intravenous vitamin K
     reverses the effect of warfarin faster than oral vitamin K (onset within 1-2 hours vs. 6-10 hours) and is used during
     acute bleeding if urgent reversal is needed. When reversing the effect of warfarin, a higher dose is generally used for
     higher INR elevations. However, high doses can lead to difficulty anticoagulating a client with warfarin in the future.
     It is important to avoid confusion of vitamin K with potassium, which can also be abbreviated with "K."

     DOAC Reversal Agents
     Specific agents for DOAC reversal have been approved. Idarucizumab is used for life-threatening or uncontrolled
     bleeding in clients that have taken dabigatran. It is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds dabigatran to
     remove it from the blood, ceasing its anticoagulant effect. Andexanet alfa is used for life-threatening or uncontrolled
     bleeding in clients who have taken apixaban or rivaroxaban. It is a recombinant inactive form of factor Xa. It binds

the factor Xa inhibitors, ceasing their anticoagulant effect. Prothrombin complex concentrates, which are the
components of blood containing clotting factors, are also used for reversal of DOACs at some institutions.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications

The major side effect of all anticoagulant medications is bleeding complications. This can manifest in many different
ways, including excessive bleeding in response to trauma or during surgery, gastrointestinal bleeding, or
spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage. Some symptoms of bleeding are blood in the stool; dark, tarry-appearing
stools; blood in the urine; epistaxis (nosebleed); gingival bleeding; very severe headache; coffee-ground emesis;
and hemoptysis.

A history of bleeding complications such as intracranial hemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding may be considered
a contraindication to further anticoagulant therapy. Concomitant medications that further increase bleeding risk,
such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., ibuprofen and naproxen) or antiplatelet agents (e.g. aspirin,
discussed later in this chapter) should also be avoided with anticoagulants when possible. However, since
anticoagulants treat life-threatening diseases, contraindications must be carefully considered. The risks and
benefits of avoiding an anticoagulant due to a relative contraindication must be carefully weighed in the context of
the risk of their primary disease state. For example, clients who have experienced multiple embolic strokes may still
need anticoagulant therapy despite experiencing bleeding complications. For those clients, a lower intensity of
anticoagulation or increased monitoring may be utilized to mitigate bleeding risk and balance risks/benefits. A client
who has atrial fibrillation and a recent stent placed may need concomitant anticoagulant and antiplatelet
medications, although it increases the risk of bleeding.

     Nursing Implications

     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking anticoagulants:

     · Monitor the drug effect via PTT, anti-Xa level, INR, or ACT depending on the specific anticoagulant use, as
        ordered by the provider or per the institutional protocol.

     · Monitor the client for bleeding via decreases in hemoglobin and/or hematocrit and for other signs/symptoms;
        monitor platelets to identify bleeding risk.

     · Familiarize themselves with institutional dosing protocols, especially any nurse-driven protocols.
     · Utilize independent double checks for dose adjustments, especially heparin.
     · Administer warfarin at the same time each day according to institutional policies.
     · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

        teaching guidelines.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking an anticoagulant should:

    · Recognize the signs and symptoms of bleeding as described under adverse effects and notify providers
        immediately if any of these signs or symptoms occur.

    · Differentiate signs of typical bleeding, such as minor bruising, from signs of dangerous bleeding as
        described above.

    · Recognize the signs and symptoms of therapeutic failure, depending on the disease state being treated.
    · Avoid high-risk behaviors that could result in falls (such as working on rooftops or on tall ladders); injuries,

        especially head injuries, may be more severe in clients who take anticoagulants.
    · Wear medical identification, such as a medical alert bracelet, so that if there is an emergency, providers

        are aware of the client's propensity to bleed.
    · Avoid injecting through clothing or into skin that is bruised or scarred.
    · Avoid ejecting the air bubble from the syringe.
    · Avoid rubbing the injection site after administration.

FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

Enoxaparin, Dalteparin, Apixaban, Rivaroxaban, Edoxaban, Dabigatran

There is a risk for epidural or spinal hematomas in clients who take these anticoagulants and are undergoing
spinal puncture or receiving neuraxial anesthesia. These can be very serious and result in long-term or
permanent paralysis. These risks should be considered when scheduling clients for spinal procedures.

Warfarin

Warfarin can cause major or fatal bleeding. INRs should be monitored in all treated clients. Drugs, dietary
changes, or other factors can affect INR levels. Instruct clients to minimize bleeding risk and report signs and
symptoms to their provider.

Apixaban, Rivaroxaban, Edoxaban, Dabigatran

Premature discontinuation of these drugs can lead to increased risk of thrombotic events. Consider coverage
with another anticoagulant if discontinued for reasons other than pathological bleeding or completion of
therapy.

Edoxaban

Edoxaban should not be used in clients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) over 95 mL/min due to a higher rate of
ischemic stroke in clients with atrial fibrillation. Another anticoagulant should be used.

     20.3 Antiplatelets

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 20.3.1 Identify the characteristics of the antiplatelet drugs used to treat thrombus formation.
         · 20.3.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, contraindications, and interactions of

             antiplatelet drugs used to treat thrombus formation.

         · 20.3.4 Explain the client education related to antiplatelet drugs used to treat thrombus formation.

     Antiplatelet drugs work by decreasing platelet activation and/or platelet adhesion. They are used for various
     indications including prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease and prevention of ischemic stroke. One of
     the most common uses for antiplatelets is therapy after a client has an acute coronary syndrome and/or a coronary
     artery stent placed.

     Antiplatelet Drugs

     There are many antiplatelet drugs available. They will be discussed as grouped by mechanism of action.

Aspirin
Aspirin is an over-the-counter antiplatelet agent used for many indications. Some of those indications are secondary
prevention of stroke, coronary artery disease, acute coronary syndromes, primary prevention of cardiovascular
disease, peripheral artery disease, and prevention of thromboembolism in clients with certain heart valves. It also
has anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, which allow it to be used for pain, inflammatory conditions, and
fever. Aspirin works as an antiplatelet agent by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzyme in platelets, which is
responsible for production of prostaglandin precursors of thromboxane A2. Thromboxane A2 is a substance that
activates platelets. Aspirin should not be routinely used in pediatric clients due to the risk of Reye syndrome. Like all
antiplatelet agents, bleeding is a concerning side effect. However, in addition to the effect on platelets, aspirin can
also increase the risk of gastric ulcer formation through inhibition of gastric prostaglandin synthesis. Subsequently,
gastrointestinal effects are a major adverse effect, and it has additive gastrointestinal bleeding risk beyond its
antiplatelet effect.

     CLINICAL TIP

 Chew Aspirin for Faster Absorption

  If acute effects of aspirin are needed, such as during a heart attack, it is recommended that aspirin be chewed
  and swallowed for faster absorption (Mayo Clinic, n.d.).

P2Y12 Inhibitors
P2Y12 inhibitors are potent antiplatelet agents that work as antagonists at the P2Y12 subunit of the ADP receptor
on the platelet surface, which decreases platelet activation at the site of vessel injury. Because of their effect on
bleeding, it is recommended that P2Y12 inhibitors be discontinued 5-7 days prior to surgery, depending on the
agent. There are currently four P2Y12 inhibitors available in the United States: clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor, and
cangrelor. P2Y12 inhibitors require a loading dose if immediate therapeutic effect is needed (e.g., in an acute
myocardial infarction). Onset is slower without loading doses.

Clopidogrel is a prodrug, meaning it must be metabolized to become biologically active. This activation is
accomplished through the enzyme CYP2C19. This is significant because clients can have a genetic alteration in this
enzyme that inhibits clopidogrel activation, which could lead to therapeutic failure. It is also important because it
confers drug interactions. If clients without any genetic alteration take a concomitant drug that inhibits CYP2C19,
the enzyme will not be available to activate clopidogrel, which could lead to therapeutic failure.

     SAFETY ALERT

 Clopidogrel

  Clopidogrel requires a loading dose if immediate onset is desired, such as during an acute coronary syndrome.
  Initiating clopidogrel without a loading dose will result in a delayed effect up to several days, putting the client at
  risk for a thromboembolic event.

Ticagrelor and prasugrel are two additional oral P2Y12 inhibitors that are stronger in their antiplatelet effect
compared to clopidogrel. Prasugrel is a prodrug that must be activated in the body, but it does not rely on CYP2C19
for activation, so it is less susceptible to drug interactions or therapeutic failure due to genetics. However, prasugrel
has a comparatively higher risk of bleeding and the highest risk of fatal bleeding of these agents. It is also
contraindicated in clients with a history of a stroke or transient ischemic attack, clients who are older than 75 years
of age unless they are at very high risk of thromboembolism, and clients who weigh less than 60 kg.

Ticagrelor does not require activation, so like prasugrel, it is not susceptible to CYP2C19-mediated drug interactions
or genetic polymorphisms. A noteworthy side effect of ticagrelor is dyspnea, which can limit activities of daily living.
It also has a boxed warning from the FDA regarding concomitant aspirin doses, which should not exceed 100 mg
orally per day. It is contraindicated in clients with a history of intracranial hemorrhage.

Cangrelor is the only intravenous P2Y12 inhibitor. It is approved for use during percutaneous coronary intervention.
The advantage of cangrelor is that it inhibits platelets nearly immediately upon administration, and platelet function
590  20 · Anticoagulant, Antiplatelet, and Thrombolytic Drugs

     recovers within an hour of medication discontinuation.

     Eptifibatide
     Eptifibatide inhibits the GPIIbIIIa receptor on the platelet surface, preventing activation by von Willebrand's factor
     and fibrinogen. This receptor is responsible for the final step in platelet-to-platelet adhesion; thus, this is a very
     potent antiplatelet agent. It is FDA approved for use during percutaneous coronary intervention in clients
     experiencing a non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome. The major side effect of eptifibatide is profound
     thrombocytopenia. Nurses should monitor the client's platelet count closely and discontinue eptifibatide if the
     platelet count decreases to under 100,000/mm3.

     Table 20.5 lists common antiplatelets and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications

     Like anticoagulants, the major side effect of all antiplatelet medications is bleeding complications. This can manifest
     in many different ways, including excessive bleeding in response to trauma or during surgery, gastrointestinal
     bleeding, or spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage. Some symptoms of bleeding are blood in the stool; dark, tarry-
     appearing stools; blood in the urine; epistaxis; gingival bleeding; very severe headache; coffee-ground emesis; and
     hemoptysis.

     A history of bleeding complications, such as intracranial hemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding, may be
     considered a contraindication to further antiplatelet therapy, depending on the circumstances and the drug.
     Concomitant medications that further increase bleeding risk such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g.,
     ibuprofen and naproxen) or antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin) may also be considered contraindicated with
     antiplatelet medications.

Nursing Implications

The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking antiplatelets:

    · Monitor the client for bleeding via a complete blood count and monitoring for other signs/symptoms.
    · Monitor the client for bleeding via decreases in hemoglobin and/or hematocrit and monitoring for other signs/

        symptoms; monitor platelets to identify bleeding risk.
    · Pay special attention to dosing; initial doses of antiplatelet medications may be higher as a single loading dose

        to accelerate the onset of effect.
    · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

        teaching guidelines.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking an antiplatelet drug should:

    · Recognize the signs and symptoms of bleeding as described under adverse effects. Providers should be
        notified immediately if any of these signs and symptoms occur.

    · Recognize the signs and symptoms of therapeutic failure, depending on the disease state being treated.
    · Avoid high-risk behaviors that could result in falls (such as working on rooftops or on tall ladders). Clients

        must be educated that injuries, especially head injuries, may be more severe in clients who take
        antiplatelets.
    · Wear medical identification, such as a medical alert bracelet, so that if there is an emergency, their
        providers are aware of the client's propensity to bleed.
592  20 · Anticoagulant, Antiplatelet, and Thrombolytic Drugs

       FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

       Clopidogrel

       The antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel is diminished in clients with two loss-of-function alleles of the CYP2C19
       gene. Consider use of another platelet P2Y12 inhibitor in clients identified as CYP2C19 poor metabolizers.

       Ticagrelor

       Ticagrelor can cause significant and sometimes fatal bleeding. It should be avoided in clients with active
       pathological bleeding or a history of intracranial hemorrhage. It should not be started in clients undergoing
       urgent coronary artery bypass graft surgery. If possible, manage bleeding without discontinuing ticagrelor since
       discontinuation will increase the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. Ticagrelor also has a boxed warning
       stating that the maintenance dose of aspirin over 100 mg daily reduces the effectiveness of ticagrelor and
       should be avoided.

       Prasugrel

       Prasugrel can cause significant and sometimes fatal bleeding. It should not be used in clients with active
       pathological bleeding or a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke. It is generally not recommended in
       clients 75 years old or older unless the client is at particularly high risk. Do not start prasugrel in clients likely to
       undergo urgent coronary artery bypass grafting, and discontinue at least 7 days prior to any surgery. If possible,
       manage bleeding without discontinuing prasugrel, as discontinuation increases the risk of subsequent
       cardiovascular events.

     Thrombolytics to Break Down an Existing Clot

     Anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications work in the clotting cascade to prevent clotting in clients without a
     thromboembolism or to prevent worsening of an existing clot while the body breaks the clot down over time.
     Conversely, thrombolytics work to quickly break down an existing clot, which is often needed when the clot is
     blocking blood flow to a major organ. They work by facilitating conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. Plasmin then
     initiates fibrinolysis, or fibrin clot breakdown.

          SAFETY ALERT

      Alteplase

       Alteplase is frequently referred to as tPA as an abbreviation for tissue plasminogen activator (which refers to the
       mechanism of action). However, this can be confused with TNK, an abbreviation sometimes used for
       tenecteplase, or TPN, the abbreviation for total parenteral nutrition, which has led to medication errors and/or
       medication delays in circumstances where timing is crucial. The nurse should avoid using tPA as an abbreviation
       for alteplase.

       See this Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) report for more information on potential medication errors
       associated with alteplase (https://openstax.org/r/confusion).

Alteplase
Alteplase is an intravenous thrombolytic drug that is approved to treat acute ischemic stroke, acute myocardial
infarction, and pulmonary embolism. Alteplase works quickly upon administration, and the half-life is less than 5
minutes. It requires reconstitution prior to administration, which is somewhat complicated and further explained in
the product labeling and manufacturer website (https://openstax.org/r/activase). Because of the high risk of
bleeding, the risks and benefits must be carefully weighed prior to administration. Alteplase has many
contraindications, which are listed in Table 20.8. These contraindications are clinical characteristics or disease
states that put the client at an unacceptable risk for bleeding complications. For example, severe uncontrolled
hypertension increases the risk of intracranial hemorrhage in clients receiving alteplase. Thus, alteplase should be
avoided in those clients. Prior to administering alteplase, the nurse should confirm that the client does not have any
contraindications to therapy.

In small doses, alteplase can also be used as an agent to restore function of central venous access devices that are
unable to draw blood due to thrombus formation. For this use, it is known by the brand name Cathflo Activase.

Tenecteplase
Tenecteplase is approved for treatment of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The most common adverse
effects are bleeding and hypersensitivity. Like alteplase, it has many contraindications that would put the client at
an unacceptable risk of bleeding: active internal bleeding, history of cerebrovascular accident, intracranial or
intraspinal surgery or trauma within 2 months, intracranial neoplasm, arteriovenous malformation, or aneurysm,
known bleeding diathesis, and severe uncontrolled hypertension. Although not FDA approved, off-label use of
tenecteplase for acute ischemic stroke is gaining popularity and is listed as an option in the guidelines for treatment
of acute ischemic stroke (Powers, 2019). Some of the practical advantages of tenecteplase as compared to
alteplase are that it is quicker to prepare, does not require a dedicated intravenous line or pump, and can be
administered as an IV bolus.

Table 20.7 lists common thrombolytics and typical routes and dosing for adult clients. Protocols are usually site
specific and should be utilized accordingly.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications

The main adverse effect of thrombolytic therapy is bleeding, which is sometimes severe and can be fatal. This is
especially frequent at arterial and venous puncture sites, which leads to nursing implications regarding vascular
access described in the next section. Hypersensitivity reactions are also possible. When used to treat coronary
thrombus in a client with an acute myocardial infarction, there is an increased risk of dysrhythmias after blood flow
is restored. The specific contraindications to thrombolytics are discussed within the content for the specific drugs
but are mostly related to bleeding risk.

Table 20.8 is a drug prototype table for thrombolytics featuring alteplase. It lists drug class, mechanism of action,
adult dosage, indications, therapeutic effects, drug and food interactions, adverse effects, and contraindications.

     Nursing Implications

     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking thrombolytics:

         · Obtain baseline vital signs.
         · Avoid intramuscular injections, internal jugular, and subclavian venous punctures during infusion. If an arterial

             puncture is necessary during infusion, the nurse should use an upper extremity blood vessel that can be
             compressed and should apply pressure applied for 30 minutes afterward. The nurse should also monitor the
             puncture site closely.
         · Ensure clients remain on bedrest following thrombolytic administration to reduce falls and subsequent
             bleeding risk.
         · Monitor the client for bleeding via a complete blood count and monitoring for other signs/symptoms.
         · Notify the provider immediately if signs or symptoms of bleeding occur; treatments such as cryoprecipitate

     (blood-derived clotting factors) or antifibrinolytic medications (medications that prevent fibrin breakdown,
     such as aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid) may be warranted.
 · Monitor for hypersensitivity reactions.
 · Initiate an additional IV line for clients receiving alteplase because alteplase requires a dedicated IV line.
 · Monitor for changes in the client's condition depending on the indication for use.
 · Administer thrombolytic therapy promptly; there are specific time frames that the drug must be administered
     for full therapeutic effect, depending on the disease state being treated.
 · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client
     teaching guidelines.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking a thrombolytic should:

    · Recognize the signs/symptoms of bleeding as described under adverse effects. Providers should be
        notified immediately if any of these signs and symptoms occur.

    · Recognize the signs/symptoms of therapeutic failure, depending on the disease state being treated.
    · Remain on bedrest after thrombolytic administration to reduce falls and subsequent bleeding risk.
    · Follow drug-specific dietary guidelines.

The client taking a thrombolytic should not:

    · Discontinue therapy unless following specific instructions from the health care provider.
    · Schedule any invasive procedure without direct communication with the health care provider, including

        but not limited to dental procedures.

INTRODUCTION Lipids are fatty, waxy, or oily substances that have important roles in the body. Some of the most
important ones are energy storage, regulation of body temperature, and hormonal regulation. Lipids are also an
integral part of the cell membrane of each cell in the body. There are three types of lipids, which are differentiated
by their chemical structure: triglycerides, sterols, and phospholipids. This chapter will focus on triglycerides and
sterols and the drugs used to manage their elevations in the blood.

21.1 Introduction to Lipoprotein and Apolipoproteins

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 21.1.1 Discuss fat metabolism and the role of lipoproteins and apolipoproteins in the body.
    · 21.1.2 Discuss the role of lipids as a risk factor for coronary artery disease.

Understanding Lipids

Triglycerides are the main dietary source of fat. They are composed of three long fatty acid chains attached to a
glycerol backbone, as depicted in Figure 21.2. The major sterol in the body is cholesterol. Cholesterol is important
for the structure of cell membranes and for the production of hormones, bile acids, and vitamin D.

     Dyslipidemia is the general term to describe abnormal lipid levels or an imbalance of lipids in the blood.
     Hyperlipidemia refers to excessive serum levels of lipids. It can be categorized as hypertriglyceridemia (excessive
     triglycerides in the blood) or hypercholesterolemia (excessive cholesterol in the blood). Hypercholesterolemia is
     extremely prevalent, affecting 11.5%-38.1% of adults in the United States (Centers for Disease Control and
     Prevention, 2023b; Tsao et al., 2022). Many individuals with hypercholesterolemia have no symptoms; the diagnosis
     is made by monitoring their lipid panel. Familial hypercholesterolemia is a genetic disorder that manifests as very
     high cholesterol levels that can cause early cardiovascular disease. People with familial hypercholesterolemia can
     have one or two copies of the gene for familial hypercholesterolemia. Clients with one copy of the gene have
     heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, which is a mild form of the disease. Clients with two copies of the gene
     have homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. This is a much more severe form of the disease and manifests
     during childhood. Some of the signs and symptoms of familial hypercholesterolemia are bumps or lumps around the
     knees, knuckles, or elbows; swollen or painful Achilles tendon; yellowish areas around the eyes; and a whitish-gray
     color in the shape of a half-moon on the outer edge of the cornea, which are lipid deposits called arcus senilis
     (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020).

                   21.1 · Introduction to Lipoprotein and Apolipoproteins                                                   601

Chylomicrons are lipoproteins produced by enterocytes in the gut. They carry triglycerides to the tissues after
dietary consumption. Three major types of lipoproteins are made by the liver. They vary in their relative amounts of
triglycerides and cholesterol:

    · Very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL)
    · Low-density lipoproteins (LDL or LDL-cholesterol)
    · High-density lipoproteins (HDL or HDL-cholesterol)

VLDL is predominantly composed of triglycerides, whereas LDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol are richer in
cholesterol. Triglycerides carried by VLDL and LDL-cholesterol are mediators of atherosclerosis development.
Atherosclerosis refers to the formation of fatty material, called plaques, on inner arterial walls. It can lead to
coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and peripheral artery disease. Therefore, LDL-
cholesterol is often called "bad cholesterol." HDL-cholesterol, on the other hand, is often called "good cholesterol"
because it does not contribute to atherosclerosis; in fact, it removes cholesterol from the blood (Grundy et al.,
2019).

Lipid levels in the blood are monitored using a blood test called a lipid panel. A lipid panel measures LDL-
cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides. It also measures the total cholesterol level. In most cases, the LDL-
cholesterol level on a lipid panel is calculated using the Friedewald formula, shown below (Friedewald, 1972). Note
that all of the values must be measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL).

Optimal levels of cholesterol are subject to debate and depend on individual characteristics and cardiovascular risk.
However, generally accepted optimal cholesterol levels are shown in Table 21.1.

Lipid              Optimal Level

Total cholesterol  About 150 mg/dL

LDL-cholesterol    About 100 mg/dL

HDL-cholesterol    At least 40 mg/dL in males and 50 mg/dL in females

Triglycerides      Less than 150 mg/dL

TABLE 21.1 Optimal Cholesterol Levels (source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023a)

Lipid Metabolism

Fats from the diet are emulsified by bile acids, which are made in the liver and secreted by the gallbladder when
food is consumed. The emulsified fats are absorbed in the small intestine and carried via chylomicrons to the
tissues. Chylomicrons interact with an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase on muscle and adipose tissue, thereby
facilitating the release of free fatty acids from the triglycerides. The free fatty acids can be burned by the tissues for
energy or stored as fat. The remnants of chylomicrons that are left over after fatty acid delivery return to the liver.
Apolipoproteins A, B, C, and E are all involved in different aspects of this pathway.

The liver also synthesizes cholesterol and triglycerides. Cholesterol is synthesized via an enzyme called HMG CoA
reductase, which is a key drug target in lipid-lowering therapy. The liver then packages cholesterol and triglycerides
into VLDL particles, which travel to muscle and adipose tissue. Lipoprotein lipase breaks down VLDL particles to
release free fatty acids from triglycerides for energy or storage. The remnants left over from the VLDL particles are
called intermediate-density lipoproteins, which can be disposed of by the liver or further broken down by lipases to
form LDL particles. LDL receptors in the liver interact with LDL-cholesterol to engulf it via endocytosis and dispose of
it, effectively removing it from circulation. A protein called PCSK9 interacts with the LDL receptors, leading to their
degradation; this is another important drug target in lipid-lowering therapy. HDL-cholesterol also assists in removing

      Ketogenic Diet

       The ketogenic diet, often called "keto," was originally used to help children suffering from frequent seizures.
       However, it has recently become a popular diet for those seeking weight loss. The diet consists of very low
       amounts of carbohydrates and higher amounts of fat. When very low amounts of carbohydrates are consumed,
       the body uses ketone bodies, made from fats, as the major fuel instead of glucose. Although this diet can lead to
       rapid weight loss, it can be very difficult to sustain. A typical 2000-calorie ketogenic diet would limit
       carbohydrates to 20-50 g per day (Masood et al., 2022). A single apple could satisfy the entire daily intake of
       carbohydrate for a ketogenic diet. The keto diet also may be associated with increased lipid levels and
       cardiovascular disease.

     Lipids and Coronary Artery Disease

     Cholesterol has a central role in the development of coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD is characterized by plaque
     buildup within the coronary arteries, which can occlude blood flow to the heart muscle. The development of CAD
     starts with cholesterol and triglycerides, which can be deposited onto the inner walls of arteries. Cells from the
     immune system called macrophages engulf the cholesterol, forming foam cells and fatty streaks within the arterial
     wall. Over time, cells and cellular debris build up on the fatty streaks, and a fibrous cap forms to create plaques that
     can narrow the artery and obstruct blood flow. Rupture of the fibrous plaque can cause a thrombus, or blood clot, to
     form at the site, possibly resulting in complete arterial occlusion and acute myocardial infarction.

       This interactive slide presentation from the American Heart Association introduces the role of cholesterol in the
       pathophysiology of CAD.

     Because of this pathophysiology, hypercholesterolemia due to elevated LDL-cholesterol is an independent risk
     factor for heart disease. Lipid-lowering therapy that targets LDL-cholesterol is used to decrease the risk for CAD. The
     optimal target levels for LDL-cholesterol and specific treatment strategies recommended in national guidelines have
     changed over the last 15 years and continue to evolve; however, the role of LDL-cholesterol as an independent risk
     factor has not changed.

     Although triglycerides have been implicated in the development of atherosclerosis, treatment has not resulted in
     positive cardiovascular outcomes. Therefore, hypertriglyceridemia is generally not treated unless it is very severe
     (greater than 500 mg/dL), which can put the individual at risk for pancreatitis.

     HDL-cholesterol actually has a protective role against cardiovascular disease, and higher levels (Table 21.1) are
     considered beneficial.

     21.2 Statins (HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors) and PCSK9 Inhibitors

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 21.2.1 Identify the characteristics of statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) and PCSK9 inhibitor drugs
             used to lower lipid levels.

         · 21.2.2 Explain the indications, action, adverse reactions, and interactions of statins (HMG-CoA reductase
             inhibitors) and PCSK9 inhibitor drugs used to lower lipid levels.

         · 21.2.3 Describe nursing implications of statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) and PCSK9 inhibitor
             drugs used to lower lipid levels.

         · 21.2.4 Explain the client education related to statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) and PCSK9 inhibitor
             drugs used to lower lipid levels.

     Statin drugs are some of the most common drugs taken in the United States and are the mainstays of cholesterol-
     lowering pharmacologic therapy. Depending on the dose, they can reduce LDL-cholesterol levels by greater than
     half. Statins are oral drugs that work by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, which is an enzyme used in cholesterol
     synthesis. In addition to their effect on LDL-cholesterol levels, statin medications have additional beneficial effects
     that are unrelated to their effect on cholesterol; these are called pleiotropic effects. Some examples of pleiotropic
     effects are anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiproliferative, and plaque-stabilizing actions, which contribute to their
     efficacy in preventing and treating CAD (Choudhary et al., 2023). Many different statin medications are available.
     Much of the information regarding statin medications applies to all drugs in this class; however, there are some
     differences among the agents. Some of the major differentiators within the statin class of medications are
     administration instructions, potency, and drug interactions.

     Because cholesterol is made in the body at night, it is common for statin medications to be taken at bedtime. This
     timing allows the highest concentration of the drug to be available when cholesterol synthesis is most active,
     leading to the greatest therapeutic efficacy. However, drugs with a longer half-life, such as rosuvastatin and
     atorvastatin, can be taken at any time of day because they remain in the body longer.

     Statin medications vary in their potency, or the magnitude of cholesterol lowering that occurs upon administration to
     a client. The drug/dose combinations are classified by this potency: high intensity (greater than 50%), moderate
     intensity (30%-49%), and low intensity (less than 30%; Table 21.3). Based on their high potency, atorvastatin and
     rosuvastatin are some of the most frequently prescribed statin medications.

     High Intensity                   Moderate Intensity     Low Intensity

     Atorvastatin 40-80 mg            Atorvastatin 10-20 mg  Simvastatin 10 mg

     Rosuvastatin 20-40 mg            Rosuvastatin 5-10 mg   Pravastatin 10-20 mg

     TABLE 21.3 Statin Drugs Classified by Intensity of Ability to Lower Cholesterol (source: Adapted from Grundy et al., 2019)

     The drug interaction profile of each statin depends on its metabolic pathway. Simvastatin and lovastatin have a high
     likelihood of interacting with many other drugs. Their metabolism relies heavily on cytochrome enzymes, and if
     another drug inhibits their metabolism, the statin concentrations increase, putting the client at risk for adverse
     events. Pravastatin has relatively fewer drug interactions because it relies less on metabolism via cytochrome
     enzymes in the liver for metabolism. It is often considered the drug of choice for clients who must take highly
     interacting drugs, such as certain immunosuppressants after an organ transplant.

     Nurses should be familiar with the American Heart Association's recommendations for management of drug
     interactions with statins (https://openstax.org/r/ahajournalso). The tables provide summaries of selected
     interactions and their management recommendations (Wiggins et al., 2016). If drug interactions are present, the
     choice of drug depends on the specific indication for statin therapy and other medications the client must take.

     PCSK9 inhibitors are a newer class of drugs that bind to PCSK9 proteins, rendering them unable to function.

Inhibition of PCSK9 leads to less degradation of LDL receptors, making them more available to remove LDL-
cholesterol from the circulation. PCSK9 inhibitors are some of the most potent LDL-lowering medications available
and can lower LDL-cholesterol by 43%-64% (Grundy et al., 2019). PCSK9 inhibitors are monoclonal antibodies and
require ongoing administration by injection. They are generally well tolerated, although long-term safety has not
been well established. One of the disadvantages of PCSK9 inhibitors is the cost--roughly $14,000 per year (Grundy
et al., 2019; based on list price from mid-2018).

Inclisiran is another drug that targets PCSK9, but it works differently than the PCSK9 inhibitors, and it is not a
monoclonal antibody. It prevents the formation of PCSK9 altogether, leading to a therapeutic effect similar to that of
the PCSK9 inhibitors. Like the PCSK9 inhibitors, it is given by subcutaneous injection; however, a health care
professional should administer it. After an initial 3-month loading phase, it is administered just twice a year. No
specific monitoring is required after injection.

Table 21.4 lists common statins and PCSK9 inhibitors and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

Statins

Some of the most popular statin medications are atorvastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, and pravastatin.

Rosuvastatin
Rosuvastatin is the most potent statin medication. At a dosage of 20-40 mg per day, it is one of only two statin
medications classified as high intensity and is recommended for individuals with the greatest cardiovascular risk.
Unlike some other statins, rosuvastatin may be taken at any time of the day because it has a long half-life of 19
hours. The capsules or tablets should be swallowed whole and not crushed or chewed. Rosuvastatin is metabolized
by CYP2C9, so it interacts with other drugs that affect that enzyme. Rosuvastatin is a hydrophilic (water-soluble)
statin, which may confer a lower risk of myopathy because it does not easily enter the muscle.
606  21 · Lipid-Lowering Drugs

     Atorvastatin
     Atorvastatin is another potent statin medication. At a dosage of 40-80 mg per day, it is also classified as high
     intensity and is recommended for individuals with the greatest cardiovascular risk. It may be taken at any time of
     day because of its long half-life. It is metabolized by CYP3A4, so it interacts with other drugs that affect that
     enzyme. The metabolizing enzyme for atorvastatin is different from that for rosuvastatin, so the drug interaction
     profiles vary as well. Atorvastatin is a lipophilic (fat-soluble) statin, which may allow it to penetrate the muscle
     tissue and lead more readily to myopathy.

     dosage, indications, therapeutic effects, drug and food interactions, adverse effects, and contraindications.

     TABLE 21.5 Drug Prototype Table: Atorvastatin (source: https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/)

     Simvastatin
     At its highest prescribed doses, simvastatin is considered a moderate-intensity statin. Therefore, it is not
     appropriate for clients who have very high cardiovascular risk. Nurses should instruct clients to take simvastatin in
     the evening because of its shorter half-life compared to rosuvastatin or atorvastatin. Simvastatin is metabolized to a
     great extent by CYP3A4, and drug interactions influence its concentrations in the body. The U.S. Food and Drug
     Administration (FDA) has issued a warning regarding dose limitations when simvastatin is used concomitantly with
     amiodarone. (See the FDA website for the most recent update to that warning (https://openstax.org/r/
     fdagovdrugsd).) It is also a highly lipophilic statin. The high potential for drug interactions, combined with
     lipophilicity that may facilitate entry into muscle tissue, may confer greater risks for clients taking simvastatin rather
     than other options.

     SAFETY ALERT

 Simvastatin

  Clients should not take simvastatin 80 mg because the risk of muscle-related adverse events is unacceptably
  high. More information about restrictions, contraindications, and dose limitations (https://openstax.org/r/
  fdagovdrugsdr) can be found online.

Pravastatin
Pravastatin is another statin medication. At its highest doses, it is considered a moderate-intensity statin. Thus, it is
not considered appropriate for clients who have high cardiovascular risk. Pravastatin has a comparatively lower risk
of drug interactions because it is not metabolized as highly by CYP enzymes, although some interactions are still
possible. In addition, is hydrophilic; these two aspects may confer a lower risk for myopathy. Pravastatin is often
considered a drug of choice in clients who take multiple medications and have an increased risk of drug interactions
or those who cannot tolerate other statins due to adverse effects. However, it is not potent enough to be a first-line
option for many clients.

PCSK9 Inhibitors

The two PCSK9 inhibitors currently available are alirocumab and evolocumab. The drugs are relatively similar but
vary in their dosing (Table 21.4). Both are given as subcutaneous injections that can be self-administered by the
client.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Some of the most common and limiting adverse effects associated with statins are muscular in nature. Myalgia, or
muscle pain, is common and occurred in 5%-10% of clients taking statin therapy in observational studies (Grundy
et al., 2019). Myositis is rare and is characterized by muscular pain or weakness and elevated levels of the enzyme
creatine kinase, indicating muscle breakdown. Rhabdomyolysis is the most severe muscular side effect of statin
therapy. It is characterized by severe muscle breakdown and creatine kinase (CK) levels 10-fold greater than
normal. The byproducts of muscle breakdown can cause kidney toxicity, which can be fatal. Some statins have a
higher propensity to cause myopathy. This risk may be related to their drug interactions. If clients take a drug that
raises the concentration of their statin medication in their blood, they may have a higher risk for adverse effects. The
risk of myopathy may also be related to how hydrophilic or lipophilic the drug is. Statins that are more highly
lipophilic can more easily enter the muscle and cause toxicity.

Statins are associated with new-onset diabetes, most commonly in clients who have other risk factors for diabetes,
such as obesity or metabolic syndrome. Infrequently, statins have been associated with elevations in transaminase.
Prior to 2012, liver function was frequently monitored in clients taking statin medications because of concerns for
and association with liver failure. However, in 2012 the FDA revised the recommendation (https://openstax.org/r/
fdagovdrugsdrugsafe) for monitoring liver function and now recommends that liver enzymes be tested before
starting statin therapy and only as clinically indicated thereafter. This change was made because hepatic failure due
to statin medications is rare, and monitoring liver enzymes does not detect or prevent serious liver injury.

Previously, statin medications carried a strong warning against use in pregnancy and were considered absolutely
contraindicated. In 2021, based on a review of evidence, the FDA downgraded this strong warning to a
recommendation. The FDA now recommends that health care providers discontinue statin use in most pregnant
clients but that they also should consider the individual client's ongoing therapeutic needs.

The most common adverse effects of PCSK9 inhibitors are injection site reactions, which are usually mild.
Hypersensitivity reactions are also possible. PCSK9 inhibitors are contraindicated in clients with a history of
hypersensitivity to any drug within the class.

The most common adverse effects of inclisiran are injection site reactions. It has no absolute contraindications.

Bile Acid Sequestrants

Bile acid sequestrants are a class of drugs that lower cholesterol. Bile acids are made from cholesterol and are
released from the small intestine to aid in fat digestion after the individual consumes food. The majority of bile acids
are reabsorbed back into the body after use. Bile acid sequestrants work by binding to bile acids in the intestine,
which reduces their absorption and decreases the amount of bile acids available in the body. The body compensates
for this by producing more bile acids from cholesterol, effectively decreasing the amount of cholesterol that
remains.

Bile acid sequestrants are often used as second-line therapy for hypercholesterolemia if clients do not achieve
sufficient goals using first-line therapy or if they are intolerant to first-line therapy. Bile acid sequestrants can be
expected to lower the LDL-cholesterol levels by 15%-30% (Grundy et al., 2019). Response to therapy is monitored
by obtaining LDL-cholesterol levels. These drugs are orally administered and are not absorbed into the systemic
circulation; therefore, they are best taken with meals so that they will encounter the bile acids upon secretion.
However, their use is limited by frequency of dosing, an unfavorable gastrointestinal adverse effect profile, and their
propensity for interaction with other drugs, which necessitates coordination of administration. Also, outcomes data
in cardiovascular disease are lacking when used in combination with statins, the first-line therapy for
hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular risk reduction.

Three bile acid sequestrants are used for treating hyperlipidemia. The drugs have few distinguishing factors beyond
the class effects listed here. Some of the differentiators are the available dosage forms (tablets, powder),
administration instructions, and FDA-approved indications. These are summarized in Table 21.7; however, it is

     Fibrates

     Fibrates are a group of oral drugs that are used primarily to treat hypertriglyceridemia. They include fenofibric acid,
     fenofibrate, and gemfibrozil. They work by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. The primary result
     of this activation is lower triglyceride levels via increased expression of lipoprotein lipase, an enzyme that breaks
     down triglycerides. Fibrates also lead to increased HDL-cholesterol and mildly lower LDL-cholesterol levels;
     however, they are not typically recommended for those uses (Grundy et al., 2019). Adverse effects of fibrates
     include increased serum transaminase, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), and creatinine levels; myopathy;
     cholelithiasis; and venous thrombosis.

     Fenofibric Acid Derivatives
     Fenofibric acid is an active drug that directly stimulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors as described

above. It is available in the active form under the brand name Fibricor and as generic drugs. An inactive form called
fenofibrate is also available; this form converts to fenofibric acid in the body after ingestion. Some of the available
dosage forms of fenofibrate are Antara, Lipofen, Fenoglide, Tricor, Trilipix (choline fenofibrate), and their respective
generic formulations. The various fenofibrate dosage forms are not bioequivalent and cannot be substituted for each
other or for fenofibric acid on a milligram-per-milligram basis; they use different types of medication delivery
technology to ensure absorption, including micronized particles, nanocrystals, and different salt forms.

Gemfibrozil
Gemfibrozil is another fibrate approved for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia and for primary prevention of CAD
in clients who have failed to respond to lifestyle changes and other pharmacologic therapies. Gemfibrozil is
generally administered orally, twice daily, 30 minutes before breakfast and dinner. The most common adverse
events are dyspepsia, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Less commonly, abnormal liver function tests and worsening
renal function in those with baseline dysfunction have been reported. It is contraindicated in clients with severe
hepatic or renal disease, preexisting gallbladder disease, or hypersensitivity to gemfibrozil.

Gemfibrozil is associated with several notable drug interactions. The concomitant use of gemfibrozil and
rosuvastatin or simvastatin is contraindicated because of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. If the client
needs to take both a fibrate and a statin, it is safer to use a fenofibric acid derivative. Similarly, a client taking
gemfibrozil with colchicine should be monitored for the same concerns of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis.
Concomitant use with warfarin places the client at risk for bleeding, so frequent monitoring of the international
normalized ratio is recommended until stabilization.

          SAFETY ALERT

      Gemfibrozil

       The nurse should clarify any medication orders that use abbreviations. For example, gemfibrozil could be
       abbreviated as "gem." This could be confused with gemcitabine, a chemotherapy agent, with severe
       consequences. Learn more about error-prone abbreviations (https://openstax.org/r/ismporgresources) like this
       one by visiting the website for the Institute for Safe Medication Practices.

     Niacin

     Niacin (vitamin B3) is a water-soluble vitamin. The chemical name for niacin is nicotinic acid. It is approved for
     treatment of hyperlipidemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertriglyceridemia; for secondary prevention of myocardial
     infarction; and, in combination with a bile acid sequestrant, for slowing the progression or promoting the regression
     of atherosclerotic disease. The specific mechanism of action of niacin in dyslipidemia is not well understood. It may
     increase the activity of lipoprotein lipase, the main enzyme that is affected by fibrates, or it may increase the rate of
     removal from plasma and decrease the rate of synthesis of LDL-cholesterol. The therapeutic effect in dyslipidemia is
     a reduction in triglyceride, LDL-cholesterol, and total cholesterol levels as well as an increase in HDL-cholesterol
     levels.

     Niacin is available in various dosage forms. Many are considered dietary supplements and thus are not regulated by
     the FDA. Some of these dietary supplements are marketed as "flush-free" niacin; however, these flush-free versions
     have been shown to contain no free nicotinic acid and should not be used to treat dyslipidemia (National Institutes
     of Health, 2022). Prescription niacin products include extended-release and immediate-release formulations.
     Nurses should be aware that the various niacin preparations are not interchangeable on a milligram-per-milligram
     basis.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications

     Bile acid sequestrants. Because these drugs are not absorbed into the systemic circulation, systemic adverse
     effects are limited; side effects from bile acid sequestrants are generally related to their effect on the
     gastrointestinal system. Constipation is the most common one; it can be severe and can aggravate hemorrhoids.
     Clients can minimize constipation by starting doses cautiously, taking one per day. It can also be managed with
     increased fluids and dietary fiber and, if needed, a stool softener. Other gastrointestinal adverse effects include
     abdominal pain, heartburn, loss of appetite, indigestion, diarrhea, and upset stomach.

     Bile acid sequestrants also can cause an increase in triglyceride levels, which is typically mild. However, in clients
     with a triglyceride level of 300 mg/dL or higher at baseline, hypertriglyceridemia can be severe. With long-term
     therapy of high doses, absorption of some fat-soluble nutrients may be decreased, and supplementation of vitamins
     A, D, E, and K may be needed. In extreme cases, bleeding can occur due to an induced deficiency of vitamin K,
     which is needed for the synthesis of clotting factors. Additionally, bile acid sequestrants can interfere with the
     absorption of some drugs. Because of this, it is recommended that clients take other drugs at least 1 hour before or
     3-4 hours after taking a bile acid sequestrant (Grundy et al., 2019).

     Because of the high incidence of constipation, bile acid sequestrants are contraindicated in clients with a history of
     bowel obstruction. Because these drugs can increase triglycerides, they also are contraindicated in clients who have
     baseline hypertriglyceridemia or a history of pancreatitis due to hypertriglyceridemia.

     Fibrates. The most common adverse effects of fibrates are elevated liver enzymes, increases in serum creatinine,
     and myopathy, especially when fibrates are combined with statin medications. They should not be used in clients
     who have active liver disease, gallbladder disease, severe renal dysfunction, or hypersensitivity (Singh & Correa,
     2023).

     Niacin. The most limiting adverse effect of niacin is flushing, which is most prominent in the immediate-release
     preparations. This occurs because niacin increases prostaglandins in capillaries, leading to cutaneous vasodilation.
     It can be managed by slowing down the niacin absorption rate by using a slower-release (extended-release) version
     or by administering a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as aspirin 30 minutes before niacin

administration (National Institutes of Health, 2022). Clients taking niacin can minimize flushing by avoiding hot
drinks and alcoholic beverages. Significant adverse effects include hepatotoxicity, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia,
and hyperuricemia (National Institutes of Health, 2022).

Niacin is contraindicated in clients with active liver disease, unexplained or persistent elevations in hepatic
transaminase levels, active peptic ulcer disease, arterial bleeding, or hypersensitivity to niacin or components of the
formulation.

Nursing Implications

The nurse should do the following for clients taking bile acid sequestrants:

    · Monitor for constipation and instruct client about appropriate management (increase fluids and dietary fiber
        and, if needed, take a stool softener).

    · Administer other drugs at least 1 hour before or 3-4 hours after bile acid sequestrant administration.
    · Mix powder dosage forms with fluid as appropriate.
    · Monitor for deficiency of fat-soluble nutrients and recommend supplementation when needed.
    · Administer with meals as directed by the health care provider.
    · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

        teaching guidelines.

The nurse should do the following for clients taking fibrates:

    · Obtain an accurate home medication list to assess for drug interactions.
    · Avoid direct substitution of different forms of fenofibric acid because they are not interchangeable.
    · Monitor for signs and symptoms of muscle-related adverse effects, especially when coadministered with a

        statin.
    · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

        teaching guidelines.

The nurse should do the following for clients taking niacin:

    · Assist the client in choosing appropriate over-the-counter versions when needed. Avoid flush-free niacin and
        choose extended-release products to maximize efficacy and minimize flushing.

    · Administer an NSAID prior to administration if directed by the health care provider; if the client is already
        taking low-dose aspirin, the aspirin dose can be administered before niacin to limit additional NSAIDs.

    · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client
        teaching guidelines.

  CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

  The client taking a bile acid sequestrant should:

      · Take other drugs at least 1 hour before or 3-4 hours after bile acid sequestrant administration.
      · Alert their health care provider, increase fluids and dietary fiber, and, if needed, take a stool softener if

          they experience constipation.
      · Administer with meals as directed by their health care provider.
      · Take vitamin supplementation if instructed to do so by their health care provider.

  The client taking a fibrate should:

      · Keep an accurate medication list so that health care professionals can assess for drug interactions.
      · Monitor for adverse events and alert their health care provider with any concerns.

  The client taking niacin should:

      · Avoid choosing flush-free niacin for managing lipid levels.
      · Ask their health care provider about possibly taking an NSAID before their niacin drug.
      · Avoid hot drinks and alcoholic beverages around the time of administration to minimize flushing.

CHAPTER OUTLINE
22.1 Introduction to Cardiac Emergencies and Shock
22.2 Cardiac Emergency Drugs
22.3 Shock Drugs

INTRODUCTION Cardiac emergencies are life-threatening events that can include acute myocardial infarction,
unstable angina, and acute dysrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms). Acute myocardial infarction and unstable
angina occur when the blood supply to the heart is threatened by occlusion of a coronary artery. Both of these
processes of cardiac tissue ischemia deprive the tissue of oxygen; in infarction, cell death has occurred in the tissue
as a result of this sudden insufficient blood supply. Ischemia and infarction can acutely and significantly affect the
heart's ability to pump blood. Dysrhythmias occur when the cardiac conduction system is not functioning correctly
and so does not stimulate the heart to contract correctly. Both coronary artery occlusions and acute dysrhythmias
can lead to shock, which occurs when tissue perfusion is decreased so much that tissues become ischemic. If shock
is not reversed quickly, tissue damage will occur, and eventually cell, tissue, and system death will occur.

22.1 Introduction to Cardiac Emergencies and Shock

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 22.1.1 Describe cardiac emergencies requiring emergency drugs.
    · 22.1.2 Describe shock and general treatment guidelines.

Cardiac Emergencies

The primary responsibility of the heart is to generate cardiac output. Cardiac output (CO) is a function of heart rate

(HR) and stroke volume  . Normal resting cardiac output is 4-5 L/min. Heart rate is the
620  22 · Cardiac Emergency and Shock Drugs

     number of times the heart beats per minute. Stroke volume is the amount of blood pumped out of the left ventricle
     with each heartbeat. In order for the heart to maintain cardiac output, both the electrical system of the heart and
     the pumping system of the heart must function properly. When the heart pumps blood into the aorta, the first organ
     that receives blood is the heart itself; coronary arteries branch off the aorta to supply the heart with oxygen and
     nutrients. The left main coronary artery and the right coronary artery (Figure 22.2) are large arteries that branch into
     smaller arteries and arterioles to supply the heart. If any type of occlusion exists, then the blood flow to the heart
     tissue is reduced (ischemia), and anoxia and infarction may occur.

     There are two main types of cells in the heart: cardiac myocytes, which are contractile cells, and cardiac conduction
     cells, which generate and conduct electrical impulses. If cardiac myocytes are damaged, then the pumping ability of
     the heart is decreased. If cardiac myocytes die, an acute myocardial infarction (commonly referred to as a heart
     attack) occurs. If cardiac conduction cells die, the conduction system does not function properly, which can affect
     cardiac output. The cardiac conduction system also depends on appropriate electrolyte plasma levels in order to
     function optimally.

     FIGURE 22.2 Both views of the heart show the prominent coronary arteries and surface vessels. (credit: modification of work from Anatomy
     and Physiology 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

     Acute Myocardial Infarction
     The heart, just like every other organ in the body, needs oxygen and nutrients to survive. Cardiac tissue receives
     oxygenated blood from coronary arteries, which branch off from the aorta (Figure 22.2). However, the coronary
     arteries may become occluded due to various causes, with atherosclerosis, atherosclerotic plaque rupture, and
     emboli being the most common. If coronary artery occlusion occurs, then oxygenated blood does not reach all of the
     cardiac tissue. The affected tissue then becomes ischemic, and eventually an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) will
     occur. It is possible to avert tissue death with timely drugs and procedures.
     Figure 22.3 shows an occlusion in the circumflex artery and the common trunk of the left coronary artery. Occlusion
     in the circumflex artery can lead to ischemia and possible infarction in the apex of the heart.

Unstable Angina
Angina is the medical term for chest pain caused by cardiac ischemia. Angina occurs when the heart is not getting
enough blood flow. There are two types of angina: stable and unstable. Stable angina (discussed in Antihypertensive
and Antianginal Drugs) occurs when the heart needs more oxygen but the supply of oxygen is restricted. Once the
heart does not need increased oxygen, the angina subsides. Stable angina occurs during exercise or exertion and
improves with rest because the cardiac myocytes no longer require an increased oxygen supply. Many people live
with stable angina, and medications are available to treat it.

Unstable angina occurs when the heart does not get enough blood flow. Often, the heart does not have an increased
demand for oxygen; rather, the supply of oxygen has been decreased most often due to an occlusion of a coronary
artery. Because oxygen supply is decreased, the angina will not be relieved with rest. Unstable angina is a medical
emergency.
622  22 · Cardiac Emergency and Shock Drugs

     Dysrhythmias
     It is important to understand cardiac conduction in order to understand dysrhythmias. The heart is truly amazing in
     that it has the ability to generate electrical impulses. The sinoatrial (SA) node generates impulses that travel through
     the conduction tissue and stimulate the myocytes to contract. Each impulse leaves the SA node and travels to the
     atrioventricular (AV) node (during this time, the atria are stimulated to contract), has a brief pause, and then travels
     down the bundle branches and Purkinje fibers to stimulate ventricular contraction (Figure 22.4).

     FIGURE 22.4 The SA node generates impulses that travel to the AV node, pause briefly, and then travel down the bundle branches and
     Purkinje fibers to stimulate ventricular contraction. (credit: modification of work from Anatomy and Physiology 2e. attribution: Copyright
     Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

     The generation and conduction of electrical impulses rely heavily on various electrolytes: potassium, sodium, and
     calcium. Disturbances in the balance of these electrolytes can lead to serious dysrhythmias. Dysrhythmias can also
     occur when the conduction system has an interruption in blood supply. The conducting cells of the heart need
     oxygen and nutrients just as every other cell in the body does. If they do not receive oxygen, they will become
     ischemic and eventually die. If cells in the conduction pathway die, then that area does not conduct the electrical
     impulses.

     Diagnostics
     Unstable Angina and Acute Myocardial Infarction
     When an individual is experiencing acute unstable angina or an AMI, the health care provider will first perform a
     rapid physical assessment based on signs and symptoms and then order specific diagnostics. These may include an
     electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG), continuous cardiac monitoring, cardiac troponin levels, a complete blood count, a
     lipid profile, and a basic metabolic profile. Other more advanced diagnostic testing may be performed based on
     assessment findings. The individual will often undergo cardiac angiography for diagnostics and treatment.

     Dysrhythmias
     If cardiac dysrhythmia is suspected, the health care provider will perform a rapid physical assessment and order an
     ECG, which shows changes in heart rhythm and is diagnostic for dysrhythmias. Additional diagnostic tests include a
     basic metabolic profile to assess potassium, sodium, and calcium levels.

     Clinical Manifestations
     Clinical manifestations of both unstable angina and AMI include chest pain that may radiate down the left arm or up

                                                22.1 · Introduction to Cardiac Emergencies and Shock                      623

to the neck, jaw pain, back pain, shortness of breath, diaphoresis (excessive sweating), nausea and vomiting,
anxiety, and a feeling of impending doom. Nurses must be aware that signs and symptoms of AMI vary quite a lot,
and some individuals may not feel chest pain at all. Furthermore, female clients often experience symptoms that are
more vague or subtle than the ones reported by male clients.

  SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

  Signs and Symptoms of Acute Myocardial Infarction

  Many different signs and symptoms can be suggestive of an AMI. Clients will often downplay them and suggest
  they may be attributed to other causes.

  Female clients often experience different signs and symptoms than male clients do during an AMI, such as
  upper back pressure or lightheadedness. See the American Heart Association website (https://openstax.org/r/
  topics) for more information on these symptoms.

Clinical manifestations of dysrhythmias include heart palpitations, racing heart rate, chest pain, shortness of breath,
anxiety, fatigue, lightheadedness, dizziness, diaphoresis, and syncope (fainting). Life-threatening dysrhythmias
often cause syncope to occur rapidly because cardiac output and blood pressure are not maintained.

Nonpharmacologic Treatment
Unstable Angina and Acute Myocardial Infarction
Nonpharmacologic treatment for both unstable angina and AMI includes stopping the activity that caused the pain,
having the individual rest, and transporting them by ambulance to the nearest emergency department as soon as
possible. They should undergo rapid emergency assessment and, if needed, should be transported to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory for coronary artery catheterization, which will provide further diagnostic information and
can be used for stent placement in blocked arteries.

Dysrhythmias
If an individual is experiencing a life-threatening dysrhythmia, they should be transported to the nearest emergency
department by ambulance. Depending on the type of dysrhythmia, defibrillation (administration of electrical shock)
may be used to attempt to convert the life-threatening dysrhythmia to normal sinus rhythm (rhythm originating from

All cells in the body require oxygen to make adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the primary source of energy
that cells use. This process is called aerobic metabolism. Most cells in the body can produce a limited amount of
ATP anaerobically (without oxygen), but if oxygen is not eventually present, the cells cannot produce enough ATP to
continue functioning, and they will die.

Shock is caused by decreased tissue perfusion that occurs when cells, tissues, and organs do not receive adequate

oxygenated blood. Tissues are perfused via the blood pressure (BP), which is a function of cardiac output (CO) and

systemic vascular resistance                    . Recall that cardiac output is a function of heart rate

and stroke volume             . Systemic vascular resistance is the amount of resistance in the blood

vessels; in other words, it is the pressure that the arterial wall exerts against the circulating blood volume. Systemic

vascular resistance is affected by blood vessel diameter, blood vessel length, and fluid viscosity (thickness). Of

these three components, blood vessel diameter is by far the most important. A small change in blood vessel

diameter can cause a major difference in vascular resistance and overall blood pressure.

Shock is typically classified into four types:

· Distributive shock occurs when the normally circulating volume of fluid shifts from intravascular (within the
   blood vessels) to extravascular (outside of the blood vessels or in the area of the tissues). Because blood
   pressure depends on systemic vascular resistance, if there is a decreased fluid volume within the vasculature,
   then there is decreased resistance, and blood pressure is lower. An example of this type of shock is
   anaphylactic shock.

· Hypovolemic shock occurs when there is blood loss. If the bleeding is profound, then the volume in the
624  22 · Cardiac Emergency and Shock Drugs

             vasculature will be reduced, leading to decreased systemic vascular resistance and decreased blood pressure.
             An example of this is acute blood loss due to a major trauma.
         · Cardiogenic shock occurs when the heart has been damaged in some way and can no longer maintain
             adequate cardiac output. When cardiac output decreases, blood pressure decreases in turn. An example of
             cardiogenic shock is the aftereffect of an AMI. If tissue in the left ventricle dies, then the heart is not able to
             generate enough force to pump blood, and cardiac output is decreased.
         · Obstructive shock occurs when some type of blockage in the thoracic cavity (rib cage) impedes the heart's
             ability to pump. An example of this is cardiac tamponade (increased fluid in the pericardial sac that protects
             the heart). If there is too much fluid, then the ventricles cannot open enough to allow blood in for filling and
             therefore cannot pump blood out. Cardiac output is needed to maintain blood pressure, so this reduction in
             cardiac output will cause a decrease in blood pressure.

     This chapter will focus on anaphylactic shock (a type of distributive shock), hypovolemic shock, and cardiogenic
     shock.

     Anaphylactic Shock
     Anaphylaxis occurs when the immune system has an overwhelming response to a foreign substance that is not
     usually harmful to most people. Examples of this type of substance include food and insect stings. In a typical
     allergic response, the immune system releases inflammatory mediators that cause local vasodilation, but in
     anaphylaxis, the immune system releases inflammatory mediators throughout the entire body. This response
     causes systemic vasodilation along with other signs of allergy (rash, pruritis) and bronchoconstriction, which allows
     plasma to leak from the blood vessels into the tissues. Because systemic vascular resistance is a major component
     of blood pressure, systemic vasodilation causes hypotension. In anaphylaxis, the resulting profound hypotension is
     referred to as anaphylactic shock.

     Anaphylactic shock can rapidly become life-threatening because the systemic release of inflammatory mediators
     also affects the respiratory system. In the lungs, the extreme vasodilation causes plasma to leak from blood vessels
     directly into lung tissue. This is referred to as pulmonary edema. The inflammatory mediators also cause smooth
     muscle constriction. Because the bronchioles are surrounded by smooth muscle, the airways narrow, and breathing
     is severely restricted. Air flow can become completely cut off and lead to death.

     Hypovolemic Shock
     Hypovolemic shock results when not enough blood is circulating through the blood vessels. Causes of hypovolemic
     shock include blood loss due to external or internal bleeding, fluid loss from third-degree burns, and excessive
     vomiting or diarrhea. For blood pressure to be maintained, an adequate amount of fluid must be present within the
     blood vessels. If the blood volume is too low, then there will not be enough pressure to maintain systemic vascular
     resistance, which will cause blood pressure to decrease and the body's tissues to become ischemic. Hypovolemic
     shock can rapidly become a life-threatening emergency if it is not reversed in a timely fashion.

     Cardiogenic Shock
     Cardiogenic shock occurs when there has been damage to the cardiac muscle or when an area of cardiac muscle is
     dead. As already stated, cardiac output is a function of heart rate and stroke volume. Stroke volume is determined
     by preload, afterload, and contractility. Preload is the amount of blood that returns to the heart (venous return),
     afterload is the resistance that the heart must pump against, and contractility is the force of the cardiac contraction.
     In AMI, ventricular muscle cells have died and are no longer able to contract. In ischemia, the decreased blood flow
     means that cardiac muscle cells do not receive enough oxygen and cannot contract well. Regardless of the
     precipitating event, contractility is decreased, which negatively affects cardiac output. If cardiac output is
     decreased, then blood pressure will be decreased, and tissue perfusion will in turn be further decreased.

     Diagnostics
     Low blood pressure accompanied by clinical signs such as cool, clammy skin; an elevated heart rate; elevated
     respiratory rate; change in mental status; or reduced level of consciousness are indicative of shock. Because shock
     is a life-threatening event, if it is suspected, treatment will begin as soon as possible and often before the problem is
     even definitively diagnosed.

     Diagnostics may include an ECG, continuous cardiac monitoring, x-rays, complete blood count, comprehensive

metabolic profile, serum lactate level, blood type and screen testing for possible blood transfusion, and different
types of blood cultures (because the cause of the shock may not yet be known).

Clinical Manifestations
Clinical manifestations of shock may include hypotension, tachycardia (heart rate greater than 100 beats/min),
tachypnea (fast respiratory rate), cold or clammy skin, decreased mental status, and loss of consciousness. The
signs and symptoms can vary depending on the type of shock. In anaphylactic shock, the individual may also have
wheezing, stridor, or complete inability to breathe.

22.2 Cardiac Emergency Drugs

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 22.2.1 Identify the characteristics of drugs used to treat cardiac emergencies.
    · 22.2.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of drugs used to treat cardiac

        emergencies.
    · 22.2.3 Describe nursing implications of drugs used to treat cardiac emergencies.
    · 22.2.4 Explain the client education related to drugs used to treat cardiac emergencies.

The goal of treatment for a client with AMI or unstable angina is restoring the blood supply to the affected area of
the heart muscle. Drugs can help either supply more oxygen to the heart (temporarily) or reduce the heart's demand
for oxygen. If there is stenosis (narrowing) in a coronary artery, the definitive treatment is having the client undergo
stent placement or, if stenting is not an option, coronary artery bypass grafting. It is very important that this
treatment not be delayed because it can save heart tissue. Thrombolytic therapy may also be used to dissolve an
occlusive clot that is causing the coronary ischemia or infarction. Thrombolytic therapy is discussed in
Anticoagulant, Antiplatelet, and Thrombolytic Drugs.

Acute Myocardial Infarction and Unstable Angina Drugs

Four classifications of drugs may be used in emergency situations for AMI and unstable angina: aspirin, oxygen,
nitroglycerin, and, occasionally, morphine. In either AMI or unstable angina, the most important thing to consider is
blood supply to the heart. If the cardiac cells are not receiving blood, they will become ischemic and eventually will
die. Each of the medications is used to enhance oxygen-rich blood flow to the heart.

Aspirin
Salicylic acid (aspirin) has been used for mild pain relief for more than 100 years. (Pain Response Drugs discusses
aspirin as a nonopioid analgesic.) It was also found to work as an antiplatelet drug; therefore, it is useful in
suspected AMI and unstable angina. Aspirin irreversibly binds to receptors on platelets, which prevents them from
sticking to other platelets. Because platelet aggregation is the first step in blood clotting, if this can be reduced, then
the heart may receive more blood.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Aspirin can cause gastritis and bleeding in the stomach, other parts of the gastrointestinal tract, brain, and spinal
cord.

Contraindications to aspirin are allergy to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), asthma, hemophilia, and
other blood clotting disorders. Pediatric clients who have suspected viral illnesses should not take aspirin because
Reye's syndrome, a potentially fatal complication, could develop. As a precaution, aspirin is generally not used in
pediatric clients.

action, adult dosage, indications, therapeutic effects, drug and food interactions, adverse effects, and

     Nursing Implications
     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking aspirin:

     · Assess the client's allergies and verify that they are not allergic to any of the NSAIDs.
     · Assess for signs and symptoms of bleeding.
     · In the event of suspected AMI or unstable angina, direct the client to chew the aspirin and then swallow it.
     · Provide client teaching regarding the drug. See below for client teaching guidelines.

     CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

     The client taking aspirin in an emergency situation should:

         · Inform the health care team if they have an allergy to aspirin or other NSAIDs or have a diagnosis of
             asthma.

         · Chew the aspirin tablet before swallowing.

     See Anticoagulant, Antiplatelet, and Thrombolytic Drugs for full client teaching guidelines on the use of aspirin in
     nonemergency situations.

       FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

       Aspirin

       The risk of serious bleeding in the stomach, gastrointestinal tract, brain, and spinal cord is increased with aspirin
       and other NSAIDs.

       Concomitant use of aspirin greater than 100 mg per day can reduce the efficacy of ticagrelor (an antiplatelet
       medication) and should be avoided.

     Oxygen
     In an AMI or unstable angina, the cardiac cells are deprived of oxygen. When cells are deprived of oxygen, they
     eventually will die. Supplemental oxygen may be used if the client's oxygen saturation is less than 94% on room air.
     In the past, oxygen was used immediately for clients with suspected AMI or unstable angina; however, it was not
     found to be beneficial if used in clients who were already maintaining an oxygen saturation of 95% or more

22.2 · Cardiac Emergency Drugs                                                                                             627

(Hofmann et al., 2017). Oxygen is typically delivered via nasal cannula starting at 2 L/min and can be titrated to 6 L/
min. If the client requires a higher dose to maintain oxygen saturation greater than 94%, then other methods of
oxygen delivery should be used.

Nitroglycerin
Nitroglycerin is a nitrate and a first-line treatment for clients with AMI or unstable angina. Nitroglycerin is converted
to nitrous oxide, which ultimately causes smooth muscles around arteries to relax. Smooth muscle relaxation
causes vasodilation. In AMI or unstable angina, the cardiac myocytes are not receiving enough oxygen, and
vasodilation allows more oxygen to be delivered to hypoxic cells. In emergency situations, nitroglycerin is
administered either sublingually or intravenously.

Antihypertensive and Antianginal Drugs discusses nitrates more extensively.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Adverse effects include orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, paradoxical bradycardia, flushing, peripheral edema,
nausea and vomiting, headache, and blurred vision.

Contraindications include allergies to nitrates, concomitant use of phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors such as
tadalafil and sildenafil, history of right ventricular infarction, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Nitrates should be used cautiously in clients who are on chronic diuretic therapy, have low systolic blood pressure,
have autonomic nervous system dysregulation, or are pregnant or breastfeeding.

     SAFETY ALERT

 Nitroglycerin

  Nitrates can cause hypotension. In an emergency situation, make sure the client is sitting or lying down before
  administering nitroglycerin.

action, adult dosage, indications, therapeutic effects, drug and food interactions, adverse effects, and

     Nursing Implications
     Refer to Antihypertensive and Antianginal Drugs for a full list of nursing implications for clients prescribed nitrates.
     In the event of suspected AMI or unstable angina, the health care provider may order sublingual nitroglycerin until
     an IV line is in place. If the client is receiving IV nitroglycerin, the nurse will receive orders to titrate the nitroglycerin
     based on pain level and blood pressure.

     The nurse should do the following for clients who are receiving nitroglycerin intravenously for chest pain:

     · Place the client on continuous cardiac monitoring.
     · Monitor vital signs frequently, particularly blood pressure, because nitroglycerin can cause significant

        hypotension.
     · If symptomatic hypotension occurs, do not give the nitroglycerin and inform the health care provider.
     · Frequently assess pain level.
     · Assess for headache and give pain medication for it as ordered.
     · Provide client teaching regarding the drug. See below for client teaching guidelines.

     CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

     The client receiving nitroglycerin for unstable angina or AMI should:

         · Alert the nurse if any of these occur:

Morphine
Morphine is a potent, fast-acting opioid agonist. It binds to opioid receptors in the central and peripheral nervous
systems to modulate (decrease) the pain response. Morphine also can help relieve anxiety, which may lower heart
rate and reduce the heart's demand for oxygen. For many years, morphine was a first-line drug in the emergency
management of AMI and unstable angina, but now it is used if nitroglycerin cannot control the chest pain (Hermiz &
Sedhai, 2023). Pain Response Drugs covers opioid agonists in depth.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Opioids must be managed carefully due to their potential adverse effects, which include respiratory depression,
respiratory arrest, apnea, circulatory depression, shock, cardiac arrest, sedation, lightheadedness, dizziness,
nausea, vomiting, and constipation.

Opioids should not be used if the client has a known hypersensitivity to morphine, respiratory depression, acute or
severe asthma, hypercarbia, or a paralytic ileus.

     SAFETY ALERT

 Opioid Analgesics

  Morphine can cause respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, and shock. Nurses must monitor
  the client frequently (reassess at least every 5-10 minutes) when using morphine to control pain.

Dysrhythmia Drugs

There is a saying in cardiac nursing that there are only three problems with the conduction system: The heart can
beat too fast, too slow, or not at all.

This is an oversimplification, but each one of these problems can lead to hemodynamic instability and potentially
death. Once again, the importance of cardiac output cannot be emphasized enough. Cardiac output is a function of
heart rate and stroke volume. If the heart rate is too fast, then ventricular filling cannot occur, and cardiac output is
affected. If the heart rate is too slow, then not enough blood will be pumped, and cardiac output is affected. If there
is no heart rate at all, then, of course, there is no cardiac output.

The cardiac conduction system--specifically, the SA node--determines the heart rate. The SA node is influenced by
the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. As with all other tissues in the body, it must have a blood
supply, and it needs the correct amount of electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride) to function
optimally. The cardiac conduction system (see Figure 22.4) includes the SA node, the AV node, the bundle of His,
and the Purkinje fibers.

Although the main pacemaker of the heart is the SA node, other areas of the conduction system generate electrical
impulses. The SA node generates impulses at 60-100 beats/min, the AV node at 40-60 beats/min, and the
ventricles at 20-40 beats/min. Typically, the conduction system will conduct the fastest rate, which is why the
system normally follows the SA node impulses.

Cardiac conduction can be categorized by area of the heart: atrial conduction and ventricular conduction. Most
conduction problems in the atria are not life-threatening, but supraventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation with
rapid ventricular response, and sick sinus syndrome (which can cause hemodynamically unstable bradycardia) can
cause hemodynamic instability and potentially death. Ventricular dysrhythmias nearly always cause hemodynamic
instability and will lead to death if not treated rapidly. Ventricular dysrhythmias include ventricular tachycardia,
pulseless ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation.

Emergency dysrhythmias discussed in this chapter include:

    · Asystole: Complete cessation of electrical activity in the heart
    · Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: Rapid electrical stimulation and conduction that cause the

        atria to have unorganized contraction (fibrillation) and the ventricles to beat rapidly
    · Symptomatic bradycardia: Heart rate less than 60 beats per minute that negatively affects cardiac output
    · Pulseless electrical activity: Life-threatening dysrhythmia in which the electrical system conducts impulses

        but the cardiac myocytes do not respond
    · Pulseless ventricular tachycardia: Life-threatening dysrhythmia in which the ventricles contract so rapidly

        that a pulse cannot be detected
    · Supraventricular tachycardia: Rapid heart rate that originates from above the ventricles
    · Ventricular fibrillation: Life-threatening dysrhythmia originating in the ventricles in which ventricles are not
632  22 · Cardiac Emergency and Shock Drugs

        coordinated in their contraction, leading to minimal cardiac output
     · Ventricular tachycardia: Dysrhythmia that originates from the ventricles and causes them to contract rapidly;

        if it becomes fast enough, it can turn into pulseless ventricular tachycardia, which is life-threatening

     The drugs described in this section are used in emergency situations to restore hemodynamic stability and improve
     cardiac conduction. Antiarrhythmic drugs that are used long term are discussed in Antidysrhythmic Drugs.

     Adenosine
     Adenosine is a class V antidysrhythmic drug. It is used to convert supraventricular tachycardia into normal sinus
     rhythm (the regular conduction pattern of the heart). Adenosine affects how potassium and calcium move into and
     out of the myocardial conduction cells that affect the resting membrane potential, causing conduction to take
     longer. This is useful in disrupting supraventricular tachycardia and gives the heart the opportunity to restart in
     normal sinus rhythm.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Adenosine may cause flushing of the skin, palpitations, chest pain, hypotension, lightheadedness, nausea, sweating,
     nervousness, numbness, and apprehension. It decreases conduction through the AV node and may produce short-
     lasting heart block. It is important to note that the benefit of adenosine in a life-threatening event outweighs the risk
     of adverse effects.

     Contraindications to adenosine include second- or third-degree heart block (except in clients with a pacemaker),
     sinus node disease (sick sinus syndrome or symptomatic bradycardia), and known hypersensitivity to adenosine.

     Table 22.4 is a drug prototype table for adenosine use in emergency situations. It lists drug class, mechanism of
     action, adult dosage, indications, therapeutic effects, drug and food interactions, adverse effects, and

     CLINICAL TIP

 Adenosine

  Adenosine has a very short half-life and should be administered as a rapid IV bolus directly into a vein, followed
  by a rapid saline flush.

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients who are receiving adenosine intravenously:

    · Place the client on continuous cardiac monitoring.
    · Monitor vital signs frequently.
    · Administer adenosine as an IV push directly into a vein over 1-2 seconds.
    · Administer a rapid saline bolus immediately after administering adenosine.
    · Be prepared to administer a second dose.
    · If the client is alert, inform them that they may feel chest pain once the bolus is given. The chest pain should

        subside quickly (in less than 1 minute).
    · Provide client teaching regarding the drug. See below for client teaching guidelines.

  CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

  In supraventricular tachycardia, the client may not be conscious because of decreased cardiac output.

  If alert and oriented, the client receiving adenosine should:

      · Inform the health care team if they have a known heart block or sick sinus syndrome.

Amiodarone
Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic drug used for hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia,
ventricular fibrillation, and other dysrhythmias. It blocks potassium and calcium channels from opening, which
slows down cardiac conduction and therefore slows heart rate. Antidysrhythmic Drugs covers the use of amiodarone
in the management of chronic dysrhythmias.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Amiodarone can cause hypotension, bradycardia, atrioventricular block, hepatic injury, heart rhythm disturbances,
pulmonary injury, loss of vision, thyroid injury, hypersensitivity, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and photosensitivity. It is
important to note that the benefit of amiodarone in a life-threatening event outweighs the risk of adverse effects.

Contraindications to amiodarone include known hypersensitivity, cardiogenic shock, marked sinus bradycardia, and
second- or third-degree AV block (unless the client has an implanted pacemaker).

Table 22.5 is a drug prototype table for amiodarone use in emergency situations. It lists drug class, mechanism of
action, adult dosage, indications, therapeutic effects, drug and food interactions, adverse effects, and

  Amiodarone
  Amiodarone can cause pulmonary toxicity and swelling in the lungs.

Atropine
Atropine is a first-line drug used for treating symptomatic bradycardia. It is an anticholinergic drug, which means it
blocks receptors in the parasympathetic nervous system. The heart is constantly stimulated by both the
parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). It reacts to whichever system is
sending more impulses. If the PNS signals are blocked, then the heart receives fewer signals from acetylcholine, the
primary neurotransmitter of the PNS. Because of fewer signals from the PNS, the SNS signaling is stronger, which
increases the heart rate.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Atropine can cause tachycardia, acute glaucoma, pyloric obstruction, and complete urinary retention. It is important
to note that the benefit of atropine in a life-threatening event outweighs the risk of adverse effects.

There are no contraindications to the use of atropine.

Table 22.6 is a drug prototype table for atropine use in emergency situations. It lists drug class, mechanism of
action, adult dosage, indications, therapeutic effects, drug and food interactions, adverse effects, and

         · Provide client teaching regarding the drug. See below for client teaching guidelines.

       CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

       In symptomatic bradycardia, the client may not be conscious because of decreased cardiac output.

       If alert and oriented, the client receiving atropine should:

           · Inform the health care team if they feel different (better or worse) after the initial dose.
           · Inform the health care team if they feel a fast heart rate or racing heart after the dose.

     Diltiazem
     Diltiazem is a nondihydropyridine Calcium channel blocker and a class IV antiarrhythmic drug. Nondihydropyridine
     calcium channel blockers inhibit calcium flow into cardiac myocytes, which results in decreased force of
     contractions and decreased heart rate. Therefore, diltiazem is useful for treating supraventricular tachycardia and
     atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. In addition, calcium channel blockers cause vasodilation and can
     reduce blood pressure. Antihypertensive and Antianginal Drugs discusses the use of calcium channel blockers in
     hypertension.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Diltiazem can cause asystole; atrial flutter; first-, second-, and third-degree atrioventricular block; bradycardia;
     chest pain; congestive heart failure; sinus pause; sinus node dysfunction; syncope; ventricular dysrhythmia;
     ventricular fibrillation; ventricular tachycardia; dizziness; allergic reaction; Stevens-Johnson syndrome; and
     angioedema. It is important to note that the benefit of diltiazem in a life-threatening event outweighs the risk of
     adverse effects.

     Contraindications include sick sinus syndrome, unless the client has a pacemaker; second- or third-degree heart
     block, unless the client has a pacemaker; severe hypotension and/or cardiogenic shock; hypersensitivity; ventricular
     tachycardia; and AMI.

     Diltiazem should not be administered concurrently with IV beta-adrenergic blockers.

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients receiving diltiazem intravenously:

· Place the client on continuous cardiac monitoring.
· Monitor blood pressure frequently.
· Monitor level of consciousness.
· Have resuscitative equipment and drugs available.
· Provide client teaching regarding the drug. See below for client teaching guidelines.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

In supraventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, the client may not be
conscious because of decreased cardiac output.
638  22 · Cardiac Emergency and Shock Drugs

       If alert and oriented, the client receiving diltiazem should:

           · Inform the health care team if they have a known heart block or sick sinus syndrome.

       See Antidysrhythmic Drugs for client teaching guidelines for diltiazem in less acute situations.

     Epinephrine
     Epinephrine (adrenaline) is a hormone that stimulates the SNS during the fight-or-flight response. SNS stimulation
     results in a faster heart rate, increased cardiac output, and pulmonary dilation (for increased oxygen intake), among
     other things. Epinephrine is a nonselective adrenergic agonist, which means it stimulates all receptors in the SNS.
     Epinephrine is used in a variety of emergency situations. In cardiac emergencies, epinephrine is used in ventricular
     fibrillation, pulseless ventricular tachycardia, asystole, and pulseless electrical activity.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Epinephrine can cause anxiety and excitability, headache, fear, heart palpitations, tachycardia, supraventricular
     tachycardia, ventricular arrhythmias, hypertension, cerebral hemorrhage, hemiplegia, subarachnoid hemorrhage,
     anginal pain in clients with angina, pulmonary edema, hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, and lactic acidosis. It is
     important to note that the benefit of epinephrine in a life-threatening event outweighs the risk of adverse effects.

     Contraindications to epinephrine include cardiac dilation, coronary artery insufficiency, and shock during general
     anesthesia. Epinephrine contains sodium bisulfate, which may cause an allergic reaction.

The nurse should do the following for clients receiving epinephrine intravenously:

· Place the client on continuous cardiac monitoring.
· Monitor blood pressure frequently. (Often, blood pressure is measured continuously when client is in shock.)
· Monitor level of consciousness.
640  22 · Cardiac Emergency and Shock Drugs

         · Have resuscitative equipment and drugs available.
         · Provide client teaching regarding the drug. See below for client teaching guidelines.

       CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

       In ventricular fibrillation, pulseless ventricular tachycardia, asystole, or pulseless electrical activity, the client
       will be unconscious. In anaphylaxis, the client may be unconscious.

       If alert and oriented, the client receiving epinephrine should:

           · Inform the health care team if they have a change in status (better or worse) after medication
               administration.

           · Inform the health care team if they notice a change in their breathing.

     Lidocaine
     Lidocaine is classified as a local anesthetic agent, but it is also a class Ib antiarrhythmic drug used in acute
     ventricular dysrhythmias. Lidocaine blocks sodium channels, which slows the cardiac action potential and causes
     the electrical stimulation threshold to be higher. The higher stimulation threshold causes the cardiac conduction
     cells to be less likely to conduct action potentials, which ultimately treats ventricular tachyarrhythmias.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Lidocaine can cause respiratory depression and arrest, unconsciousness, convulsions, tremors, twitching, vomiting,
     blurred or double vision, drowsiness, dizziness, light-headedness, agitation, confusion, paresthesia, and dysarthria.
     It is important to note that the benefit of lidocaine in a life-threatening event outweighs the risk of adverse effects.

     Contraindications to lidocaine include a history of hypersensitivity, Stokes-Adams syndrome,
     Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, and heart block.

     Table 22.9 is a drug prototype table for lidocaine use in emergency situations. It lists drug class, mechanism of

     Procainamide
     Procainamide is a class Ia antiarrhythmic drug that binds to sodium channels, reducing the speed of conduction. It
     is used in life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Procainamide can cause hypotension, asystole, ventricular fibrillation, lupus erythematosus-like syndrome, pleural
     effusions, pericarditis, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, agranulocytosis, dizziness, weakness,
     and elevated liver enzyme levels.

     Prolonged use of procainamide often leads to a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) test; if this occurs, the
     risk-benefit ratio of procainamide use should be reassessed. It is important to note that the benefit of procainamide
     in a life-threatening event generally outweighs the risk of adverse effects.

     Contraindications to the use of procainamide include a history of hypersensitivity, complete heart block, atrial

  FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

  Procainamide
644  22 · Cardiac Emergency and Shock Drugs

       Prolonged administration of procainamide often leads to the development of a positive antinuclear antibody
       (ANA) test, with or without symptoms of a lupus erythematosus-like syndrome. If a positive ANA titer develops,
       the benefit versus risks of continued procainamide therapy should be assessed.

     Dopamine and Dobutamine
     After a cardiac event, clients often may still have hypotension or be in shock even after the immediate emergency is
     over. They may need medications to stabilize their blood pressure so that tissues are perfused. Dopamine and
     dobutamine are two drugs that help achieve and maintain hemodynamic stability.

     Dopamine
     Endogenous (naturally occurring in the body) dopamine is a hormone that plays a role in stimulating the SNS.
     Dopamine, an inotropic agent, is converted into epinephrine within the bloodstream. Dopamine binds to alpha-1,
     alpha-2, beta-1, and dopaminergic receptors. Adrenergic stimulation of alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptors causes
     vasoconstriction, which leads to increased blood pressure. Adrenergic stimulation of beta-1 receptors directly
     increases the heart rate.

     Exogenous (synthetic) dopamine mimics the body's own dopamine to the same effect. Dopamine is used in
     profound hypotension and shock to increase cardiac output by increasing the rate and force of contraction and
     blood pressure by vasoconstriction. At low doses (0.5-2 mcg/kg/min), dopamine causes vasodilation and can be
     used to increase urinary output. At intermediate doses (2-10 mcg/kg/min), it increases heart rate and stroke
     volume, which leads to increased cardiac output. At high doses, dopamine causes vasoconstriction, which increases
     blood pressure.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Dopamine can cause ventricular arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, ectopic beats, tachycardia, anginal pain, palpitations,
     cardiac conduction abnormalities, widened QRS complex, bradycardia, hypotension, hypertension, vasoconstriction,
     dyspnea, azotemia, headache, and anxiety. Extravasation of dopamine into the tissue around an IV site may cause
     necrosis, sloughing, and potentially gangrene. It is important to note that the benefit of dopamine in a life-
     threatening event outweighs the risk of adverse effects.

     Contraindications to the use of dopamine include pheochromocytoma, uncorrected tachyarrhythmias or ventricular
     fibrillation, and allergy to metabisulfite.

          SAFETY ALERT

      Dopamine

       Dopamine may cause peripheral ischemia in clients with a history of occlusive vascular disease.

       Dopamine is a potent drug. It should be administered only in an intensive care area with proper monitoring
       available.

     Table 22.11 is a drug prototype table for dopamine use in emergency situations. It lists drug class, mechanism of

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients receiving dopamine intravenously:

· Place the client on continuous cardiac monitoring.
· Monitor blood pressure frequently.
· Monitor level of consciousness.
· Have resuscitative equipment and drugs available.
· Monitor IV site for signs of extravasation.
· Monitor for signs and symptoms of occlusive vascular disease.
· Provide client teaching regarding the drug. See below for client teaching guidelines.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

In hypotension or shock, the client may be unconscious.
646  22 · Cardiac Emergency and Shock Drugs

     If the client receiving dopamine is alert and oriented, the client should:

         · Inform the health care team if they have a change in status (better or worse) after medication
             administration.

         · Inform the heath care team if they have pain at the IV site.
         · Inform the health care team if they have a headache.

       FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

       Dopamine
       Dopamine may cause peripheral ischemia in clients with a history of occlusive vascular disease.

     Dobutamine
     Dobutamine is a beta-1 adrenergic agonist that stimulates the heart to contract more forcefully and, to a lesser
     extent, faster. It is used for the cardiac decompensation that can occur immediately after a cardiac event.
     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Dobutamine can cause increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, ventricular ectopic activity, hypotension, and
     IV site reaction. It is important to note that the benefit of dobutamine in a life-threatening event outweighs the risk
     of adverse effects.
     Contraindications to the use of dobutamine include idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis and hypersensitivity
     to bisulfite. Use after AMI may be contraindicated because of increased contractility. Dobutamine may cause
     marked increase in blood pressure or heart rate. Hypovolemia must be corrected prior to initiating dobutamine.

          CLINICAL TIP

      Dobutamine

       Dobutamine should not be mixed with any other drug in the same solution because it is incompatible with many
       other drugs.

     Table 22.12 is a drug prototype table for dobutamine. It lists drug class, mechanism of action, adult dosage,
     indications, therapeutic effects, drug and food interactions, adverse effects, and contraindications.

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients receiving dobutamine intravenously:

· Place the client on continuous cardiac monitoring.
· Monitor blood pressure frequently.
· Monitor level of consciousness.
· Have resuscitative equipment and drugs available.
· Ensure that dobutamine is not mixed with any other drug in the same solution.
· Provide client teaching regarding the drug. See below for client teaching guidelines.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client receiving dobutamine should:

    · Inform the health care team if any of these occur:
          They have a change in status (better or worse) after medication administration.
          They notice chest pain; dyspnea; or numbness, tingling, or burning in their extremities.
          They have discomfort or pain at the IV site.

General Nursing Implications for Cardiac Emergencies and Anaphylaxis
In the emergency department and critical care unit, nurses are current in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR),
advanced cardiac life support (ACLS), advanced trauma life support (ATLS), and other emergency certifications.
Many nurses undergo certified emergency nurse (CEN) or certified critical care nurse (CCRN) certification. Advanced
training for cardiac and other emergencies is helpful in a fast-paced, stressful environment.

        CASE STUDY

Read the following clinical scenario to answer the questions that follow.
James Ryan is a 72-year-old client whose wife brought him to the emergency department because of chest pain and
difficulty breathing. He said he was shoveling snow from the sidewalk when he started having pain in his left arm
648  22 · Cardiac Emergency and Shock Drugs

     and chest. He also had difficulty catching his breath. After a few minutes, James went inside and sat down, but the
     pain in his arm and chest continued. He started to feel lightheaded, and even though he was sitting down, he still
     found it hard to breathe. James wanted to lie down on the couch, but his wife insisted that he go to the emergency
     department.

22.3 Shock Drugs

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 22.3.1 Identify the characteristics of drugs used to treat anaphylactic, hypovolemic, and cardiogenic
        shock.

    · 22.3.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of drugs used to treat
        anaphylactic, hypovolemic, and cardiogenic shock.

    · 22.3.3 Describe nursing implications of drugs used to treat anaphylactic, hypovolemic, and cardiogenic
        shock.

    · 22.3.4 Explain the client education related to drugs used to treat anaphylactic, hypovolemic, and
        cardiogenic shock.

Shock is a state of medical emergency in which tissues are not receiving enough oxygenated blood to sustain life. If
not treated rapidly, decreased perfusion will cause hypoxia and eventually cell and tissue death. Because many
different cells and tissues are at risk, cell and tissue death can lead to multiorgan failure and, eventually, death.

Anaphylactic Shock Drugs

Anaphylactic shock is a severe and life-threatening response to an allergen to which the body has a hypersensitivity.
Typically, systemic vasodilation occurs, which causes shock and bronchoconstriction (often severe). Drugs are used
to reverse bronchoconstriction and support hemodynamic stability.

Epinephrine
Epinephrine, a nonselective adrenergic agonist, is the most important drug used to treat anaphylactic shock. It
causes sympathetic nervous system stimulation, which dilates the pulmonary bronchioles to open up airways and
constricts blood vessels to increase blood pressure. Epinephrine acts very quickly and can decrease
bronchoconstriction within 3-5 minutes. Epinephrine can be administered intramuscularly or intravenously
depending on the acuteness of the situation. Table 22.8 earlier in the chapter is a drug prototype table for
epinephrine use in emergency situations.

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients receiving epinephrine intramuscularly or intravenously for anaphylactic
shock:

    · Place the client on continuous cardiac monitoring.
    · Assess lung sounds prior to administration and frequently after administration.
    · Monitor blood pressure frequently. (Blood pressure is often measured continuously when a client is in shock.)
    · Monitor respiratory rate frequently.
    · Monitor oxygen saturation continuously.
    · Monitor level of consciousness.
    · Have resuscitative equipment and drugs available.
    · Provide client teaching regarding the drug. See below for client teaching guidelines.

  CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

  In ventricular fibrillation, pulseless ventricular tachycardia, asystole, or pulseless electrical activity, the client
  will be unconscious. In anaphylaxis, the client may be unconscious.

  If alert and oriented, the client receiving epinephrine should:

      · Inform the health care team if they have a change in status (better or worse) after medication
          administration.

      · Inform the health care team if they notice a change in their breathing.

Albuterol
Albuterol is a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist that causes bronchiole smooth muscle dilation, which opens up the
650  22 · Cardiac Emergency and Shock Drugs

     bronchiole airways. Albuterol may be used in anaphylaxis if epinephrine does not fully open the airways. In
     anaphylaxis, it is administered as an inhaled nebulizer treatment.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Albuterol can cause paradoxical bronchospasm, tachycardia, and an immediate hypersensitivity reaction.

     Hypersensitivity is the only contraindication to albuterol.

     Table 22.14 is a drug prototype table for albuterol. It lists drug class, mechanism of action, adult dosage,
     indications, therapeutic effects, drug and food interactions, adverse effects, and contraindications.

     Nursing Implications
     The nurse should do the following for clients receiving albuterol via nebulizer for anaphylaxis:

     · Assess lung sounds prior to administration and frequently after administration.
     · Monitor blood pressure frequently. (Blood pressure is often measured continuously when a client is in shock.)
     · Monitor respiratory rate frequently.
     · Monitor oxygen saturation continuously.
     · Monitor level of consciousness.
     · Have resuscitative equipment and drugs available.
     · Provide client teaching regarding nebulizer treatment.
     · Provide client teaching regarding the drug. See below for client teaching guidelines.

     CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

     The client receiving albuterol should:

         · Hold the nebulizer mouthpiece between their teeth with their lips closed around it.
         · Hold the nebulizer in an upright position.
         · Understand that treatment often lasts 10-15 minutes.
         · Inform the health care provider of chest pain or pressure or a feeling of rapid heart rate.

     Isotonic Intravenous Solution
     Anaphylactic shock causes fluids to shift from within the blood vessels (intravascular) to the tissues (extravascular).

     Access for free at openstax.org
22.3 · Shock Drugs                                                                                                      651

This can occur very rapidly and is the primary cause of the shock. Isotonic IV solutions have the same amount of
sodium concentration as blood does.

Because fluid has shifted to the extravascular space in anaphylactic shock, there is not enough volume in the
intravascular space to maintain blood pressure and tissue perfusion. Isotonic intravenous solution will increase
volume, which then increases blood pressure.

In anaphylactic shock, 1-2 L of an isotonic IV solution such as normal saline should be administered rapidly (at the
highest flow rate possible) as soon as an IV is established. After the initial IV fluid bolus, the client may need
continuous IV fluids at a rapid rate to maintain blood pressure. Examples of isotonic IV solutions are normal saline
and lactated Ringer's.

Hypovolemic Shock Drugs

Hypovolemic shock occurs when the circulating volume of fluid has decreased so much that it affects tissue
perfusion. The first priority in hypovolemic shock is to correct the underlying cause; for example, if the hypovolemia
is caused by blood loss, measures should be taken to stop the blood loss, and the client should receive a blood
transfusion as soon as possible. Intravenous fluid resuscitation is also used to increase cardiac output and stabilize
blood pressure. The use of vasopressors (drugs that increase blood pressure) in hypovolemic shock is controversial
and will not be included in this section.

In hypovolemic shock, 2 L of an isotonic IV solution should be administered as quickly as possible. After the initial
fluid bolus, additional IV solution may be ordered to maintain blood pressure.

Cardiogenic Shock Drugs

Cardiogenic shock occurs when the myocardium is not able to pump effectively enough to maintain cardiac output.
This can be due to ischemia, infarction, or other causes. Cardiogenic shock is treated with vasopressors and SNS
stimulation. Cardiac output must be increased in order to restore adequate tissue perfusion. Medications used in
cardiogenic shock include dopamine, dobutamine, and norepinephrine. Dopamine and dobutamine are covered in a
previous section in this chapter. Norepinephrine can be used for other types of shock, but it is included here
because of its effects on the heart.

Norepinephrine
Norepinephrine is an alpha-1 receptor agonist and a moderate beta-1 receptor agonist. Alpha-1 receptors are
located in the smooth muscle around blood vessels. When these receptors are stimulated, they cause muscle
contraction, which causes vasoconstriction. Beta-1 receptors are located in the heart; when they are stimulated,
they cause increased heart rate and force of contraction.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Norepinephrine can cause cardiac arrhythmias, severe peripheral ischemia in clients who are hypovolemic,
gangrene in clients with occlusive or thrombotic vascular disease (in high doses), and rebound hypotension after
discontinuation. Norepinephrine may cause decreased sensitivity to insulin, so clients with diabetes may need their
glucose levels monitored more frequently as well as increased doses of antidiabetic medications.

Extravasation of norepinephrine at the IV site can cause tissue necrosis.

There are no contraindications for norepinephrine.

Table 22.15 is a drug prototype table for norepinephrine. It lists drug class, mechanism of action, adult dosage,
indications, therapeutic effects, drug and food interactions, adverse effects, and contraindications.

CHAPTER OUTLINE
23.1 Introduction to the Upper Respiratory System
23.2 Introduction to the Lower Respiratory System
23.3 Oxygenation and Gas Exchange
INTRODUCTION The respiratory system allows the body to breathe, talk, and smell. The respiratory system is
primarily responsible for bringing oxygen into the body and is a major pathway to remove carbon dioxide and other
waste gases. Adequate functioning of the respiratory system depends on having the nervous, cardiovascular, and
musculoskeletal systems working properly as well. This will be discussed later in the chapter.
This chapter is separated into three sections: the upper respiratory system, the lower respiratory system (see Figure
23.2), and the system of oxygenation and gas exchange. This chapter will review both the upper and lower
respiratory systems and will briefly discuss common conditions that affect the respiratory tract, oxygenation, and
gas exchange (Cleveland Clinic, 2023).

         · 23.1.2 Discuss the common conditions that affect the upper respiratory system.

     The upper respiratory system, shown in Figure 23.3, contains structures that allow us to breathe and speak, warm
     and clean the air we inhale, and trap foreign particles before air travels down to the lungs (Visible Body, 2023).

Upper Respiratory System and Function

The upper respiratory tract consists of these structures (Cleveland Clinic, 2023):

    · Nose: This is the entrance to the respiratory tract. It contains a small patch of tissue that is home to olfactory
        sensory neurons. These neurons allow for recognition of scents. The nose contains mucus and cilia. The
        mucus traps dirt and particles, and then the cilia move those particles out of the nose. The mucous
        membranes within the nose help to clean the inhaled air as well as moisten and warm it.

    · Nasal cavity: This is a space inside the nose that is divided into two nasal passages. These passages are lined
        with respiratory mucosa to clean, moisten, and warm the inspired air.

    · Sinus cavities: These are four air-filled, interconnected cavities located between the eyes and nose that
        produce and circulate mucus. They are typically empty except for a thin layer of mucus. The sinuses drain into
        the nose. They are commonly referred to as paranasal cavities.

    · Mouth: This is an opening through which food and air enter the body. Although air can enter through the
        mouth, that air is not filtered as it is when entering the nose.

    · Throat (pharynx): This carries air, food, and fluid down from the nose and mouth.
    · Voice box (larynx): This protects the lower respiratory tract from food being aspirated into the trachea while

        breathing; it also contains the vocal cords.

Air is inhaled through the nose, where it is warmed and moistened by the vascular mucosa, and foreign material is
filtered out by the mucus and hairs. This prevents foreign material from entering the lung tissue. Air can be inhaled
through the mouth, but it is not warmed, moistened, or filtered properly before it travels through the upper and
lower respiratory systems. Air from the nose then passes through the sinuses and is further filtered by the
respiratory mucosa. The respiratory mucosa consists of the columnar epithelium, which includes the goblet cells
and cilia. The mucus captures any foreign particles not cleared via the nasal passages, and the cilia sweep the
mucus up and out of the respiratory tract. Air then continues through the pharynx and the larynx and into the
trachea.

Upper Respiratory Conditions

Upper respiratory conditions usually involve an inflammatory response that can affect the mucosal layer of the
airways and can lead to various health conditions. Some of the most common upper respiratory conditions are
rhinitis, sinusitis, pharyngitis, and laryngitis. Each of these conditions can impact the ability of the airway to
transport air to and from the lungs. Breathing difficulties and other respiratory symptoms can result from any of
these conditions.

Rhinitis
Rhinitis is inflammation and swelling of the mucous membranes in the nose. It can be caused by a variety of factors
including allergens such as pollen and animal dander, smoke, temperature, viral infection, and certain drugs. The
inflammatory response that is triggered by these irritants causes the mucous membranes of the nose and pharynx
to swell and increase secretion production. The increased production of secretions that drain down the throat can
cause irritation and coughing. Common symptoms of rhinitis include:

    · Stuffy and runny nose (with clear drainage)
    · Sneezing
    · Itchy nose, throat, and eyes
    · Sore throat and coughing

Histamine is the substance in the body that produces many of these symptoms, but it is also involved in the
immune response. Therefore, it is also a causative factor in the signs and symptoms of viral rhinitis.

Rhinitis can be acute, chronic, or year-round. Acute rhinitis is usually caused by viral illness and seasonal allergies.
Rhinitis is considered chronic if it lasts longer than 4 weeks. Chronic rhinitis causes are often the same as those of
acute rhinitis. Year-round rhinitis is considered an allergic rhinitis and occurs in clients who have allergic reactions to
trees, pollen, animal dander, and other allergens.

Prevention and avoidance of triggering factors are the ideal methods for managing rhinitis, but if symptoms persist,
treatment with antihistamines, decongestants, and nasal sprays may also be used (Johns Hopkins Medicine, n.d.-b).
660  23 · Introduction to the Respiratory System

     Sinusitis
     Sinuses are air-filled pockets located near the nasal passage. Because they are hollow, sinuses help reduce the
     weight of the facial bones. They make mucus that cleans bacteria and other particles out of the air being breathed.

     Sinusitis is an infection or inflammation of the lining of the sinuses. Sinusitis can be acute, chronic, or recurring.

     Symptoms of sinusitis include:

         · Headache
         · Facial pain
         · Runny nose that lasts longer than 7-10 days
         · Cough and sore throat
         · Swelling around the eyes

     Sinusitis is treated with antibiotics, pain relievers, and nasal decongestants or drops. A referral to an allergist or
     immunologist may be needed for chronic or recurrent sinusitis (Johns Hopkins Medicine, n.d.-c).

     Pharyngitis and Laryngitis
     Pharyngitis is inflammation of the pharynx. It is more commonly known as a sore throat. A diagnosis of pharyngitis
     is nonspecific and does not convey the etiology of the illness. It is typically caused by viral or bacterial infections
     such as the common cold, influenza, or strep throat. Strep throat is an infection caused by the Streptococcus A
     group of bacteria. The first symptom of strep throat is often a sore throat. Noninfectious causes of pharyngitis
     include allergies and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

     Symptoms of pharyngitis include:

         · Sore, dry, or scratchy throat
         · Pain when swallowing or speaking

     Pharyngitis treatment is dependent on the cause and may require antibiotics, pain relievers, and increased fluids to
     treat the symptoms (Johns Hopkins Medicine, n.d.-a).

     Laryngitis is inflammation of the larynx. It will typically resolve without treatment in about a week. Symptoms
     typically begin suddenly and include hoarseness, difficulty speaking, sore throat, and irritating cough (NHS Inform,
     2023).

Lung Structure and Function

The lower respiratory tract consists of these structures:

    · Trachea (windpipe): This carries inhaled air into the lungs.
    · Lungs: These include the bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli. Air enters the lungs for oxygen and carbon dioxide

        to be exchanged.
          Bronchi: Major air passages that branch off from the trachea
          Bronchioles: The smallest airways in the lungs

The lungs are air-filled organs on either side of the thorax. The right lung consists of three lobes, and the left lung
consists of two lobes. Air travels from the larynx to the trachea, which is lined with smooth muscle and elastic
tissue. Cartilage supports the airway and prevents collapse. The air then flows into branches called bronchi. The
bronchi divide into smaller bronchioles until they become microscopic. At the end of the bronchioles are alveoli.
Alveoli are microscopic air sacs where oxygen from the air is absorbed into the blood. Carbon dioxide travels from
the blood to the alveoli so that it can be exhaled.

The function of the lungs can be assessed in a variety of ways. Assessing a client's respiratory rate can provide an
insight into proper function. A normal respiratory rate for an adult should be 12-20 breaths per minute. Pulmonary
function tests (PFTs) determine how well the lungs work. They measure how much air goes into and out of the
lungs, how much air goes from the lungs to the blood, and how well the lungs work during exercise.

  This video from Columbus Community Hospital illustrates four pulmonary function tests that a client may need to
  undergo: spirometry, maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV), diffusion capacity testing, and lung volume
  measurements. It also shows examples of each test.

Lower Respiratory Conditions

Some of the most common lower respiratory conditions are asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
662  23 · Introduction to the Respiratory System

     (COPD), which includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis.

     Asthma
     Asthma is a condition in which airways swell and become narrow. The airways may also produce extra mucus. The
     combination of these characteristics can make breathing difficult and cause coughing and wheezing (a whistling
     sound) when breathing out. Asthma often causes clients to feel short of breath. (Mayo Clinic, n.d.-a).

     Asthma symptoms can vary from person to person and in severity. Clients may present with:

         · Shortness of breath
         · Chest tightness or pain
         · Wheezing (inspiratory and expiratory)
         · Sleep problems due to the previous symptoms

     Symptoms can be worsened by respiratory viruses such as influenza. They also can be triggered by exercise,
     occupational exposure to chemicals or dust, and allergens such as pollen or mold. Asthma cannot be cured, but it
     can be treated and its symptoms controlled.

     Diagnosis of asthma is made utilizing PFTs as described previously, typically spirometry, after a client has exhibited
     symptoms.

     Preventing asthma attacks and long-term control are the main goals of treatment. Asthma is often treated with
     inhaled corticosteroid and inhaled bronchodilators. For treatment of acute asthma attacks, inhaled short-acting
     bronchodilators and anticholinergic agents such as ipratropium are often used (Mayo Clinic, n.d.-a).

       respiratory-system)
       This video from EMTPrep provides examples of breath sounds, including the wheezing that one might hear in a
       client with asthma. Along with wheezing, it includes samples of bronchial breath sounds, crackles, diminished
       breath sounds, pleural rub, stridor, and vesicular breath sounds.

     Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
     Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a group of conditions that cause the blockage of air flow and
     result in breathing issues. It includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis (discussed in the following sections). The
     main cause of COPD is tobacco smoke; other causes include air pollution, family history, and certain respiratory
     infections like pneumonia (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021).

     Emphysema
     Emphysema is characterized by shortness of breath. In clients with emphysema, the alveoli are damaged and do
     not work properly. Because of this damage, when the client exhales, old carbon dioxide-rich air becomes trapped
     and reduces room for fresh, oxygen-rich air. Emphysema is a progressive disorder. As time goes on, the inner walls
     of the alveoli become weak and rupture. This creates large air spaces in the lungs, which reduce the surface area of
     the lungs and how much oxygen reaches the bloodstream (Mayo Clinic, n.d.-b).

     Symptoms of emphysema get progressively worse and include:

         · Shortness of breath
         · Wheezing
         · Chronic cough

     Many clients do not have symptoms for years, but eventually they may notice difficulty breathing during normal
     everyday activities.

     Because smoking is the biggest risk factor for emphysema, smoking cessation is the most common preventative
     measure.

Emphysema is diagnosed through a client history, images such as x-rays, and pulmonary function tests.

Emphysema cannot be cured, but there are treatments that can decrease symptoms and slow the progression of the
disease. Bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, and, if needed, antibiotics are utilized. Many clients may need
supplemental oxygen to ensure proper blood oxygen levels (Mayo Clinic, n.d.-b).

  This video with Kristina Hamilton of the American Lung Association discusses the health benefits of smoking
  cessation. She discusses changes in health at certain time intervals when quitting and provides information on
  where to get additional information and support.

Chronic Bronchitis
Chronic bronchitis is a type of COPD characterized by inflammation and irritation of the bronchial tubes. This
causes mucus buildup and difficulty moving air into and out of the lungs.

Chronic bronchitis is usually caused by exposure to irritants over a long period. In the United States, cigarette
smoking is the main reason for this disorder (Johns Hopkins Medicine, 2019).

Symptoms of chronic bronchitis include:

    · Frequent coughing
    · Wheezing
    · Shortness of breath
    · Tightness in the chest

Although there is no cure for chronic bronchitis, it is possible to manage symptoms, slow disease progression, and
improve quality of life. Nonpharmacologic treatments include lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, increasing
physical activity, and having a healthy diet.

Pharmacological therapy often includes bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, and antibiotics if bacterial
infection is suspected (Johns Hopkins Medicine, 2019).

    · 23.3.2 Discuss the phases of gas exchange.

Two main functions of the lungs are oxygenation and gas exchange. Without these processes, the body would not
get the oxygen that tissues and organs need and would not be able to expel waste gases from the body.

Oxygenation

Oxygenation is the process of supplying oxygen to body cells. When a person breathes in, oxygen diffuses and is
picked up by the hemoglobin of the red blood cells. It is then transported and distributed to the organs and tissues
of the body. All organs and tissues rely on oxygen to function properly.

The amount of oxygen bound to hemoglobin can be measured using oxygen saturation. This describes the
percentage of hemoglobin currently bound to oxygen. Normal oxygen saturation is between 95% and 100% for a
client breathing only room air.

When the tissues and organs lack oxygen, a condition called hypoxemia can result. Hypoxemia is lower-than-normal
oxygen levels in the blood and often requires the client to receive concentrated oxygen. This condition can be fatal if
not treated (Landry, 2022).

     Gas Exchange

     Gas exchange, shown in Figure 23.5, occurs when oxygen moves from the lungs to the bloodstream. For gas
     exchange to happen, the alveoli must be ventilated, gases must be diffused, and perfusion must take place. The
     pulmonary arteries bring venous blood from the right side of the heart to be oxygenated, and the gas exchange
     occurs in the pulmonary capillaries. The pulmonary veins then return the oxygenated blood to the left side of the
     heart, which pumps it out into the systemic circulation (Landry, 2022).

     Ventilation
     Ventilation is the process of moving air into and out of the lungs. It helps ensure that oxygen-rich air is brought into
     the lungs and carbon dioxide is expelled. The ventilation process also helps to maintain blood pH in the normal
     range by regulating the amount of carbon dioxide in the body.

     Ventilation consists of inspiration and expiration. With inspiration, air flows into the body and travels through the
     respiratory system, down the airways, and into the alveoli. Upon normal expiration, the diaphragm and intercostal
     muscles relax, and air flows out of the alveoli and back through the respiratory system to the atmosphere (Landry,
     2022).

     Respiratory control is significantly influenced by chemical factors. Chemoreceptors sense changes in the levels of
     carbon dioxide, hydrogen ions, and oxygen in the blood. These receptors adjust the rate of ventilation in response to
     the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood. When carbon dioxide levels are too high, the respiratory rate increases to
     "blow off" the excess carbon dioxide. This, in turn, raises the pH level of blood because carbon dioxide is acidic. On
     the other hand, if carbon dioxide levels are too low, the respiratory rate will decrease to "hold on to" the carbon
     dioxide, thereby lowering the pH level (Landry, 2022).

     Diffusion
     Diffusion is the spontaneous movement of gases between the alveoli and capillaries in the lungs. This process does
     not require any use of energy or effort by the body. Diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide depends on the
     concentration or partial pressure of gases. The movement of gases always occurs from a high-pressure area to a
     low-pressure area. Diffusion can also be affected by the thickness of respiratory membranes and the thickness of
     the alveolar membrane (Dezube, 2023).

     Perfusion
     Perfusion is the process of blood flowing to tissues and organs, which is crucial for delivering oxygen and nutrients
     and removing waste products. Blood carries needed oxygen throughout the body, where it is used for various
     metabolic processes (Dezube, 2023).

In the lungs, perfusion takes place through the capillaries that surround the alveoli. This allows for the exchange of
oxygen and carbon dioxide between the air in the lungs and the blood in the capillaries (Landry, 2022).

Perfusion can be affected by poor circulation, which reduces the amount of oxygen that is transported to the tissues
and organs. Other factors that can affect perfusion are low circulating volume, the pumping ability of the heart, and
low blood pressure (Dezube, 2023).

Antihistamines

Histamines are chemicals in the immune system. Histamines are released by the body as part of the immune
670  24 · Upper Respiratory Disorder Drugs

     response to a foreign substance such as an allergen or pathogen. Histamine receptors are activated, and reactions
     occur. H1 receptors are found in smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and nerve endings. Activation of these
     receptors leads to various responses, including smooth muscle contraction, increased vascular permeability,
     itching, and sensory nerve stimulation. These receptors are involved in allergic reactions as well as regulating
     sleep-wake cycles and maintaining blood pressure. H2 receptors are mostly located in the stomach parietal cells,
     regulating gastric acid secretion. When these receptors are blocked, allergy symptoms can be reduced and stomach
     acid can be controlled.

     Once the immune system detects an allergen, a sequence of events is triggered to safeguard the body. Chemical
     messages are dispatched to mast cells and basophils in various body parts, signaling them to release histamines
     (see Figure 24.2). These histamines then augment blood circulation in the vicinity of the allergen, which leads to
     inflammation. To illustrate, if the nose is impacted, histamines stimulate the mucous membranes to produce
     additional mucus, resulting in nasal congestion, sneezing, and runny nose. These symptoms can typically be relieved
     using antihistamines (Fowler, 2022).

     FIGURE 24.2 Antihistamines work by blocking the action of histamine. (credit: modification of work "Antihistamine" by Phn003 at English
     Wikibooks/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

     In addition to antihistamines, decongestants are another class of drugs that are commonly used for short-term
     relief of nasal congestion, or stuffy nose. A variety of disease processes can cause congestion, including colds,
     influenza, and allergies. Decongestants come in a wide array of forms including nasal sprays, drops, inhalers, and
     oral pills. Decongestants work by narrowing blood vessels and decreasing swelling and inflammation, which allows
     for easier breathing.

     Antihistamines play a role in managing allergic reactions and mitigating the symptoms caused by histamine release
     in the body. The main method of achieving this is by competitively blocking or reducing the effects of histamine on
     target cellular receptors. Essentially, antihistamines obstruct the receptors in the brain that would typically respond
     to histamine (Johnson and Johnson, 2023). All three generations of antihistamines are beneficial for allergy relief,
     anti-inflammatory effects, respiratory symptoms relief, itch relief, and sleep. This chapter will focus on
     antihistamines as they relate to the respiratory system.

     First-Generation Antihistamines
     Antihistamines belonging to the first generation are extensively accessible and frequently used for managing allergy
     and cold symptoms. They were among the earliest antihistamines developed. These medications impact the
     histamine receptors present in the brain and spinal cord. Because they can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, they

may lead to drowsiness as a side effect. These antihistamines usually take around 30-60 minutes to take effect and
provide relief that lasts for 4-6 hours. A commonly used first-generation antihistamine is diphenhydramine (Sicari &
Zabbo, 2023). Table 24.1 lists common first-generation antihistamines and typical routes and dosing for adult
clients.

SAFETY ALERT

Antihistamines and Older Clients

First-generation antihistamines should be avoided in older clients. Their highly anticholinergic properties can
increase the risk of dementia, and clearance of the drug is reduced in clients of advanced age.
672  24 · Upper Respiratory Disorder Drugs

     Second-Generation Antihistamines
     The mechanism of action and side effects of second-generation antihistamines are distinct from those of first-
     generation antihistamines. Unlike first-generation antihistamines, which block both histaminic and muscarinic
     receptors and can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, second-generation antihistamines primarily target histamine
     receptors and do not cross the blood-brain barrier, which therefore diminishes the likelihood of central nervous
     system-related adverse effects. This distinction leads to a significantly reduced occurrence of first-generation side
     effects, especially drowsiness, in second-generation antihistamines (Naqvi & Gerriets, 2023).

     Cetirizine
     Initially, cetirizine was a prescription-only second-generation antihistamine, but it was subsequently approved as an
     over-the-counter (OTC) medication and is now readily accessible. It is a potent treatment for allergic rhinitis and
     effectively alleviates symptoms such as sneezing, watery eyes, and rhinorrhea. Additionally, cetirizine has been
     identified as a primary therapeutic option for individuals with chronic urticaria. The effectiveness of cetirizine and
     its minimal side effects make it a very popular option for clients (Naqvi & Gerriets, 2023).

     Levocetirizine
     Levocetirizine is another second-generation antihistamine that effectively treats allergic rhinitis and its associated
     symptoms. Like other second-generation antihistamines, including cetirizine, it does not penetrate the blood-brain
     barrier, resulting in a lower occurrence of side effects when compared to first-generation antihistamines (DailyMed,
     Levocetirizine, 2011).

     Loratadine
     Loratadine is also a second-generation antihistamine and is available over the counter. It is effective in pruritus,
     allergic rhinitis, and sneezing related to seasonal allergies. Loratadine should not be used if a client is pregnant or
     breastfeeding until they have consulted with their health care provider (MedlinePlus, 2022).

     Table 24.3 lists common second-generation antihistamines and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

     Drug                                   Routes and Dosage Ranges

     Cetirizine      One 10 mg tablet orally once daily. Do not take more than one 10 mg tablet daily. A 5 mg
      (Zyrtec)       product may be used for less severe symptoms and for older clients.

     Levocetirizine  One 5 mg tablet orally once daily in the evening. Do not take more than one 5 mg tablet in 24
         (Xyzal)     hours. One-half of a tablet (2.5 mg) once daily may be appropriate for less severe symptoms.

     Loratadine One 10 mg tablet orally daily, not to exceed more than 1 tablet in a 24-hour period. Also

     (Claritin)      available in chewable and dissolving tablets and oral solution.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Second-generation antihistamines have a lower incidence of adverse effects than first generation, but they can still
     cause drowsiness, sedation, dry mouth, and insomnia. Clients with hepatic or renal impairment should use second-
     generation antihistamines cautiously, and those with hypersensitivity to the medication should avoid use.

Third-Generation Antihistamines
The latest type of antihistamines, known as third-generation antihistamines, are among the newest antihistamines
available. They were designed to effectively treat the same conditions as previous antihistamines but without the
potential risk of cardiac toxicity that was observed in clients with metabolic issues. This new generation offers a
safer alternative for such individuals, and as with the second generation, the likelihood of experiencing negative side
effects is decreased. The reduced incidence of side effects is related to the inability of third-generation
antihistamines to cross the blood-brain barrier and affect the central nervous system. Second- and third-generation
antihistamines are favored compared to the first generation due to their effectiveness and safety profile (Ricciardi et
al., 2019).

Fexofenadine is a recently developed third-generation antihistamine (Sakur et al., 2022) for managing allergic
rhinitis and chronic urticaria, and it has been approved for use by individuals of all ages, including children.
Compared to other antihistamines, fexofenadine has demonstrated greater efficacy in relieving eye and nasal
congestion symptoms. Clients who are pregnant or breastfeeding should seek advice from their health care provider
before taking this medication because it can decrease breast milk production. It is not usually prescribed during
pregnancy. Fexofenadine can cause headaches and dizziness (NHS, 2021).

Desloratadine, an active metabolite of the second-generation antihistamine loratadine, is a highly selective
medication that is considerably more powerful than loratadine in treating allergy symptoms and urticaria (DailyMed,
Loratadine, 2009).

Table 24.5 lists common third-generation antihistamines and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

Drug                                              Routes and Dosage Ranges

     SAFETY ALERT

     Antihistamines

     Ingesting antihistamines in doses exceeding the recommended amount, particularly diphenhydramine, may
     result in severe heart complications, seizures, unconsciousness, or even fatality. Clients should avoid combining
     antihistamines with substances that are also sedating (sedatives, alcohol, etc.).

        CLINICAL TIP

     Antihistamine Education

     When educating clients on the use of antihistamines, the nurse should tell them to call the health care provider if
     their symptoms last for more than 1 week, worsen, or are accompanied by other symptoms such as a headache
     that will not go away, a fever, or a rash. These may indicate a more serious medical condition.

  SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

  Antihistamines

  Antihistamines can cause marked drowsiness and should be avoided when driving or operating machinery.

  Alcohol and other CNS depressants can increase drowsiness and should be avoided when taking antihistamines.

  Clients also should tell their health care provider if they are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are
  breastfeeding.

Decongestants

Decongestants refer to medications that offer temporary relief for a blocked nose or nasal congestion. They can
alleviate the stuffiness commonly associated with allergies, sinusitis, colds, and the flu. These medications function
by diminishing the inflammation of the blood vessels in the nose, resulting in opening of the air passage. Two types
of decongestants are systemic decongestants and topical, or nasal, decongestants (Corren, 2017).

Nasal Decongestants
Nasal decongestants are typically available as drops or sprays applied directly to the nasal passage. These remedies
are regarded as topical agents and do not have any widespread impacts on the body. They are usually favored over
oral drugs since they deliver prompt relief from nasal congestion. Nasal decongestants should be used for 3 days or
less, as rebound congestion can occur. Rebound congestion is worsened congestion after the medication wears off.

Oxymetazoline
Oxymetazoline is a nasal spray that helps alleviate nasal congestion induced by allergies and colds. It may also
relieve sinus pressure and congestion. Despite its convenience, this medication should be used only briefly.
Overuse, beyond 3 days, can result in rebound congestion, where inflammation of the nasal mucosa occurs due to
excessive use of nasal drops or sprays. Oxymetazoline is considered a local decongestant because it acts on the
nasal tissue by narrowing the blood vessels and opening the air passages to allow for ease of breathing, producing
no systemic effects. The lack of systemic effects can be beneficial to clients with hypertension or other cardiac
disorders.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Rebound congestion can occur if used for more than 3 days. Some clients may experience temporary discomfort
such as burning when used. Those who are hypersensitive should avoid their use.

Table 24.7 is a drug prototype table for the nasal decongestant oxymetazoline. It lists drug class, mechanism of
action, adult dosage, indications, therapeutic effects, drug and food interactions, adverse effects, and
contraindications.

     Systemic Decongestants
     Systemic decongestants act by causing vasoconstriction of the nasal mucosa, relieving nasal congestion. Unlike
     topical nasal decongestants, systemic decongestants can cause more side effects. Nervousness, heart palpitations,
     insomnia, and tachycardia can be seen. Systemic decongestants act on alpha-adrenergic receptors in the blood
     vessel walls and can cause an increase in blood pressure and affect the cardiovascular system. Clients with cardiac
     issues should use systemic decongestants with caution because they can also increase blood pressure.

     Pseudoephedrine
     Pseudoephedrine is a systemic decongestant used to relieve nasal congestion. Pseudoephedrine can be purchased
     over the counter; however, it is highly regulated due to the use of some components of the drug to make
     methamphetamine. The drug typically must be requested from the pharmacist, but specific regulations may vary by
     state (American Addiction Centers, 2023). Clients should avoid caffeine when taking this drug, and those with blood
     pressure issues should discuss use of this medication with their health care provider. Pseudoephedrine is often
     found in combination with other medications. Clients should check labels carefully to avoid taking too much of the
     same medication (MedlinePlus, 2018).

     Phenylephrine
     Phenylephrine is another common nasal decongestant. This drug is an alpha-adrenergic agonist. It can be
     administered via tablet, liquid, or dissolving strip. It works as other decongestants do by reducing the swelling of the
     blood vessels in the nose. As with pseudoephedrine, those with blood pressure issues should consult with their
     health care provider before taking this medication because it can cause an increase in blood pressure.

     Table 24.8 lists common systemic decongestants and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

     Drug                                               Routes and Dosage Ranges

       SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

       Decongestants

       Decongestants and nasal drops should be used per the label instructions and not more to avoid rebound
       congestion.

       Decongestants are not safe for children under age 6.

       Clients should increase fluid intake when taking any cold medication, including decongestants.

       (Source: MyHealth.Alberta.ca Network, 2022)

     Nursing Implications
     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking antihistamines or decongestants:

         · Prior to administering, assess the client's medical history, current drug list, and allergies for potential
             interactions and contraindications.

         · Educate the client on adverse effects of antihistamines including drowsiness, dizziness, and dry mouth.
         · Educate the client on adverse effects of decongestants including nervousness, dizziness, and rebound

             congestion (nasal sprays).
         · Monitor vital signs for hypotension and respiratory depression (antihistamines) and hypertension and irregular

             heart rhythms (decongestants).
         · Monitor urinary input and output for urinary retention.
         · Initiate fall precautions for older clients due to the adverse effects of hypotension, dizziness, and drowsiness

             (antihistamines).
         · Provide oral care and lozenges or saliva substitute for dry mouth (antihistamines).
         · Instruct the client on administration technique for nasal decongestant spray.
         · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

             teaching guidelines.

       CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

       The client taking an antihistamine should:

           · Check with their health care provider before taking if they have glaucoma, peptic ulcer disease, or urinary
               retention or are pregnant.

           · Take antihistamines only as prescribed, not exceeding the recommended amount.
           · Use sugarless candies or lozenges if dry mouth is experienced.

       The client taking an antihistamine should not:

           · Drive a car, operate machinery, or perform other tasks that require alertness when taking first-generation
               antihistamines due to their causing drowsiness and/or dizziness.

           · Take more than one antihistamine at a time. Often OTC drugs contain a combination of drugs that may
               contain antihistamines.

       The client taking a decongestant should:

           · Take the drug as directed.
           · Report any adverse effects or symptoms not relieved within 1 week.
           · Be sure to take in fluids and maintain hydration.
           · Use a humidifier to prevent drying of the nasal passages.
           · Avoid exposure to triggers that may cause congestion.

       The client taking a decongestant should not:

           · Use nasal sprays for more than 3 days.

    · 24.2.3 Describe nursing implications of antitussive drugs used to treat respiratory disorders.
    · 24.2.4 Explain the client education related to antitussive drugs used to treat respiratory disorders.

Opioid Antitussives

Antitussives are drugs that are used to treat nonproductive coughs. They are more commonly referred to as cough
suppressants. Although their exact mechanism of action is unknown, it is thought that these medications inhibit the
cough center in the brain or soothe nerve receptors around airways to reduce transmission of cough signals to the
brain. Antitussives are not recommended for productive coughs where the client is coughing up mucus due to the
infection risk that can result from the buildup of mucus in the respiratory system. Many antitussives are available
over the counter, but there are a few that are prescription only (Sison, 2022).

Opioid antitussives are very effective and are thought to act centrally in the brain stem as well as on sensory nerve
endings in the airways. The main concern with opioid antitussives is the potential for dependence, respiratory
depression, and gastrointestinal issues such as constipation. Due to the opioid component, addiction is a concern,
as is overdose of the drug.

Codeine/Guaifenesin
Codeine/guaifenesin is an opioid drug that is very effective as an antitussive, or cough suppressant. The drug works
by suppressing the cough reflex through direct action on the cough center in the medulla. Because it contains
codeine, which is an opioid, there is concern about adverse effects such as respiratory depression and dependence
(MedlinePlus, 2023).

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Opioid antitussives can cause drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, and hypotension. Dependence is also a concern due
to the opioid portion. Those who are hypersensitive to them should avoid their use. Clients with angle-closure
glaucoma, pyloric stenosis, peptic ulcer disease, and prostatic hyperplasia should also avoid opioid antitussives.

Table 24.10 is a drug prototype table for opioid antitussives featuring codeine/guaifenesin. It lists drug class,

     Nonopioid Antitussives

     Nonopioid antitussives are antitussives that do not contain an opioid component. Because of the lack of an opioid,
     there are no opioid-related side effects. These drugs work by numbing the throat and suppressing the cough.
     Drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and trouble sleeping are common side effects of these drugs.

     Benzonatate
     Benzonatate is a nonopioid antitussive that works by reducing the cough reflex in the airways and lungs. The drug
     comes as a capsule, taken orally. Clients should discuss with their health care provider any medications they are
     currently taking and inform the provider immediately if they experience rash, itching, or confusion because these are
     adverse effects (MedlinePlus, 2017).

     Dextromethorphan
     Dextromethorphan acts to suppress cough by acting on the cough center in the medulla. This drug is a common
     choice for relief of cough because it does not cause addiction and has little to no CNS depression. Clients should
     inform their health care provider if their cough lasts longer than 1 week or is accompanied by other symptoms such
     as fever or rash.

     Table 24.11 lists common nonopioid antitussives and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

Cough Reflex and Antitussives

Access multimedia content (https://openstax.org/books/pharmacology/pages/24-2-antitussives)
This video discusses the cough reflex and how antitussives work to suppress cough.

   SAFETY ALERT

Antitussives and Older Adults

Opioid antitussive doses may need to be reduced in older adults. Older adults are more sensitive to opioids and
more likely to have adverse reactions.

   CLINICAL TIP

Antitussive Education

When educating clients on use of antitussives, the nurse should tell them to call their health care provider if their
cough last for more than 1 week, worsens, or is accompanied by other symptoms such as a headache that will
not go away, a fever, or a rash. These may indicate a more serious medical condition.
682  24 · Upper Respiratory Disorder Drugs

       SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

       Antitussives

       Opioid antitussives can cause respiratory depression. Respirations should be monitored closely.

       Antitussives can cause drowsiness, and clients should avoid driving until they know how the drug will affect
       them.

       Antitussives should not be taken longer than recommended to prevent serious adverse effects.

       (Source: Nurselabs, 2023)

     Nursing Implications
     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking antitussives:

         · Prior to administering, assess the client's medical history, current drug list, and allergies for potential
             interactions and contraindications.

         · Prior to administering, assess the client's respiratory status for signs of respiratory distress that indicate
             additional evaluation and treatment is indicated.

         · Assess and monitor the client's cough including type and frequency.
         · Educate the client on adverse effects of antitussives including drowsiness, dizziness, constipation (opioid

             antitussives), and nausea and vomiting (nonopioid antitussives).
         · For clients taking opioid antitussives, monitor vital signs for hypotension and respiratory depression before

             and after administration.
         · For clients taking opioid antitussives, monitor for misuse or abuse.
         · For clients taking opioid antitussives, the nurse should instruct the client on how to maintain healthy bowel

             habits to avoid constipation.
         · Initiate fall precautions for older clients due to the adverse effects of hypotension, dizziness, and drowsiness

             (opioid antitussives).
         · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

             teaching guidelines.

       CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

       The client taking an antitussive should:

           · Take the medication as prescribed and should not exceed recommended doses.
           · Report a cough that lasts longer than 1 week or is accompanied by other symptoms.
           · Report symptoms of respiratory depression.
           · Take measures to prevent constipation.
           · Keep all antitussives out of the reach of children.
           · Avoid irritants, such as smoking, that can cause more coughing.
           · Increase fluid intake to help loosen secretions.

        disorders.

Expectorants

Expectorants are a class of drugs that help to clear mucus from the airways when coughing. Expectorants can be
stand-alone drugs or can be a part of combination cold and flu preparations. Expectorants do not suppress the
cough like antitussives do, so they should only be used with productive coughs when it is necessary to loosen and
clear mucus. Expectorants work by lubricating the airways, stimulating the cough reflex, and decreasing mucus
viscosity so that it is easier to expel (Cleveland Clinic, 2021).

Guaifenesin
Guaifenesin is a common expectorant and is available over the counter without a prescription. It increases
production of respiratory tract fluids to help liquefy mucus and make it easier to expel.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Guaifenesin does not cause many adverse effects, but dizziness, headache, nausea, and vomiting may occur.

Table 24.13 is a drug prototype table for expectorants featuring guaifenesin. It lists drug class, mechanism of
action, adult and pediatric dosage, indications, therapeutic effects, drug and food interactions, adverse effects, and

Mucolytics

Mucolytics also help clients to clear mucus from the airway. They differ from expectorants in that they are used to
help high-risk respiratory clients cough up thick, tenacious mucus. Mucolytics directly break down the structure of
mucus by breaking its protein bonds, helping to reduce the thickness and stickiness of mucus. Clients with
684  24 · Upper Respiratory Disorder Drugs

     tracheostomies often benefit from mucolytics. Mucolytics are also sometimes used to clear the airway in
     preparation for a bronchoscopy.

     Acetylcysteine
     Acetylcysteine is used to help clients clear thick, tenacious mucus from the airways. It is often used in clients with
     pneumonia, bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, and emphysema. It can also be used prior to bronchial studies, such as
     bronchoscopy, to help clear the airway and is also used as routine tracheostomy care. To manage respiratory
     symptoms, the medication is inhaled. Acetylcysteine is also administered orally or intravenously as the antidote for
     acetaminophen toxicity.

     Side effects include tachycardia, nausea, and vomiting. Acetylcysteine is contraindicated in clients with
     hypersensitivity to it or those with peptic ulcer disease.

     Dornase Alfa
     Dornase alfa is another mucolytic used most often to lower the number of lung infections and help lung function in
     cystic fibrosis. Dornase alfa acts like an enzyme naturally found in the lungs to help thin out thick, sticky mucus.
     Removing mucus in these clients helps to reduce the number of infections that they may have by reducing the
     potential breeding ground for bacteria.

     Dornase alfa can cause voice changes, hoarseness, and sore throat. It is contraindicated in those with
     hypersensitivity to the drug or to Chinese hamster ovary cell products used in the pharmaceutical industry.

     Table 24.14 lists common mucolytics and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

INTRODUCTION The lower respiratory system (shown in Figure 25.2) plays a crucial role in respiration, allowing
the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the body and the external environment. The lower respiratory
system includes the trachea, the lungs, and within the lungs, the bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli. See Introduction
to the Respiratory System for more information on the lower and upper respiratory systems. Various respiratory
diseases and disorders can significantly affect the functioning of the lower respiratory system, leading to respiratory
distress, impaired lung function, and reduced quality of life. Lower respiratory drugs are a class of medications
designed to alleviate symptoms, manage chronic conditions, and improve overall respiratory function.
Respiratory diseases affecting the lower respiratory system can be broadly classified into two categories:
obstructive and restrictive lung diseases. Obstructive lung diseases, such as asthma and Chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), are characterized by airflow limitation due to inflammation, bronchoconstriction, and
increased mucus production. Asthma affects the lungs, causing repeated episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, and
coughing. COPD is a group of diseases including emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Emphysema damages the
airways and causes chronic inflammation in the lungs. This makes it very difficult for the person to breathe. Chronic
bronchitis is a productive cough of more than 3 months, specifically within a span of 2 years (Widysanto & Mathew,
2022).
Restrictive lung diseases, such as pulmonary fibrosis, involve a reduced lung capacity due to impaired lung tissue
expansion or chest wall abnormalities (Martinez-Pitre et al., 2023).
Lower respiratory drugs encompass a wide range of pharmacological agents, each targeting specific mechanisms

     involved in respiratory diseases. These drugs can be administered via various routes, including inhalation, oral
     ingestion, and intravenous infusion, depending on the medication's characteristics and the severity of the
     respiratory condition.

             respiratory disorders.

     Adrenergics

     Adrenergic drugs, also known as sympathomimetic drugs, are a class of medications that that bind to adrenergic
     receptors throughout the body. These receptors are stimulated by the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and
     epinephrine, also known as adrenaline. Adrenergic drugs mimic the effects of these neurotransmitters or enhance
     their activity, resulting in a wide range of physiological responses. These medications can act on different types of
     adrenergic receptors, including alpha-adrenergic receptors and beta-adrenergic receptors, producing diverse effects
     on various organ systems. Adrenergic drugs are used to manage several conditions, such as asthma, and they play a
     crucial role in bronchodilation (Farzam et al., 2022).

     Beta Adrenergics
     Beta-adrenergic drugs target beta-adrenergic receptors in the sympathetic nervous system. These receptors are
     found in various tissues, including the heart, lungs, and smooth muscles, and lead to smooth muscle relaxation.

     One type of beta-adrenergic receptor, beta 2, is predominantly found in the smooth muscles of the lungs,
     bronchioles, and blood vessels. Stimulating these receptors leads to bronchodilation and vasodilation. Medications
     like albuterol, levalbuterol, and salmeterol are frequently used in the treatment of respiratory conditions, such as

                                                                            25.1 · Adrenergics and Anticholinergics       691

asthma and COPD, that cause bronchoconstriction.

Albuterol is a short-acting beta-2 adrenergic agonist and is primarily used to treat and manage respiratory
conditions such as asthma, COPD, and exercise-induced bronchospasm. Albuterol works by engaging or stimulating
the beta-2 adrenergic receptors, relaxing the smooth muscles in the airways and leading to bronchodilation and
improved airflow. Albuterol is often used as a rescue medication for acute asthma attacks and as maintenance
therapy for COPD (Hsu & Bajaj, 2023).

Levalbuterol and salmeterol are also beta-adrenergic agonists and are used to treat asthma and COPD. Levalbuterol
is a short-acting beta-2 agonist, and salmeterol is a long-acting beta-2 agonist. Salmeterol is used as a maintenance
therapy to prevent asthma and should not be used for immediate relief of an asthma attack, whereas levalbuterol is
used similarly to albuterol.

Table 25.1 lists common beta adrenergics used for lower respiratory system disorders and typical routes and dosing
for adult and pediatric clients.

     Alpha- and Beta-Adrenergic Agonists
     Alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists stimulate both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors. Alpha-adrenergic
     receptors are found primarily in smooth muscles, regulating vasoconstriction and blood pressure. Beta-adrenergic
     receptors are present in the heart, lungs, and other tissues and control heart rate, bronchodilation, and metabolic
     processes.

     Ephedrine, a sympathomimetic drug, acts as a nonselective alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonist, meaning it
     stimulates both types of receptors. The ability of ephedrine to activate both receptor types makes it a widely used
     drug for conditions such as asthma and nasal congestion as well as low blood pressure. However, its usage requires
     caution due to potential side effects and interactions with other medications (Drugbank Online, 2023).

     Epinephrine is used often as an emergency treatment for allergic reactions and respiratory distress including
     anaphylaxis. It works by relaxing and opening air passages to allow for easier breathing. It can be given as an oral
     inhalation, intravenously, subcutaneously, and as an intramuscular injection (Dalal & Grujic, 2023). Epinephrine can
     cause anxiety, tremors, palpitations, nausea, and headache.

     Anticholinergics

     Anticholinergic drugs block the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors, which are found in numerous
     organs and tissues throughout the body. They produce a range of effects such as relaxation of smooth muscles,
     reduction in secretions, and inhibition of parasympathetic responses. These medications are useful in the treatment
     of various conditions, including respiratory disorders, overactive bladder, gastrointestinal disorders, and certain
     neurological conditions.

     SAFETY ALERT

     Side Effects of Anticholinergics

     Anticholinergics should be used with caution due to potential side effects, especially in older adults, who may be
     more susceptible to adverse reactions like cognitive impairment and increased risk of falls.

     Two commonly used respiratory anticholinergics are ipratropium bromide and tiotropium. Ipratropium bromide,
     often administered via inhalation, acts as a bronchodilator by blocking the action of acetylcholine at the muscarinic
     receptors in the airways. This helps to relax the smooth muscles and widen the air passages, providing relief from
     symptoms such as wheezing and shortness of breath in conditions like asthma and COPD.

     Tiotropium, also an inhalation medication, is a long-acting anticholinergic that provides sustained bronchodilation
     by binding specifically to the muscarinic receptors in the airways. It is primarily used for the long-term maintenance
     treatment of COPD to reduce symptoms and improve lung function.

     Table 25.5 lists common anticholinergics used for lower respiratory system disorders and typical routes and dosing
     for adult clients.

This educational video with animation discusses the different types of adrenergic receptors and the different
types of drugs that act on them.

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking adrenergic or anticholinergic drugs:

    · Prior to administering, assess the client's medical history, current drug list, and allergies.
    · Assess the client's baseline respiratory function.
    · Ensure the drug is prepared appropriately using aseptic technique, and verify dosage prior to administration.
    · Monitor the client's response to the drug, including any changes in breathing effort, rate, and oxygen

    · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

        teaching guidelines.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking an adrenergic or anticholinergic drug should:

    · Take the drug as prescribed without skipping doses or stopping therapy.
    · Prime the inhaler prior to use by shaking it and spraying into the air for a total of 4 sprays. Clean it after

        use by rinsing it with water and allowing it to dry.
696  25 · Lower Respiratory Disorder Drugs

         · Wait at least 15 seconds between inhalations if more than one is required.
         · Inform the health care provider of worsening symptoms including shortness of breath, cough, chest

             tightness, and wheezing.
         · Create an asthma action plan. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America provides an example

             (https://openstax.org/r/aafa).

     The client taking an adrenergic or anticholinergic drug should not:

         · Use more medication than was prescribed by the health care provider.
         · Wash or place a powder inhaler in water.

25.2 Corticosteroids

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 25.2.1 Identify the characteristics of corticosteroid drugs used to treat respiratory disorders.
    · 25.2.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of corticosteroid drugs used to

        treat respiratory disorders.
    · 25.2.3 Describe nursing implications of corticosteroid drugs used to treat respiratory disorders.
    · 25.2.4 Explain the client education related to corticosteroid drugs used to treat respiratory disorders.

Corticosteroids, specifically inhaled corticosteroids (ICs), play a vital role in the management of respiratory
conditions such as asthma and COPD. These medications are designed to reduce inflammation and suppress the
immune response in the airways (see Figure 25.3) (Cleveland Clinic, 2023a). By targeting the underlying
inflammation, corticosteroids help to control symptoms, prevent exacerbations, and improve lung function. Inhaled
corticosteroids are typically administered through inhalation devices directly into the lungs, allowing for targeted
delivery to the respiratory system while minimizing systemic side effects. They are considered a cornerstone of
long-term respiratory treatment, often used in combination with other bronchodilators for optimal control (Williams,
2018).

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications

     Side effects of corticosteroid drugs include candidiasis (an oral fungal infection), hoarseness, cough, and increased
     susceptibility to infection. Clients should not stop corticosteroids abruptly because adrenal insufficiency may
     occur. Those with hypersensitivity to the drug, systemic fungal infections, and recent live vaccines should not use
     corticosteroids. Corticosteroids can affect potassium levels and sleep patterns, so both should be monitored during
     treatment. Corticosteroids can also cause weight gain, so weight should be monitored. Corticosteroids can modulate
     the immune system, so clients should be educated on signs and symptoms of infection to report (Cleveland Clinic,
     2023a).

Nursing Implications

The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking corticosteroid drugs:

· Assess for hypersensitivity.
· Monitor blood pressure, sleep patterns, and potassium levels.
· Weigh client regularly and report weight gain.
· Monitor glucose levels in clients with diabetes.
· Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection.
· Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

   teaching guidelines.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking a corticosteroid should:

    · Take the drug as prescribed without skipping doses or stopping therapy.
    · Take oral corticosteroids with food to avoid gastrointestinal (GI) upset.
    · Rinse mouth out after inhalation corticosteroids to reduce risk of candidiasis (thrush).
    · Report all adverse reactions including weight gain, GI upset, sleep disturbances, and mood disturbances.
    · Report any signs of infection such as fever or sore throat.
    · Weigh themselves daily. Report a weight gain of more than 2-3 pounds over 24 hours or 5 pounds in a

        week.
700  25 · Lower Respiratory Disorder Drugs

         · Monitor glucose carefully (if they have diabetes).
         · Wear a medical ID bracelet indicating use of corticosteroids.

     The client taking a corticosteroid should not:

         · Stop taking the drug abruptly because this can lead to adrenal insufficiency. Drug will need to be reduced
             gradually, especially after long-term therapy.

             UNFOLDING CASE STUDY

     Part B

     Read the following clinical scenario to answer the questions that follow. This case study is a follow-up to Case Study
     Part A.

     Harold Watson's health care provider calls him at home to discuss the results of his x-ray. The provider confirms the
     diagnosis of COPD and discusses a treatment plan with Harold. Part of the plan is a prescription for a
     beclomethasone inhaler.

         3. Harold asks the provider how beclomethasone will help his COPD. Which response by the provider is
             accurate?
                a. "It will reduce the inflammation in your airways."
                b. "This medication should be used only when you have trouble breathing."
                c. "You can stop using this medication when you feel better."
                d. "This medication will reverse the damage to your lungs."

         4. The provider educates Harold to rinse his mouth after using the inhaler. Why does he need to rinse his mouth?
                a. To help avoid allergic reaction
                b. To get rid of the taste
                c. To help the medication absorb
                d. To help prevent candidiasis

         · 25.3.4 Explain the client education related to xanthines, leukotriene modifiers, and mast cell stabilizers
             used to treat respiratory disorders.

     Xanthines

     Xanthines are a class of drugs that have been used for many years to manage respiratory conditions, particularly
     asthma and COPD. Xanthines work by relaxing the smooth muscles in the airways, which helps to open the bronchial
     passages and improve breathing. They also have some anti-inflammatory effects and can enhance the contractility
     of the diaphragm.

     The primary xanthine medication used in clinical practice is theophylline. Aminophylline is another xanthine that can
     be used to treat asthma and COPD; however, it has a very narrow therapeutic index and even with regular monitoring
     can lead to adverse effects.

     Theophylline is typically administered orally or intravenously (Khan, 2021). It has a narrow therapeutic window,

requiring careful monitoring of blood levels to ensure efficacy and prevent toxicity. The therapeutic serum levels of
theophylline are 10-20 mcg/mL. Doses should be adjusted so that levels are maintained at the lowest level within
this range that produces a symptomatic response (DailyMed, Theophylline, 2023). Clients with theophylline toxicity
may present with abdominal pain, blurred vision, confusion, nausea, and vomiting. Although the use of xanthines
has decreased with the advent of newer medications, they still play a role in certain situations and can be a valuable
option for clients who do not respond well to other treatments. Clients taking theophylline should avoid other CNS
stimulants such as caffeine (Cunha, 2021).

Table 25.10 lists common xanthines used for lower respiratory system disorders and typical routes and dosing for
adult clients.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Close monitoring and individualized dosing are essential when utilizing xanthines in respiratory therapy. Xanthines
can have a variety of potential adverse effects, including nausea, vomiting, restlessness, nervousness, increased
heart rate, and tremors. The number of adverse effects is partly why xanthines are not as widely used as they
formerly were. Clients with hypersensitivity, seizure disorder, hyperthyroidism, and severe cardiac arrhythmias
should not use xanthines (Khan, 2021).

     Leukotriene Modifiers

     Leukotriene modifiers, also known as leukotriene receptor antagonists or leukotriene inhibitors, are a class of
     medications used to manage various inflammatory conditions, particularly asthma. These medications target
     leukotrienes, which are inflammatory substances produced in the body in response to certain triggers. By blocking
     the effects of leukotrienes, leukotriene modifiers help to reduce inflammation, bronchoconstriction, and mucus
     production in the airways. This can lead to improved asthma control, decreased frequency of asthma symptoms,
     and reduced need for rescue medications.

     Leukotriene modifiers, such as montelukast, zafirlukast, and zileuton, are typically administered orally and are often

used as adjunctive therapy in combination with other asthma medications. Montelukast is taken at night due to its
short half-life and to ensure peak drug levels with symptom onset (Cleveland Clinic, 2023b).

     Mast Cell Stabilizers

     Mast cell stabilizers are medications used to manage allergic conditions such as asthma and allergic rhinitis. These
     medications work by preventing the release of inflammatory substances, particularly histamine, from mast cells.
     Histamine is a key mediator of allergic reactions and is responsible for the symptoms of itching, sneezing, wheezing,
     and swelling. By stabilizing mast cells, mast cell stabilizers help to inhibit the release of histamine and other
     inflammatory mediators, thereby reducing the allergic response.

     Cromolyn sodium is one of the commonly used mast cell stabilizers. It is available as an inhaler for asthma and is
     most effective when used prophylactically, before exposure to triggers, because it does not provide immediate relief
     of symptoms (Science Direct, 2019).

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Mast cell stabilizers are generally well tolerated, with minimal systemic absorption and few side effects. Side effects
     that may occur include coughing, sneezing, nausea, wheezing, and nasal congestion. Clients with a hypersensitivity
     to the drug should not take cromolyn (DailyMed, Cromolyn sodium, 2022).

INTRODUCTION The endocrine system serves as a crucial communication network within the body, regulating
important functions such as growth and development, reproduction, energy use, and electrolyte balance. The
endocrine system closely interacts with the nervous system to maintain homeostasis and ensure adequate
responses to various stressors. This chapter will cover the pharmacologic agents utilized for managing endocrine
disorders affecting the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and adrenal cortex.

Introduction to the Hypothalamus

The hypothalamus is critical to coordinating both nervous and endocrine responses to internal and external stimuli,
making it a crucial component of the neuroendocrine system, which is central to regulatory function, as can be
seen in Figure 26.2. This section will delve into the intricacies of the hypothalamus by exploring its functions and the

     Hypothalamus Function
     The hypothalamus gland is located at the base of the forebrain--above the pituitary gland--and serves as a critical
     regulatory center in the body, responsible for coordinating both nervous and endocrine functions. The hypothalamus
     controls a range of essential physiological processes, including body temperature, hunger and thirst, water and
     electrolyte balance, blood pressure, heart rate, sleep and wake cycles, and reproductive behaviors. Additionally, the
     hypothalamus plays a crucial role in regulating the release of hormones from the pituitary gland, which controls
     many endocrine functions throughout the body.

     Hypothalamus Hormones
     The hypothalamus produces and releases several hormones, which play important roles in regulating various
     physiological processes in the body (Shahid et al., 2022). Some of the major hypothalamus hormones are included
     in Table 26.1. These hormones are released into the bloodstream and travel to their target organs or glands, where
     they stimulate or inhibit the release of other hormones or regulate various physiological processes.

Introduction to the Pituitary Gland

The pituitary gland (see Figure 26.3), or pituitary, is a small, pea-sized gland that is a vital part of the endocrine
system, regulating various physiological functions in the body. The pituitary, also known as the hypophysis, is
located at the base of the brain and is often referred to as the "master gland" because it controls the secretion of
hormones by many other glands. The pituitary is divided into two parts, the anterior pituitary and the posterior
pituitary, each with unique functions and hormone secretions (Alatzoglou et al., 2020).

FIGURE 26.3 The pituitary gland sits at the base of the brain and is considered the "master gland" because of its hormone regulatory
actions. (credit: modification of work from Anatomy and Physiology 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0
license)

The anterior pituitary, also known as the adenohypophysis, is the front part of the pituitary. The adenohypophysis is
composed of different types of cells that secrete various hormones (see the following section). The anterior pituitary
hormones play essential roles in regulating growth and development, metabolism, reproduction, and stress
response (Alatzoglou et al., 2020).

The posterior pituitary, also known as the neurohypophysis, is the back part of the pituitary. Unlike the anterior
pituitary, it does not synthesize its own hormones, but stores and releases two hormones produced by the
hypothalamus: oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as human vasopressin. Oxytocin is involved
in the contraction of the uterus during childbirth and breast milk ejection during breastfeeding. ADH regulates water
balance in the body by controlling the amount of water reabsorbed in the kidneys (Alatzoglou et al., 2020).

Pituitary Function
The pituitary's primary function is to produce and secrete hormones that act on various organs and tissues
throughout the body. Overall, the pituitary assists in regulating various bodily processes and maintaining
homeostasis in the body.
712  26 · Hypothalamus, Pituitary, and Adrenal Disorder Drugs

     Pituitary Hormones
     Some of the major hormones produced by the pituitary include:

         · Growth hormone (GH): Promotes the growth and development of bones, muscles, and organs
         · Prolactin (PRL): Stimulates breast milk production
         · Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH): Regulates the function of the thyroid gland
         · Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH): Stimulates the adrenal cortex to produce cortisol, which helps the body

             respond to stress
         · Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH): Stimulates the development of eggs in females and sperm in males
         · Luteinizing hormone (LH): Regulates the production of sex hormones, including estrogen and testosterone

     Introduction to the Adrenal Cortex

     The adrenal glands, which are located on top of each kidney, consist of two layers: the adrenal medulla and the
     adrenal cortex. The adrenal medulla is the inner layer of the adrenal glands and is important for producing
     epinephrine and norepinephrine in response to stress. This chapter, however, will focus on the adrenal cortex as it
     relates to endocrine function. The adrenal cortex, as is seen in Figure 26.4, is the outer layer of the adrenal glands.
     The adrenal cortex produces several important hormones that are essential for proper functioning of the body. Each
     of the three layers of the adrenal cortex produces a different hormones. The outermost layer is called the zona
     glomerulosa; the middle layer is called the zona fasciculate; and the innermost layer is called the zona reticularis.

     FIGURE 26.4 The adrenal glands produce hormones that are important for regulating body function and the stress response. (credit:
     modification of work from Anatomy and Physiology 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

     Adrenal Cortex Function
     The hormones produced by the adrenal cortex regulate various bodily functions. These hormones maintain the
     body's internal environment by regulating electrolyte, pH, and water balance; glucose metabolism; and immune
     function. Additionally, the adrenal cortex is involved in responding to stressors because its hormones help the body
     adapt to physical and emotional stress (Huecker et al., 2023; National Institutes of Health [NIH], 2017).

     The adrenal cortex's importance cannot be overstated--it is crucial for maintaining overall health and well-being.
     Without the hormones from the adrenal cortex, the body would struggle to maintain a stable internal environment,
     making it vulnerable to various health issues. Therefore, it is essential to maintain the adrenal cortex's health and
     function to ensure optimal health and wellness (Huecker et al., 2023; NIH, 2017).

  adrenal glands to produce cortisol, also known as the stress hormone, which regulates various physiological
  processes and helps the body cope with stress.

Adrenal Cortex Hormones
Some of the hormones produced by the adrenal cortex include:

    · Mineralocorticoids: produced in the zona glomerulosa, these help regulate the balance of electrolytes,
        particularly sodium and potassium, in the body as well as water balance.

    · Glucocorticoids: produced in the the zona fasciculate, these help regulate metabolism, immune function, and
        the body's response to stress.

    · Androgens: produced in the zona reticularis, these contribute to sexual development and fertility in males.

26.2 Growth Hormones and Suppressants

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 26.2.1 Identify the characteristics of growth hormone drugs used to treat pituitary disorders.
    · 26.2.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, contraindications, and interactions of growth

        hormone drugs used to treat pituitary disorders.
    · 26.2.3 Describe nursing implications of growth hormone drugs used to treat pituitary disorders.
    · 26.2.4 Explain the client education related to growth hormone drugs used to treat pituitary disorders.

Growth Hormone

Growth hormones and suppressants are used to treat various growth and development disorders. Growth hormone,
also known as somatotropin or human growth hormone, is essential for the body's growth and development. Growth
hormone stimulates the production of the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in the liver, which promotes the
growth of bone, muscle, and other tissues. Growth hormone also helps to regulate metabolism and break down fats.
Growth hormone is particularly important during childhood and adolescence when it promotes the growth and
development of the body. However, growth hormone continues to be important throughout adulthood, helping to
maintain healthy bone density, muscle mass, and overall well-being.

Deficiencies in growth hormone can lead to stunted growth, delayed puberty, and other health issues. Conversely,
excessive growth hormone production can result in abnormal growth of bones and soft tissues, causing gigantism in
children or acromegaly in adults.

Somatropin
Somatropin (different from somatotropin mentioned above) is a recombinant growth hormone that is used to treat
failure to grow due to growth hormone deficiency in pediatric and adult clients; some forms of this prescription are
indicated in the treatment of Prader-Willi syndrome. The drug is available in a subcutaneous injection dosage form
and is individualized based on the client needs.

Drug interactions include glucocorticoids, which may oppose the growth-promoting effects of somatropin; oral
estrogen, which impacts growth hormone secretion; and insulin or oral diabetes drugs, which may need dosages
altered due to somatropin increasing glucose levels in the blood. The most common adverse effects are injection
site reaction, rash, lipoatrophy, thyroid hormone suppression, and headaches. Somatropin is contraindicated in
clients who are critically ill or have active malignancy, impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes, hypersensitivity, or
closed epiphyses.

Growth Hormone Suppressants

Growth hormone suppressants are medications used to reduce the production or activity of growth hormone in the
body. These drugs are typically used to treat medical conditions such as acromegaly or gigantism. Suppressants
include somatostatin analogs, dopamine agonists, and growth hormone receptor antagonists. Nurses should note
that these drugs should only be used under the guidance of a qualified health care provider because they can have
significant side effects on the body and may interact with other medications or medical conditions.

     Bromocriptine Mesylate
     Bromocriptine mesylate is a dopamine receptor agonist. This grown hormone suppressant stimulates the dopamine
     receptors in the brain and helps to reduce prolactin production as well as lessen symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
     It also is used to treat clients with acromegaly or those with high levels of prolactin, which can cause a lack of
     menstrual periods and infertility. Bromocriptine mesylate is readily absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract and mainly
     excreted in the urine. Adverse effects include nausea, headache, dizziness, fatigue, vomiting, abdominal cramps,
     nasal congestion, constipation, and drowsiness. This drug is contraindicated in clients with uncontrolled
     hypertension, hypersensitivity, and pregnancy.

     Lanreotide Acetate
     The growth hormone suppressant lanreotide acetate is a somatostatin analog and is used to treat acromegaly in
     clients who have had an inadequate response to or cannot be treated with surgery and/or radiotherapy and to treat
     clients with certain types of unresectable tumors. Drug interactions include cyclosporine, bromocriptine, and beta
     blockers. Adverse reactions include diarrhea, cholelithiasis, abdominal pain, nausea, and injection site reactions.
     Lanreotide acetate is contraindicated in clients with previous hypersensitivity reaction to lanreotide or any of the
     ingredients in the formulation.

     Octreotide Acetate
     Octreotide acetate inhibits growth hormone as a suppressant and is used in the treatment of acromegaly and certain
     types of tumors. See Table 26.3 for additional information on octreotide acetate.

     Pegvisomant
     The growth hormone receptor antagonist pegvisomant is indicated for the treatment of acromegaly in clients who
     have inadequate response to surgery or radiation therapy or for whom these therapies are inappropriate. Adverse
     reactions include infection, pain, nausea, diarrhea, abnormal liver tests, flu-like symptoms, and injection site
     reactions. Pegvisomant is contraindicated in clients with diabetes or hypoglycemia, liver toxicity, or hypersensitivity.

     Table 26.2 lists common growth hormone suppressants and typical routes and dosing for adult and pediatric clients.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications

Common adverse effects of growth hormone suppressants include gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal
pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting; low or high blood glucose levels; vitamin B12 deficiency; fatigue and
weakness; and injection site reactions such as redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site.

Contraindications include hypersensitivity to the drugs or any of their components, uncontrolled diabetes--as
growth hormone suppressants can have potential effects on blood glucose regulation--severe liver disease, and
severe kidney disease. These drugs are metabolized by the liver and can cause further hepatic impairment in clients
with liver disease, and because they are excreted in the urine, they can cause further renal insufficiency in clients
with kidney disease.

     Nursing Implications
     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking growth hormone suppressants:

         · Assess the client's medical history, current drug list, and allergies.
         · Assess the client's baseline height, weight, and vital signs.
         · Ensure the drug is prepared appropriately using aseptic technique and verify dosage before administration.
         · Monitor the client's response to the drug, including any changes in height, weight, and vital signs.
         · Monitor closely for injection site reactions and other adverse reactions such as pain, nausea, and diarrhea.
         · Monitor IGF-1 levels and liver function, and report abnormalities to the health care provider.
         · Monitor for thyroid suppression and elevated glucose levels and notify the health care provider of

             abnormalities.
         · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for additional

             client teaching guidelines.

       CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

       The client taking a growth hormone suppressant should:

           · Keep this drug in its original carton to protect it from light.
           · If injectable:

                  Choose injection site (thigh, abdomen, or buttock) as recommended by their health care provider,
                     avoiding areas that are bony, bruised, sore, red, scarred, or hard.

                  Cleanse injection area with an alcohol swab/pad and let dry for 30 seconds before administering the
                     drug.

                  Dispose of needles in an FDA-approved sharps disposal container after use.

           · Keep a journal of their symptoms and note improved or worsening symptoms.
           · Report symptoms of fluid retention, including swelling in legs and feet, weight gain, and shortness of

               breath, or other symptoms such as constipation, fatigue, dry skin, increased thirst, polyuria, blurred vision,
               muscle pain, and/or tingling in hands and feet to their health care provider because these may represent
               an adverse reaction to the drug.
           · Speak to their health care provider if they are pregnant or plan on becoming pregnant before starting these
               drugs because they can impact the fetus.
           · Store out of reach from children and away from heat, moisture, and light.

       The client taking a growth hormone suppressant should not:

           · Dispose of needles or sharps container in the household trash.
           · Reuse needles.
           · Stop taking the drug unless directed by the health care provider because this drug class replaces or

               suppresses the body's growth hormone.

by the kidneys by causing the renal tubules to increase water reabsorption, which reduces the amount of urine
produced and helps to maintain the body's fluid balance. When ADH is released, it causes the kidneys to retain
water, which leads to an increase in blood volume and a decrease in urine output.

In conditions where there is a deficiency or dysfunction of ADH, such as diabetes insipidus, excessive urine output
can occur, leading to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and manifestations of polydipsia and hypotonic polyuria
(Christ-Crain & Gaisl, 2021). Conversely, an excess of ADH production can cause water retention and low sodium
levels as with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Excess ADH can result in manifestations
of symptomatic hyponatremia, such as muscle cramps, nausea, and vomiting (Mentrasti et al., 2020; Yasir &
Mechanic, 2023).

Desmopressin Acetate
Desmopressin acetate is a synthetic ADH that regulates water balance and blood pressure by promoting water
retention in the kidneys and reducing the amount of urine produced. It also increases clotting factor levels in the
blood. Desmopressin is commonly used to treat diabetes insipidus, nocturnal enuresis (bed wetting), and bleeding
disorders such as hemophilia A. Adverse effects include headache, nausea, and low sodium levels. It is
contraindicated in clients with severe renal impairment, a history of hyponatremia, or hypersensitivity.

Vasopressin
Vasopressin, also known as antidiuretic hormone, is released by the posterior pituitary gland. Its primary function is
to regulate water balance in the body by controlling the amount of water excreted in the urine. This hormone binds
to vasopressin receptors in the cells of the kidneys, which increases the reabsorption of water back into the
bloodstream. The reabsorption helps reduce the amount of water lost in the urine and can prevent dehydration.
Vasopressin also has vasoconstrictor effects, causing narrowing of blood vessels and an increase in blood pressure,
making it useful as a drug to treat conditions such as shock or cardiac arrest.

Demeclocycline
Demeclocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic that is rarely used for its antibiotic properties. This drug interferes with
vasopressin and is used to treat SIADH. It helps to regulate water balance, leading to an increase in urine output
and a reduction in the amount of water in the body. Adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and
photosensitivity. Demeclocycline is contraindicated in clients with hypersensitivity.

Tolvaptan
Tolvaptan is used to treat a condition called hyponatremia (low serum sodium levels). This drug works by blocking
the action of vasopressin, which helps the body to retain water and maintain electrolyte homeostasis, and is used to
treat conditions such as SIADH, heart failure, liver disease, and kidney disease. Tolvaptan should be initiated and re-
initiated in a hospital setting where serum sodium levels can be monitored closely. A too rapid correction of
hyponatremia can cause osmotic demyelination, resulting in seizures, coma, and death. Adverse effects include dry
mouth, constipation, thirst, hyperglycemia, and polyuria. It is contraindicated in clients with hypovolemic
hyponatremia or hypersensitivity.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Typical adverse effects of ADH drug classification include fluid retention and hyponatremia--by reducing urine
     output, which can lead to fluid retention and low sodium levels--headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as
     abdominal cramps, nausea, and vomiting.

     Contraindications include hyponatremia, cardiovascular disease, and kidney disease. Using ADH drugs may
     exacerbate or worsen hyponatremia. With cardiovascular disease, ADH drugs can cause vasoconstriction, which can
     worsen angina, elevate blood pressure, and promote fluid retention that can exacerbate heart failure and lead to
     fluid volume overload. Nurses should note that these drugs are excreted in the urine and can further impair renal
     function of clients with kidney disease.

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking ADHs:

· Educate the client regarding ADH drugs.
· Assess the client's knowledge about signs and symptoms of over- and undertreatment, adverse reactions, and

   contraindications and clarify any gaps in knowledge.
· Monitor client fluid intake and urine output closely.
· Monitor electrolytes, especially sodium, as well as urine specific gravity.
· Monitor client and report any abnormalities or symptoms of water intoxication and fluid excess such as

   nausea, vomiting, headache, changes in mental status, muscle cramps, and drowsiness or fluid loss such as
   extreme thirst, dry mouth, and feelings of tiredness or fatigue.
· Monitor nasal passages for ulceration if administering via nasal route.
· Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for additional
   client teaching guidelines.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking an antidiuretic hormone should:
720  26 · Hypothalamus, Pituitary, and Adrenal Disorder Drugs

         · Keep a journal of their symptoms. It may take several weeks for them to notice improved symptoms.
         · Report symptoms of irregular nausea, vomiting, headache, changes in mental status, muscle cramps,

             drowsiness, extreme thirst, dry mouth, and feelings of tiredness or fatigue to their health care provider
             because these may represent an adverse reaction to the drug.
         · Monitor their fluid intake and urine output.

     The client taking an antidiuretic hormone should not:

         · Stop taking the drug unless directed by their health care provider.

       FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

       Antidiuretic Hormones

       Desmopressin acetate may precipitate hyponatremia, which may be life-threatening if severe.

       Tolvaptan can cause serious and potentially fatal liver injury. Tolvaptan should be initiated and re-initiated only
       in a hospital where serum sodium levels can be monitored closely. A too rapid correction of hyponatremia can
       cause osmotic demyelination resulting in dysarthria, mutism, dysphagia, lethargy, affective changes, spastic
       quadriparesis, seizures, coma, and death.

             disorders.

         · 26.4.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, contraindications, and interactions of
             glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid drugs used to treat adrenal disorders.

         · 26.4.3 Describe nursing implications of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid drugs used to treat adrenal
             disorders.

         · 26.4.4 Explain the client education related to glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid drugs used to treat
             adrenal disorders.

     Glucocorticoids

     Glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids are two types of steroid hormones that are produced by the adrenal cortex
     and play distinct roles in regulating the body's metabolism, fluid balance, and stress response. Glucocorticoids are
     produced in response to stress and help regulate metabolism and the immune system.

     The primary glucocorticoid in the body is cortisol. Cortisol helps regulate glucose uptake in other tissues--such as
     muscles and fat--and has an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effect, making it an important medication
     in the treatment of many inflammatory and autoimmune disorders and in preventing transplantation rejection.
     Nurses should note that there are many corticosteroids within this class of drugs, and they vary by potency, route of
     administration, and other non-anti-inflammatory activity. These properties help the health care provider choose the
     appropriate corticosteroid agent to prescribe for the client. Synthetic glucocorticoids--such as prednisone,
     dexamethasone, and hydrocortisone--are commonly used in medicine to treat conditions such as asthma,
     rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease.

     Although glucocorticoids can be effective at treating certain conditions, they can have significant toxic effects over
     time that limit use. As such, their use is typically reserved for short-term treatment of acute conditions or as a last
     resort for long-term conditions that have not responded to other treatments. Short-term use is tapered quickly to
     avoid rebound symptoms. Long-term use also requires tapering due to HPA axis suppression resulting in inadequate
     cortisol production.

Cortisone Acetate
Cortisone acetate is a glucocorticoid that also has salt-retaining properties. It is indicated for use with primary or
secondary adrenocortical insufficiency, hypercalcemia associated with cancer, rheumatic disorders, collagen
disorders, allergic states, inflammatory bowel disorders, and various respiratory, hematologic, integumentary, and
neoplastic disorders. Adverse effects include fluid retention, sodium retention, hypertension, muscle weakness,
osteoporosis, headache, and weight gain.

Hydrocortisone
Hydrocortisone, a synthetic form of cortisol, is a short-acting glucocorticoid that is used to reduce inflammation and
swelling in the body. Hydrocortisone is used to treat a variety of conditions including skin disorders, allergic
reactions, asthma, arthritis, and certain types of cancer. It can be applied topically, as a cream or ointment, and has
ophthalmic, otic, and rectal routes available. Adverse effects include headache, dizziness, nausea, weight gain,
mood changes, increased blood pressure, hyperglycemia, difficulty sleeping, dry skin, acne, skin irritation, and
increased risk of infections.

     CLINICAL TIP

 Hydrocortisone Administration

  Systemic administration of steroids is often recommended to take place in the morning to avoid insomnia
  (Hodgens & Sharman, 2023).

Methylprednisolone
Methylprednisolone is an intermediate-acting synthetic glucocorticoid that is used as an anti-inflammatory and
immunosuppressant. It is commonly used to treat a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions.
Methylprednisolone--available in oral, injectable, and topical forms--works by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in
the cells of the body, which leads to a reduction in the release of inflammatory molecules, such as cytokines, and
inhibits the immune response and decreases inflammation. Dosing is based on the condition being treated and the
severity of symptoms.

Prednisolone
Prednisolone, an intermediate-acting synthetic form of cortisol, is used to decrease inflammation and to treat a
variety of conditions including rheumatic conditions, allergic reactions, asthma, and certain types of cancer. The
medication comes in an oral form and as an injectable. Adverse effects include increased glucose levels, injection
site reactions, weight gain, and mood changes.

Prednisone
Prednisone is an intermediate-acting steroid medication and a synthetic form of cortisol used to reduce
inflammation. Like prednisolone, it is used in the treatment of a variety of conditions including asthma, allergic
reactions, rheumatic disorders, respiratory disorders, and certain types of cancer. Adverse effects include weight
gain, mood changes, increased blood sugar levels, and osteoporosis.

Betamethasone
Betamethasone is a long-acting synthetic cortisol that reduces inflammation and swelling in the body and is used to
treat various disorders including skin and inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Adverse effects
include skin irritation, increased risk of infection, and elevated blood glucose levels.

Dexamethasone
Dexamethasone is a long-acting synthetic form of cortisol that is used to reduce inflammation in the body and may
also be used as an immunosuppressant. Dexamethasone, which comes in an oral and injectable form, is used to
treat numerous disorders including rheumatic, respiratory, asthma, and allergic reactions. This drug is also used in
the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome as a suppressive test. Adverse effects include increased risk of infection,
weight gain, irritability and mood changes, increased blood sugar levels, GI upset, and osteoporosis.

Mineralocorticoids

Mineralocorticoids are a type of steroid hormones that are produced by the adrenal cortex and are involved in
regulating the body's fluid balance and electrolyte levels. The primary mineralocorticoid in the body is aldosterone.

Disorders of mineralocorticoid production or activity can lead to imbalances in fluid and electrolyte levels: two such
conditions exist. The first is hyperaldosteronism, which is characterized by excess aldosterone production. An
excess of aldosterone causes an increase in blood pressure and serum sodium levels along with a decrease in
serum potassium levels. The other condition is hypoaldosteronism, which is characterized by insufficient
aldosterone production. Hypoaldosteronism leads to a decrease in blood pressure and serum sodium levels along
with an increase in serum potassium levels.

Aldosterone
Aldosterone works by binding to mineralocorticoid receptors in the cells of the kidneys, which increases the
reabsorption of sodium ions and the excretion of potassium ions. This leads to an increase in blood volume and
blood pressure. In addition to regulating fluid and electrolyte balance, aldosterone plays a role in the renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). The RAAS is a complex hormonal system that helps to regulate blood
pressure by controlling the balance of sodium and water in the body.

Fludrocortisone
Fludrocortisone is a synthetic adrenocortical steroid that binds to mineralocorticoid receptors in the cells of the
kidneys and supports fluid and electrolyte balance within the body. This medication is used to treat primary and
secondary adrenocortical insufficiency in Addison's disease. Adverse effects include hyperglycemia, hypokalemia,
hypertension, muscle weakness, and impaired wound healing. It is contraindicated in clients with fungal infections
and hypersensitivity.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Common adverse effects of mineralocorticoid drugs include fluid retention because they promote sodium and water
reabsorption in the kidneys; hypokalemia where symptoms include muscle weakness, fatigue, irregular heartbeat,
and muscle cramps; elevated blood pressure; gastrointestinal disturbances such as stomach discomfort, nausea,
and diarrhea; and mood and behavioral changes such as mood swings, irritability, or anxiety.

Contraindications include hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components, systemic fungal infections, heart

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking a glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid should:

    · Take drugs as prescribed by their health care provider.
    · If using the drug systemically, avoid people who are sick--especially those who have chickenpox, measles,

        or tuberculosis--because they are at an increased risk of contracting the condition.
    · Report signs of fluid volume overload such as a weight gain of 2 pounds in 3 days or 5 pounds in a week.
    · Limit salt intake.
    · Report symptoms of infection, such as a fever greater than 100.4°F, a fast heartbeat, fast breathing, and

        symptoms of electrolyte imbalances such as weight gain, edema, a change in mental status, or shortness
        of breath and symptoms of cardiovascular issues including jugular vein distention, tachycardia, and/or
        palpitations to the health care provider.

The client taking a glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid should not:

    · Stop taking this medication without consulting with the health care provider because this drug must be
        tapered to decrease adverse effects.

27.3 Calcium Preparations, Vitamin D, Bisphosphonates, Calcimimetics, and Peptide Hormones

INTRODUCTION The endocrine system influences almost every cell in the body. Several organs and glands
comprise the endocrine system, which acts as a messenger system within the body. Endocrine glands release
chemicals called hormones directly into the bloodstream. These hormones control processes that occur within the
body. Endocrine hormones help to coordinate bodily functions such as emotions, growth, metabolism, mood, sexual
function, and sleep. This chapter will introduce and focus on the thyroid and parathyroid glands.

27.1 Introduction to the Thyroid and Parathyroid

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 27.1.1 Describe the function of the thyroid and parathyroid glands.
    · 27.1.2 Discuss hormones associated with the thyroid and parathyroid glands.

Thyroid and Parathyroid Glands

The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped gland located at the front of the neck below the voice box (see Figure 27.2).
This important gland regulates metabolism in the body through the production and secretion of thyroid hormones,
which require iodine for synthesis. The thyroid gland produces the active thyroid hormone, triiodothyronine (T3),
and the inactive thyroid hormone, thyroxine (T4). Thyroid follicular cells secrete T3 and T4, while parafollicular cells
secrete calcitonin cells that aid calcium metabolism. Follicular cells line the follicles, which are small spherical
structures in the thyroid gland. They absorb iodine from the blood and combine it with T3 and T4. Parafollicular cells
730  27 · Thyroid and Parathyroid Disorder Drugs

     are scattered between the follicles of the thyroid gland. Their main function is to secrete calcitonin for calcium
     regulation. Calcitonin lowers the levels of calcium in the blood by inhibiting the activity of osteoclasts--cells that
     break down bone tissue and release calcium into the blood. When calcium levels in the blood rise, the thyroid gland
     releases calcitonin, which binds to receptors on the surface of osteoclasts and inhibits their activity, reducing the
     amount of calcium released from the bone into the blood, thereby lowering calcium levels in the blood (McLaughlin
     & Jialal, 2022).

     FIGURE 27.2 The thyroid and parathyroid play an important role in body functioning and metabolism. (credit: modification of work from
     Biology 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

     Thyroid hormones affect multiple body systems:

         · the cardiac system--they have a positive inotropic effect on cardiac output and stroke volume;
         · metabolism--they play an important role through heat production and oxygen consumption;
         · the respiratory system--they help by normalizing arterial oxygen;
         · the nervous system--they stimulate the peripheral nervous system; and
         · the reproductive system--they are necessary for growth and development.

     The parathyroid glands are four tiny glands that are located on the upper and lower parts of the sides of the thyroid
     gland (see Figure 27.2). The parathyroid glands secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH), which along with dihydroxy-
     vitamin D3 (vitamin D3) and calcitonin are responsible for calcium homeostasis within the body. The major target
     organs for PTH are the kidneys, skeletal system, and intestines. The primary responses to PTH by the kidneys are to
     increase renal calcium reabsorption and phosphate excretion as well as to enhance the kidney's ability to activate
     vitamin D so that more calcium is absorbed through the intestine. In addition, it increases the activity of osteoclasts,
     thereby increasing the resorption of bone (Lofrese et al., 2022; Khan et al., 2022).

     When thyroid hormone levels are insufficient within the body, a series of responses is initiated. The process begins
     with the hypothalamus releasing thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). This hormone acts as a communicator by
     interacting with the anterior pituitary gland, a small pea-sized gland located at the brain's base. In response to TRH,
     the anterior pituitary gland releases thyrotropin, also known as thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH stimulates
     the thyroid gland, prompting it to either increase or decrease the production of both T4 and T3, essential thyroid
     hormones.

     Conversely, in cases where an excess of thyroid hormones is present, a crucial negative feedback system comes into
     play. Excessive levels of T4 and T3 instruct the anterior pituitary and hypothalamus to restrain the release of their
     respective hormones. This control mechanism is of paramount importance in maintaining a balanced hormonal
     environment. The influence of thyroid hormones extends beyond their impact on metabolism and energy regulation.

These hormones also interact with the parathyroid glands. The secretion of calcitonin, for instance, directly interacts
with calcium ions and affects parathyroid hormones. Calcitonin, functioning as an antagonist to the parathyroid
gland, contributes to the intricate balance of calcium in the body. Figure 27.3 illustrates thyroid hormones that
control metabolism and parathyroid hormones that control calcium homeostasis.

Hypothyroidism

Hypothyroidism arises from an inadequate secretion of T3 and T4 into the bloodstream, prompting the pituitary
gland to release TSH. This dynamic is part of the hypothalamus-pituitary axis, in which the hypothalamus triggers
the release of TRH to stimulate the anterior pituitary in the secretion of TSH. Hashimoto thyroiditis is the most
common cause of hypothyroidism. This condition is caused by an autoimmune-mediated destruction of the thyroid
gland, which leads to a dysfunctional thyroid gland and decreased secretion of thyroid hormones. If hypothyroidism
is left untreated, the client may develop a myxedema coma, which is a life-threatening disorder that leads to
hypothermia, cardiovascular collapse, hypoventilation, hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, and coma.

Symptoms of hypothyroidism include:

    · Bradycardia
          Thyroid hormones stimulate the heart, which increases the heart rate. However, in hypothyroidism, the
              reduced levels of thyroid hormone cause the heart rate to decrease.

    · Cold intolerance
          When thyroid hormones are low, the body's ability to generate and maintain heat is reduced. This can
              result in feeling excessively cold, often with a decreased tolerance to cold environments.

    · Constipation
          Thyroid hormones play a role in promoting gastric motility. With hypothyroidism, the decreased levels of
              thyroid hormones cause slower movement in the digestive tract, resulting in constipation.

    · Fatigue and decreased energy
732  27 · Thyroid and Parathyroid Disorder Drugs

               Thyroid hormones are responsible for cellular metabolism and energy production. When the thyroid
                   hormone levels are insufficient, it slows the metabolic process, resulting in decreased energy and fatigue.

         · Weight gain
               Thyroid hormones influence the body's metabolic rate and the breakdown of fat. With reduced levels of
                   thyroid hormones, the metabolic rate slows, resulting in a decreased ability to burn calories and fat.

     Treatment for hypothyroidism involves replacing the body's natural thyroid hormone when the levels are low or
     absent within the body and will be discussed later in this chapter.

     Hyperthyroidism

     Hyperthyroidism occurs when the body secretes too much T3 and T4 into the blood. The autoimmune disorder
     Graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. In Graves' disease, the production of TSH receptor
     antibodies stimulate the thyroid gland to grow and secrete additional thyroid hormone. Thyroid storm (thyrotoxic
     crisis) is a rare but severe complication of hyperthyroidism, which leads to severe tachycardia, fever, dehydration,
     heart failure, and coma. It occurs in clients who are inadequately treated for hyperthyroidism or initially after the
     removal of the thyroid.

     Symptoms of hyperthyroidism include:

         · Weight loss
               Increased levels of thyroid hormones can accelerate the body's metabolic rate, causing an increase in
                   calorie burning. This can lead to unintended weight loss, even with a normal or increased appetite.

         · Heat intolerance
               Thyroid hormones influence thermoregulation and can affect how the body generates and dissipates
                   heat. In hyperthyroidism, the elevated levels of thyroid hormones can lead to an increased sensitivity to
                   heat, resulting in an intolerance to hot temperatures.

         · Diarrhea
               Excessive thyroid hormones speed up gastric motility, leading to frequent bowel movements and
                   diarrhea.

         · Fine tremors
               Increased thyroid hormones cause an increased excitability within the nervous system, leading to
                   tremors, usually in the hands and fingers.

         · Tachycardia
               Thyroid hormones have a stimulatory effect on the heart, thereby increasing the heart rate and the force
                   of contractions.

         · Frequent mood changes
               Thyroid hormones can influence neurotransmitters in the brain, affecting mood regulation. In
                   hyperthyroidism, fluctuations in thyroid hormone levels contribute to mood swings, irritability, and
                   anxiety.

         · Muscle weakness
               Elevated thyroid hormone levels can cause increased breakdown of muscle protein and impair muscle
                   function, which leads to muscle wasting and weakness.

     Treatment for hyperthyroidism includes surgery to remove all or part of the thyroid gland and antithyroid drugs,
     which will be discussed later in this chapter.

Hypoparathyroidism

Hypoparathyroidism occurs when the body does not secrete enough PTH in the blood. This leads to dangerously low
levels of calcium in the blood. Because calcium and phosphate have an inverse reaction, the phosphate levels in the
body increase. Hypoparathyroidism is typically caused by an autoimmune disorder, can be idiopathic, or is a result
of thyroid/parathyroid surgery.

Symptoms of hypoparathyroidism are tetany, contraction of facial muscles after tapping the facial nerve (Chvostek
sign), induction of carpal pedal spasm (Trousseau sign), paresthesia, and a prolonged QT wave (total time from
ventricular depolarization to complete repolarization) on an electrocardiogram. Treatment for hypoparathyroidism
includes intravenous calcium gluconate, oral calcium, and vitamin D supplements, which will be discussed later in
this chapter.

Hyperparathyroidism

Hyperparathyroidism occurs when the body secretes too much PTH in the blood, leading to dangerously elevated
levels of calcium in the blood. The inverse reaction of calcium and phosphate causes the phosphate levels in the
body to decrease. Hyperparathyroidism is typically caused by a lack of response to the normal feedback mechanism
of the calcium homeostasis cycle.

Symptoms of hyperparathyroidism include:

    · Nausea and vomiting
          Elevated levels of PTH can disrupt the normal balance of calcium in the body, leading to gastrointestinal
              symptoms.

    · Constipation
          Excessive PTH slows gastric motility, resulting in constipation.

    · Kidney stones
          Increased levels of calcium in the blood due to hyperparathyroidism can lead to the deposition of calcium
              crystals in the kidneys, leading to the development of kidney stones.

    · Polyuria
          Elevated PTH levels increase the excretion of water in the urine, leading to increased urination.

    · Impaired sodium-water reabsorption
          Elevated PTH levels can interfere with the normal resorption of sodium and water in the kidneys, leading
              to fluid imbalance.

    · Muscle weakness
          Excessive PTH promotes the loss of calcium from muscles, impairing muscle function and causing muscle
              weakness.

    · Bone pain and osteoporosis
          Increased PTH causes increased calcium release from bones, resulting in bone pain, osteoporosis, and an
              increased risk of fractures.

    · Depression, psychosis, or an altered mental status
          High levels of PTH can affect neurotransmitter function, contributing to mood changes and cognitive
              function impairment and affecting overall mental well-being.

Treatment for hyperparathyroidism includes increasing fluid intake and supplementing with calcimimetics, vitamin
D supplements, phosphate binders, and calcitriol, which will be discussed later in this chapter.

     Diagnostic testing is key in determining thyroid and parathyroid conditions. Review the article Thyroid Function
     Testing in the Diagnosis and Monitoring of Thyroid Function Disorder. The first figure in the article illustrates an
     algorithm commonly used when diagnosing thyroid and parathyroid disorders.

     Other diagnostic tests that assist in diagnosing thyroid and parathyroid conditions include:

         · Ionized serum calcium: This test is performed for conditions that affect the body's ability to balance the
             amounts of ionized calcium and bound calcium in the blood. The normal range is 1.12-1.23 mmol/L, although
             ranges may vary slightly depending on the laboratory (American Board of Internal Medicine, 2023).

         · Vitamin D (calciferol): This test is performed to determine the amount of vitamin D in the blood, which helps
             the body to absorb calcium. The normal range is 30-60 ng/mL, although ranges may vary slightly depending
             on the laboratory (American Board of Internal Medicine, 2023).

Thyroid Drugs

Thyroid drugs are used when the thyroid is functioning incorrectly and there is a need to replace the thyroid
hormone so that the body can maintain its expected function. Thyroid drugs can be synthetic thyroid hormones or
animal-based thyroid hormones. These drugs act by replacing the body's natural thyroid hormone when the levels
are low or absent within the body.

Levothyroxine Sodium
Levothyroxine sodium is a synthetic thyroid hormone that is identical to T4 produced in the body. The
gastrointestinal tract absorbs 40%-80% of this synthetic hormone. The drug is greater than 99% protein bound and
easily distributed. It is primarily eliminated by the kidneys, with approximately 20% of T4 being excreted in the stool
(Eghtedari & Correa, 2022). It comes in tablet and injectable forms and is used to treat hypothyroidism and pituitary
TSH suppression. Levothyroxine is contraindicated in clients with uncorrected adrenal insufficiency: because of the
role of adrenal glands in regulating stress response and cortisol production, levothyroxine's ability to increase
metabolic demands and stress may overwhelm the impaired adrenal glands, causing an adrenal crisis. Stabilization
of adrenal function is crucial before starting levothyroxine treatment to prevent an adrenal crisis.

Levothyroxine sodium has a narrow therapeutic index; careful dose titration is necessary to avoid overtreatment or
undertreatment. Clients should take this drug in the morning at least 30 minutes before consuming food or fluid
containing caffeine such as coffee, tea, or soda. Food and caffeinated drinks can both interfere with the absorption
of levothyroxine sodium.

Liothyronine Sodium
Liothyronine sodium is a synthetic thyroid hormone mimicking T3. This hormone replacement is commonly used to
treat hypothyroidism and myxedema coma. Liothyronine can be taken orally, comes in an intravenous form, and is
easily absorbed and readily distributed in the body. As with levothyroxine, liothyronine is contraindicated in clients
with uncorrected adrenal insufficiency. As stated above, the adrenal glands control the stress response and cortisol
levels within the body. When they are impaired, they are unable to handle the increase in metabolic rate caused by
the administration of liothyronine, leading to an adrenal crisis. Adverse effects of liothyronine include anxiety,
blurred vision, chest discomfort, decreased bone mineral density, and decreased urine output.

     SAFETY ALERT

 Similarly Named Drugs

 Do not confuse levothyroxine sodium with liothyronine sodium. Although these drugs are in the same drug class,
  they require different dosing and lab monitoring.

Desiccated Thyroid Extract
Desiccated thyroid extract is a thyroid hormone developed from pig glands that is often used as an over-the-counter
remedy for thyroid hormone replacement. Desiccated thyroid extract has not been approved by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) due to a complex manufacturing process leading to issues with safety, effectiveness, and
quality, with inconsistent or inaccurate dosage. Table 27.2 lists common thyroid drugs and typical routes and dosing
for adult clients.

                                      Serum T4 levels should be used to monitor therapeutic dosing range of drug.
                                      Must be titrated based on the individual's need and to avoid the consequences of
                                      overtreatment or undertreatment.

                                      25 mcg orally once daily; increase by 25 mcg orally daily every 1-2 weeks if

     Liothyronine sodium              needed.

     (Cytomel, Triostat)              Maintenance dose: 25-75 mcg once daily.

                                      Serum T3 levels should be used to monitor therapeutic dosing range of drug.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Common adverse effects among the thyroid drug classification include cardiac effects--such as tachycardia,
     palpitations, and arrhythmias--weight loss, nervousness and irritability, heat intolerance, diarrhea, abdominal
     cramping, headaches, and sleep disturbances.

     Contraindications for thyroid drug classification include hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components as well
     as any recent myocardial infarction because thyroid drugs can increase heart rate and heart contractility. Untreated
     adrenal insufficiency is a contraindication because impaired adrenal glands cannot handle the increased metabolic
     rate cause by thyroid drugs, as is hyperthyroidism since the drugs would increase thyroid hormone levels that are
     already elevated.

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking thyroid drugs:

· Educate the client that thyroid replacement hormone is a lifelong therapy.
· Assess the client's knowledge about signs and symptoms of over- and undertreatment, adverse reactions, and

   contraindications and clarify any gaps in knowledge.
· Monitor thyroid functioning of the client and report any abnormalities or symptoms of thyroid storm, such as

   tachycardia, cardiac dysrhythmias, fever, heart failure, flushed skin, confusion, behavioral changes, and
   hypotension, to the health care provider.
· Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client
   teaching guidelines.
738  27 · Thyroid and Parathyroid Disorder Drugs

       CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

       The client taking a thyroid drug should:

           · Take on an empty stomach 1/2-1 hour before breakfast for better absorption.
           · Keep a journal of their symptoms. It may take several weeks for them to notice improved symptoms.
           · Report symptoms of irregular heartbeat, chest pain, shortness of breath, leg cramps, headache,

               nervousness, irritability, sleeplessness, and heat intolerance to their health care provider because these
               may represent an adverse reaction or toxicity to the drug.
           · Notify the health care provider if they are pregnant or become pregnant because the dose of the drug may
               need to be increased during pregnancy.
           · Store out of reach of children and away from heat, moisture, and light.

       The client taking a thyroid drug should not:

           · Stop taking unless directed by their health care provider because this drug class replaces their body's
               missing thyroid hormone.

           · Take with food because it will decrease the drug's absorption.
           · Take within 4 hours of taking calcium and/or iron supplements, including calcium antacids, because they

               may impact the drug's absorption.

       FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

       Thyroid Hormones

       Thyroid hormones, including levothyroxine sodium, either alone or with other therapeutic agents, should not be
       used for treatment of obesity or weight loss due to producing serious toxicity or life-threatening manifestations.

     Antithyroid Drugs

     Antithyroid drugs are used to inhibit production of the thyroid hormone so that the body can maintain normal
     thyroid homeostasis. Antithyroid drugs act by inhibiting the synthesis of thyroid hormones or by inundating the
     thyroid gland with iodine to prevent thyroid hormone release. Antithyroid drugs are used when the thyroid hormone
     levels are elevated within the body.

     Thionamides
     Thionamides are compounds that effectively hinder the synthesis of thyroid hormones. These compounds are
     transported into the thyroid gland and act by inhibiting two critical processes: organification of iodine to tyrosine
     residues in thyroglobulin as well as coupling of iodotyrosines, leading to lower serum levels of thyroid hormones.
     The process of organification of iodine to tyrosine residues refers to the incorporation of iodine atoms into tyrosine
     amino acid molecules within the structure of thyroglobulin, a protein produced by the thyroid gland. This is an
     essential step in the synthesis of thyroid hormones. The coupling of iodotyrosines refers to the binding together of
     iodinated tyrosine molecules within the thyroglobulin to form the final thyroid hormones T3 and T4. Thionamides
     are used in the treatment of hyperthyroidism and Graves' disease. Thionamides include methimazole and
     propylthiouracil.

     Methimazole
     Methimazole inhibits the synthesis of thyroid hormones and is indicated to treat hyperthyroidism. This medication is
     rapidly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and metabolized rapidly. It is excreted mainly in the urine but is
     excreted in breast milk and should be used cautiously with clients who are breastfeeding. Careful dose titration is
     necessary to avoid overtreatment or undertreatment. When the client develops toxicity to methimazole, symptoms
     such as nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress, headache, fever, joint pain, pruritus, edema, and agranulocytosis may
     develop (Armstrong et al., 2022; DailyMed, Methimazole, 2022; Shahid et al., 2022; Singh & Correa, 2022).

Propylthiouracil
Propylthiouracil inhibits the synthesis of thyroid hormones. This drug is readily absorbed and extensively
metabolized; it is mainly excreted in the urine. Propylthiouracil is indicated for Graves' disease with
hyperthyroidism, multinodular goiter, and to ameliorate symptoms of hyperthyroidism before thyroidectomy or
radioactive iodine therapy in clients who did not tolerate methimazole. It is contraindicated in clients with
hypersensitivity and with liver failure. Adverse effects include hepatitis, jaundice, anemia, thrombocytopenia,
nephritis, arthralgia, and paresthesia.

Iodine
The body naturally uses iodine for the formation of thyroid hormone. Iodine solutions cause the thyroid cells to
become inundated with iodine, thereby decreasing thyroid hormone production. Iodine preparations are used to
treat hyperthyroidism when thionamides are ineffective or for those clients who are not candidates for surgery.

Potassium Iodide
Potassium iodide prevents iodine from getting into the thyroid gland. As a medication, potassium iodine is used two
separate ways: 1) to treat hyperthyroidism by inhibiting thyroid hormone secretion in very acute situations, and 2) to
prevent the uptake of radioactive iodine in the event of a nuclear emergency. Additional use includes radioactive
iodine to ablate a hyperactive thyroid gland. Adverse effects include skin rash, shortness of breath, wheezing,
swelling, fever, and joint pain. It is contraindicated in those who have had an allergic reaction to iodine and those
with nodular thyroid disease. ThyroShield and Thyrosafe are the only FDA-approved brands of potassium iodide.

· Gastrointestinal symptoms--nausea and vomiting
· Liver toxicity--jaundice, dark urine, abdominal pain, fatigue
· Bone marrow suppression--decreased white blood cell, red blood cell, and platelet production leading to

   unexplained fever, sore throat, easy bruising, bleeding, and fatigue
· Hypothyroidism--increased fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation

Contraindications include hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components, severe liver disease or impairment,
and with pregnancy or breastfeeding because the drugs can cross the placenta, be excreted in breast milk, and
potentially affect the development of the fetus or infant.

     Nursing Implications
     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking antithyroid drugs:

     · Monitor complete blood cell count and coagulation studies, liver studies, and thyroid levels and report
        abnormalities to the health care provider.

     · Check with the health care provider before administering antithyroid drugs if the client is currently taking
        anticoagulants, beta-adrenergic blockers and digitalis glycosides, or theophylline, which stimulates the central
        nervous system and when taken with antithyroid drugs can impact mood, behavior, cognition, and sleep
        patterns.

     · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for additional
        client teaching guidelines.

     CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

     The client taking an antithyroid drug should:

         · Take the drug exactly as prescribed by the health care provider.
         · Report sore throat, skin eruptions, fever, headache, or general malaise to the health care provider because

             these may be symptoms of a severe reaction.
         · Monitor weight weekly and report a weight gain of 3 pounds in 24 hours or 5 pounds in a week to the

             health care provider.
         · Notify the health care provider if they are pregnant or plan to become pregnant or if they are

     27.3 Calcium Preparations, Vitamin D, Bisphosphonates, Calcimimetics, and
     Peptide Hormones

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 27.3.1 Identify the characteristics of calcium preparations, vitamin D, bisphosphonates, calcimimetics,
             and peptide hormone drugs used to treat hypoparathyroidism.

         · 27.3.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, contraindications, and interactions of calcium
             preparations, vitamin D, bisphosphonates, calcimimetics, and peptide hormone drugs used to treat
             hypoparathyroidism.

         · 27.3.3 Describe nursing implications of calcium preparations, vitamin D, bisphosphonates, calcimimetics,
             and peptide hormone drugs used to treat hypoparathyroidism.

         · 27.3.4 Explain the client education related to calcium preparations, vitamin D, bisphosphonates,
             calcimimetics, and peptide hormone drugs used to treat hypoparathyroidism.

     This section of the chapter discusses drugs used to treat parathyroid dysfunction. These drugs are used when
     parathyroid functioning is decreased or when calcium needs to be replaced or decreased to maintain its expected
     functions within the body.

     Calcium Preparations

     Calcium is a mineral utilized by the body to promote bone health. It also plays a role in blood clotting, muscle
     contraction, regulating heart rhythm, nerve function, and cell communication. Vitamin D is needed for the body to be
     able to absorb calcium. The two are often prescribed together.

     The recommended daily amount of calcium is 1000-2000 mg for adults. Calcium can be found in many foods
     including dairy products such as milk, yogurt, and cheese; fish such as sardines and salmon; vegetables such as
     kale, broccoli, and cabbage; soy milk; almond milk; and tofu.

       SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

       Calcium and Race/Ethnicity, Age, and Socioeconomic Factors

       In the United States, many Black and Asian people, as well as many adults experiencing poverty, aged 50 years
       and older, are less likely to get the recommended daily amounts of calcium (National Institutes of Health, 2023).
       As we age, our bodies absorb less calcium. For postmenopausal clients, a decrease in calcium absorption can
       lead to conditions such as osteoporosis.

       Access multimedia content (https://openstax.org/books/pharmacology/pages/27-3-calcium-preparations-
       vitamin-d-bisphosphonates-calcimimetics-and-peptide-hormones)
       This video on the role and importance of vitamin D (calcitriol) explains why vitamin D is vital for proper
       absorption and utilization of calcium.

     Calcium
     Some calcium supplements are available over the counter and are not regulated by the FDA. Clients should speak
     with their health care provider before starting any over-the-counter medication.

     Calcium Acetate
     Calcium acetate is used in the treatment of hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia but is contraindicated in clients
     with hypercalcemia. This phosphate binder, which comes in capsule form, reduces serum phosphate levels, thereby
     increasing serum calcium levels. Adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, constipation, gas, bloating, and
     headache.

     Calcium Carbonate
     Calcium carbonate is used in the treatment of hypocalcemia and can also be used as an antacid; it is contraindicated
     in clients with hypercalcemia. Like calcium acetate, this supplement reduces serum phosphate levels and results in
     increased serum calcium levels. This medication is available in a tablet, chewable tablet, capsule, and liquid.

Adverse effects include upset stomach, vomiting, abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, dry mouth, loss of
appetite, metallic taste, and increased urination.

Calcium Chloride
Calcium chloride is an injectable drug used in the treatment of hypocalcemia in those clients requiring a prompt
increase in plasma calcium levels. Calcium chloride is contraindicated in cardiac resuscitation and for use in clients
with hypercalcemia. It is administered via the intravenous route only. Adverse effects include vasodilation,
decreased blood pressure, tingling sensation, and calcium taste (bitter and sour). Administration site reactions
include local soft tissue inflammation, local necrosis, and extravasation.

Calcium Gluconate
Calcium gluconate is an injectable drug used in the treatment of acute symptomatic hypocalcemia. It increases
serum ionized calcium levels. This medication is contraindicated in clients with hypercalcemia and in neonates (28
days old or younger) and should be used cautiously in clients with cardiac arrhythmias with concomitant cardiac
glycoside use. Adverse effects include vasodilation, decreased blood pressure, cardiac arrhythmia, syncope, and
cardiac arrest. Administration site reactions include local soft tissue inflammation, local necrosis, and extravasation.

Table 27.7 lists common calcium drugs and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

Drug                                Routes and Dosage Ranges

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Common adverse effects include kidney stones and gastrointestinal symptoms, such as constipation, bloating,
abdominal discomfort, and flatulence. Drugs, such as tetracycline antibiotics, bisphosphates (e.g., alendronate), and
thyroid hormone replacements, can interfere with calcium absorption so should be taken at separate times to
minimize interactions. Hypercalcemia, another common adverse effect, leads to symptoms such as fatigue,
confusion, constipation, increased thirst, and frequent urination.

Contraindications include hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components. This medication is contraindicated
for hypercalcemia because it will increase calcium levels in the blood and for hyperparathyroidism because
increased calcium can worsen this condition. Kidney stones, as calcium preparation, may contribute to the
formation of new kidney stones. Malabsorption syndrome, such as Celiac disease or Crohn's disease, may occur
because calcium may not be absorbed appropriately by the body with these conditions.

     Vitamin D

     Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that promotes calcium and phosphorous absorption in the intestines and helps to
     maintain adequate serum calcium and phosphate levels within the body. Vitamin D has other roles in the body--it
     reduces inflammation, and it stimulates insulin production in the modulation of cell function, neuromuscular and
     immune system function, and in glucose metabolism (Chauhan et al., 2022).

     Vitamin D has two forms, vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). Both forms are well absorbed
     by the gastrointestinal tract. The recommended daily allowance (RDA) of vitamin D for adults is 600-800 IU;
     however, replacement regimens for those with low vitamin D levels vary from the RDA.

     Few foods naturally contain vitamin D. Those that do include trout, salmon, tuna, fish liver oils, beef liver, some
     mushrooms, and egg yolks. Some dairy products such as milk and cheeses are fortified with vitamin D. Sunlight is
     required for vitamin D synthesis; however, the FDA recommends sun protection such as sunscreen and limiting
     exposure to high sun times of day to prevent sun exposure complications such as skin cancer.

     Ergocalciferol
     Ergocalciferol is a synthetic calcium regulator. It mobilizes calcium and phosphate from bone and increases
     reabsorption of calcium and phosphate by the renal tubules, thereby increasing serum calcium and phosphate
     levels. This supplement is indicated in the treatment of hypoparathyroidism and in those with hypophosphatemia. It
     is frequently used off-label for vitamin D deficiency. It is contraindicated in clients with hypercalcemia,
     malabsorption syndrome, and hypervitaminosis D as well as clients with abnormal sensitivity to the toxic effects of
     vitamin D.

Calcitriol
Calcitriol is a synthetic vitamin D analog that is active in the regulation and absorption of calcium from the
gastrointestinal tract. Calcitriol is readily absorbed from the intestine with peak serum concentration within 3-6
hours. It is 99.9% bound to protein in the blood and easily distributed. Calcitriol is indicated in the management of
hypocalcemia and hypoparathyroidism. It is contraindicated in clients with hypercalcemia or evidence of vitamin D
toxicity.

Table 27.9 lists common vitamin D drugs and typical routes and dosing for adult and pediatric clients.

Drug                                            Routes and Dosage Ranges

Ergocalciferol  Hypoparathyroidism:
   (Drisdol)    Adults: 50,000-200,000 units daily concomitantly with calcium lactate 4 g, 6 times daily.

                Hypoparathyroidism:

Calcitriol      Adults: 0.25 mcg orally daily in the morning; dose may be increased by health care provider in

(Rocaltrol)     2-4 weeks based on lab values.

                Children (3 years of age): 0.25 mcg orally daily; maximum dose 0.50 mcg orally daily.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Common adverse effects include constipation, dry mouth, bone pain, metallic taste, polyuria, pruritis, increased
liver enzymes (AST), and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels.

Contraindications include hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components, malabsorption disorders (such as
Celiac disease or Crohn's disease), vitamin D toxicity (symptoms include recurrent vomiting, confusion, apathy, and
dehydration), and hypercalcemia (symptoms include nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, and weight loss).

     Bisphosphonates

     Bisphosphonates are pyrophosphate analogues. They are divided into two groups: nitrogen-containing
     bisphosphonates and non-nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates that are not approved by the FDA in the treatment
     of osteoporosis. The nitrogen-containing agents are used in the treatment of osteoporosis and other associated
     conditions where bones are thin, fragile, and at an increased risk for fracture. Bisphosphonates inhibit bone
     resorption by attaching to hydroxyapatite binding sites on the bone. As osteoclasts resorb bone, the
     bisphosphonate embedded in the bone is released and impairs the osteoclast's ability to continue bone resorption,
     thereby improving bone density (Ganesan at el., 2022).

Alendronate
Alendronate is a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate that inhibits bone resorption and improves bone density. It is
used in prevention and treatment of osteoporosis and to increase bone mass in male and female clients. This
medication should be taken with 6-8 ounces of water, and the client should sit/stand for at least 30 minutes after
administration to prevent esophageal irritation. Alendronate is contraindicated with esophageal abnormalities, the
inability to stand/sit upright for 30 minutes, hypocalcemia, and hypersensitivity. Adverse effects include abdominal
pain, acid regurgitation, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, musculoskeletal pain, and nausea.

Ibandronate
Ibandronate is a potent nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate that is indicated for the treatment and prevention of
postmenopausal osteoporosis and is available in tablet and injectable formulation. Oral dosing of ibandronate
should be on an empty stomach with 6-8 ounces of water. The client should sit or stand for at least 60 minutes after
administration to enhance absorption and prevent esophageal inflammation. This medication is contraindicated in
clients with hypocalcemia, hypersensitivity, pregnancy, and abnormalities of the esophagus that delay emptying and
those with the inability to sit/stand for at least 60 minutes after taking this drug. Adverse effects include back pain,
dyspepsia, pain in extremities, diarrhea, headache, and myalgia.

Risedronate
Risedronate is also a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate that is indicated in the treatment of postmenopausal
osteoporosis. It is available as a delayed-release and immediate-release tablet and should be taken in the morning
immediately following breakfast. The client should be able to sit/stand for at least 30 minutes following
administration to facilitate delivery to the stomach and to avoid esophageal irritation. The delayed-release tablet
should not be chewed, crushed, or cut. Risedronate is contraindicated in clients with hypocalcemia, with
abnormalities of the esophagus that delay emptying, who are unable to sit/stand for at least 30 minutes after taking
this drug, with hypersensitivity, and who are pregnant. Adverse effects include abdominal pain, constipation/
diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, bronchitis, arthralgia, back pain, musculoskeletal pain, pain in the extremities, myalgia,
dizziness, and headache.

Table 27.11 lists common bisphosphonate drugs and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Adverse effects of bisphosphonates drug class include gastrointestinal symptoms (such as abdominal pain,
dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), esophageal irritation (leading to heartburn and difficulty swallowing),
musculoskeletal pain, osteonecrosis of the jaw (death of bone tissue in the jaw leading to pain, swelling, infection,
and exposed bone in severe cases), and atypical fractures.

Contraindications include hypersensitivity to the drugs or any of their components as well as severe renal
impairment because these drugs are primarily excreted through the kidneys and use of these drugs can further
impair kidney function. This class of drugs is also contraindicated in clients who have an inability to sit upright or
stand for at least 30-60 minutes after taking the medication.

     Calcimimetics

     Calcimimetics are drugs that mimic the actions of calcium by allosteric activation of the calcium-sensing receptor
     (CaSR) in the parathyroid glands or other tissues. These drugs lower the activation of extracellular calcium ions and
     decrease PTH release, thus reducing the amount of calcium in the blood. Calcimimetics are used in the treatment of
     hyperparathyroidism and in clients who have hypercalcemia.

     Cinacalcet
     Cinacalcet is a positive modulator of the CaSR agonist and is indicated in the treatment of primary and secondary
     hyperparathyroidism and in the treatment of hypercalcemia. This medication should be taken with meals, and the
     tablet should not be chewed, crushed, or divided. Nurses should use cinacalcet cautiously in clients with upper
     gastrointestinal bleeding, those with hypotension and/or heart failure, and those with bone disease. Adverse effects
     include nausea and vomiting.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Adverse effects of calcimimetics include gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain;
     hypocalcemia where symptoms include muscle cramps, tingling, numbness in the fingers or lips, and seizures;
     hypophosphatemia where symptoms include muscle weakness, bone pain, and impaired energy metabolism; and
     adynamic bone disease, which is characterized by low bone turnover and increased risk of fractures.

     Contraindications include hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components and in those clients with
     hypocalcemia because this can cause further decrease in calcium levels and death. Calcimimetics should be used
     cautiously in clients with severe liver impairment because they are primarily metabolized by the liver and can further
     impair its function.

Peptide Hormones

Peptide hormones are synthetic analog hormones used in the treatment of various disease processes. For this
chapter, calcitonin salmon will be covered under this drug classification. This type of peptide hormone inhibits
osteoclasts and increases renal excretion of calcium, thereby decreasing serum calcium levels. In the renal tubules,
it reduces serum calcium and phosphate by promoting diuresis and decreasing reabsorption. In bone, this peptide
hormone causes osteoclasts to contract, which reduces their motility and ability to resorb bone. For these reasons,
this medication is used to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis, Paget's disease of bone, and emergent
hypercalcemia (Wang et al., 2022).

Calcitonin Salmon
Calcitonin salmon is a synthetic peptide hormone that is used in the treatment of hypercalcemia, postmenopausal
osteoporosis when alternative therapies are not suitable, and symptomatic Paget's disease. Calcitonin salmon is
available as an injectable and nasal spray and is contraindicated in clients with hypersensitivity. Adverse effects of
nasal administration include nasal reactions such as dryness and irritation, nausea with or without vomiting,
injection site inflammation, and flushing of face or hands.

For preparation and administration of injectable calcitonin salmon, the client should visually inspect the injection
vials to ensure the solution is clear and colorless. If the solution is not clear and colorless or contains any particles
or if the vial is damaged, the client should discard the solution. If the volume of the drug exceeds 2 mL,
intramuscular injection is preferable. The client should be instructed on how to use the sterile injection technique
and to dispose of needles properly (DailyMed, Calcitonin Salmon Injection, 2023).

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Adverse effects of peptide hormones include nasal dryness and irritation, nausea with or without vomiting, injection
site inflammation, and flushing of hands or face.

CHAPTER OUTLINE
28.1 Introduction to Diabetes
28.2 Insulin and Non-Insulin Injectable Diabetes Drugs
28.3 Oral Antidiabetic Drugs

INTRODUCTION Diabetes is a long-term chronic health condition that affects millions of people worldwide. It
alters how the body regulates glucose from food and uses it for energy. Diabetes affects people of all races, sexes,
and ages. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, n.d.-a), diabetes and diabetes-related
health complications can be serious and costly. The eighth leading cause of death in the United States, diabetes
costs a total estimated $327 billion in medical costs and lost work and wages (CDC, n.d.-a). Along with dietary
modifications, diabetes management includes insulin, non-insulin injectable diabetes drugs, and oral diabetes
drugs. This chapter will explore diabetes and the pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments for this disease
process.

28.1 Introduction to Diabetes

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 28.1.1 Describe the pathophysiology of type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
    · 28.1.2 Identify clinical manifestations of diabetes.
    · 28.1.3 Identify the etiology and diagnostic studies related to diabetes.
The islets of Langerhans are clusters of cells located in the pancreas. They are composed of alpha and beta cells,
which are crucial for glucose homeostasis. Alpha () cells produce glucagon, which breaks down glycogen into
glucose in the liver. Beta () cells secrete insulin, which regulates glucose metabolism and facilitates absorption of
glucose from the bloodstream into cells (see Figure 28.2). Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease that is
756  28 · Diabetic Drugs

     characterized by hyperglycemia associated with alterations in carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism (Dilworth
     et al., 2021).

     Type 1 Diabetes

     Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder that causes the body's immune system to attack and destroy the  cells
     in the pancreas that make insulin. As a consequence, the pancreas stops making insulin. Without insulin, glucose
     homeostasis is disrupted, resulting in glucose not being able to get into the cells of the body, thus causing elevated
     glucose levels in the blood. Because the body is destroying the  cells in the pancreas, clients with type 1 diabetes
     will need to take insulin for the rest of their lives to survive (Holt et al., 2021).

          TRENDING TODAY

      Type 1 Diabetes and Lantidra

       The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023) approved Lantidra (donislecel-jujn) (https://openstax.org/r/
       fdagovnewsevents), the first allogeneic (donor) pancreatic islet cellular therapy made from deceased donor
       pancreatic cells to treat type 1 diabetes. Lantidra is approved for the treatment of adults with type 1 diabetes
       who are unable to approach target glycated hemoglobin (average blood glucose levels) because of current
       repeated episodes of severe hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) despite intensive diabetes management and
       education.

     According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (n.d.-a), 1.6 million U.S. adults aged 20 years or older
     have type 1 diabetes. The onset of symptoms with type 1 diabetes is often sudden. It typically appears in
     adolescents and young adults but can occur in childhood as well. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes can be severe, and
     the disease process can be difficult to control. Risk factors include family history and age. White clients are more
     likely to develop type 1 diabetes than Black, Asian American, Hispanic, or Latino/Latina clients (CDC, 2022b).

     Type 2 Diabetes

     Type 2 diabetes occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or the body is not using insulin
     effectively. Figure 28.2 shows the mechanism of normal blood sugar absorption versus insulin resistance with type

2 diabetes. The  cells in the pancreas continue to have some degree of functionality with varying amounts of insulin
secretion, resulting in elevated blood glucose levels and insulin resistance. Type 2 diabetes may be managed with
healthy eating and being active, or the health care provider may prescribe insulin, other injectable medications, or
oral diabetic medicines to help clients manage blood sugar and avoid complications (CDC, n.d.-b).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (n.d.-b) reported that of the approximately 37 million U.S. adults
who have diabetes, approximately 90%-95% of them have type 2 diabetes. Unlike type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes
symptoms are gradual in onset. The disease typically appears in people over age 45; however, it is becoming more
common in children, adolescents, and young adults. Risk factors include having prediabetes, obesity, age 45 or
older, family history, sedentary lifestyle, fatty liver, and a history of gestational diabetes. Black, Alaska Native,
American Indian, Hispanic, and Latino/Latina people are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes (CDC, 2022b).

Gestational Diabetes

Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that can develop during pregnancy in clients who do not already have
diabetes. Testing for gestational diabetes usually occurs between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy (NIH, n.d.).
Gestational diabetes causes high blood glucose levels that can affect the pregnancy and the fetus. Symptoms are
usually unnoticeable; however, the client may exhibit signs of increased thirst and increased urination. Gestational
diabetes is controlled with dietary management and exercise. Pharmacologic methods are incorporated only if the
disease process is unmanageable with diet and exercise and only introduced if safe for both the pregnant person
and the fetus. Blood sugar levels typically return to baseline soon after the delivery of the newborn. Clients with
gestational diabetes are at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes as they age (American Diabetes Association,
n.d.-a).

Complications of Diabetes

Complications from diabetes can affect all body systems. They include cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular
disease, diabetic neuropathy, diabetic retinopathy, cataracts, glaucoma, periodontal disease, peripheral vascular
disease, foot damage, stroke, increased risk of infection, and poor wound healing.

Prevention

There is no known way to prevent type 1 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes can be prevented with lifestyle modifications
such as diet, exercise, weight loss, and developing a diabetes prevention program with the health care provider
(American Diabetes Association, n.d.-a).

Clinical Manifestations of Diabetes

Typical clinical manifestations of diabetes include polyuria (increased urination), polydipsia (increased thirst),
weight loss without trying, blurry vision or vision changes, paresthesia (tingling in the feet and hands), dry skin, and
fatigue (see Figure 28.3). Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia play a role in diabetes management and are discussed
in the following sections.

     system. (credit: modification of work "Main symptoms of diabetes" by Mikael Häggström, used with permission/Wikimedia Commons,
     Public Domain)

     Hypoglycemia

     Hypoglycemia occurs when the blood glucose level in the body falls below the normal range. The expected values
     for normal fasting blood glucose concentration are between 70 mg/dL and 100 mg/dL (World Health Organization
     [WHO], n.d.). When blood glucose levels are too low, the brain does not get enough glucose to function, which in its
     most severe form can cause coma and death. Signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia include feeling shaky, sweating/
     chills, clammy skin, dizziness/feeling faint, agitation, confusion, blurred or impaired vision, slurred speech, and
     tachycardia/bradycardia (American Diabetes Association, n.d.-c).

     Treatment of hypoglycemia includes the "15-15 rule": 15 grams of carbohydrates to raise the blood glucose level
     and a blood glucose monitoring check 15 minutes after administration of the carbohydrates. If the blood glucose
     level remains under 70 mg/dL, then glucose tablets or 15 grams of carbohydrates may be repeated until the blood
     glucose is at least 70 mg/dL. Glucagon may be used to treat clients with diabetes when their blood glucose is too
     low to treat using the 15-15 rule (American Diabetes Association, n.d.-c). Glucagon can be given intravenously,
     intramuscularly, or subcutaneously if the client is unable to eat or drink or if the client is unconscious.

     Hyperglycemia

     Hyperglycemia occurs when the blood glucose level in the body is above the normal range and the body has too
     little insulin or is too insulin resistant to lower the blood glucose level on its own. This causes a disruption in glucose
     homeostasis. If a blood glucose level is above 110 mg/dL, it is considered hyperglycemia. Symptoms vary per
     individual. Some clients may have mild symptoms with blood glucose levels between 110 mg/dL and 240 mg/dL.
     Severe symptoms can result in diabetic ketoacidosis, coma, and death. Signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia
     include frequent urination (polyuria), increased thirst (polydipsia), increased hunger (polyphagia), blurred vision,
     restlessness, unintentional weight loss, abdominal pain, vomiting, drowsiness, hot/dry skin, hypotension, and coma
     (American Diabetes Association, n.d.-b; Sapra & Bhandari, 2023).

     Treatment of hyperglycemia can be as simple as dietary management and exercise if blood glucose levels are
     110-240 mg/dL. However, if increasing fluid intake, diet, and exercise does not lower blood glucose levels, the
     individual will require an oral diabetes agent, insulin, and/or a non-insulin injectable drug to lower the blood glucose
     levels (American Diabetes Association, n.d.-b; Feingold, 2022).

  In this video, Dr. Margrethe Horlyck-Romanovsky discusses intra-ethnic diabetes disparities and how to improve
  diabetes risk assessments for diverse populations. She also discusses the ways in which immigrant status,
  ethnicity, and race can influence diabetes risk in populations of African descent.

Diagnostic Testing for Diabetes

There are several diagnostic tests to determine if a person has diabetes. Health care providers will typically use one
or more of the following tests to determine if an individual has diabetes.

Glycosylated Hemoglobin (A1c or HbA1c)
A glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) test, also known as a hemoglobin A1c or HbA1c test, measures the blood sugar
level over the past 90 days. It determines the amount of hemoglobin proteins that are coated with glucose. A HbA1c
below 5.7% is normal. A HbA1c between 5.7% and 6.4% represents prediabetes, and a level of 6.5% or higher
indicates diabetes (American Diabetes Association, n.d.-a).

Fasting Blood Glucose
A fasting blood glucose test measures the blood sugar level after an overnight fasting period. A fasting blood
glucose level of 99 mg/dL or lower is normal, 100-125 mg/dL indicates prediabetes, and 126 mg/dL or higher
indicates diabetes (American Diabetes Association, n.d.-a).

Random Blood Glucose
A random blood glucose test measures the blood sugar level at the time tested. This test can be taken at any time
of the day, and the individual being tested does not need to fast. A blood sugar level of 200 mg/dL or higher
indicates diabetes (American Diabetes Association, n.d.a).

Comorbidity Tests
Diabetes impacts multiple systems within the body. The health care provider may order additional testing to
determine the impact of diabetes on other body systems. These diagnostic tests will not determine if a client has
diabetes; however, they will help show how diabetes is impacting other systems. Typical diagnostic testing includes
complete blood cell count, basic metabolic panel, chest x-ray, echocardiogram, electrocardiogram,
electromyography, and other radiologic tests such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI).

     TRENDING TODAY

 Prediabetes

  More than one in three U.S. adults have prediabetes. As defined by the CDC, "a person with prediabetes has a
  blood sugar level higher than normal, but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. He or she is at higher risk
  for developing type 2 diabetes and other serious health problems, including heart disease and stroke" (Alvarez et
  al., 2023). To better address the growing numbers and problems associated with prediabetes and diabetes, U.S.
  Congress authorized the CDC to implement the National Diabetes Prevention Program. This program provides
  individuals with guidance regarding diabetes and lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of developing type 2
  diabetes and to better manage the disease process for those who already have type 2 diabetes.

28.2 Insulin and Non-Insulin Injectable Diabetes Drugs

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 28.2.1 Identify the characteristics of insulin and non-insulin injectable drugs used to treat diabetes.
    · 28.2.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, contraindications, and interactions of insulin

        and non-insulin injectable drugs used to treat diabetes.

    · 28.2.4 Explain the client education related to insulin and non-insulin injectable drugs used to treat

        diabetes.

Insulin

Insulin is released by ß cells from the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas after eating a meal. The carbohydrates
from the meal are broken down into glucose. As glucose enters the bloodstream, insulin is secreted and allows the
cells in muscles, fat, and the liver to absorb the glucose for energy (American Diabetes Association, n.d.-d). Insulin
not only is important for glucose homeostasis, but it also plays a role in lipid metabolism through lipolysis and
assists in protein metabolism through downregulation of hepatic and muscle enzymes, and its action within
endothelial cells and macrophages has an anti-inflammatory effect on the body.

Insulin has three characteristics: onset, peak, and duration. Onset is the length of time before insulin reaches the
bloodstream and begins to lower glucose levels. Peak time is discussed below. Duration is how long insulin
continues to lower blood glucose levels.

Peak Time
Peak time is when insulin is at its maximum strength in terms of lowering blood glucose levels. Individuals are at a
higher risk of developing hypoglycemia symptoms when insulin is peaking (American Diabetes Association, n.d.-d).

Types of Insulin
There are different types of insulin based on the client's needs. In this chapter, rapid-acting, short-acting,
intermediate-acting, and long-acting insulins, as well as premixed insulins, will be discussed. Insulins are typically
clear except for insulin isophane NPH, which is cloudy.

     SAFETY ALERT

 Insulin-Independent Double Checks

      · Double-check to ensure the correct type of insulin is being administered, especially if the client is taking
          more than one type of insulin. Perform independent double checks on the vial and dose of insulin.

      · Only use insulin syringes to administer insulin.
      · Double-check client identifiers, type, product, dose, and measured dose of insulin prior to administering

          the drug to the client to decrease the risk of medication error.

Rapid-Acting Insulin
Rapid-acting insulin begins to work approximately 15-30 minutes after injection. It peaks in 1-2 hours after
injection, and its duration is 2-4 hours. Insulin aspart (Novolog), insulin glulisine (Apidra), and insulin lispro
(Humalog) are rapid-acting insulins (DailyMed, Novolog, 2021; DailyMed Apidra, 2023; DailyMed, Humalog, 2022).

Short-Acting Insulin
Short-acting insulin, also known as regular insulin, begins to work within 30 minutes to 1 hour after injection. It
peaks in 2-3 hours after injection, and its duration is 3-6 hours. Human regular insulin (Humulin R and Novolin R) is
a short-acting insulin (DailyMed, Humulin R, 2023; DailyMed, Novolin R, 2022).

Intermediate-Acting Insulin
Intermediate-acting insulin begins to work 2-4 hours after injection. It peaks in 4-12 hours, and its duration is
12-18 hours. Insulin isophane NPH (Humulin N and Novolin N) is a type of intermediate-acting insulin (DailyMed,
762  28 · Diabetic Drugs

     Humulin N, 2023; DailyMed, Novolin N, 2022).

     Long-Acting Insulin
     Long-acting insulin begins to work 1-2 hours after injection. It has no peak time and acts to lower blood glucose
     levels up to 24 hours. Insulin degludec (Tresiba), insulin detemir (Levemir), and insulin glargine (Lantus) are long-
     acting insulins (DailyMed, Tresiba, 2022; DailyMed, Lantus, 2022).

     Premixed Insulin
     Premixed insulin combines intermediate- and short-acting insulin into a single injection. These injections are usually
     taken 10 to 30 minutes before breakfast and dinner to provide both basal and mealtime coverage.

     Administration of Insulin
     Insulin typically comes as an injectable source because it needs to bypass the first pass of digestion for absorbtion
     due to its instability in the presence of gastric acid. Insulin is injected into the subcutaneous tissue via an insulin
     syringe, insulin pen, or insulin pump. Injection sites for insulin are located primarily on the abdomen, back of the
     upper arm, lower back, buttocks, and upper outer thigh (see Figure 28.4). The rate of absorption depends on the
     injection site. Insulin injection sites should be rotated to prevent fatty deposits and site irritation (American
     Diabetes Association, n.d.-d).

Methods of Insulin Dosing
Most insulin is given on a carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio via a fixed-dose insulin method with an insulin syringe
(American Diabetes Association, n.d.-d). Fixed-dose therapy can apply to clients who take one injection a day and to
clients taking multiple injections per day. With fixed-dose insulin therapy, a client will take the same amount of
insulin at a specific time each day; for example, take 30 units of insulin at breakfast each day and 20 units at dinner
each day. Because the doses stay the same from one day to another, the client will need to eat a specific amount of
carbohydrates for each meal (Diabetes.co.uk, 2023).

In health care settings such as a hospital or a nursing home, insulin may also be administered via a sliding scale
coverage method. The sliding scale method typically uses a short-acting insulin (Migdal et al., 2021). The dose of
insulin is based on the blood glucose level just before a meal, which is taken using a glucometer.

Although still commonly used in health care settings, sliding scale insulin has become controversial in recent years
because it has not been shown to control blood glucose levels very well. Sliding scale insulin dosing not only has
demonstrated poor blood glucose control, but also does not reflect a person's current insulin needs based on their
diet, weight, and insulin history. Currently, it is recommended that basal insulin dosing be used instead of sliding
scale for glycemic control. With basal dosing, a long-acting insulin is administered to keep insulin levels steady
throughout the day, and then a rapid-acting insulin is administered during mealtimes to regulate spikes in blood
glucose levels after meals (Migdal et al., 2021).

Insulin Pen
An insulin pen is a pen-shaped injector device that combines insulin and a syringe in one unit. Insulin pens are
prefilled with an insulin cartridge or have a prefilled insulin reservoir. The pens have a dial, and disposable needles
can be attached to the pen. Insulin pens are relatively easy to use and convenient. To use an insulin pen, the client
should twist on a needle, dial the dose as prescribed by the health care provider, and inject into the subcutaneous
site. The needle is then thrown away into a sharps container, and the pen is placed in a safe area until the next dose
of insulin is due (American Diabetes Association, n.d.-d).

Pens are disposable after all of the insulin in the pen has been used or the pen has expired. Pens are often color-
coded to make it easier to recognize the type of insulin the pen contains. Pens are portable and can be used
discreetly in public places when needed (American Diabetes Association, n.d.-d).
764  28 · Diabetic Drugs

          CLINICAL TIP

      Insulin Pens

       Insulin pens should never be used for more than one person or for someone other than the person they were
       prescribed for. Regurgitation of blood into the insulin cartridge or reservoir can occur after injection. The risk of
       blood-borne pathogen transmission increases if the insulin pen is used on more than one person (CDC, 2022a).

     Insulin Pump and Continuous Glucose Monitoring
     An insulin pump is a small, computerized infusion set device that delivers insulin. Doses of a rapid-acting insulin are
     supplied through a flexible catheter that has been inserted through the skin into the subcutaneous tissue. Insulin
     pumps are often integrated with a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), which is a device that monitors blood
     glucose levels on a continual basis. CGMs decrease the need for finger sticks and blood sampling with a glucometer.
     CGMs are applied to the back of the arm, abdomen, or upper gluteal areas and covered with a bandage. These
     devices need to be changed every 10-14 days. CGMs are accompanied by an app that synchronizes with the sensor
     in the device. This allows for easy and portable blood glucose tracking. Insulin pumps and CGMs have been
     successfully utilized across all age groups (American Diabetes Association, n.d.-d).

     Insulin pumps are set to deliver a small dose of insulin continuously. This is called a basal dose insulin, and it
     mimics the body's normal release of insulin. The basal dose insulin is calculated and programmed by the health care
     provider based on the client's glycemic needs. A bolus dose insulin may also be delivered by the insulin pump close
     to mealtimes to control the rise in blood glucose levels after a meal (American Diabetes Association, n.d.-d).

          LINK TO LEARNING

      Insulin Pumps (https://openstax.org/r/clevelandclinicorg)

       The Cleveland Clinic presents information on insulin pumps, reasons they are used, and how to wear an insulin
       pump. It provides a video on insulin pumps as well as information on risks and benefits.

     Intravenous Insulin
     Intravenous insulin is administered by a health care professional to a client in a health care setting. Insulin is
     administered directly into the bloodstream via an intravenous catheter. Intravenous insulin is used to treat
     hyperglycemic emergencies and other conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar (extremely high
     glucose) states, and hyperkalemia. Human regular insulin is typically the only insulin given intravenously; however,
     according to Rubin, Khanna, and McIver (2022), insulin aspart, a rapid-acting insulin, may be administered through
     a subcutaneous infusion via pump or intravenously as a diluted solution with close monitoring of blood glucose and
     serum potassium levels. Once the insulin is injected into the intravenous catheter, it only takes a few minutes for it
     to enter the bloodstream and to start working to lower blood glucose levels. Intravenous insulin therapy is typically
     administered short term for a period of 3-12 hours and requires close monitoring by a health care professional
     (Thota & Akbar, 2022).

     Intravenous insulin can be administered via a bolus dose method and/or as a titrated insulin drip requiring an
     infusion device. A bolus dose of insulin is administered via the intravenous line when rapid reduction of blood
     glucose levels is needed, such as with a severe hyperglycemic state like diabetic ketoacidosis (Dhatariya et al.,
     2020).

     A titrated intravenous insulin drip, also called an insulin infusion, may be required to assist with reducing severely
     elevated blood glucose levels when a bolus dose of intravenous insulin alone does not assist in reaching the
     targeted blood glucose level for the client. Titrated insulin drips provide 1 unit of a rapid-acting or short-acting
     insulin per milliliter of 0.9% sodium chloride. The titrated insulin drips are typically started at 1 unit/hour and
     titrated based on the facility's protocol in association with the client's blood glucose level. For example, if the
     client's blood glucose level is 111-140 mg/dL, the titrated insulin drip is set to infuse at 1 unit/hour; if the client's
     blood glucose level is 141-175 mg/dL, the titrated insulin drip is set to infuse at 2 units/hour. Blood glucose levels
     are checked hourly, and the insulin infusion is titrated based on the blood glucose levels until the client reaches

glucose homeostasis. Once the client has reached glucose homeostasis, subcutaneous insulin is administered, and
the client is weaned off of the titrated insulin drip (Dhatariya et al., 2020).

   CLINICAL TIP

Titrate Insulin Drip to Subcutaneous Insulin

The nurse or health care provider should check blood glucose levels 1 hour prior to discontinuing the titrated
insulin drip. The first dose of subcutaneous insulin should be administered prior to discontinuing the titrated
insulin drip. The titrated insulin drip should be continued for 30-60 minutes after the subcutaneous insulin
injection to prevent rebound hyperglycemia (Dhatariya et al., 2020).

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Insulin is a natural hormone present in the body. In clients with diabetes, insulin use as a medication is generally
safe and effective; however, there can be certain adverse effects and contraindications associated with its use.

Typical adverse effects of all types of insulin include hypoglycemia (symptoms include shakiness, dizziness,
sweating, confusion, and, in severe cases, loss of consciousness), weight gain (due to an increased glucose uptake
and storage in cells), injection site reactions (such as redness, swelling, or itching), lipodystrophy (fat tissue changes
from repeated use of the same injection site), and fluid retention (swelling in the legs and feet).

Contraindications include hypersensitivity to the components in the insulin, especially animal-derived insulins.
Caution should be used in clients with medical conditions that cause fluid retention, such as heart failure and renal
failure (as insulin can cause additional fluid retention leading to volume overload), and in clients with liver failure (as
insulin is metabolized by the liver).

Non-Insulin Injectable Drugs

Non-insulin injectable drugs provide an alternative to insulin therapy for clients with diabetes. They act on
766  28 · Diabetic Drugs

     hormones that are secreted along with insulin by the pancreas to control glucose homeostasis. These drugs were
     first approved for use in the United States in 2005 (Feingold, 2022; Campbell, 2021).

     Amylin Analogs
     Amylin is a hormone secreted along with insulin by the pancreas in response to food intake. In 2005, pramlintide
     (Symlin) was the first FDA-approved amylin analog non-insulin injectable drug. This drug can be used for clients with
     diabetes who are taking insulin. Pramlintide slows gastric emptying and blocks the release of glucagon from the liver
     after a meal. This drug is administered before mealtimes. Adverse effects include nausea, loss of appetite, fatigue,
     headache, and weight loss. It is contraindicated in clients with hypersensitivity to amylin analogs or who have
     hypoglycemia or gastroparesis (Maikawa et al., 2020; Campbell, 2021).

     Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) Receptor Agonists
     GLP-1 receptor agonists are a class of non-insulin injectable drugs that impact the gut hormone incretin, which
     works to increase insulin secretion in response to meals. These drugs help the pancreas release insulin after eating,
     limit glucagon, and slow down digestion. GLP-1 receptor agonists are approved for type 2 diabetes treatment. They
     have not yet been approved for type 1 diabetes management. Adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
     abdominal discomfort, and loss of appetite. Contraindications include hypersensitivity to GLP-1 receptor agonists,
     medullary thyroid carcinoma, and multiple endocrine neoplasia (Feingold, 2022).

          CLINICAL TIP

      GLP-1 Receptor Agonists

       Hypoglycemic reactions are greater when GLP-1 receptor agonists are used with sulfonylureas and insulin.
       Clients should be monitored closely for signs of hypoglycemia (Feingold, 2022).

     Dulaglutide
     Dulaglutide (Trulicity) is taken once a week at any time of day, with or without food. It can be used in combination
     with sulfonylureas, non-sulfonylurea biguanides, thiazolidinediones, and insulin. Adverse effects include nausea,
     diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, indigestion, fatigue, and weight loss (Jódar et al., 2022).

     Exenatide
     Exenatide (Byetta) is taken twice a day, 1-2 hours before a meal. It can be used in combination with sulfonylureas,
     non-sulfonylureas biguanides, thiazolidinediones, and insulin. Adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, decreased
     appetite, and weight loss (Wysham et al., 2020).

     Exenatide extended release (Bydureon) is taken once every 7 days. It can be used in combination with
     sulfonylureas, non-sulfonylureas biguanides, and thiazolidinediones. It should not be administered with exenatide
     (Byetta) or used in combination with insulin. Adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, and
     weight loss (Wysham et al., 2020).

     Liraglutide
     Liraglutide (Victoza) is taken once a day at any time of the day regardless of mealtimes. It can be used in
     combination with sulfonylureas, non-sulfonylureas biguanides, and thiazolidinediones. Adverse effects include
     headache, nausea, diarrhea, decreased appetite, and weight loss (He et al., 2019).

     Tirzepatide
     Tirzepatide (Mounjaro) is taken once a week at any time of day, with or without meals. Adverse effects include
     nausea, diarrhea, decreased appetite, vomiting, constipation, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain (DailyMed, Mounjaro,
     2023).

     Semaglutide
     Semaglutide (Ozempic) is taken once a week at any time of the day regardless of mealtimes. It can be used in
     combination with sulfonylureas, non-sulfonylureas biguanides, thiazolidinediones, and insulin. Adverse effects
     include nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, weight loss, and constipation (Smits & Van Raalte,
     2021).

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Adverse effects of amylin analogs include hypoglycemic symptoms (shakiness, dizziness, sweating, confusion, and,
in severe cases, loss of consciousness), gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and
loss of appetite), and injection site reactions.

Contraindications include hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components and in clients with medullary thyroid
cancer and multiple endocrine neoplasia (as these drugs can exacerbate these conditions). Caution should be used
in clients with gastroparesis as amylin analogs may further slow down gastric emptying, in clients with severe renal
impairment as the drugs are excreted in the urine and can further impair renal function, and in clients with hepatic
insufficiency due to the drugs being metabolized by the liver and thus can impede liver functioning.

     Nursing Implications

     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking insulin and non-insulin injectable diabetes drugs:

     · Assess the client's knowledge about diabetes, signs and symptoms, and treatment and clarify any gaps in
        knowledge.

     · Assess and monitor the client for adverse effects, drug and food interactions, and contraindications.
     · Refer client to social services for obstacles in obtaining prescribed drugs, test strips, or a glucometer.
     · Provide client teaching regarding the drug, how to administer an injection, and when to call the health care

        provider. See below for client teaching.

     CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

     The client using an insulin or non-insulin injectable diabetes drug should:

         · Report symptoms of hypoglycemia such as headache, nervousness, sweating, clammy skin, tremor, and
             tachycardia.

         · Report symptoms of hyperglycemia such as increased thirst, increased urine output, hot/dry skin, and
             sweet, fruity breath odor.

         · Keep 15 grams of carbohydrates on hand in case of a hypoglycemic reaction. Orange juice, graham
             crackers, and hard candy are appropriate carbohydrate choices during hypoglycemia.

· Show family members and their support system how to administer glucagon during a hypoglycemic
   reaction if the client cannot eat or drink or is unconscious.

· Store insulin in a refrigerator at approximately 36-46°F.
· Store non-insulin injectables per manufacturer's packaging.
· Ask the health care provider prior to taking any OTC drugs or herbal supplements with insulin and non-

   insulin injectables because they may increase the risk of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.
· Keep a blood glucose journal for tracking blood glucose levels.
· Rotate insulin injection sites to prevent fatty deposits and injection site reactions.
· Eat an appropriate diet as prescribed and as scheduled with their insulin routine.
· Use safety with injectable syringes and needles and dispose of them properly.

  FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

  GLP-1 Receptor Agonists

  GLP-1 receptor agonists should not be taken if a client has a history of medullary thyroid cancer or multiple
  endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2.

28.3 Oral Antidiabetic Drugs

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 28.3.1 Identify the characteristics of oral diabetes drugs.
    · 28.3.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, contraindications, and interactions of oral

        diabetes drugs.
    · 28.3.3 Describe nursing implications of oral diabetes drugs.
    · 28.3.4 Explain the client education related to oral diabetes drugs.

Oral diabetes drugs are used to treat type 2 diabetes. They are ineffective with type 1 diabetes because type 1
diabetic  cells are not functioning. These drugs lower blood glucose levels in various ways, such as stimulating
insulin production from  cells, decreasing insulin resistance, slowing glucose absorption from the gastrointestinal
tract, and altering the release of glucose by the liver (American Diabetes Association, n.d.-a).

Sulfonylureas

Sulfonylureas are a group of diabetes drugs that bind to potassium channels on  cells and stimulate them to
produce more insulin. They are effective in clients with diabetes who have functioning  cells. They are not effective
in all clients with type 2 diabetes. Sulfonylureas may lose their effectiveness over time, requiring an increase in
dosage (Costello et al., 2022).

     SAFETY ALERT

 Sulfonylureas

  Sulfonylureas should be used cautiously with beta blockers. Beta blockers can mask the early symptoms of
  hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia and tremors. Also, when taken with a sulfonylurea, a nonselective beta
  blocker can prevent the body from compensating for hypoglycemia, resulting in critically low levels especially
  when the client is sleeping (Costello et al., 2022; Dimakos et al., 2023).

First-Generation Short-Acting Sulfonylureas
First-generation short-acting sulfonylureas lower blood glucose levels by causing the pancreas to produce insulin.
These drugs were previously used along with diet, exercise, and, at times, other diabetes drugs to control type 2
diabetes; however, they have been discontinued for use in the United States with the development of second-
generation sulfonylureas (Costello et al., 2022).
770  28 · Diabetic Drugs

     Second-Generation Sulfonylureas
     Second-generation sulfonylureas increase insulin secretion through the pancreatic  cells. They are used along with
     diet, exercise, and sometimes other diabetes drugs to control glucose levels. Second-generation sulfonylureas
     typically have lower dosing, a longer duration of action, and fewer side effects than first-generation sulfonylureas.
     These drugs are metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine. They should be used cautiously in clients with
     hepatic and renal impairment. Dosage usually begins with a low dose and is increased based on the client's glucose
     control needs (Costello et al., 2022).

     Glipizide
     Glipizide is a second-generation sulfonylurea that stimulates the pancreas to produce insulin, thereby lowering
     blood glucose levels. Glipizide is used along with diet and exercise to improve glucose homeostasis in adults with
     type 2 diabetes. Glipizide comes in tablet form and should be taken 30 minutes before the first meal of the day. It
     also comes in an extended-release form. The extended-release form should not be chewed, crushed, or broken and
     should be swallowed whole. The extended-release form should be taken with the first meal of the day.

     Adverse effects of glipizide include headache, irritability, sweating, tachycardia, dizziness, nausea, blurred vision,
     feeling shaky, hypoglycemia, drowsiness, tremor, insomnia, myalgia, weight gain, and paresthesia. Serious adverse
     effects include agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatic failure, and syndrome of inappropriate
     antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Liver enzymes should be monitored closely when using this drug (National Library of
     Medicine, 2022b).

     Glyburide
     Glyburide is a second-generation sulfonylurea that stimulates the pancreas to produce insulin. Glyburide is used
     along with diet and exercise to control glucose levels. It comes in tablet form and is taken once or twice daily.
     Adverse effects include indigestion, flatulence, arthralgia (joint pain), blurred vision, dizziness, hypoglycemia, and
     irritability. This medication should be used cautiously with beta blockers because severe hypoglycemia may occur
     when they are taken together (National Library of Medicine, 2022c).

     Glimepiride
     Glimepiride, like glyburide and glipizide, is a second-generation sulfonylurea used along with diet and exercise to
     control blood glucose levels in the body. It is often used along with insulin to treat type 2 diabetes. Glimepiride
     comes in tablet form and is taken once daily with the first meal of the day. Adverse effects include dizziness, nausea,
     jaundice, upper abdominal pain, diarrhea, hypoglycemia, blurred vision, weight gain, and elevated serum alanine
     aminotransferase (ALT) levels (National Library of Medicine, 2022a; DailyMed, Glimepiride, 2021).

     Non-Sulfonylurea Biguanides

     Non-sulfonylurea biguanides are a group of oral diabetes drugs that prevent the production of glucose in the liver.
     They improve the body's sensitivity to insulin and reduce the amount of glucose absorbed by the intestines. Non-
     sulfonylurea biguanides are used to treat type 2 diabetes (Corcoran & Jacobs, 2022).

     Metformin is a non-sulfonylurea biguanide. It is used to treat type 2 diabetes along with diet, exercise, and
     sometimes other diabetes drugs or insulin. Metformin comes as an immediate release tablet, an extended-release
     tablet, and an oral solution. Adverse effects include dizziness, headache, weakness, hypoglycemia, palpitations,
     flushing, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and flatulence. Metformin should be used cautiously in older clients and in
     clients with renal and hepatic impairments. Clients should not drink alcohol while taking metformin (Corcoran &
     Jacobs, 2022).

          SAFETY ALERT

      Metformin and Contrast Dye

       Contrast dye can increase the risk of lactic acidosis (when lactic acid production exceeds lactic acid clearance in
       the body) in clients who are taking metformin and have decreased renal function. Metformin should be withheld
       24 hours prior to and for 48 hours after contrast dye administration if the estimated glomerular filtration rate
       (eGFR) is less than 30 mL/min (Yale School of Medicine, 2022).

  FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

  Metformin

  Lactic acidosis is a rare but potentially severe consequence of therapy with the non-sulfonylurea biguanide
  metformin.

Alpha-Glucosidase Inhibitors

Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors lower blood glucose levels by inhibiting enzymes such as amylase, maltase, and
sucrose in the GI tract, thus delaying the digestion and intestinal absorption of carbohydrates (Akmal & Wadhwa,
2022).

Acarbose
Acarbose was the prototype alpha-glucosidase inhibitor. It delays digestion and absorption of carbohydrates to
diminish the increase in blood glucose levels after meals. Acarbose is rapid acting and peaks in 1 hour. It is
metabolized by the GI tract and excreted in the urine and feces. Adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
malabsorption, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. It is contraindicated for use in clients with severe renal
and hepatic impairments (Feingold, 2022).

Miglitol
Miglitol slows the digestion of carbohydrates. It is used in combination with diet, exercise, and sometimes other
drugs to control blood glucose levels. It is rapidly absorbed and excreted in the urine. Adverse effects include
bloating, flatulence, diarrhea, and abdominal pain or cramping (Feingold, 2022).

Thiazolidinediones

Thiazolidinediones lower blood glucose levels by decreasing insulin resistance. They are referred to as "glitazones"
or "insulin sensitizers" (Feingold, 2022; Eggleton & Jialal, 2023).

Pioglitazone hydrochloride is a thiazolidinedione that is used along with diet and exercise to decrease blood glucose
levels. It works to enhance the body's response to insulin, thereby decreasing glucose in the blood. Adverse effects
include muscle pain, weight gain, sore throat, blurred vision, and tooth problems. Pioglitazone hydrochloride is
contraindicated in those with liver impairment (Feingold, 2022).

Meglitinides

Meglitinides lower blood glucose levels by stimulating the pancreas to secrete insulin. This class of drug has the
potential to produce rapid, short-lived insulin output in those with type 2 diabetes. Because of the rapid onset and
short duration of action with these drugs, they should be administered 1-30 minutes prior to meals (Feingold,
2022).

Repaglinide is a meglitinide that works in clients with type 2 diabetes by closing potassium channels in the
pancreatic beta cells, thereby increasing insulin secretion, which lowers glucose levels in the blood. It is absorbed
through the GI tract and peaks in 1-1.5 hours. Metabolism occurs in the liver, and it is excreted in the urine and
feces. Adverse effects include GI upset, upper respiratory infections, and hypoglycemia. It is contraindicated for use
in those with type 1 diabetes and those with diabetic ketoacidosis (Feingold, 2022).

Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 (DDP 4) Inhibitors

Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors block the action of dipeptidyl peptidase 4, an enzyme that destroys incretin.
Incretin helps the body produce insulin only when it is needed to reduce the excess amount of glucose being
produced by the liver. DDP 4 inhibitors are used to treat type 2 diabetes (Kasina & Baradhi, 2022).

Sitagliptin
Sitagliptin is a DDP 4 inhibitor used to treat type 2 diabetes. It is rapidly absorbed, peaks in 1-4 hours, and has a
12-hour half-life. It is mainly excreted through the urine. Adverse effects include runny nose, sore throat, headache,
and upper respiratory infections. Hypoglycemia may occur when used in combination with other drugs. Sitagliptin is
772  28 · Diabetic Drugs

     contraindicated in those with congestive heart failure (Zhou et al., 2019).

     Linagliptin
     Linagliptin, like sitagliptin, is a DDP 4 inhibitor used to treat type 2 diabetes. It is rapidly absorbed and long acting. It
     peaks in 1.5 hours and has a 12-hour half-life. Adverse effects include bloating, skin rash, stomach pain, back pain,
     and joint pain. It should be used cautiously in those with hypersensitivity, exfoliative dermatitis, or bronchial
     hypersensitivity (Gharabaghi et al., 2022).

     Selective Sodium Glucose Transporter 2 (SGLT2)

     Selective sodium glucose transporter 2 drugs are used to treat clients with type 2 diabetes. SGLT2 drugs lower
     blood glucose levels by blocking the reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys and promoting the excretion of glucose
     in the urine (Padda et al., 2022).

     Dapagliflozin
     Dapagliflozin is an SGLT2 drug that reduces reabsorption of filtered glucose and thereby promotes urinary glucose
     excretion. It is rapidly absorbed and peaks in 2 hours. It is metabolized in the liver and excreted mainly in the urine.
     Adverse effects include increased urination, skin rash, dehydration, hypotension, back pain, and genital infections
     including UTIs. It is contraindicated in those with renal impairment (Dhillon, 2019).

     Empagliflozin
     Empagliflozin is an SGLT2 drug that is rapidly absorbed. It peaks in 1.5 hours. Empagliflozin is metabolized by the
     liver and excreted mainly in the urine. Adverse effects include increased urination, bladder pain, painful urination,
     vaginal irritation or discharge, and pain during intercourse. It is contraindicated in those with renal impairment (Sizar
     et al., 2022).

     Fixed Combination Oral Diabetes Drugs

     Fixed combination oral diabetes drug therapy may be required in the control of type 2 diabetes. Combination oral
     diabetes drug therapy is used when monotherapy, diet, and exercise alone cannot control blood glucose levels.
     Although in the past these drugs were taken as separate tablets, several fixed-dose single-tablet combinations have
     been manufactured (Kalra et al., 2020).

       In this video, Lisa Kroon, a Doctor of Pharmacy, describes general treatments for glycemic control
       (hyperglycemia) in people with type 2 diabetes.

     Glyburide-Metformin
     Glyburide-metformin is a combination of a second-generation sulfonylurea and a non-sulfonylurea biguanide. It is
     used in conjunction with diet and exercise for clients with type 2 diabetes that was not controlled with a
     monotherapy diabetes drug. Dosing is a combined tablet of 1.25 mg glyburide and 250 mg metformin one to two
     times daily. The maximum dose is 20 mg glyburide and 2000 mg metformin daily. It is not recommended for use in
     children. Adverse effects include blurred vision, drowsiness, excessive hunger, headache, nausea, nervousness,
     sore throat, and unusual tiredness. Glyburide-metformin is contraindicated in those with severe renal and liver
     impairment. Those with congestive heart failure should use it cautiously because this drug may increase the risk of
     myocardial infarction (Shuster et al., 2020).

     Sitagliptin-Metformin
     Sitagliptin-metformin is a fixed-dose combination diabetes drug that combines a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor
     and a non-sulfonylurea biguanide. Sitagliptin-metformin is used to treat type 2 diabetes when the diet, exercise, and
     monotherapy diabetes drugs were ineffective. The recommended starting dose in clients not currently treated with
     metformin is 50 mg sitagliptin and 500 mg metformin HCl twice daily, with gradual dose escalation recommended to
     reduce gastrointestinal side effects associated with metformin. The starting dose in clients already treated with

metformin should provide sitagliptin dosed as 50 mg twice daily (100 mg total daily dose) and the dose of
metformin already being taken. For clients taking metformin HCl 850 mg twice daily, the recommended starting
dose of sitagliptin-metformin is 50 mg sitagliptin and 1000 mg metformin HCl twice daily. The maximum
recommended daily dose is 100 mg of sitagliptin and 2000 mg of metformin hydrochloride (HCl). Adverse effects
include diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, hypoglycemia, EKG
changes, pancreatitis, acute renal failure, myalgia, and pain in extremity (DailyMed, Sitagliptin, 2023; He et al.,
2021).

Liraglutide-Insulin Degludec
Liraglutide-insulin degludec is a fixed-dose combination of liraglutide and insulin degludec. It is used to treat type 2
diabetes when diet, exercise, and drug monotherapy were ineffective. It comes in a subcutaneous pen similar to an
insulin pen. The pen is a combined dose of insulin degludec 50 units and liraglutide 1.8 mg. Adult and pediatric
dosing is based on the client's blood glucose level and must be determined by the health care provider. Adverse
effects include bloating, blurred vision, chills, confusion, constipation, dry mouth, headache, hives, increased
hunger, lightheadedness, muscle aches, nausea, sweating, tachycardia, and trouble swallowing. It is
contraindicated in those with hypoglycemia, pancreatitis, and hypersensitivity (DailyMed Victoza, Liraglutide
injection, 2023).

     Hypoglycemia Drugs

     Hypoglycemia drugs raise blood glucose levels. These drugs are used to treat severe hypoglycemia and
     hypoglycemic reactions that are often associated with diabetes. They are used after conservative measures to treat
     severe hypoglycemia are ineffective (Mathew & Thoppil, 2022).

     Glucagon
     Glucagon is a hormone secreted by alpha () cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. Glucagon increases
     blood glucose levels by stimulating glycogen breakdown in the liver. Peak time is 15 minutes after dosing. Glucagon
     comes as an injectable and as a nasal spray. Adult and pediatric dosing is based on the client's age and weight.
     Glucagon is used when the client is semiconscious, unconscious, or unable to ingest sugar-containing food. Blood
     glucose levels should be reassessed 15 minutes after administering this drug. Adverse effects include nausea,
     vomiting, and temporary tachycardia. Glucagon is contraindicated in clients with hypersensitivity and with known
     pheochromocytoma (Morris & Baker, 2022).

     Diazoxide
     Diazoxide is a non-diuretic benzothiadiazine and works by inhibiting insulin release from the pancreas by opening
     potassium channels in the beta cell membrane. It is used to treat hypoglycemia in clients with hyperinsulinemia.
     This drug is also a vasodilator and used to treat hypertensive emergencies. It is rapidly absorbed and highly protein
     bound. Diazoxide is metabolized by the liver and mainly excreted by the kidneys. The usual adult daily oral dosage is
     3-8 mg/kg, divided into two or three equal doses every 8 or 12 hours. Its onset is 1 hour, and its duration is 8 hours.
     Adverse effects include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tachycardia, palpitations, and increased uric
     acid levels. Diazoxide is contraindicated in clients with a hypersensitivity to sulfonamide and thiazide diuretics (Chen
     et al., 2021).

     note for metformin).

Adverse Effects and Contraindications

Common adverse effects of oral diabetes drugs include gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
abdominal discomfort), hypoglycemia (symptoms include dizziness, shakiness, sweating/chills, clammy skin, feeling
faint, agitation, confusion, blurred or impaired vision), fluid retention, weight gain, and headache.
776  28 · Diabetic Drugs

     Contraindications include hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components, severe kidney disorders (as most of
     these drugs are excreted in the urine and can further impair renal function), hepatic insufficiency (as most of these
     drugs are metabolized by the liver and can result in further impaired hepatic function), and disorders with fluid
     retention (such as heart failure and renal failure, as these drugs can cause additional fluid retention and volume
     overload).

 · Assess the client's knowledge about diabetes, signs and symptoms, and treatment and clarify any gaps in
     knowledge.

 · Monitor blood glucose levels as ordered and as needed when symptoms of hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia are
     present.

 · Provide client teaching regarding how the drug is administered and when to call the health care provider. See
     below for client teaching guidelines.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking an oral diabetes drug should:

    · Report symptoms of hypoglycemia such as headache, nervousness, sweating, clammy skin, tremor, and
        tachycardia.

    · Report symptoms of hyperglycemia such as increased thirst, increased urine output, hot/dry skin, sweet,
        fruity breath odor, and ketones in urine.

    · Keep 15 grams of carbohydrates on hand in case of a hypoglycemic reaction. Orange juice, graham
        crackers, and hard candy are appropriate carbohydrate choices during hypoglycemia.

    · Show family members and their support system how to administer glucagon during a hypoglycemic
        reaction if the client cannot eat or drink or is unconscious.

    · Keep a blood glucose journal for tracking blood glucose levels.
    · Make lifestyle modifications as directed by their health care provider, such as diet, exercise, and weight

        loss, to help control blood glucose levels.

The client taking an oral diabetes drug should not:

    · Drink alcohol with oral diabetes agents because it may impair hepatic function.

INTRODUCTION The digestive system is continuously at work, yet people seldom appreciate the complex tasks it
executes in a choreographed biologic performance. Eating may be one of the simple pleasures in life, but digesting
even one apple requires the coordinated work of many organs. This chapter will introduce the digestive system and
some common conditions that can alter any one of its functions.

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 29.1.2 Discuss common conditions that affect the gastrointestinal system and oral cavity.

Gastrointestinal System

The digestive system consists of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and accessory organs. The GI tract is also known as
the alimentary canal. Together with the accessory organs, the GI tract provides nutrition and hydration to the body
through the processes of ingestion, digestion, absorption, and metabolism. A healthy GI system with functional
digestive processes is essential to break down and absorb nutrients from food and liquids to provide energy and
growth to the human body. The ability to assimilate nutrients and hydration is crucial to cellular maintenance and
repair. The final phase of digestion is to eliminate waste material not used by the body.

     The GI tract and accessory organs form one continuous structure from the mouth to the anus (Figure 29.2).
     Ingestion is the process of taking in food, generally by the mouth. Digestion is a systematic process that breaks
     down food into its simplest form to promote absorption and moves this food and fluids through the GI tract. The
     complex digestive process starts with the mastication process as a person uses their teeth to bite and chew food.
     This is referred to as the mechanical phase of digestion. In the mouth, the food mixes with saliva from the salivary
     glands. Muscles in the pharynx allow the mixed food to be swallowed as a bolus. The bolus continues to travel
     through the GI tract, passing through the esophagus into the stomach. The stomach is the basic organ of digestion.
     The stomach further mixes the bolus and blends it with acidic gastric juices and pepsin to digest protein. This
     process produces chyme. At this point, the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder further aid the digestive process by
     adding bile and bicarbonate before the chyme is released into the small intestine. These substances help protect
     the small intestine from being destroyed by the acidic chyme. The digestive enzymes and hydrochloric (HCl) acid
     are part of the chemical phase of digestion, which continues as the food travels to the small intestine. Nutrients are
     absorbed into the blood or lymph in the small intestine. Water, along with some vitamins and minerals, is absorbed
     in the large intestine. Material not assimilated and absorbed results in waste products that leave the body through
     the anus. Table 29.1 provides an overview of the organs of the GI system and their functions.

       Major Organs of the GI System            Function
       Mouth/oral cavity
                                                When food enters the mouth for nourishment,
       Pharynx                                  processes of sensory stimulation, mechanical
                                                processing, and lubrication begin. The salivary glands

                                                starches. Lipase is secreted by the salivary glands to
                                                break down fats.

                                                Commonly called the throat, the pharynx is a

  Major Organs of the GI System               Function
  Esophagus
                                              The esophagus empties food materials into the
  Stomach                                     stomach through peristalsis during swallowing. It
                                              secretes large amounts of mucus, which helps
  Small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, ileum)  lubricate food.

  Gallbladder
                                              The small intestine is responsible for the absorption of
TABLE 29.1 Gastrointestinal System Organs     90%-95% of food with the aid of the pancreatic
                                              enzymes (amylase, trypsin, and lipase) and enzymes
                                              secreted in the intestine (maltase, sucrase, lactase,
                                              and peptidase).

                                              The large intestine receives unabsorbed and
                                              undigested food material (waste products), absorbs
                                              water and electrolytes, and forms feces.

                                              The anus is responsible for defecation.

                                              Function

                                              The teeth bite and chew (masticate) food as the first
                                              step in digestion.

                                              The tongue is a muscular organ that helps with
                                              mastication and assists in swallowing the food bolus.

                                              Located in the mouth are three pairs of salivary glands
                                              (parotid, sublingual, submandibular) that secrete
                                              saliva (consisting of water, amylase, lipase,
                                              electrolytes, mucus, immunoglobins, and amino acids)
                                              and digestive enzymes. The main role of saliva is to
                                              lubricate the mouth, moisten the food bolus, and start
                                              the digestive process.

                                              The pancreas produces enzymes to digest proteins
                                              (trypsin and chymotrypsin), carbohydrates (amylase),
                                              and fats (lipase).

                                              The liver makes and secretes bile (which includes
                                              cholesterol, bile acids, and bilirubin). Bile helps
                                              emulsify fats into fatty acids, aiding lipid absorption.

                                              The gallbladder stores and concentrates bile.

The average length of the adult human GI tract is about 30 feet from the mouth to the anus. Under normal
conditions, nutrients are introduced into the human body through the mouth as food and fluids. As food and fluids
move through the GI tract, they are transformed into useful nutrients to be assimilated into the body's cells for
survival and homeostasis. The breakdown and assimilation depend on the large surface area of the GI tract, which
has traditionally been described as the size of a tennis court. However, recent literature notes that the surface area
is much smaller. According to Rao and Johncy (2022), using geometric comparisons to approximate the intestinal
surface area is inappropriate.
784  29 · Introduction to the Digestive System

     Multiple factors play a role in GI functions and health. Structural and nutritional deficiencies can alter the function of
     tissues and organs. Intestinal transit time, or how quickly food and fluids move through the GI tract, may also
     impact GI functions and health. Intestinal transit time varies based on age. Transit time is slower in newborns and
     gradually increases, starting at about 4 months of age. The transit time slows again in older adults due to an aging
     GI system with decreased GI peristalsis (muscular contractions and relaxations that propel food through the GI
     tract), motility, and intestinal blood flow. The aging GI system, coupled with medications that may alter absorption
     of food and fluids, can cause the most common GI complaints: constipation and diarrhea. Although these are some
     of the most frequent GI concerns in older adults, these uncomfortable conditions can affect people of any age.

     Oral Cavity

     The oral cavity is the beginning of the digestive tract (Figure 29.3). The oral cavity refers to the structures of the
     mouth: the upper and lower lips, teeth, gingiva (gums), hard and soft palate, uvula, retromolar trigone, tonsils, floor
     of the mouth, tongue, salivary glands, and buccal mucosa. The teeth are vital for breaking up food (mastication) for
     digestion and absorption. Mastication is the essential first step in digestion. The tongue is a strong muscle that
     facilitates mastication by mixing food and helping to form it into a bolus, which is the first step in swallowing. The
     tongue is also involved in the sensation of taste through taste buds. Taste buds are specialized cells that
     communicate the sense of taste (sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami) to the brain.

     Salivary glands located in and around the mouth have many functions for oral health and digestion. The three types
     of salivary glands--sublingual, submandibular, and parotid--produce saliva to keep the oral cavity moist and
     lubricated to promote digestion and optimal oral health. In an adult, the salivary glands produce up to 2 L of saliva
     every day (Cleveland Clinic, n.d.). The presence of food increases saliva secretion. This is a parasympathetic
     response mediated by two cranial nerves, the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) and the glossopharyngeal nerve
     (cranial nerve IX). Saliva helps protect the teeth from cavity-causing bacteria as well as maintain the pH balance in
     the mouth, but the most appreciated role of saliva is that of digestive aid. It helps moisten food to facilitate the
     swallowing of chewed food. Saliva contains an enzyme, amylase, to help break down foods, particularly complex
     carbohydrates (starches) into simple and more easily digested sugars. The enzymes in saliva kick-start the digestive
     process in addition to helping food travel through the esophagus to the stomach for further digestion.

     Any disorder of the mouth or oral cavity may disrupt the digestive process. Common disorders such as "cold sores"
     from a herpes simplex virus (HSV), canker sores, mucositis, and candida infections may affect the oral cavity. These
     can be painful conditions. A thorough nursing history is essential to determine the source of any pain in order to
     alleviate it and ensure the client's ability to eat. The nursing health history should include questions about oral
     health and dental practices, home-based treatments, and the use of both over-the-counter and prescription
     medications. A thorough physical examination of the oral cavity is equally important because careful inspection of
     the oral cavity may uncover issues that can impair biting and chewing. Nurses should teach clients that good oral
     hygiene is essential for this first step in digestion.

29.2 Introduction to the Esophagus and Stomach

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 29.2.1 Describe the structure and function of the esophagus and stomach.
    · 29.2.2 Discuss common conditions that affect the esophagus and stomach.

Esophagus

The esophagus is a muscular tube at the base of the pharynx behind the trachea (Figure 29.4). The esophagus is
approximately 10 inches long and extends to the stomach. Its primary function is to move food and fluids from the
mouth to the stomach for digestion. The upper esophageal sphincter and the lower esophageal sphincter are two
structures within the esophagus that control the movement of food and liquid. The sphincters are ringlike bands of
smooth muscle fibers that function as valves to protect the body by propelling food and fluids through the
esophagus and into the stomach. These neuromuscular sphincters open and close in response to autonomic
nervous system stimulation and control.

The upper esophageal sphincter, also known as the oropharyngeal sphincter, is located between the pharynx and
the mouth. A properly functioning upper esophageal sphincter is vital to prevent aspiration of food and liquids into
the airways. Another structural membrane that prevents aspiration is the epiglottis. The epiglottis is a sheetlike flap
that closes over the trachea to prevent food and fluids from entering the lungs (aspiration).

The lower esophageal sphincter is located where the esophagus meets the stomach. It is commonly referred to as
the gastroesophageal sphincter because of its location between the esophagus and the stomach. It is also
sometimes referred to as the cardiac sphincter because it is located close to the heart.

If either of the esophageal sphincters is not functioning properly, ingested food, fluids, and acidic stomach contents
may move backward into the esophagus, causing irritation or damage to the tissues. Common problems with the
esophagus include GI inflammation, esophagitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), esophageal varices,
and hiatal hernia. Structural defects in the esophagus may also cause problems such as obstruction. Esophageal
dysfunction often interferes with nutrition and at times may cause varying degrees of discomfort. Medications are
often used to alleviate uncomfortable symptoms and prevent further symptoms and potential complications.

     Stomach

     The stomach plays an essential role in mechanical and chemical digestion yet is dependent on many different body
     structures, functions, and processes (Figure 29.5). Located in the upper part of the abdomen, the stomach has four
     parts: the cardia (the opening from the esophagus into the stomach), the fundus (the expanded upper portion), the
     body (the central and largest portion), and the pylorus (the lowest portion).

     FIGURE 29.5 The stomach has four major regions: the cardia, fundus, body, and pylorus. The addition of an inner oblique smooth muscle
     layer gives the muscularis the ability to vigorously churn and mix food. (credit: modification of work from Anatomy and Physiology 2e.
     attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

     The regulation of food and fluids in the stomach is controlled by autonomic neuromuscular innervation of two
     sphincters: the lower esophageal sphincter (gastroesophageal sphincter) and the pyloric sphincter. The pyloric
     sphincter separates the stomach from the first part of the small intestine, the duodenum. Much like the upper and
     lower esophageal sphincters, it is also a ringlike band of smooth muscle. The pyloric sphincter opens and closes
     under neuromuscular automaticity to control the passage of partially digested food and stomach contents into the
     small intestine. A malfunctioning pyloric sphincter may lead to delayed gastric emptying, known as gastroparesis. In
     another type of dysfunction, the pyloric sphincter empties the gastric contents too quickly into the small intestine,
     causing bloating and discomfort.

The digestive process involves three phases: the cephalic phase, the gastric phase, and the intestinal phase. The
cephalic phase received its name because it begins with the brain. Food is ingested in the mouth, but the experience
of seeing, smelling, and tasting food involves the brain. The neurologic sensory stimulation of ingesting food and
fluids stimulates the vagus nerve, the secretion of acetylcholine, and motor responses of the parasympathetic
nervous system. The production of gastric acid is essential to aid digestion, absorption, and metabolism. It is
regulated through neuronal and endocrine pathways (Engevik et al., 2020). Histamine, gastrin (released from
G cells), and acetylcholine are substances necessary for the parietal cells to produce and release hydrochloric (HCl)
acid. The stomach produces 1500-2000 mL of HCl acid daily, and an adequate amount of it is necessary for vitamin
B12 to be extracted from food sources. In addition, intrinsic factor, which is crucial for vitamin B12 absorption, is
produced and released by the parietal cells. The entrance of food and fluids into the stomach initiates the second
phase of digestion, the gastric phase. As indicated by its name, the gastric phase takes place in the stomach.

Within the parietal cells, hydrogen-potassium (H+-K+) ATPase enzymes comprise the proton pump that generates
and secretes HCl acid in response to acetylcholine, histamine, or gastrin binding to receptors on the parietal cells.
This action increases the hydrogen ion (H+) concentration, creating an acidic environment in the stomach that
supports digestion by breaking down food, primarily carbohydrates and protein. Hydrochloric acid is also important
in promoting the absorption of minerals. The acidic environment further aids digestion by controlling harmful
microorganisms such as bacteria or viruses in the stomach.

The stomach acts as a basin for digestion. Stomach muscles and rugae stretch and contract in response to the
volume of food in the stomach. When stretched, the rugae provide increased surface area for enhanced nutrient
absorption. The upper muscles relax to let food and fluids enter the stomach; the lower muscles churn and mix food
with digestive juices to form chyme and start the breakdown of proteins. Absorption of nutrients is minimal at this
point, but protein digestion is further enhanced when the chief cells secrete pepsinogen, which is converted to
pepsin. An acidic environment with a pH of 1.5-2.0 is needed for pepsin activation. The HCl acid lowers and
maintains the acidic pH of the stomach.

One of the main ways the stomach keeps itself from becoming irritated by the HCl acid is by producing mucus via
the goblet cells. However, the protective structure of the mucosal membrane may become eroded when exposed to
excessive HCl acid and pepsin, especially if these substances permeate the epithelium. This condition is commonly
referred to as gastritis and may lead to serious problems as the stomach lining becomes irritated and inflamed.
Gastritis can be painful and impair digestion and may cause life-threatening complications, such as bleeding or
perforation.

Gastric mucosal cells counteract the HCl acid by secreting prostaglandin E2, a strong, lipid-rich molecule that
stimulates gastric mucus and pancreatic bicarbonate. Prostaglandins ensure adequate submucosal perfusion. When
prostaglandin E2 is not sufficient to prevent gastritis, clients may need medications such as antacids to reduce or
eliminate symptoms. Because prostaglandins play an essential role in enhancing protective features of the stomach,
some medications that inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, such as ibuprofen, can injure the stomach. Nurses should
instruct clients that taking too much ibuprofen can be harmful to the stomach and kidneys and can lead to bleeding
due to altered platelet aggregation.

Prostaglandin E2 also has a role in GI motility as chyme is peristaltically pushed toward the pyloric sphincter and
into the duodenum for the final and third phase of digestion--the intestinal phase, which begins in the small
intestine.

29.3 Introduction to the Small and Large Intestines

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 29.3.1 Describe the structure and function of the small and large intestines.
    · 29.3.2 Discuss common conditions that affect the small and large intestines.

Small and Large Intestines

The largest GI organ is the small intestine (Figure 29.6). The duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and ileocecal valve
comprise the almost 20 feet of the small intestine. The primary functions of the small intestine are absorption and
digestion; the small intestine is responsible for 90%-95% of nutrient absorption. The muscles of the small intestine
788  29 · Introduction to the Digestive System

     further mix the chyme with digestive fluids for continued breakdown. The small intestine receives digestive juices
     from the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. Bile acids from the liver and gallbladder enter the small intestine and
     break down fat for absorption in the small intestine. The pancreatic enzymes lipase, protease, and amylase travel
     through the pancreatic duct to the small intestine to facilitate digestion. Lipase, together with bile salts, breaks
     down fats and aids absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). Poor fat absorption may result in steatorrhea (fatty
     bowel movements). Protease breaks down protein for absorption. Amylase is released from the pancreas into the
     proximal small intestine to break down and absorb carbohydrates.

     FIGURE 29.6 The three main regions of the small intestine are the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. (credit: modification of work from
     Anatomy and Physiology 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

     Unique to the small intestine are tiny fingerlike projections called villi that line the walls of the small intestine. The
     villi protrude into the lumen to absorb water and nutrients into the circulatory system. The highly vascular villi line
     the entire small intestine to accomplish most of the digestion and absorption processes as peristalsis continues to
     move nutrients and digestive waste along the alimentary canal. The blood capillaries absorb carbohydrates and
     proteins. The lymph capillaries, also called lacteals, absorb fats. Disorders affecting the intestinal villi of the small
     intestine may result in malabsorption or nutritional disorders.
     The large intestine, also known as the colon, receives waste products from the small intestine. Water is further
     absorbed from the waste products in the large intestine and forms stool. Peristaltic movements push stool toward
     the rectum. Under expected conditions, when waste products reach the rectum, most of the water has been
     reabsorbed into the body, leaving solid stool for evacuation from the body. The large intestine receives unabsorbed
     and undigested food material (waste products), absorbs water and electrolytes, and forms feces. The large intestine
     maintains over 500 species of bacteria that promote fermentation of indigestible material in the colon. The bacteria
     in the large intestine are responsible for absorbing vitamin K and B vitamins, including biotin (Thursby & Juge,
     2017).
     Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder affecting the intestine. The symptoms of IBS range from mild
     to severe and vary from person to person. Symptoms may include bloating, gas, abdominal pain or discomfort,
     abdominal spasms, cramping, and constipation or diarrhea (or both). Because people experience varying types of
     symptoms, IBS is further categorized as IBS-C (constipation), IBS-D (diarrhea), IBS-M (mixed symptoms of diarrhea
     and constipation), and IBS-U (unsubtyped, with varying inconsistent symptoms). Although IBS is a chronic
     condition, most people with IBS can manage their disease with lifestyle changes such as consistently eating healthy,
     balanced meals; staying hydrated; and reducing stress.

CHAPTER OUTLINE
30.1 Antiemetics
30.2 Antidiarrheals
30.3 Laxatives and Stool Softeners

INTRODUCTION The normal function of the gastrointestinal (GI) system is regulated and controlled by the central
nervous system. The parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems play a role in gastrointestinal muscle
movements, tone, motility, and mucosal secretions, especially in the stomach and esophagus. The nature of the
gastrointestinal and neuronal relationships makes the GI system susceptible to conditions causing symptoms such
as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation. In this chapter, drugs used to treat and manage these symptoms
will be discussed.

30.1 Antiemetics

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 30.1.1 Identify the characteristics of antiemetic drugs used to treat gastrointestinal disorders.
    · 30.1.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of antiemetic drugs used to

        treat gastrointestinal disorders.
    · 30.1.3 Describe nursing implications of antiemetic drugs used to treat gastrointestinal disorders.
    · 30.1.4 Explain the client education related to antiemetic drugs used to treat gastrointestinal disorders.
Antiemetics are a group of drugs that manage nausea and vomiting. They are classified by mechanism of action and
receptor target. Generally, antiemetics work by reducing the hyperactivity of the vomiting reflex in the brain, either
locally or centrally, by modulating neurotransmitter receptor sites. Localized antiemetics, such as antacids, work at
the site of acid production, thereby decreasing the response to excessive acid stimulation that may induce vomiting.
796  30 · Gastrointestinal Disorder Drugs

     Conversely, centrally acting antiemetics directly block the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) or suppress the
     vomiting center (VC).

          CLINICAL TIP

      Identify Underlying Factors Contributing to Nausea and Vomiting

       When administering an antiemetic, the health care provider should identify the factors causing nausea and
       vomiting. Treatment or elimination of the causative factors should be a goal of antiemetic treatment.

     Phenothiazines

     Phenothiazines are a class of drugs that produce antiemetic, antipsychotic, antihistaminic, and anticholinergic
     effects, primarily acting centrally to alleviate mild to moderate nausea and vomiting resulting from anesthesia,
     surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. They work by blocking dopamine receptors in the brain's chemoreceptor trigger
     zone (CTZ), effectively countering nausea and vomiting, so they are classified as dopamine antagonists. Additionally,
     phenothiazines interact with alpha adrenergic, serotonergic, histaminic, and muscarinic receptors, potentially
     causing orthostatic hypotension and sedation. Prioritizing fall precautions is essential in the nursing plan of care
     when administering these drugs. See Table 30.1.

     Promethazine
     Promethazine, a widely used phenothiazine, effectively manages nausea, motion sickness, and pregnancy-induced
     nausea and vomiting when other treatments are ineffective. Its antiemetic effects are attributed to depressing the
     CTZ. It also possesses antiserotonin, anticholinergic, and local anesthetic properties, resulting in moderate to
     significant sedative effects. Promethazine is also considered an antihistamine and antivertigo agent, making it
     versatile in allergy symptoms, allergic reactions, and pre- and postoperative sedation for adults and children over
     age 2.

     Prochlorperazine
     Prochlorperazine is another commonly used phenothiazine to manage severe nausea and vomiting, including those
     associated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Prochlorperazine suppresses the CTZ and blocks postsynaptic
     dopamine receptors, making the drug an effective antiemetic and antipsychotic.

     Chlorpromazine
     Chlorpromazine is a phenothiazine derivative that widely affects the central nervous system, producing antiemetic
     and antipsychotic effects. It is primarily used as an antiemetic, targeting the CTZ to manage mild to moderate
     nausea and vomiting. Other uses include intractable hiccups, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, attention-deficit
     hyperactivity disorder, and tetanus as an adjunct drug. However, its dopamine receptor blockade can lead to
     extrapyramidal symptoms, making it less commonly used for nausea and vomiting compared to promethazine and
     prochlorperazine. See Table 30.2 for additional information on chlorpromazine.

       FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

       Chlorpromazine and Prochlorperazine

       Increased mortality can occur when taking chlorpromazine and prochlorperazine in older adults with dementia-
       related psychosis.

       Promethazine

       Severe respiratory depression and death in pediatric clients under age 2 may occur with promethazine.

     Antihistamines

     Antihistamines are a class of medications that are commonly used to treat allergic reactions and upper respiratory
     conditions, but they also serve as antiemetics. Antihistamines, known as H1-receptor antagonists, compete with the
     H1-receptor sites in various body tissues, including mucous membranes, arterioles, capillaries, and the vomiting

center (VC). By doing so, they effectively block muscarinic and histaminergic receptors, making them effective
antiemetics. See Table 30.1.

Hydroxyzine
Hydroxyzine, a first-generation antihistamine and H1-receptor antagonist, effectively treats nausea and vomiting
caused by anesthesia, motion sickness, or pregnancy. It also acts as an anticholinergic by counteracting excessive
acetylcholine at the cholinergic receptors at the CTZ and VC, which receive signals from the inner-ear vestibular
network. Hydroxyzine is available various forms, including tablets, capsules, oral solutions, and injectables. When
using the injectable form of hydroxyzine to treat nausea and vomiting, it should be administered deep into a large
muscle, such as the gluteus maximus for adult clients and the vastus lateralis (the muscle on the outside of the
thigh) for pediatric clients.

Meclizine
Meclizine, a first-generation antihistamine with anticholinergic properties, is used as an antiemetic and antivertigo
agent. It acts by reducing excitability in the inner-ear labyrinth and vestibular simulation, thereby affecting the CTZ
and providing relief from vertigo and nausea. Meclizine is used to manage nausea and vomiting associated with
motion sickness or diseases affecting the vestibular system. It is available in oral tablet form, with an onset of about
60 minutes. The drug is readily available from the GI tract and has a duration of action of 8-24 hours.

Serotonin Receptor Antagonists

Serotonin (5-HT3) receptor antagonists prevent emesis by blocking the serotonin receptors centrally located within
the CTZ. These agents exhibit their antiemetic action by impeding peripheral serotonin receptors on the afferent
vagal neurons, which transmit signals from the upper GI tract to the CTZ, thereby mitigating nausea and vomiting.
See Table 30.1.

Ondansetron
Ondansetron acts by inhibiting the serotonin receptors and preventing activation of the vomiting reflex. Ondansetron
is one of the most effective antiemetics used to treat postoperative nausea and vomiting as well as nausea and
vomiting associated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Additionally, it has been used off-label for treating
conditions such as hyperemesis gravidarum, alcohol dependence, and pruritis.

Granisetron
Granisetron is a serotonin receptor antagonist like the prototype ondansetron. Granisetron is available as a tablet,
oral solution, transdermal patch, and solution for injection. It is used to prevent and/or treat chemotherapy-induced
nausea and vomiting. Oral granisetron is administered 1 hour before chemotherapy. The transdermal granisetron
patch is applied 24-48 hours before chemotherapy and remains in place for up to 7 days.

Substance P/Neurokinin-1 (NK1) Receptor Antagonists

Substance P is a neurotransmitter found in high concentrations in the central and peripheral nervous systems that
plays a vital role in pain modulation and may influence vomiting via the neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptors. Neurokinin-1
antagonists block the effects of substance P in the CNS and are effective in treating chemotherapy-induced and
postoperative nausea and vomiting. The primary goal of these antagonists is to prevent nausea and vomiting by
inhibiting substance P. As substance P coexists with serotonin in the body, the NK1 antagonist works best when
concurrently used in combination with a serotonin antagonist and glucocorticoid. See Table 30.1.

Aprepitant
Aprepitant, a substance P/NK1 receptor antagonist, crosses the blood-brain barrier to block neurokinin action in the
CTZ, with peripheral effects in the GI tract to combat nausea and vomiting. Often used concurrently with
ondansetron, aprepitant may be administered by mouth or intravenously to enhance the antiemetic activity of the
serotonin antagonist for acute and delayed effects of vomiting caused by chemotherapeutic agents.

Rolapitant
Rolapitant is a tablet that blocks the action of substance P and neurokinin to prevent nausea and vomiting in
chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Rolapitant prevents both acute and delayed chemotherapy-induced
nausea and vomiting. Nursing assessment includes monitoring for drug effectiveness by emetic control.

     Anticholinergics

     Anticholinergics, also called cholinergic antagonists, are drugs that block the actions of acetylcholine. Motion
     sickness, nausea, and vomiting may be caused by excessive acetylcholine at the CTZ and vestibular receptors in the
     VC. Anticholinergics are often used as antiemetics, as they interfere with or block inner-ear nerve impulses to the VC
     that causes vomiting.

     Scopolamine
     Scopolamine is a transdermal application with a controlled release system to prevent nausea and vomiting
     associated with motion sickness and anesthesia. Scopolamine inhibits the action of acetylcholine on nerves that
     connect the vestibular apparatus of the inner ear to the VC smooth muscle. Scopolamine transdermal patch is
     generally administered 4 hours before traveling in clients who suffer from motion sickness and in clients with post-
     anesthesia nausea and vomiting. Other routes of administration include oral and subcutaneous.

     Application of the transdermal patch is best to the hairless area behind the ear, after the area is cleansed and dried
     to ensure adherence (see Figure 30.2). Nurses should wear gloves during application to avoid accidental cross-
     absorption and should educate clients not to touch the patch. It is often recommended that the patch be covered
     with a bandage or medical tape to avoid accidental cross-absorption. The patches are replaced every 3 days as
     needed. When removing the transdermal patch, nurses should wear gloves and fold the patch in half so that the
     adhesive sides stick together for disposal, following facility policy. Nurses should wash hands thoroughly after
     handling scopolamine.

     Cannabinoids

     Cannabinoids are a group of ingredients found in Cannabis sativa plant, commonly referred to as cannabis. They
     interact with the endocannabinoid system, influencing nausea and vomiting regulation. Notably,
     delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) exhibits antiemetic properties by binding to CB1 and CB2 receptors in the brain
     and GI tract, reducing signals associated with nausea and vomiting. This makes cannabinoids valuable in managing
     conditions like chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.

use of medical cannabis to treat several conditions, including severe nausea or vomiting caused by cancer
treatment.

Dronabinol
Dronabinol is a synthetic form of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) that manages chemotherapy-induced nausea
and vomiting (CINV) by activating cannabinoid receptors in the brain. This activation helps regulate the body's
response to nausea and vomiting, reducing their intensity. Additionally, dronabinol is used to stimulate appetite in
conditions like HIV- and AIDS-related anorexia and cachexia (wasting syndrome). See Table 30.1.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications

     Typical adverse effects of common antiemetics include drowsiness, fatigue, dry mouth, constipation, headache, and
     dizziness. Some antiemetics such as chlorpromazine may cause extrapyramidal symptoms including dystonia,
     Parkinson-like symptoms, and tardive dyskinesia, particularly with long-term use.

     Certain antiemetics, such as dronabinol, should be used cautiously during pregnancy and when breastfeeding, as
     they may have adverse effects on fetal development and neurodevelopment outcomes.

     Antiemetics should be used cautiously or avoided when used concomittantly with other CNS depressants, as this
     may cause increased risk for CNS effects such as enhanced sedation, respiratory depression, and impaired cognitive
     function. The age of the client should be carefully considered prior to administering antiemetics, specifically in older
     adults and pediatric clients due to their potential adverse effects.

     Contraindications for antiemetics include hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components.

    · Prior to administering, assess the client's medical history, current drug list, and allergies.
    · Educate the client regarding antiemetic effects, such as dry mouth, constipation, hypotension, and urinary

        retention.
    · Moitor vital signs for signs of hypotension and respiratory depression, as these medications may cause CNS

        depression.
    · Monitor urine input and output for urinary retention.
    · Monitor the client closely for extrapyramidal effects such as dystonia, Parkinson-like symptoms, and tardive

        dyskinesia. Report these to the health care provider immediately.
    · Initiate fall precautions due to the adverse effects of orthostatic hypotension and dizziness.
    · Provide oral care and lozenges or saliva substitute for dry mouth.
    · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

        teaching guidelines.

  CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

  The client taking an antiemetic should:

      · Use sugarless candy, gum, or a saliva substitute for dry mouth as this is a normal side effect of these
          drugs.

      · Increase their dietary intake of fiber and increase fluid intake, if not contraindicated, to help reduce the
          risk of constipation.

      · Monitor blood pressure and report systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg and diastolic pressure less
          than 60 mmHg to the health care provider as this may represent hypotension.

      · Rise from a lying to sitting or sitting to standing position slowly as these drugs may cause dizziness and
          orthostatic hypotension.

      · Report signs of muscle contractions, tremors, ataxia, involuntary facial movements, or difficulty controlling
          movement as these may be symptoms of serious adverse effects of the drugs.

  The client taking an antiemetic should not:

      · Take these drugs with alcohol or other CNS depressants because this may cause increased depression of
          the central nervous system, resulting in drowsiness, dizziness, and respiratory depression.

      · Drive or operate heavy machinery because these drugs may cause drowsiness or dizziness.

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 30.2.1 Identify the characteristics of antidiarrheal drugs used to treat gastrointestinal disorders.
    · 30.2.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of antidiarrheal drugs used to

        treat gastrointestinal disorders.
    · 30.2.3 Describe nursing implications of antidiarrheal drugs used to treat gastrointestinal disorders.
    · 30.2.4 Explain the client education related to antidiarrheal drugs used to treat gastrointestinal disorders.

Diarrhea involves frequent, loose, watery stools. Diarrhea can be acute (lasting 1-2 days, often due to
microorganisms, viruses, or food intolerance) or chronic (lasting weeks, indicating underlying conditions like IBS or
Crohn's disease) (Johns Hopkins Medicine, 2023). Symptoms may include abdominal distress, cramping, bloating,
nausea, and urgency. Dehydration is a serious concern, and bloody stools should be reported. Antidiarrheal
treatments aim to slow intestinal motility, but they should not be taken if signs of infection (fever, severe pain,
bloody/mucus stool) are present, as they could allow pathogens to multiply. In these cases, it is important to
contact the health care provider.

          CLINICAL TIP

      Acute versus Chronic Diarrhea

       Diarrhea is one of the most common complaints in the United States. Although the diarrheal stools of chronic
       versus acute diarrhea may appear similar, it is important to understand the different causes and complications of
       these two medical conditions. Read this online article from the American College of Gastroenterology
       (https://openstax.org/r/giorgtopics) to learn more.

     Opioid-Related Antidiarrheal Medications

     Opioid-related antidiarrheal medications activate opioid Mu-receptors in the GI tract to slow intestinal motility,
     allowing more time for absorption of fluid and electrolytes by the colonic mucosal. Identifying the underlying cause
     of the diarrhea is recommended before treating it with an antidiarrheal agent. Caution should be exercised with
     opioid-related antidiarrheals because, if taken at high doses, clients may experience the typical opioid effects of
     euphoria or CNS depression. See Table 30.3.

     Diphenoxylate with Atropine Sulfate
     Diphenoxylate is a synthetic narcotic that reduces intestinal movement by targeting opioid receptors, effectively
     stopping diarrhea. It also slightly reduces fluid and electrolyte secretion in the intestines, promoting drug
     absorption. However, unlike typical opioids, it lacks analgesic effects and does not affect the central nervous system
     (CNS) at recommended doses for diarrhea. However, when used at higher doses or over an extended period, it can
     lead to euphoria, sedation, and addiction, classifying it as a Schedule II drug under the Controlled Substances Act
     (CSA) when prescribed alone (National Library of Medicine, 2022). When combined with atropine sulfate, it
     produces anticholinergic side effects when higher doses are used and is classified as a Schedule V drug.

     To prevent abuse, low doses of atropine, an anticholinergic, are added to diphenoxylate. Although this combination
     effectively manages diarrhea, atropine can lead to unpleasant side effects such as blurred vision, urinary retention,
     dry mouth, constipation, and tachycardia. The addition of atropine counteracts the potential euphoria from
     diphenoxylate, making the combination a Schedule V drug under the CSA. See Table 30.4 for additional information
     on diphenoxylate with atropine sulfate.

     Loperamide
     Loperamide is an effective antidiarrheal agent that prolongs transit time in the colon by directly inhibiting the
     peristatic activity of the circular and longitudinal muscles of the intestine, thereby decreasing intestinal fluid
     secretion into the intestinal lumen. This helps to increase the absorption of water and electrolytes in the intestines,
     resulting in firmer stools and a reduction in diarrhea.

     Loperamide is often used for the symptoms of acute diarrhea, such as traveler's diarrhea or viral gastroenteritis. It
     can also be used to manage chronic diarrhea associated with conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and
     irritable bowel syndrome.

          CLINICAL TIP

      Dehydration

       When administering antidiarrheals, the nurse should assess the client for signs and symptoms of dehydration by
       checking daily weights, skin turgor, and vital signs.

     Adjuvant Antidiarrheals

     Many clients experience diarrhea secondary to chemotherapeutic agents. Chemotherapy targets rapidly dividing
     cancer cells. However, chemotherapy often affects the cells within the gastrointestinal tract. Diarrhea caused by
     chemotherapy is referred to as chemotherapy-related diarrhea (CRD). Adjuvant antidiarrheals are often used for
     CRD to slow and manage the diarrhea (Krishnamurthi & Macaron, 2022). See Table 30.3.

     Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                 30.2 · Antidiarrheals    803

Bismuth Subsalicylate
Bismuth subsalicylate (BSS) is an insoluble salt of salicylic acid and trivalent bismuth antidiarrheal that inhibits the
synthesis of prostaglandins and cyclooxygenase that are responsible for inflammation and gastrointestinal motility.
Bismuth subsalicylate works directly on the intestinal mucosa as a protective agent, decreasing intestinal
secretions, and possesses anti-infective properties for acute diarrhea. However, pending the suspicious organisms,
targeted anti-infective therapy may be necessary.

BSS is commonly used for traveler's diarrhea. It can also provide temporary relief for dyspepsia and is sometimes
part of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) treatment alongside a proton pump inhibitor, tetracycline, and metronidazole
due to its anti-inflammatory effects. BSS is available in various forms for oral administration. Chewable tablets
should be crushed and taken with water. Shake liquid suspensions well before use.

Octreotide
Octreotide is a somatostatin analog primarily used for hyperpituitarism disorders, such as acromegaly. However,
octreotide is an adjuvant antidiarrheal to treat several severe diarrheal conditions associated with carcinoid tumors,
vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) tumors, gastrin-secreting tumors, and short bowel syndrome (Novartis,
2021). Octreotide is recommended for clients with CRD that does not respond to loperamide (Krishnamurthi &
Macaron, 2022).

This long-acting octapeptide mimics somatostatin and suppresses the secretion of various hormones and peptides.
Octreotide promotes fluid and electrolyte absorption in the GI tract, slowing down intestinal transit time.

Octreotide is available in capsule form for oral administration and as a parenteral solution for subcutaneous,
intramuscular, or intravenous administration (DailyMed, Octreotide acetate, 2023). The oral route is not indicated
for the treatment of diarrhea (DailyMed, Mycapssa, 2023). Clients who have responded well to octreotide injections
may switch to intramuscular depot injections (i.e., in the buttocks), avoiding the deltoid muscle due to potential
discomfort at the injection site (Novartis, 2021).

Pancreatin
Pancreatin, a medication containing porcine digestive enzymes, is used when the pancreas cannot produce
essential enzymes (lipase, amylase, and protease) that are required for proper digestion of fats, carbohydrates, and
proteins. Incomplete digestion occurs with deficient pancreatic enzyme levels and may cause excessive diarrhea.
Pancreatic enzymes are sometimes used as a secondary treatment in conditions with excessive diarrhea.

Pancreatin is an oral medication available by prescription as a tablet or capsule or over the counter as a dietary
supplement. As a digestive enzyme, pancreatin is always taken with food and with a full glass of water. Pancreatin
should be immediately swallowed whole to avoid irritation to the oral mucosa. It cannot be crushed or chewed. To
be effective, pancreatin must be taken consistently for the best results.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications

     Typical adverse effects of common antidiarrheals include constipation, nausea and vomiting, dry mouth, dizziness,
     drowsiness, and changes in bowel habits including the passage of harder or less-frequent stools. Antidiarrheals
     should be usedcautiously with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and CNS depressants.

     Use of diphenoxylate hydrochloride with atropine sulfate in higher doses than prescribed may lead to opioid and/or

Nursing Implications

The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking antidiarrheals:

· Prior to administering, assess the client's medical history, current drug list, and allergies.
· Educate the client regarding adverse effects, such as constipation, urinary retention, blurred vision,

   drowsiness, and dizziness.
· Mointor vital signs and for signs of dehydration such as poor skin turgor, reduced or dark urine, tachycardia,

   and dry mucous membranes.
· Monitor urine input and output for urinary retention.
· Initiate fall precautions due to the adverse effects of drowsiness and dizziness.
· Provide oral care and lozenges or saliva substitute for dry mouth.
· Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

   teaching guidelines.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking an antidiarrheal should:

    · Use sugarless candy, gum, or a saliva substitute for dry mouth because this is a normal side effect of these
        drugs.

    · Report adverse effects such as blurred vision, dry mouth, drowsiness, or constipation to the health care
        provider.
806  30 · Gastrointestinal Disorder Drugs

           · Report signs of abdominal distention, severe abdominal pain, fever, palpitations, or bloody diarrhea to the
               health care provider immediately as these may represent serious adverse effects.

       The client taking an antidiarrheal should not:

           · Use caffeine products during diarrhea episodes, as caffeine increases GI motility.
           · Drive or operate heavy machinery because these drugs may cause drowsiness or dizziness.

     30.3 Laxatives and Stool Softeners

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 30.3.1 Identify the characteristics of laxative and stool-softener drugs used to treat gastrointestinal
             disorders.

         · 30.3.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of laxative and stool-softener
             drugs used to treat gastrointestinal disorders.

         · 30.3.3 Describe nursing implications of laxative and stool-softener drugs used to treat gastrointestinal
             disorders.

         · 30.3.4 Explain the client education related to laxative and stool-softener drugs used to treat
             gastrointestinal disorders.

     Constipation is an unpleasant symptom or disorder that results in difficult stool evacuation or irregular and
     inconsistent stool passage, with common complaints like straining, incomplete or difficulty passing stools, or not
     defecating for a prolonged time. Stool may be small, round, hard, and lumpy when evacuated. Occasional
     constipation results in a feeling of fullness and wide-ranging discomfort. It often results from low fiber intake,
     dehydration, and a sedentary lifestyle. Certain medications can also promote constipation, such as anticholinergics
     and opioids.

     Treatment involves increasing fiber intake, staying hydrated, and being physically active. Laxatives and stool
     softeners can help if constipation persists, but they should be used briefly to avoid dependency.

     Bulk-Forming Laxatives

     Bulk-forming laxatives relieve constipation within 24-72 hours by supplying the colon with an increase in dietary
     fiber. However, it is imperative that these products are taken with an adequate amount of water. If these products
     are not taken with enough water, it may result in worsening constipation as well as esophageal and/or stomach
     obstruction. Bulk-forming laxatives are commonly marketed over the counter as a fiber supplement to promote
     regularity and improve cardiovascular and digestive health. Bulk-forming laxatives should not be used in clients with
     symptoms of acute appendicitis, esophageal stricture or perforation, GI obstruction, or ileus. See Table 30.5 for
     adult dosing of these drugs.

     Psyllium
     Psyllium is an oral bulk-producing laxative that promotes natural elimination by absorbing water into its soluble
     fiber, softening feces and increasing stool bulk. It is considered safe and can help with occasional and chronic
     constipation relief. Psyllium supports digestive health, helps to maintain healthy glycemic control, promotes a
     healthy heart with cholesterol reduction, and promotes a healthy weight by reducing hunger (Proctor & Gamble,
     2022). It is available over the counter in granules or powder to mix with water or juice. It is crucial to drink enough
     fluids to prevent complications like obstruction. Psyllium is also available as a wafer, but adequate water intake is
     essential to avoid choking and ensure its effectiveness. See Table 30.6 for additional information.

     Methylcellulose
     Another bulk-forming laxative, methylcellulose, is often used for both constipation and diarrhea for adults and
     children over age 3. Methylcellulose has also been used to promote regularity in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
     when taken as directed in capsule or powder suspension. As with its prototype, psyllium, it may take up to 3 days to
     work. Taking methylcellulose with several glasses of water will increase its effectiveness.

Calcium Polycarbophil
Calcium polycarbophil restores a balanced moisture level in the colon to form solid soft stool in cases of
constipation or diarrhea. It promotes GI motility and regularity in conditions such as acute bowel syndrome, irritable
bowel syndrome, and diverticulosis or after small-bowel surgery. Available in tablet and chewable forms, it should
be taken with at least 8 ounces of water or juice to prevent choking and ensure its effectiveness.

     LINK TO LEARNING

 Are Bulk-Forming/Fiber Supplements Safe to Take Daily? (https://openstax.org/r/
 mayoclinicorghli)

  Bulk-forming laxatives are often used as dietary supplements for regularity and gastrointestinal health. This
  Mayo Clinic post explores the benefits of taking bulk-forming laxatives daily.

Lubricant Laxatives

The goal of lubricant laxatives is to soften stool and lubricate the intestinal wall, making defecation easier and
preventing straining. The onset of action for lubricant laxatives is typically 8-48 hours, depending on the client's
normal gastrointestinal transit time. Lubricant laxatives generally do not produce increased peristatic activity that
causes abdominal cramping and spasms. These laxatives are often preferred by pregnant clients and older adults. If
used frequently, they may interfere with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K).

Mineral Oil
Mineral oil serves as a lubricant laxative for constipation or fecal impaction and facilitates the elimination of barium
residue in post-GI studies. It is available in various forms, including oral liquid and rectal enema. Mineral oil is not
recommended for children under age 6 or individuals with swallowing issues or incapacitation due to the risk of lipid
pneumonia if aspirated. Mineral-oil enemas act fast and should be administered with care to prevent complications
like bowel perforation. See Table 30.5.

Stimulant Laxatives

Stimulant laxatives intensify intestinal peristalsis and increase the volume of intestinal water to relieve acute
constipation that may be caused by high-dose opioid use. Stimulant laxatives are widely used and abused by the
public. Approximately 40% of chronic constipation sufferers self-medicate with laxatives (Rao & Brenner, 2021).
They are commonly used as part of bowel prep before colon procedures or surgeries, but are sometimes misused to
eliminate calories in an attempt to lose or maintain weight. However, such abuse can result in electrolyte
imbalances, dehydration, and potential harm to the gastrointestinal system's neuromuscular functions. Stimulant
laxatives may also lead to anal leakage, causing discomfort and affecting a client's confidence when leaving their
home. See Table 30.5.

Bisacodyl
Bisacodyl is a stimulant laxative that directly irritates the sensory nerve endings in the smooth muscle of the
intestine that induces peristalsis. Bisacodyl also stimulates an increased volume of water and electrolytes in the
intestine. The action is directly responsible for the adverse effects of abdominal cramping, diarrhea, fluid, and
electrolyte imbalances. Bisacodyl is typically used on a short-term basis to relieve constipation and should be taken
as directed to minimize these side effects and complications.

     CLINICAL TIP

 Administering a Bisacodyl Suppository

      · If the suppository feels soft in the foil package, return the package to the refrigerator to harden before
          removing the wrapper.

      · Assist the client to a comfortable left side-lying position with their right knee raised to their chest.
      · With a gloved hand, use a finger to insert the pointed end of the suppository about 1 inch (2.5 cm) past the

          rectal sphincter.
808  30 · Gastrointestinal Disorder Drugs

           · Have the client hold the suppository in place as long as possible. Gently holding the client's buttocks
               together may help the client retain the suppository as long as possible, for up to 20 minutes.

           · Assist the client with toileting.
           · Remove gloves and wash hands thoroughly.

          CLINICAL TIP

      Administering a Bisacodyl Enema

           · Shake the enema bottle well.
           · Assist the client to a comfortable left side-lying position with their right knee raised to their chest.
           · With a gloved hand, remove the protective shield and gently insert the enema tip into the rectum with the

               tip pointed toward the navel.
           · Gently squeeze the bottle until the contents are emptied into the rectum.
           · Remove the enema bottle from the rectum.
           · Have the client hold the enema contents in place as long as possible, for about 10 minutes. Gently holding

               the client's buttocks together may help the client retain the contents.
           · Assist the client with toileting.
           · Remove gloves and wash hands thoroughly.

     Castor Oil
     Castor oil is an oral stimulant laxative used for constipation or as a bowel prep before a procedure. Castor oil is
     produced from the castor bean. When castor oil is in the intestine, lipase breaks down the castor oil into ricinoleic
     acid, a fatty acid that directly stimulates peristaltic activity of the colon to produce a bowel movement in 6-12
     hours.

     Castor oil is a liquid often mixed in fruit juice to mask the taste. Castor oil is contraindicated in pregnancy due to risk
     of inducing uterine contractions.

     Senna
     Senna is a laxative that converts senna glycosides to active aglycone in the colon to soften feces and stimulate
     peristalsis, for acute constipation and preprocedural bowel evacuation. Senna is available in tablets and as a syrup.
     Senna is also available in teas that are marketed for constipation relief.

     Saline Laxatives

     Saline laxatives are hyperosmotic oral solutions that retain water in the intestine to increase the bulk of the stool.
     Sometimes called "salts," these laxatives are used when there is a need for a quick emptying of the lower bowel or
     intestine. The salts are absorbed, causing osmotic action to draw water into the intestinal lumen of the colon and
     causing the fecal mass to increase in size, or "swell." The increase in bulk softens the stool for easier evacuation
     while also stretching the intestinal wall, causing peristaltic movement. Because the hypertonic solution offers a
     rapid emptying of the bowels, saline laxatives are not recommended for long-term or repeated use (Mayo
     Foundation for Medical Education and Research, 2023a). See Table 30.5.

     Magnesium Citrate
     Magnesium citrate, often referred to as citrate of magnesia or mag citrate, is a hyperosmotic saline cathartic laxative
     available as an oral solution. Magnesium citrate evacuates bowels before surgical or diagnostic procedures within
     3-6 hours. Magnesium citrate is best given on an empty stomach with 240 milliliters (mL) of water. The solution is
     more palatable if chilled. Once opened, the effectiveness of magnesium citrate decreases.

     Available in liquid or tablet form over the counter, magnesium citrate should be used as directed by the health care
     provider or per the instructions on the product label to avoid potential side effects or complications. It typically
     produces a bowel movement within a few hours of ingestion and is known for its effectiveness in promoting bowel
     regularity when needed.

Polyethylene Glycol
Polyethylene glycol is an osmotic laxative that is used for occasional and chronic constipation. This medication
causes water to be drawn into the stool for easier evacuation. While it may take 2-4 days to produce results for
chronic and occasional constipation, larger doses of polyethylene glycol are often used for bowel preparation before
diagnostic and/or surgical procedures.

Available as a powder, a single heaping tablespoon of polyethylene glycol is reconstituted in 8 ounces of various
beverages such as water, juice, soda, coffee, or tea. Stirring helps the powder dissolve, and the mixture should be
consumed immediately. Typically, polyethylene glycol is taken once daily for up to 14 days, following the health care
provider guidance for proper use and dosage.

Miscellaneous Laxatives

Miscellaneous laxatives are a group of drugs that do not fit into the more common categories of laxatives. These
miscellaneous laxatives have different mechanisms of action and are used for the specific purpose of relieving
constipation. See Table 30.5 for adult dosing of these drugs.

Linaclotide
Linaclotide is classified as an accelerant of GI transit or guanylate cyclase-C agonist. Linaclotide is used to treat
irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) and chronic idiopathic constipation, to improve bowel function,
to eliminate constipation, and to decrease bowel irritation. Linaclotide is contraindicated if there is a suspicion of GI
obstruction. If severe diarrhea occurs, linaclotide should be stopped and the provider contacted.

Sorbitol
Sorbitol is a sugar alcohol or polyol that is commonly used as a sugar substitute in various sugar-free and "diet" food
products. It is a sweet-tasting substance with approximately 60% of the sweetness of sucrose (table sugar). When
taken orally, sorbitol has a laxative effect because it draws water into the intestines, softening the stool and
promoting bowel movements. It is sometimes used to relieve constipation, especially in situations where a mild,
osmotic laxative is needed.

Stool Softeners

Stool softeners are a type of laxative medication that helps to alleviate constipation by softening the stool, making
it easier to pass. They work by increasing the water content of the stool, which helps to prevent and relieve
constipation-related discomfort and straining during bowel movements. See drug emphasis Table 30.5.

Docusate Sodium and Docusate Calcium
Docusate sodium and docusate calcium are stool softeners often called surfactant laxatives. Docusate sodium and
docusate calcium act like a detergent in the intestine, with anionic emulsifying and wetting properties to lower the
surface tension of stool to allow penetration by water for easier defecation. Docusate sodium is available in tablets,
capsules, and syrups. Docusate calcium is available as a capsule. Docusate is used prophylactically for clients at risk
for constipation or fecal impaction who should avoid straining, such as postoperatively or after a myocardial
infarction.

Docusate can be administered orally or rectally. Oral administration should be given with a full 8-ounce glass of
water. The client should be encouraged to drink adequate fluid throughout the day. Oral solution (but not syrup) may
be mixed with milk, fruit juice, or infant formula. Syrups are stored in an airtight bottle at room temperature. Rectal
docusate is added to a microenema and administered via the rectum as an enema. Therapeutic effectiveness is
achieved within 1-3 days.

Table 30.5 lists common laxatives and stool softeners with typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications

     Typical adverse effects of laxatives and stool softeners include abdominal cramping, diarrhea, electrolyte
     imbalances (particularly sodium and potassium), dehydration, rectal irritation, and gas and bloating.

     Contraindications for laxatives and stool softeners include hypersentivitity to the drug or any of its components,
     intestinal blockage, appendicitis, and certain medical conditions such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.

     Laxatives should be used cautiously, as over time the body can become reliant on the drug to have bowel
     movements, leading to a condition known as laxative dependency. This can make it harder to have regular bowel
     movements without the use of laxatives.

Nursing Implications

The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking laxatives or stool softeners:

· Prior to administering, assess the client's medical history, current drug list, and allergies.
· Educate the client regarding laxative and stool effects, such as abdominal cramping, diarrhea, and rectal

   irriation.
· Assess client's bowel habits including frequency, consistency, and ease of bowel movements. Monitor for

   changes with laxative and stool softener administration.
· Monitor electrolyte levels, particularly sodium and potassium, to detect abnormalities.
· Educate the client on lifestyle and dietary factors, such as increasing hydration and eating a healthy diet high

   in fiber to prevent constipation.
· Educate client that these drugs are for short-term use, and long-term use could result in dependence.
· Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

   teaching guidelines.

CLINICAL TIP

Fecal Impaction and Bowel Obstruction

When administering laxatives and stool softeners, the nurse should assess the client for signs and symptoms of
fecal impaction and bowel obstruction, which include severe abdominal bloating and cramping, stool leakage or
sudden watery diarrhea (around impaction), rectal bleeding, small semi-formed stools, severe abdominal pain,
vomiting, loud sounds from the abdomen, and inability to pass flatulence.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking a laxative or a stool softener should:

    · Increase their dietary intake of fiber and increase their fluid intake, if not contraindicated, to help reduce
        the risk of constipation.

CHAPTER OUTLINE
31.1 Antacids
31.2 Histamine Blockers and Proton-Pump Inhibitors
31.3 Pepsin Inhibitors and Prostaglandin Analogues

INTRODUCTION Hyperacidity is a condition in which the stomach produces an excessive amount of stomach acid,
primarily hydrochloric (HCl) acid. This excess acid production can lead to various gastrointestinal symptoms,
including heartburn, regurgitation, abdominal discomfort, and in severe cases can contribute to the development of
conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and peptic ulcer disease (PUD).
Hyperacidity can result from factors such as dietary choices, lifestyle habits, certain medications, or underlying
medical conditions. This chapter will review drugs used to treat and manage hyperacidity disorders, including GERD
and PUD.

31.1 Antacids

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 31.1.1 Identify the characteristics of antacid drugs used to treat GI disorders.
    · 31.1.2 Explain the indications, action, adverse reactions, and interactions of antacid drugs used to treat

        GI disorders.
    · 31.1.3 Describe nursing implications of antacid drugs used to treat GI disorders.
    · 31.1.4 Explain the client education related to antacid drugs used to treat GI disorders.
Antacids are a class of over-the-counter medications that are used to neutralize or reduce gastric hyperacidity.
Antacids are also beneficial in treating duodenal and gastric ulcers, gastritis, pancreatic insufficiency, biliary reflux,
and phosphate binding in chronic renal failure. The goals of antacid therapy are to alleviate symptoms of heartburn
816  31 · Hyperacidity and Antiulcer Drugs

     and indigestion such as pain, as well as stomach spasms. Antacids are recommended for short-term use only.

     A combination of antacid ingredients is most often used to balance the therapeutic effects and avoid adverse
     effects. Various salts of calcium, aluminum, and magnesium neutralize gastric acids (Salisbury & Terrell, 2022).
     Antacids are available in many forms, including tablets, chewable tablets, liquid suspensions, and effervescent
     powders.

     Sodium Bicarbonate

     Sodium bicarbonate is an alkaline substance that neutralizes excess stomach acid. When sodium bicarbonate
     comes in contact with stomach acid, it reacts with the acid to form water, carbon dioxide, and sodium chloride, also
     known as common table salt. It is commonly used orally as a tablet or powder to alleviate the burning sensation and
     discomfort caused by indigestion or heartburn. Because it contains sodium, it may not be suitable for individuals on
     sodium-restricted diets or those with conditions that cause fluid retention, such as heart failure and chronic kidney
     disease. See drug emphasis Table 31.1 for dosing information.

     Calcium Carbonate

     Calcium carbonate is a fast-acting oral antacid that efficiently neutralizes gastric acids, offering relief from heartburn
     and associated symptoms. It also serves as a calcium supplement, beneficial for conditions such as osteoporosis
     and hypocalcemia. Calcium carbonate also aids peristalsis in the esophagus, reducing acid reflux by pushing gastric
     acid back into the stomach (Salisbury & Terrell, 2022). It effectively treats hyperacidity symptoms linked to various
     conditions, including indigestion, esophagitis, and hiatal hernia. In clients with chronic renal failure and
     hyperphosphatemia, calcium carbonate helps manage excess phosphorus due to kidney insufficiency.

     Calcium carbonate is administered by mouth as a sustained-released capsule, chewable tablet, or a powder that
     can be mixed in water. Chewable tablets must be chewed thoroughly before swallowing. Sustained-released
     capsules should be swallowed whole and never chewed. When taken as an antacid, calcium carbonate is
     administered 1 hour after meals and at bedtime. Calcium supplements should always be taken with vitamin D, as
     vitamin D is essential for efficient absorption of calcium (Rosen, 2023). See drug prototype Table 31.2 for additional
     information.

     Aluminum Hydroxide

     Aluminum hydroxide is a formulation of aluminum hydrochloride and water. It functions as an antacid by
     neutralizing excess stomach acid, primarily hydrochloric acid. It raises the pH (a measure of acidity) of gastric and
     esophageal secretions to reduce acid by making the secretions more alkaline.

     Aluminum hydroxide is used to relieve intermittent hyperacidity symptoms from gastritis, GERD, and hiatal hernia. It
     may also be used as an adjunct medication for ulcers (gastric and duodenal) due to its alkalization properties. It is
     often used in combination with other antacids. These combination antacids provide both acid-neutralizing
     properties and relief from potential constipation. See drug emphasis Table 31.1 for dosing information.

     Magnesium Hydroxide

     Magnesium hydroxide is a commonly used active ingredient in antacid medications. Its role involves the
     neutralization of stomach acid. Similar to the other antacids mentioned in this chapter, it achieves this by leveraging
     its alkaline properties to counteract excessive stomach acidity. Magnesium hydroxide is often combined with
     aluminum hydroxide, and sometimes simethicone, to provide relief from heartburn, indigestion, and upset stomach
     with gas and bloating.

     Magnesium hydroxide also has a laxative effect by causing osmotic fluid retention in the colon. This results in colon
     distention that stimulates peristalsis. When taken in larger quantities or more frequently than recommended,
     magnesium hydroxide can act as a mild laxative, potentially resulting in diarrhea. The magnesium in magnesium
     hydroxide can impact phosphorous digestion. Magnesium and phosphorus engage in a competitive absorption
     process within the small intestine. When there is a substantial disparity in the dietary intake of these minerals, one
     may hinder the absorption of the other, potentially leading to a deficiency in the inhibited mineral.

     Magnesium hydroxide is an aqueous suspension that needs to be shaken well before use to mix the suspension.

Magnesium hydroxide is most effective when administered on an empty stomach. It is best administered in the
morning or at bedtime. Doses should be followed by at least 8 ounces of water if used as a laxative. The medication
should be stored at 15°-30°C (59°-86°F). See drug emphasis Table 31.1 for dosing information.

Table 31.1 lists the common antacids and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications

Typical adverse effects of antacids include constipation (particularly those containing aluminum or calcium when
used in large amounts or for extended periods of time), diarrhea (specifically antacids containing magnesium, which
have a laxative effect), rebound hyperacidity (when the antacid wears off and the stomach produces additional
acid), kidney stones (particularly from antacids containing calcium, as some kidney stones are caused by calcium
oxalate), and gas and bloating.

When used excessively or for prolonged periods of time, antacids can potentially lead to electrolyte imbalances. The
specific electrolyte imbalance that can result from antacid use depends on the types of minerals they contain.
Electrolyte imbalances associated with antacids include:

· Hypercalcemia: Antacids that contain calcium, such as calcium carbonate, can lead to elevated calcium levels
   in the bloodstream. Symptoms may include excessive thirst, frequent urination, abdominal pain, nausea,
   vomiting, constipation, and fatigue.

· Hypermagnesemia: Antacids containing magnesium, like magnesium hydroxide, can cause elevated
   magnesium levels. Symptoms may include muscle weakness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, low blood pressure,
   and in severe cases, cardiac arrhythmias and respiratory distress.

· Hypernatremia: Antacids containing sodium, like sodium bicarbonate, can cause elevated sodium levels.
   Symptoms may include excessive thirst, dry mouth, confusion, restlessness, edema, or muscle twitching.

· Hypophosphatemia: Although less common, antacids (particularly magnesium hydroxide) can potentially
   interfere with the absorption of phosphate in the digestive tract, leading to low phosphorous levels in the
   blood. Symptoms may include muscle weakness, bone pain, confusion, and fatigue.

Contraindications to antacids include hypersensitivity to the antacid or any of its components. Individuals with
kidney disease or heart failure should use antacids containing magnesium, aluminum, or sodium cautiously, as
these may impact kidney function.

     Nursing Implications

     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking antacids:

     · Prior to administering, assess the client's medical history, current drug list, and allergies.
     · Educate the client regarding antacid effects, such as constipation, gas, and diarrhea.
     · Monitor fluid intake and urine output (I&Os) for urinary retention and edema with sodium bicarbonate.
     · Provide the client with teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for

        additional client teaching guidelines.

     CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

     The client taking an antacid should:

         · Chew oral tablets thoroughly before swallowing.
         · Drink 8 ounces of fluid after taking antacids.
         · Shake suspensions well to adequately mix the ingredients before taking.
         · Take 1 hour before or 2 hours after other medications.
         · Reports effects such as muscle twitching, tetany, edema, or bone pain to the health care provider as these

             may be symptoms of a severe adverse reaction.

     The client taking an antacid should not:

         · Take two different types of antacids at the same time.
         · Use for more than 2 weeks.

31.2 Histamine Blockers and Proton-Pump Inhibitors

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 31.2.1 Identify the characteristics of histamine-blocker and proton-pump inhibitor drugs used to treat GI
        disorders.

    · 31.2.2 Explain the indications, action, adverse reactions, and interactions of histamine-blocker and
        proton-pump inhibitor drugs used to treat GI disorders.

    · 31.2.3 Describe nursing implications of histamine-blocker and proton-pump inhibitor drugs used to treat
        GI disorders.

    · 31.2.4 Explain the client education related to histamine-blocker and proton-pump inhibitor drugs used to
        treat GI disorders.

Histamine blockers, known as H2 blockers, and proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) belong to the categories of drugs
used to mitigate or hinder the production of stomach acid. These medications find widespread application in the
treatment of conditions associated with heightened gastric acid secretion, encompassing gastroesophageal reflux
disease (GERD), peptic ulcers, and heartburn.

Histamine Blockers

Histamine blockers, also called histamine H2-receptor antagonists or H2 blockers, have GI antisecretory action. By
blocking the H2 receptors, drugs in this classification suppress gastric acid secretions and lower the hydrogen ion
concentration of the gastric contents by attaching to the histamine (H2) receptor sites on gastric cells. Therefore,
they prevent or treat heartburn, acid indigestion, gastric and duodenal ulcers, GERD, and hypersecretory conditions
such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. H2 blockers are often used concurrently with antibiotics to treat H.
pylori-associated peptic ulcer disease (PUD).

duodenal ulcers. Prophylactic use of cimetidine includes prevention of stress ulcers or management of
hypersecretory conditions such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Cimetidine has a high selectivity for the H2 receptors
on the parietal cells of the stomach. (Pino & Azer, 2023) Occupying these receptor sites inhibits all phases of basal
(daytime and nocturnal) gastric acid secretion. By blocking the parietal cells, gastric acid production is reduced,
raising the pH of gastric contents. This results in an indirect reduction of pepsin secretion. See drug prototype Table
31.4 for additional drug information.

Famotidine
Famotidine, a histamine inhibitor, is commonly used to treat heartburn, GERD, PUD, and hypersecretory conditions.
Famotidine reduces the output of hydrochloric acid from the parietal cells, which in turn reduces the erosive damage
to the gastric mucosa that may occur from hyperacidity. Famotidine is an effective prophylactic drug for stress
ulcers and perioperative aspiration pneumonia. It is available orally and intravenously. See drug emphasis Table
31.3 for dosing information.

Nizatidine
Nizatidine blocks histamine at the H2 receptors of the parietal cells, significantly reducing the secretion of nocturnal
gastric acid for up to 12 hours. It is an effective drug for GERD, gastric ulcers, and duodenal ulcers. Nizatidine may
also be used for prevention of stress ulcers or the abolition of H. pylori. The medication is generally given twice per
day for up to 8 weeks. If nizatidine is ordered daily, it is generally given at bedtime. See drug emphasis Table 31.3
for dosing information.

            d. "This medication will give me extra energy."

     Proton Pump Inhibitors

     Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are antisecretory drugs that block both basal and stimulated gastric acid production.
     Gastric acid secretions are reduced by irreversibly blocking gastric hydrogen and potassium ATPase, an enzyme that
     produces gastric acid. Short-term use of PPIs for 4-6 weeks is an effective treatment for gastric and duodenal
     ulcers, GERD, and erosive esophagitis. The long-term use of PPIs is useful in hypersecretory conditions such as
     Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Prophylactic use of PPIs is administered for clients at risk for stress ulcers, such as
     trauma clients on mechanical ventilation.

     Omeprazole
     Omeprazole is the prototype antisecretory PPI that suppresses the secretion of gastric acid by inhibiting the gastric
     proton pump found within the parietal cells. Various chemicals such as acetylcholine, histamine, and gastrin bind to
     receptors on parietal cells, prompting activation of hydrogen (H+), potassium (K+), and ATPase enzymes (the proton
     pump) that produces gastric acid secretion. Suppressing this action relieves GI distress to allow for healing of the
     mucosal lining.

     Omeprazole is commonly used for dyspepsia (occurring at least twice per week), GERD, duodenal and gastric ulcers,
     erosive esophagitis, and prophylactically to prevent gastric ulcers related to the use of nonsteroidal
     antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Typical treatment is 4-8 weeks, along with diet and lifestyle modifications. Short-

term use in combination with clarithromycin may be used to treat duodenal ulcers associated with H. pylori
infections.

Omeprazole is available for oral use as a capsule, delayed-release tablet, and powder for oral suspension. Oral
capsules and delayed-released tablets are best administered 30-60 minutes before breakfast. These must be
swallowed whole and should not be opened, chewed, or crushed. It may take several days for omeprazole to take
effect. In these cases, occasionally omeprazole is administered along with antacids until the omeprazole takes
effect. Oral-suspension omeprazole may be administered via a gastrostomy tube. The omeprazole suspension
contains granules that must be diluted in water. See drug prototype Table 31.7 for additional information.

Pantoprazole
Pantoprazole is a PPI used short-term for GERD and to manage or prevent erosive esophagitis. It is also useful in
managing hypersecretory diseases, peptic ulcer disease, duodenal ulcers, dyspepsia, heartburn, and for stress ulcer
prophylaxis. Pantoprazole suppresses gastric acid production by inhibiting the proton pump in the parietal cells.

Pantoprazole is available in delayed-release tablets, granules to create an oral suspension, and as a reconstituted
solution for parenteral use. Tablets should be taken whole with or without food, without chewing, crushing, or
breaking them. Granules may be administered orally or via a gastric tube. Oral suspension and granules may only be
administered in apple juice or applesauce; the medication should not be mixed with water or other liquids or foods
(Pfizer, 2023). However, the nurse should recommend that clients take small sips of water after administration to
ensure the granules are washed down into the stomach. Pantoprazole is typically not used for longer than 8 weeks,
especially in older clients. See drug emphasis Table 31.6 for dosing.

Esomeprazole
Esomeprazole is a weak base isomer of omeprazole that is converted to its active form in a highly acidic gastric
environment. It inhibits the proton pump in parietal cells, significantly decreasing basal and stimulated gastric acid
secretions.

Esomeprazole is an effective PPI that supports healing of erosive esophagitis, treatment of heartburn, prevention of
recurrent gastric or duodenal ulcers, and ulcer prophylaxis with NSAID use. Additionally, esomeprazole is effective
in the management of GERD, ulcers, and hypersecretory disease such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.

Esomeprazole is available in capsules, oral suspension, and powder for reconstitution for injection. The drug is
destroyed in acidic environments; therefore, esomeprazole capsules are produced to allow for delayed absorption in
the small intestine. Capsules must be swallowed whole and cannot be crushed or chewed. If a client cannot swallow
capsules, the capsule may be opened and the capsule pellets mixed in applesauce The nurse should emphasize that
the applesauce, once mixed, must be swallowed promptly without chewing the pellets to ensure the medication
remains effective. Direct parenteral administration of esomeprazole must be reconstituted. See drug emphasis
Table 31.6 for dosing.

Lansoprazole
Lansoprazole is a PPI that suppresses gastric acid formation, making it effective for short-term use to treat
duodenal ulcers, erosive esophagitis, and GERD and as maintenance treatment for hypersecretory disorders.
Lansoprazole is rapidly absorbed from the GI tract after leaving the stomach. The onset to reduce acid is
approximately 2 hours. Ulcer symptom relief is generally acquired within the first week of its use. Lansoprazole is
available as a sustained-release capsule and oral disintegrating tablets. See drug emphasis Table 31.6 for dosing.

Table 31.6 lists common PPIs and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

     CLINICAL TIP

     Assess for Worsening GI Symptoms

     When assessing a client's response to medications for hyperacidity and antiulcer treatment, monitor signs and
     symptoms of GI distress--weight, bowel habits, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, bloating, or belching. Follow
     provider instruction on dietary intake; some GI conditions require increased fiber and fluids, while others may
     require "bowel rest" that involves smaller meals with soft foods.

     Nursing Implications
     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking histamine blockers and proton pump inhibitors:

31.3 · Pepsin Inhibitors and Prostaglandin Analogues                                                                      825

    · Prior to administering, assess the client's medical history, current drug list, and allergies.
    · Educate the client regarding duration of use for these medications being short term, typically 4-8 weeks.
    · Teach the client to avoid trigger foods that increase stomach acidity such as spicy foods, fried foods, and

        caffeine.
    · Monitor for respiratory infection and/or pneumonia with PPI administration as these may lead to an

        overgrowth of bacteria in the upper GI tract that can migrate to the lungs.
    · Provide the client with teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for

        additional client teaching guidelines.

  CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

  The client taking a histamine blocker and proton pump inhibitor should:

      · Adhere to dosing regimen as prescribed by the health care provider, typically short-term administration of
          4-8 weeks.

      · Avoid trigger foods such as fast food, fried foods, spicy foods, caffeine, tea, and colas as these may
          increase stomach acid.

      · Reports effects such as cough, fever, and shortness of breath to the health care provider as these may be
          symptoms of a severe adverse reaction.

  The client taking a histamine blocker and proton pump inhibitor should not:

      · Use for longer than prescribed.

31.3 Pepsin Inhibitors and Prostaglandin Analogues

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 31.3.1 Identify the characteristics of mucosal protectants and prostaglandin analogues used to treat
        gastrointestinal disorders.

    · 31.3.2 Explain the indications, action, adverse reactions, and interactions of mucosal protectants and
        prostaglandin analogues used to treat gastrointestinal disorders.

    · 31.3.3 Describe nursing implications of mucosal protectants and prostaglandin analogues used to treat
        gastrointestinal disorders.

    · 31.3.4 Explain the client education related to mucosal protectants and prostaglandin analogues used to
        treat gastrointestinal disorders.

Mucosal Protectants

Pepsin is a gastric enzyme that breaks down and supports the digestion of proteins from foods. A low gastric pH of
1.5-2 activates pepsin. However, pepsin may cause erosive damage to the mucosal lining of the stomach. To
mitigate the potential harm caused by pepsin, mucosal protectants are employed. These agents serve a dual
purpose by reducing both gastric acid production and pepsin activity. Notably, when the gastric pH exceeds 5,
mucosal protectants act as inhibitors of pepsin further safeguarding the delicate mucosal lining of the stomach.

Sucralfate
Sucralfate is classified as a mucosal protectant or coating agent. When ingested, it transforms into a viscous
substance that adheres to ulcerated areas, creating a protective barrier on the mucosal lining of the stomach and
duodenum. This protective paste-like barrier can adhere or stick to the ulcers for up to 6 hours, shielding them from
the damaging effects of pepsin and hydrochloric acid. Sucralfate is especially effective with duodenal ulcers, ulcers
due to aspirin use, and chemotherapy-induced mucositis. It may also be beneficial for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Sucralfate is available in a tablet form or a liquid suspension. To maximize effectiveness, it should be taken 4 times a
day, approximately 60 minutes before meals and at bedtime. When used alongside antacids in antiulcer therapy, it's
advisable to administer antacids 30 minutes before or after sucralfate. Additionally, due to its adhesive properties,
sucralfate should be taken at least 2 hours before or after medications such as quinolones, digoxin, phenytoin, and
tetracycline to prevent any interference with their effectiveness.

     Prostaglandin Analogues

     Prostaglandins are naturally occurring compounds present in the GI tract that protect the mucosal lining of the
     stomach and duodenum. They do this by inhibiting gastric acid and pepsin secretions.

     Synthetic prostaglandin analogues, in a similar manner, act as mucosal protectants by decreasing acid secretions
     while increasing the secretion of bicarbonate and protective mucus. This combined action serves to fortify the
     defense mechanisms of the GI tract, preserving its delicate mucosal integrity.

     Misoprostol
     Misoprostol acts as an endogenous prostaglandin in the GI tract. As an antiulcer agent for the prevention of NSAID-
     induced ulcers, it inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid and pepsin secretions and also increases the secretion of
     bicarbonate and protective gastric mucous. Misoprostol also promotes vasodilation to maintain submucosal gastric
     blood flow. These actions prevent gastric ulcers.

     Misoprostol is available in tablets that are administered with food 4 times a day alongside NSAID therapy.
     Misoprostol is readily available from the GI tract with an extensive first-pass metabolism, reaching peak levels in

INTRODUCTION In the United States, almost 75% of adults age 20 or older are classified as having overweight or
obesity based on their body mass index (BMI). Almost 20% of children ages 2-19 live with obesity (National Heart,
Lung, and Blood Institute, 2022). According to the World Health Organization, over the past 50 years the global
incidence of obesity has tripled (Yadav & Jawahar, 2023). The body of evidence notes that disparities exist by race
and ethnicity, age, educational level, and environmental factors. Maintaining a healthy weight can reduce many
health risks, especially those associated with obesity such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.
Overweight and obesity may lead to various serious health issues for people of all ages. An alarming consequence is
the monetary impact affecting people with overweight and obesity. According to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC, 2022b), obesity-related medical costs in the United Sates were an estimated $173 billion annually
(about $530 per person in the United States). The ramifications also include a loss of productivity due to
absenteeism. The CDC estimates that the national loss of productivity costs between $3.4 and $6.4 billion annually
(about $20 per person in the United States).
The detrimental consequences of overweight and obesity on the health and wellness of people, compounded with
financial burdens, lead to a critical need for weight management. Proper weight management starts with
understanding the pathophysiology of overweight and obese conditions and the comorbidities. This understanding
must also consider genetic and lifestyle factors to promote optimal weight management. Pharmaceutical agents to
promote weight loss and bariatric procedures may be initiated when lifestyle and behavioral modifications are
ineffective at maintaining a healthy weight. All of these aspects will be discussed in this chapter.

     32.1 Introduction to Weight Management

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 32.1.1 Describe the pathophysiology of overweight and obesity.
         · 32.1.2 Identify clinical manifestations related to obesity.
         · 32.1.3 Identify the etiology and diagnostic studies related to obesity.
         · 32.1.4 Describe nonpharmacologic measures to reduce weight.

     Overweight and obesity are terms that can be used to describe the increase in the size and number of fat (adipose)
     cells in the body. There are two ways that adipose tissue increases in the body. Hyperplasia of adipose tissue is an
     increase in the number of fat cells in the body. Hypertrophy is an increase in the size of fat cells. Both genetics and
     lifestyle, mainly a diet high in fat, affect hyperplasia and hypertrophy of adipose tissue. There is a strong correlation
     between genetics and adipose tissue growth. Adipose tissue begins to develop in a fetus by the second trimester.
     Despite a genetic predisposition, lifestyle behaviors can impact developing overweight or obesity.

     Simply stated, excess weight gain that can lead to overweight or obesity can be caused by ingesting more calories
     than the body needs to function. The American Heart Association (2020) notes that a healthy diet that includes
     fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and lean proteins low in saturated fats reduces the risk of
     cardiometabolic diseases in the United States. However, there are many reasons why people ingest more calories
     than what is needed by the body. One major factor is the increased availability and consumption of highly processed
     convenience foods. These foods are often high in sugar and fat. Unfortunately, high-calorie, high-sugar, high-fat,
     processed foods are often less costly than healthier foods. People struggling with finances or living in a food desert
     (an area where people have extremely limited access to healthy, affordable food) often buy low-cost, high-sugar,
     high-sodium, and high-fat foods that are cheaper than healthy food choices.

     Obesity is recognized as a complex medical condition. In addition to diet, there are other factors that can increase
     the likelihood of a person developing obesity, including genetics, lack of sleep, decreased or restricted physical
     activity, certain medications, and stress. Obesity raises an individual's risk for developing heart disease,
     hypertension, diabetes, and cancer (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 2022).

     Weight Stigma

     Society typically values a person who is "thin and fit," despite the fact that almost 75% of Americans live with
     overweight or obesity. Obesity stigma is characterized by prejudice, stereotyping, and discriminating bias and
     actions toward people with obesity, often fueled by inaccurate ideas about the causes of obesity (Westbury et al.,
     2013). Weight stigma often stereotypes people with overweight or obesity negatively as lacking self-discipline,
     being lazy or sloppy, and lacking intelligence. These stereotypes may result in discrimination in relationships, social
     acceptance, employment, and recognition. Weight discrimination often leads to adverse health consequences such
     as binge eating, psychological and physiological stress, weight gain, and avoidance of participating in healthy
     behaviors and provider follow-up (Lee et al., 2021). Weight stigma may be internalized by the person with
     overweight or obesity. Unfortunately, clients may encounter weight stigma as a bias among health care
     professionals (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2019). However, individuals may have their
     own phrasing and preferences for how they discuss their body size, health, and weight, and nurses should consider
     those preferences as well.

     Overweight and obesity are medical conditions. As with all medical conditions, health care professionals should
     approach these conditions with a focus on a client-centered treatment plan. Physicians, nurses, physical therapists,
     nutritionists, and fitness professionals are a few of the types of health care professionals who have contributed to
     weight bias, stigma, and discrimination by labeling people with overweight and obesity as "noncompliant,"
     furthering the weight stigma (World Obesity Federation, n.d.). How health care professionals engage in
     conversations and use terminology with clients is vital to avoid further bias and weight stigma. Using person-first
     terms such as "person with obesity" instead of "obese person" is recommended for health care professionals. The
     first term identifies the client as having a condition rather than defining the person as obese. The terms "morbidly
     obese," "fat," and "obese" have been found to be the most stigmatizing, whereas "weight problem," "unhealthy
     weight," and "high BMI" have been found to be the most motivating and least offensive language options for
     discussing weight with clients (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2019).

In addition to being thoughtful in their verbal communications, health care professionals can decrease weight
stigma by implementing individualized client-centered weight counseling, encouraging healthy lifestyle behaviors,
displaying empathy, and being supportive. Above all, health care professionals should treat overweight and obesity
as a medical condition requiring an interprofessional, individualized treatment plan. Nonpharmacological modalities
such as meal planning and increased physical activity are encouraged before moving on to weight-loss drugs and
bariatric procedures or surgeries. Health care professionals should focus on the consequences, complications, and
comorbidities of overweight and obesity, while being certain that they are not simply promoting a "thin body ideal."
For example, health care professionals should not assume that a person with overweight or obesity is unable or
unwilling to participate in certain activities, such as physically challenging events. And healthcare professionals
should never assume or imply that people with overweight or obesity should be unhappy in their bodies.

Overweight Versus Obesity

Overweight and obesity both are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health.
However, overweight and obesity are not the same thing.

Body mass index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height that is commonly used to classify overweight and
obesity in adults. For adults, the World Health Organization (WHO) defines overweight as a BMI greater than or
equal to 25 and obesity as a BMI greater than or equal to 30 (WHO, 2021). Being overweight may change the way
the body functions and may lead to adverse health effects. If the body is overweight for a prolonged period, it
progressively may lead to obesity (Mayo Clinic, 2023c).

Body fat alone is not a disease. In fact, the human body requires fat for energy and to function. Body fat insulates
and protects vital organs. The body cannot produce fat on its own. It is essential for humans to ingest cholesterol,
triglycerides, and essential fatty acids (EFAs) for basic metabolic and immune functions and to supply the body with
the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K (MedlinePlus, 2023). Despite the importance of fats in the human body,
regulation is key to avoiding developing overweight or obesity.

Body Mass Index

The BMI is calculated for adults by first determining a person's height and weight. The weight in pounds is divided
by the height in inches and then multiplied by a conversion factor of 703 to obtain the BMI. To determine the BMI
using the metric system, divide the weight in kilograms by the height in square meters and then multiply the result
by 10,000. Although the BMI is calculated in the same way for children and teens, clinicians interpret the findings
for them differently. For children and adolescents, refer to the CDC Growth Charts (https://openstax.org/r/
growthcharts).

BMI for adults 20 years and older (see Figure 32.2):

    · Healthy weight: 18.5-24.9 kg/m2
    · Overweight: 25.0-29.9 kg/m2
    · Obese: 30.0 kg/m2 and greater

These parameters may not apply to athletes, body builders, or people who exercise a lot because a BMI may be
higher in athletes due to their increased muscle mass. Also, BMI measurements are based on anthropometric
measurements of White people. Body fat distribution differs by race and ethnicity, such as among Hispanic, Black,
East Asian, and South Asian populations (Nair, 2021). The BMI interpretations should be adjusted based on
ethnicities (Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, n.d.). Furthermore, the American Medical Association
indicates that BMI should not be used as a sole determinant of health and risk. Rather, it should be used in
conjunction with measurements of body adiposity index, relative fat mass, waist circumference, and visceral fat, as
well as considerations of body composition, genetic factors, metabolic factors, and other measures (American
Medical Association, 2023).

The significance of an increased BMI should be determined by a health care professional and discussed with clients
on an individual basis. When obesity is determined to be detrimental to health, it is further classified as:

    · Class I obesity: 30-34 kg/m2
    · Class II obesity: 35-39 kg/m2
    · Class III obesity: 40+ kg/m2
834  32 · Weight Management Drugs

     Treatment for obesity is often determined by the class of obesity the client fits into, as determined by a health care
     professional. Class III obesity is most often linked to serious health conditions.

     Factors Associated with Obesity

     Obesity at a minimum alters the body's metabolism. Metabolism is the body's process of converting calories into
     energy for optimal functioning. When the body takes in too many calories, it stores the excess as adipose tissue.
     Excess adipose tissue secretes hormones that start an inflammatory process in the body that may lead to chronic
     inflammation and insulin resistance. With insulin resistance, the body does not respond to insulin to properly
     regulate blood glucose levels. This affects the body's ability to use glucose for energy in the muscles and other body
     organs, and glucose builds up in the bloodstream (hyperglycemia). The pancreas then does what it is supposed to
     do and produces more insulin to combat hyperglycemia. Over time, this circle leads to type 2 diabetes mellitus.
     Obesity raises the incidence of developing type 2 diabetes 7-12 times that of a person of a healthy weight
     (Cleveland Clinic, 2022).

     Hormonal weight gain due to aging is another concern, especially for postmenopausal clients. According to Mayo
     Clinic (2023d), hormonal changes due to menopause may cause up to 1.5 pounds of weight increase, particularly in
     the abdominal area. However, an active lifestyle and healthy eating patterns can minimize postmenopausal weight
     gain.

     In addition to hyperglycemia from chronic inflammatory processes and insulin resistance, serum lipids (cholesterol
     and triglycerides) may increase, leading to hyperlipidemia. The combination of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia
     leads to hypertension (high blood pressure). These risk factors are often grouped together in a condition called
     metabolic syndrome, which is a collection of risk factors, including overweight and obesity, that drastically
     increases the chance of a person developing hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. In addition to
     steering the body to metabolic syndrome, increased BMI coupled with hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertension,
     and/or chronic inflammation increases the risk of atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, and coronary artery
     disease. As metabolic syndrome may be prevented with client education on nutrition and meal planning, it is
     recommended that providers consider referring clients to a registered dietician for individual meal planning
     education.

The excess circulating serum lipids and glucose eventually make their way to the liver, kidneys, and gallbladder. The
liver and kidneys are responsible for filtering the blood. Excessive lipids in the liver may lead to steatosis and
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Long-term storage of excess lipids in the liver can increase chronic
inflammation in the liver, triggering hepatitis and eventually possible cirrhosis. Prolonged hyperglycemia and
hypertension are taxing on the kidneys and eventually affect the functioning of the renal tissue, leading to possible
chronic kidney disease. High cholesterol can also accumulate in the gallbladder, leading to cholelithiasis, which
further impairs metabolism.

In addition to the metabolic issues that can lead to serious chronic diseases, overweight and obesity have
detrimental direct effects on the body due to the excess adipose tissue. The strain primarily affects the
musculoskeletal and respiratory systems. The excess weight on the musculoskeletal system impairs the body's
ability to support itself. It also impairs mobility. The added weight on the soft tissues, bones, joints, tendons, and
ligaments causes stiffness and pain. This may lead to injuries and diseases such as low back pain, osteoarthritis,
and gout, further impeding mobility.

Excess body fat also puts additional strain on the respiratory system, contributing to obesity hypoventilation
syndrome, sleep apnea, and asthma. Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is a respiratory condition that is a
direct outcome of obesity, especially Class III obesity. "OHS is defined by the combination of obesity (body mass
index [BMI] 30 kg/m2), SDB [sleep-disordered breathing], and awake daytime hypercapnia (awake resting PaCO2
[the partial pressure of carbon dioxide] 45 mm Hg at sea level), after excluding other causes for hypoventilation"
(Mokhlesi et al., 2019).

Physiological Factors
Physiological factors are related to the chemical and physical processes that occur within the body. Various
physiological factors affect weight management including basal metabolic rate (BMR), circadian rhythm and sleep
cycles, hormones, thermogenesis, physical fitness and strength, digestive health and gut flora, prenatal and
postnatal factors, and physiological response to stress. The foundational physiological factor in weight management
is the BMR, which is the amount of energy required to sustain the essential body functions of life. The physiology of
the BMR is influenced by several factors including sex, muscle mass, body size, amount of sleep, and genetics.
Males have a greater BMR than females, which accounts for the muscle mass and fat distribution differences.
Muscles burn about 4 calories more per hour than adipose tissue. Although males have a greater muscle mass than
females, it is important for females to maintain a proper proportion of lean muscle mass to maintain a higher BMR.

An adequate amount of sleep is fundamental for maintaining physical, psychological, and emotional health. For
optimal health, 7-9 hours of sleep per night is recommended. Sleep is essential to proper weight management. Poor
sleep is associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Additionally, sleep deprivation affects metabolic
rates, hormones that regulate metabolism, and even eating habits (Papatriantafyllou et al., 2022). The effects of
sleep on worsening obesity have been studied quite a bit in children. Results demonstrate that just 1 hour less sleep
per night from normal sleep patterns can lead to an increase in obesity in children and teens (Yadav & Jawahar,
2023).

It is important to pay attention to an individual's internal clock (circadian rhythm) in respect to sleep as well.
Hormonal regulation affecting eating and sleeping is controlled by a person's physiological circadian rhythm. Not
paying attention to the urge to sleep based on the physiological internal clock can alter weight management.
Incidentally, eating too late at night can not only alter the circadian rhythm but also interfere with sleep (Reynolds,
2022).

Several hormones play a role in weight management, influencing appetite and the ability to utilize adipose tissue as
an energy source. Insulin, an anabolic hormone, regulates glucagon and fat for energy. Ghrelin is a hormone that
controls hunger and satiety. Leptin is another hormone that is primarily involved in satiety. According to the
Cleveland Clinic (2023a), research demonstrates that some people may have leptin resistance, which may lead to
weight gain by inhibiting satiety, increasing hunger, and decreasing metabolism. Glucagon is a hormone that
stimulates hepatic glucose production (gluconeogenesis). Weight gain is promoted when insulin and ghrelin are
chronically elevated and leptin and glucagon are chronically low. Many factors affect this cycle, including sleep
deprivation.

Thermogenesis is an integral process of the body's metabolic functions. It is the production of heat in the human
836  32 · Weight Management Drugs

     body, specifically in brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Thermogenesis burns calories to produce heat/
     energy, creating a negative energy balance that leads to weight loss. It is sometimes referred to as "fat burning" due
     to the burning of specifically adipose tissue. There are three primary types of thermogenesis: nonexercise-activity
     thermogenesis (NEAT), exercise-associated thermogenesis (EAT), and diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT). NEAT
     occurs under normal natural physical activity and burns calories associated with activities of daily living. EAT refers
     to calories that are burned with purposeful exercise. DIT is the production of heat (calorie burning) that occurs after
     eating. Intentionally increasing thermogenesis is a nonpharmacological method of weight management (discussed
     later in the chapter).

     Genetic Factors
     In terms of factors affecting obesity, heredity and genetic factors have been considered part of a multifactorial
     cause. Genome studies demonstrate genetic biological reinforcement and the role of the brain in weight
     management (Loos & Yeo, 2021). Genes affect the amount of fat stored in an individual's body and fat distribution.
     Several genes play a role in the pathogenesis of overweight and obesity. The most significant is the fat mass and
     obesity-associated (FTO) gene. Genetic variation in the first segment of the FTO gene is largely related to adiposity.
     This may lead to long-term overweight and obesity consequences as an adult (Huang et al., 2023). Genetics may
     also play a role in digestion and metabolism; however, genetics are not the sole cause of obesity.

     Ethnicity has also been correlated with excess weight. Non-Hispanic Black adults (49.9%) had the highest age-
     adjusted prevalence of obesity, followed by Hispanic adults (45.6%), non-Hispanic White adults (41.4%), and non-
     Hispanic Asian adults (16.1%) (CDC, 2022c). There is some evidence that the differences may be linked to racial
     genetics that affect body composition and fat distribution.

     Environmental Factors
     In most discussions about the genetic influences of obesity, the role of family environment is also stressed as a
     major factor of obesity. Family environment may lead to sedentary and poor lifestyle behaviors. There may also be
     socioeconomic factors related to the family environment. In the United States over the last few decades, there has
     been an increased incidence of choosing ultra-processed and fast food for meals. This is coupled with a decrease in
     physical activity, especially in children. Food deserts are also a concern with weight management. Healthy food
     accessibility is a major environmental factor, especially in lower-income and minority neighborhoods, which have
     approximately 30% fewer supermarkets (Yadav & Jawahar, 2023).

     The family environment also greatly influences lifestyle behaviors such as physical activity, eating behaviors, sleep
     patterns, and reactions to stress. All of these can affect weight management. Physical spaces such as where one
     lives, works, and socializes have a large familial influence and can affect weight management. Gurka et al. (2018)
     found that the prevalence of obesity fluctuates across the United States based on geographic areas. The highest
     levels of obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome in the United States are in the Midwest and Southern regions.

     Psychological Factors
     According to the National Council on Aging (Vafiadis, 2021), research demonstrates that there are barriers to
     treatments based on the complex interrelatedness between obesity and mental health. Most discussions on obesity
     focus on the physical consequences such as cardiovascular challenges, type 2 diabetes, and musculoskeletal
     conditions. Rarely are the emotional and mental health impacts related to obesity considered in treatment plans
     (Vafiadis, 2021). There are significant psychological burdens associated with obesity and its comorbidities. People
     with obesity often exhibit more self-esteem issues, body-image dissatisfaction, anxiety, depression, low quality of
     life, and discrimination (Vafiadis, 2021).

     Due to the large body mass from obesity and the detrimental effects of comorbidities, people with obesity often are
     unable to participate in activities they enjoy, such as spending time with family and friends, traveling, attending
     social events, or participating in hobbies. Social isolation may lead to loneliness, difficulty coping, and depression.
     Furthering the potential for depression is society's negative attitude toward overweight and obesity. People with
     obesity often experience weight bias, being stereotyped as lacking self-discipline or being lazy. Weight bias may
     also be present among health care providers (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2019). These
     critical biases may lead to discrimination. Discriminatory behaviors and weight bias may exacerbate depressive
     symptoms.

     There is a reciprocal relationship between obesity and mental health concerns. Although overweight and obesity

32.1 · Introduction to Weight Management                                                                                  837

may trigger consequences on mental and emotional health, various mental and emotional conditions may, in turn,
lead to behaviors causing weight gain. Chronic stress, anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder may cause a person
to use food for comfort or decrease their interest in participating in physical activities. Self-medication with food is
common in clients with depressed mood, sleep disturbances, and anxiety due to serotonin deficiency (Vafiadis,
2021). Serotonin is a vital neurotransmitter for optimal functioning of body processes, enhancing learning, memory,
and happiness. Serotonin also regulates sleep, mood, digestion, satiety, bone health, wound healing, and sexual
desires. When there is an imbalance of serotonin, physical and psychological symptoms such as depression, mania,
and anxiety may occur (Cleveland Clinic, 2023b). The complex interrelationship between obesity and mental health
requires further exploration of the connections and weight-management strategies.

Nonpharmacologic Weight Management

Obesity is an epidemic worldwide caused by biological, genetic, social, environmental, and behavioral factors. There
is no single treatment or easy solution to reducing overweight and obesity; it is a multifaceted dilemma requiring
comprehensive multidimensional approaches that are individualized to the client. Weight reduction focuses on meal
planning and increasing physical activity to reduce weight, thus preventing or reducing obesity complication.
Nonpharmacological weight-loss strategies, such as behavioral lifestyle interventions of eating less and moving
more, should be initiated before drugs and/or procedures. Collaborative short-term weight-management and
behavioral goals should be developed with an experienced health care professional in weight management. Client
education and support are vital to weight-loss and management success.

A healthy meal plan should be balanced with moderate lean proteins and complex carbohydrates and should be low
in fat and sugar. Foods with a glycemic index (GI) of less than 55 are recommended to promote stable blood
glucose levels that aid in weight management. Foods in this category include most fruits and vegetables, beans,
minimally processed grains, pasta, low-fat dairy foods, and nuts (Harvard Health, 2023).

Lean-protein foods such as fish and poultry increase the basal metabolic rate while balancing the release of insulin
and serum glucose levels. This results in glucagon mobilizing adipose tissue and promoting more weight loss. A
consistent eating schedule also enhances constant blood glucose levels. Controlling blood glucose levels enhances
the body's ability to burn stored body fat while controlling hunger.

Eating many raw fresh fruits and vegetables is recommended to increase dietary fiber and promote clean eating.
Clean eating refers to eating foods that are in their natural state and unprocessed because these are nutrient-
dense foods and free of synthetic chemicals, preservatives, and additives such as sugar and salt (Dutter, 2019).
These additives are detrimental to health and often promote weight gain. Choosing foods that the client likes will
encourage adherence. Individual considerations must be taken into account to provide optimal nutrition, promote
weight loss, and ensure success. Eating fewer calories and increasing physical activity coupled with behavior
modification is the only way to lose weight. However, clients must be educated on eating the right foods in a
collaborative weight-management plan determined with a health care professional.

The Mediterranean diet, which is high in fish (especially those species high in omega-3 fatty acids), fresh fruits and
vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and olive oil, has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and
metabolic syndrome while promoting weight loss. Extra virgin olive oil is the main source of dietary fat in a
Mediterranean diet.

Some foods that help boost metabolism and quickly burn body fat are classified as thermogenic foods. Proteins are
considered a thermogenic food because the digestion process takes the longest and burns more calories. High-
protein foods incorporated into a daily meal plan help with weight loss by burning more calories. Plant-based
proteins such as lentils, chickpeas, black beans, hemp seeds, nuts, quinoa, tofu, and peanut butter help to increase
metabolism. Lean animal proteins such as poultry (white meat), fish (salmon, tuna, mackerel, herring, and sardines),
pork tenderloin, lean beef cuts, and eggs curb hunger while promoting thermogenesis. Caffeine and green tea are
excellent additives in a meal plan for thermogenesis. Other foods to enhance thermogenesis are coconut oil, ginger,
and capsaicin/red pepper. High-fiber foods also help increase thermogenesis.

Supplements such as garcinia cambogia, yohimbine, and bitter orange may also promote thermogenesis (National
Institutes of Health, 2022). Other supplements that help with weight loss and management include:

    · Chromium picolinate: Stabilizes metabolism of carbohydrates (reduces sugar cravings)
838  32 · Weight Management Drugs

         · Essential fatty acids (EFAs): Provide cellular nutritional support and appetite control
         · Amino acids: Decrease cravings and promote weight loss
         · Kelp: Balances minerals and aids in weight loss
         · Spirulina: Protein source, stabilizes blood glucose
         · Multivitamins: Provide nutritional support
         · Herbs: See Section 32.4 for more on herbal supplements

     In addition to a healthy meal plan, increasing physical activity promotes weight loss. Adding an exercise program
     should be done in consultation with the client's health care provider and an exercise professional. Limiting
     sedentary activities is key to enhancing weight loss. If a reduction in caloric intake and increasing physical activity is
     ineffective after 12 months, drugs such as anorexiants, lipase inhibitors, and herbal supplements may be used to aid
     in weight loss.

          CLINICAL TIP

      Talk to Your Client

       When discussing goals with a client who needs to lose weight, it is important to talk about all aspects of the
       client's life that affect weight management. Sustainable weight loss requires a comprehensive approach with a
       foundation on eating balanced, heart-healthy foods and getting consistent physical activity, along with adequate
       sleep and stress reduction.

          TRENDING TODAY

      Clinical Trials on Overweight and Obesity

       The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) has conducted clinical trials to
       prevent, detect, and treat overweight and obesity that lead to multiple system diseases. On its Health
       Information page, Clinical Trials for Overweight & Obesity (https://openstax.org/r/growthcharts), the NIDDK
       outlines how clinical trials may optimize weight management and overall health. Clinical trials are essential to
       help understand the best evidence-based strategies to prevent and minimize overweight and obesity.

       SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

       Weight-Loss Medications and Supplements

       Individual factors such as age, sex, and ethnicity must be considered with the use of all weight-loss medications
       and supplements. Older clients may not be able to absorb and excrete drugs, leading to ineffective or toxic
       doses. Safety concerns for various racial/ethnic groups include differences in absorption, metabolism,
       distribution, and excretion due to genetic components and possible cytochrome P-450 (CYP) deficiencies.
       Additionally, nurses must assess the client's ability to understand and comprehend medication instructions and
       education.

increasing norepinephrine availability to neural receptors. Although these drugs have gone through the standard
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process, many have been removed from the market due to the
critical and fatal effects of body stimulation.

Phentermine Hydrochloride

Phentermine hydrochloride is a sympathetic amine that stimulates the central nervous system to increase
norepinephrine (NE) availability. When NE is attached to brain receptors, it suppresses the appetite and increases
metabolism. Along with following a healthy diet, phentermine hydrochloride is used adjunctly as an oral tablet or
capsule to promote weight loss. It is recommended for short-term therapy (8-12 weeks) as a daily dose or three
times a day before meals.

Phentermine hydrochloride is a Schedule IV controlled substance because there may be a potential for problematic
use; it should not be used for clients with a history of substance misuse or substance use disorder.

Phentermine and Topiramate ER

The drugs phentermine (an anorexiant and stimulant) and extended-release topiramate (an anticonvulsant and
gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA]) are combined in a capsule for weight management. It is utilized in addition to
daily caloric restriction and increased physical activity in clients with an initial BMI of 30 kg/m2 or greater and at
least one other comorbidity of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and/or dyslipidemia.

Clients are initially started on a low dose of the drugs for 14 days; the dose is then increased yet still taken once per
day for 12 more weeks. Weight is assessed after 12 weeks of the increased dosage. If weight loss has not exceeded
3% of the baseline weight, the dose is either discontinued or increased again, with an increased dosing for another
14 days and increased again for 14 weeks. Baseline weight at that point is reassessed, looking for a 5% or more
weight loss over baseline. Daily doses are not increased in clients with renal and/or hepatic insufficiency.

Phentermine and topiramate ER is also a Schedule IV controlled substance.

Phendimetrazine

Phendimetrazine is an appetite suppressant used short-term to promote weight loss in conjunction with a low-
calorie diet and exercise in clients who did not lose weight with diet and exercise alone. The drug is available in
immediate-release (IR) tablets, extended-release (ER) capsules, and sustained-release (SR) capsules. It is
important to swallow the extended-release capsule whole. Clients should not crush, break, or chew it.

Dosage varies for each client. Clients should be educated to follow the prescribed dosage and instructions. Dosing is
determined by the provider based on both the client's individual needs and the dosage form (Mayo Clinic, 2023a).

Nurses should advise clients that if they miss a dose, they should take it as soon as possible; however, if it is close to
the time for the next dose, they should skip the dose. Clients should not take double doses. This medication is a
stimulant and should never be increased without the provider's advice.

Benzphetamine

The drug benzphetamine is another CNS stimulant used as an anorexiant for weight loss in clients with obesity.
Benzphetamine is an indirect sympathomimetic amine that acts like amphetamine, yet with fewer side effects. Its
effectiveness as an appetite suppressant is thought to be due to the stimulating effects on the hypothalamus that
release catecholamines. It is a Schedule III controlled substance for its potential for misuse and should not be used
in clients with addictive behaviors.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications

     All four drugs discussed in this section should not be administered within 14 days of taking a monoamine oxidase
     inhibitor (MAOI), such as phenelzine, selegiline, isocarboxazid, or tranylcypromine. Using these medicines together
     may cause serious unwanted effects (Mayo Clinic, 2023b).

     Use of phentermine hydrochloride is contraindicated in clients with hypersensitivity to sympathetic amines. The
     drug is a CNS stimulant, so it is often contraindicated in clients with hyperthyroid conditions, glaucoma, agitation,
     severe renal impairment, and/or cardiovascular disease such as coronary artery disease, stroke, arrhythmias,
     congestive heart failure, and uncontrolled hypertension (DailyMed, Adipex-P, 2020). Phentermine hydrochloride is
     used cautiously in clients with seizures, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and renal impairment. Caution also should
     be exercised in clients with a history of substance use disorder because there is a risk of misuse with Schedule III
     and Schedule IV drugs.

     Adverse effects of phentermine are related to the stimulant effects of the drug and include palpitations, tachycardia,
     arrythmias, precordial pain, nervousness, restlessness, dizziness, insomnia, anxiety, agitation, and tremors. Other
     adverse effects include hyper- or hypotension, syncope, pulmonary hypertension, fatigue, malaise, confusion,
     incoordination, headache, change in libido, gynecomastia, and hair loss. Severe hematological adverse effects are
     bone marrow suppression, agranulocytosis, and leukopenia. It is important to instruct clients not to take the drug
     late in the evening because it may cause insomnia.

     Along with MAOIs, phentermine is contraindicated with tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake
     inhibitors (SSRIs), and antihypertensive drugs.

     Life-threatening adverse drug reactions (ADRs) for phentermine and topiramate include hepatotoxicity and skin
     conditions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Life-
     threatening seizures may occur following abrupt discontinuation of the drug. Clients should be monitored closely for
     changes in behavior, such as the development of or worsening depression and/or suicidal ideation.

     Phentermine and topiramate ER combination is contraindicated in clients with hypersensitivity to either drug,
     sympathomimetics, or stimulants. It is also contraindicated in clients with glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, severe renal
     impairment, severe hepatic impairment, pregnancy, lactation, or history of suicidal ideation. Cautious use is
     recommended in clients with diabetes mellitus because there is a risk of hypoglycemia with weight loss. Clients with
     diabetes should be encouraged to speak to their provider about increasing capillary blood glucose testing and given
     parameters for when to call the provider. Abrupt withdrawal of the drug due to the topiramate component has been
     associated with seizures in clients without a history of seizures or epilepsy. In situations where immediate
     termination of phentermine plus topiramate is medically required, appropriate monitoring for seizure activity is
     recommended. Clients discontinuing the drug in a dosage of 15 mg/92 mg should be gradually tapered to reduce
     the possibility of precipitating a seizure.

Nursing Implications

The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking anorexiants:

· Assess the client's response to anorectic effects and dependency. It may become mentally and physically
   habit-forming (Mayo Clinic, 2023b).

· Monitor the client's cardiovascular status frequently because stimulant effects may alter blood pressure, heart
842  32 · Weight Management Drugs

          rate, exercise tolerance, and energy levels.
      · Monitor for peripheral edema if the client's cardiovascular system is compromised and pulmonary

          hypertension develops.
      · Monitor weight status at least three times per week.
      · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

          teaching guidelines.

     CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

     The client taking an anorexiant should:

         · Immediately report shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, fainting, or swelling of the extremities.
         · Understand that within a few weeks, tolerance to the appetite-suppressant effects may develop. The

             client should not increase the dose. If this occurs, they should notify the prescriber.
         · Monitor weight status at least three times per week, preferably at the same time of the day with the same

             amount of clothing using the same scale.
         · Notify the provider of any sudden behavior or mood changes, such as mood swings and/or aggressive/

             angry outbursts.
         · Take a missed dose as soon as possible; however, if it is close to the next dosage time, they should wait

             and just take the next dose.
         · Be aware of the potential for misuse of the drug and that the drug can be habit-forming.

     The client taking an anorexiant should not:

         · Take stimulants at night because the stimulation effects may cause severe insomnia.
         · Chew, crush, or open ER or SR capsules.
         · Take double the dosage.

       Many clients do not consult their health care provider when choosing to use dietary supplements for weight loss.
       It is imperative that health care professionals become educated on the dietary supplements that clients may use
       to lose weight. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has developed a comprehensive fact sheet for health care
       professionals on dietary supplements. The NIH also has a fact sheet for consumers on dietary supplements that
       health care professionals may find helpful in client education on the use of weight-loss supplements.

          SAFETY ALERT

      Anorexiants

       Clients with an eating disorder who are taking anorexiants have an increased risk of developing dependency.
       Also, stimulation effects on the body may lead to critical or fatal cardiovascular effects.

Lipase is a digestive enzyme that enables the body to digest and systemically absorb dietary fat. Lipase inhibitors
bind to gastric and pancreatic lipases in the intestine. This prevents hydrolysis of dietary triglycerides into
monoglycerides and fatty acids and the absorption of dietary fat. Currently, orlistat is the only one drug approved by
the FDA as a lipase inhibitor (Yip & Ambizas, 2019).

Orlistat

Orlistat (Alli, Xenical) is a nonsystemic gastric lipase inhibitor that reduces intestinal absorption of dietary fat by
approximately 30%. Orlistat binds to lipases, reducing absorption of dietary fat while also demonstrating the ability
to lower total cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins, fasting glucose, and insulin concentrations. Additionally, client
blood pressure measurements often improve (Sahebkar et al., 2018).

Orlistat is available as an oral capsule. Alli is available over the counter, whereas Xenical is available through a
prescription. Capsules are taken up to three times a day, up to 1 hour before meals containing fat. Dietary fat is not
absorbed systemically and is eliminated in feces.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Orlistat is not systemically absorbed, so the most common side effects are gastrointestinal: flatus, abdominal pain/
discomfort, nausea, oily rectal discharge, fecal urgency, diarrhea, and fatty/oily stool. The adverse GI effects often
subside within 4 weeks.

Orlistat is contraindicated in clients with hypersensitivity to the drug. It is also contraindicated in conditions such as
gallbladder disease, cholestasis, malabsorption X drug syndrome, hypothyroidism, anorexia/bulimia nervosa, and
organic causes of obesity. Orlistat is contraindicated in pregnant clients. It should be used cautiously with
gastrointestinal diseases, nephrolithiasis, hyperoxaluria, and known dietary deficiencies of vitamins A, D, E, and K.
Providers should exercise caution in older adults, lactating clients, and children under age 12.

     Nursing Implications
     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking orlistat:

         · Consistently monitor the client's weight, blood pressure, and serum lab values associated with obesity (e.g.,
             lipids, glucose, and hepatic function tests).

         · Monitor clients with diabetes closely for hypoglycemia and/or the need for medication reduction or
             elimination. With weight loss, a client's need for medications to treat diabetes may be reduced or eliminated.

         · Monitor clients with hypertension closely. With weight loss, a client's need for medications to treat
             hypertension may be reduced or eliminated.

         · Monitor client's weight every 3 months for dosage changes as needed.
         · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

             teaching guidelines.

       CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

       The client taking orlistat should:

           · Distribute daily fat intake evenly across all three meals.
           · Be educated to supplement with a multivitamin that also contains vitamins A, D, E, and K because lipase

               inhibitors may prevent absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Vitamin supplements should be taken 2 hours
               before or after taking a lipase inhibitor.
           · If taking levothyroxine concurrently, take orlistat 4 hours before or 4 hours after levothyroxine to avoid
               reducing the serum availability of levothyroxine.
           · Report low blood glucose levels to their health care provider because their medication may need to be
               readjusted or eliminated with weight loss.

       The client taking orlistat should not:

           · Eat very high-fat meals, to minimize uncomfortable GI effects.

     Nonpharmacological Lipase Inhibitors

     Nonpharmacological natural lipase inhibitors are present in various foods and supplements. Ox bile supplements
     have lipase inhibitor activity and are taken in much the same way as orlistat. Although ox bile supplements are
     considered safe, they may cause uncomfortable GI symptoms and deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K).
     Ox bile supplements have been used for centuries in Eastern medicine to support various GI symptoms.

     Less-invasive natural lipase inhibitors include caffeine, green coffee bean extract, tea (especially green tea), panax
     ginseng, soybeans, apples, grapevines, yerba mate, mulberry extract, and peanuts. These food items and
     supplements may contain several natural lipase inhibitors such as flavonoids, lactones, and polyphenols. However,
     any weight-loss supplements should only be used under the guidance of a weight-management health care
     professional.

       SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

       Losing Weight

       Finding a health care professional with experience in weight loss improves a person's long-term weight-loss and
       management success. Different modalities work for different clients. An experienced weight-loss health care
       professional can develop an individualized weight-loss plan that includes a foundation of meal planning and
       exercise.

Obesity is a global concern that may not be managed by diet and exercise alone. There are other adjunct
medications and supplements that can promote weight loss in conjunction with diet and exercise.

Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) Receptor Agonists

GLP-1 receptor agonist medications were originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes and control blood sugar;
however, they have been found to also cause weight loss and decrease the risk of cardiovascular events such as
heart attacks and strokes in clients with diabetes.

Semaglutide
Semaglutide, which mimics the GLP-1 hormone that is released in the gut in response to eating, is the newest
medication for weight management. Semaglutide is approved for weight loss only under the brand name Wegovy.
Semaglutide is also the active ingredient in several medications used to treat diabetes (Ozempic, Rybelsus).
However, due to differing doses and differences in how the drug is packaged, prescribers should take caution when
prescribing off-label.

Semaglutide is intended for use in adults with an initial BMI of 30 kg/m2 or greater (obesity) or an initial BMI of 27
kg/m2 or greater (overweight) and at least one weight-related comorbidity such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes
mellitus, or dyslipidemia (DailyMed, Wegovy, 2023). Semaglutide may be used in pediatric clients over age 12 who
have an initial BMI at or above the 95th percentile for their age and sex. According to UCLA Health (2023),
semaglutide emphasizes treating obesity as a chronic metabolic disease rather than solely a condition that requires
lifestyle/behavioral changes.

     TRENDING TODAY

 Weight Loss Benefits with Semaglutide

  Losing weight can positively affect many body systems, especially the cardiovascular system; however,
  semaglutide itself may also have cardiovascular benefits. A report by NBC News (https://openstax.org/r/
  nbcnews) discusses a potential reduction of cardioembolic events such as a myocardial infarction or
  cerebrovascular accident (stroke) in clients taking semaglutide.

When the blood glucose levels rise in response to ingested food, semaglutide mimics the GLP-1 hormone to
stimulate insulin release and decrease glucagon release. This action lowers serum glucose levels and delays gastric
emptying. A decrease in blood glucose and delayed gastric emptying suppress the appetite, which aids in weight
loss. Note that because semaglutide delays gastric emptying, it may alter the absorption of other medications and
supplements.

Liraglutide
Liraglutide has been shown to be an effective treatment to reduce weight in clients with obesity. Liraglutide is an
injectable medication classified as a glucagon-like peptide receptor agonist and incretin mimetic that triggers
increased insulin release and decreased glucagon release, lowering post-prandial blood glucose levels. By causing a
glucose-dependent release of insulin and a decrease in blood glucagon levels, there is a delay in gastric emptying,
leading to appetite suppression and weight loss. This action also causes an ancillary increase in heart rate of 10-20
846  32 · Weight Management Drugs

     beats per minute above the client's baseline.

     Liraglutide is highly bound to protein, has a large distribution area, and has a half-life of approximately 13 hours.
     This allows for a once-a-day subcutaneous (SQ) injection (abdomen, thigh, upper arm) without regard to meals to be
     effective. Double gloves and a protective gown (and goggles if necessary) should be worn during preparation and SQ
     administration to avoid unintentional absorption through the skin. Liraglutide has caused thyroid C-cell tumors in
     mice (DailyMed, Saxenda, 2021).

     Table 32.4 lists common GLP-1 drugs for weight loss and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

     Drug                             Routes and Dosage Ranges

     Semaglutide  Initial dose: 0.25 mg subcutaneously once a week for 4 weeks.
       (Wegovy)   Weeks 5-8: 0.5 mg/week.
                  Weeks 9-12: 1 mg/week.

                  Maximum dose: 2.4 mg/week.

     Liraglutide  3 mL prefilled injection pen: 6 mg/mL. Initial dose: 0.6 mg/day subcutaneously. After 1 week,
     (Saxenda)    increase daily dose by 0.6 mg per week at weekly intervals to reach 3.0 mg. Maximum dose: 3.0
                  mg/day.

     TABLE 32.4 Drug Emphasis Table: GLP-1 Drugs (source: https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/)

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Both semaglutide and liraglutide are contraindicated in clients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid
     carcinoma (MTC), multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2), serious hypersensitivity to liraglutide,
     diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), pancreatitis, suicidal attempts/ideation, pregnancy, and lactation. Semaglutide and
     liraglutide should be used cautiously in clients with alcohol use disorder, severe hypoglycemia, gastroparesis, renal
     and/or hepatic impairment, or history of angioedema. Caution should be exercised when used concurrently with
     insulin and insulin secretagogues like sulfonylureas. They should also be used cautiously in older adults. Safety in
     children under age 10 has not been established.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking a GLP-1 receptor antagonist should:

    · Use proper SQ injection technique and rotate injection sites weekly (liraglutide).
    · Monitor capillary blood glucose levels closely; immediately report hypoglycemia to the provider.
    · Drink adequate fluids to ensure hydration.
848  32 · Weight Management Drugs

     · Avoid alcohol, which may interfere with weight-loss drugs and potentially cause hypoglycemia.
     · Maintain an accurate food log that includes ingestion of water and physical activity. Handwritten logs

        facilitate clients staying on track and achieving success. Some clients use smartphone apps to log meals,
        water intake, and physical activity.
     · Follow up with their provider as instructed.

       Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) Receptor Agonists

       Semaglutide and liraglutide have been associated with thyroid tumors in animal studies; relevance to humans
       has not been established.

     Other Drugs for Weight Management

     Additional adjunct drugs and supplements target enzymatic and lipid metabolism to manage chronic obesity. These
     drugs do not fit into the previous categories of pharmacotherapeutics.

     Bupropion Naltrexone
     Bupropion naltrexone (Contrave) is a combination of an antidepressant (bupropion) and an opioid antagonist
     (naltrexone). Bupropion is commonly used for adult depression, seasonal affective disorder (SAD), and smoking
     cessation. Naltrexone is commonly used for substance use disorders because it blocks opioid receptors and the
     euphoric effects of alcohol and opioids. In combination, these two drugs have been found to promote weight loss as
     a dopamine reuptake inhibitor by affecting two different areas of the brain involved in hunger and satiety
     stimuli--the hypothalamic appetite regulatory center and the mesolimbic dopamine circuit reward system. The
     resultant decreased appetite results in therapeutic weight loss.

     Bupropion naltrexone is indicated for chronically overweight clients or those with chronic obesity with at least one
     other comorbidity (hypertension, type 2 diabetes, or dyslipidemia). This drug is used as an adjunct to a low-calorie
     diet and increased exercise in clients with obesity. Both drugs are well-absorbed orally, and a low-fat meal
     enhances absorption.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Adverse effects of bupropion naltrexone include life-threatening anaphylactic reactions (pruritis, urticaria, hives,
     dyspnea, angioedema), homicidal/suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and seizures. Common adverse effects include
     nausea, vomiting, constipation, and headache. Clients should be instructed to contact their provider immediately if
     any abnormal symptoms occur. Clients with diabetes should monitor capillary blood glucose levels 3-4 times per
     day for hypoglycemia caused by the drug and/or weight loss.

     Contraindications include a known hypersensitivity to bupropion or naltrexone, uncontrolled hypertension, end-
     stage renal disease, severe hepatic impairment and concurrent use of CYP2B6 inducers, seizure disorders, anorexia
     or bulimia, pregnancy, and in children. Concurrent use is contraindicated within 14 days of the use of an MAOI or
     use of opioids or other bupropion medications and antidepressants including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
     (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Bupropion
     naltrexone should be used cautiously in older adults secondary to possible adverse CNS effects and decreased renal
     excretion. Dosages are often decreased in cases of renal and hepatic impairment. Use of other bupropion-containing
     products may increase the risk of seizures. Bulimia and anorexia nervosa may also increase the risk of seizures.

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking bupropion naltrexone:

· Consistently monitor the client's weight, blood pressure, and serum lab values associated with obesity (e.g.,
   lipids, glucose, and hepatic function tests).

· Monitor clients with hypertension closely. With weight loss, a client's need for medications to treat
   hypertension may be reduced or eliminated.

· Monitor client's weight every 3 months for dosage changes as needed.
· Monitor for worsening signs of depression or suicidal ideation that may occur with some weight-loss

   supplements. It is critical that clinicians assess clients' mental status, mood changes, and significantly
   increased signs of depression (depressed mood, loss of interest in usual activities, insomnia or hypersomnia,
   psychomotor agitation or retardation, increased fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or
   impaired concentration, irritability, hostility, suicide attempt, or suicidal ideation), especially during the initial
   few months of therapy.
· Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client
   teaching guidelines.
850  32 · Weight Management Drugs

       CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

       The client taking bupropion naltrexone should:

           · Immediately report any increase in depressive symptoms and/or suicidal ideation to provider.
           · Report any signs or symptoms, such as headache, palpitations, dizziness, nervousness, irritability, to the

               provider.
           · Drink adequate fluids to ensure hydration.
           · Avoid alcohol, which may interfere with weight-loss drugs and potentially cause hypoglycemia.
           · Maintain an accurate food log that includes ingestion of water and physical activity. Handwritten logs

               facilitate clients staying on track and achieving success. Some clients use smartphone apps to log meals,

           · Follow up with their provider as instructed.

       FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

       Bupropion

       Bupropion has been shown to increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior in short-term trials.

     Supplements and Herbal Remedies for Weight Management

     Supplements such as chromium picolinate, conjugate linoleic acid, glucomannan, green tea extract, guarana, and
     hoodia have been credited with supporting weight loss. The success of these supplements, just like drugs, relies on
     their being adjuvant to low-calorie meals and exercise. A successful weight-management plan is individualized and
     client centered and may include natural food or herbal supplements to aid in weight loss. Stress-reduction
     techniques also play a role in lowering cortisol levels and improving mental well-being because stress may impede
     weight-loss success.

     Chromium Picolinate
     Chromium is an essential mineral involved in glucose metabolism and is often called glucose tolerance factor (GTF).
     It is found in various foods such as beef, chicken, eggs, dairy products, broccoli, potatoes, and garlic, but it is poorly
     absorbed, prompting some clients to use supplements. Picolinate acid, an amino acid, is added to chromium to
     improve the absorption and aid insulin function. However, excessive supplementation can lead to toxicity. Research
     indicates that chromium picolinate can lower blood glucose and serum cholesterol, promote fat loss, and increase
     lean muscle mass, especially in clients with type 2 diabetes. Clients who are dependent on insulin should use it
     under medical guidance and monitor their capillary blood glucose levels (Balch, 2023).

     Conjugated Linoleic Acid
     Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a polyunsaturated fatty acid found naturally in animal food products such as beef,
     lamb, butter, and dairy products. Synthetic CLA may be produced from safflower, sunflower, corn, and soybean oils.
     This essential fatty acid has been found to have antiobesogenic and antiatherosclerotic properties (den Hartigh,
     2019). The metabolic mechanism of action of CLA reduces lipogenesis while promoting lipolysis to improve body
     composition. Studies have found that CLA increases lipolysis significantly in human fat cells (adipocytes) while
     decreasing the synthesis of fatty acids (Basak & Duttaroy, 2020). The use of CLA may interfere with CYP enzyme
     functions. It may also interfere with the effectiveness of tamoxifen, a breast cancer medication.

     Glucomannan
     Processed foods have removed much of the natural fiber in the American diet. Fiber supplements are often used for
     overall health and wellness. Glucomannan is a dietary fiber extracted from the konjac (elephant yam), a Japanese
     root vegetable. Glucomannan passes unchanged into the colon, where it works as a dietary fiber. It is one of the
     most potent fibers because it can absorb up to 50 times its weight in water; therefore, a smaller amount is taken
     than for other fiber supplements.

     Some research has shown that supplementing with glucomannan may reduce body weight but not BMI in the short

32.4 · Other Drugs, Supplements, and Herbal Remedies                                                                           851

term in otherwise healthy adults with overweight or obesity. Other research has shown that daily 4-gram doses of
glucomannan consumed over 8 weeks did not lead to weight loss or changes in body composition, did not lead to
feelings of hunger or meal satiation, and did not impact cholesterol or blood sugar levels (MacPherson, 2022).

Glucomannan reduces weight in the same way as other water-soluble, fermentable fibers do--through low energy
density and bulking properties causing a laxative effect. The absorption of water expands glucomannan in the
gastrointestinal tract, producing satiety. Additionally, glucomannan, like all fiber foods, stabilizes blood glucose
levels and reduces total cholesterol and LDL levels through fecal excretion. As with all fiber supplements, adequate
water intake is essential to avoid constipation.

Green Tea Extract
Second to water, tea is the most consumed beverage globally. Green tea is one of the healthiest teas available for
consumption. Green tea contains polyphenols and phytochemicals with antioxidant and antiviral properties. The
health-enhancing properties of green tea are numerous. One of the polyphenols in green tea helps protect the DNA
in the body's cells from oxidative stress. This boosts the body's immune system to combat many conditions and
illnesses, including cancer. A study in South Korea found that consistently drinking green tea reduced abdominal
obesity by 44% (Kwak & Shin, 2022).

The natural pharmacological effects of green tea are related to the increased fatty acid oxidation that reduces body
and abdominal fat. Additionally, green tea lowers concentrations of total cholesterol, serum free fatty acids, and
leptin levels. These effects may decrease the incidence of metabolic syndrome.

Guarana
Guarana is a seed with stimulant and phytochemical properties containing caffeine as the active ingredient. It is
used as a general intestinal detoxification herb and stimulant to improve mental alertness and increase metabolic
rate. Guarana is rich in antioxidants and is like green tea in its properties. Consumers can find guarana in energy
drinks, soft drinks, smoking-cessation products, and vitamin supplements. Guarana alone does not significantly
promote weight loss; it must be combined with a low-calorie diet and exercise. Due to the stimulant effects, guarana
should not be used by clients with hypertension or cardiovascular conditions such as dysrhythmias. A disadvantage
for consumers is that it is not easy to determine how much caffeine content any specific product contains.

Hoodia Gordonii
Hoodia gordonii, commonly called hoodia, is an African cactus that the San Bushmen used historically as an appetite
suppressant. There are several hoodia supplements marketed as weight-loss supplements. According to the
National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (2020), there has been little research on the weight-loss
properties of hoodia in humans and its efficacy in weight loss.

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking supplements and herbal remedies for weight
management:

    · Teach clients to monitor for signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia that may occur from weight loss and/or the
        supplement. Signs of hypoglycemia include headache, nervousness, irritability, sweating, clammy skin,
        shakiness, and palpitations.

    · Educate clients that some over-the-counter (OTC) products may not be safe and can interact with other
        prescribed medications, including increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. Recreational alcohol ingestion may also
        cause hypoglycemia.

    · Monitor for worsening signs of depression or suicidal ideation that may occur with some weight-loss
        supplements. It is critical that clinicians assess clients' mental status, mood changes, and significantly
        increased signs of depression (depressed mood, loss of interest in usual activities, insomnia or hypersomnia,
        psychomotor agitation or retardation, increased fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or
        impaired concentration, irritability, hostility, suicide attempt or suicidal ideation), especially during the initial
        few months of therapy.

    · Provide client teaching regarding the supplement or herbal remedy and when to call the health care provider.

         · Learn about the safety and efficacy of products because they are not medically investigated or regulated.
         · Talk with their health care provider for a fully informed weight-loss plan.
         · Follow the manufacturer's and provider's guidelines.

     The client taking a supplement or herbal remedy for weight management should not:

33.3 Introduction to the Urinary System

INTRODUCTION The renal system, consisting of the kidneys, ureters, and urethra, has several essential functions
(Ogobuiro & Tuma, 2022). In addition to filtering and removing waste products from the body, it also regulates
plasma osmolarity, acid-base balance, and blood pressure (BP). Accordingly, the renal system affects many cells
and organs within the body. Acute kidney injury affects as many as 60% of all critically ill hospitalized clients
(Pickkers et al., 2021). The ureters, bladder, and urethra are at risk from infection, obstruction, vascular
compromise, and other conditions. Chronic renal disease, often associated with hypertension and diabetes, affects
one in seven adults, and 90% of those affected are unaware of their condition (National Institute of Diabetes and
Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 2021).

Kidneys

The kidneys have three main functions: filtration, reabsorption, and secretion. The kidneys filter 200 liters of fluid
daily to remove waste products that exit the body in the urine. Collecting important nutrients, ions, and proteins
protects the body against deficiencies. The individual processes for the three main functions are listed here and

     explained in greater detail in later sections of this chapter:

         · Removal of the waste products of metabolism
         · Regulation of electrolytes and fluid
         · Acid-base balance regulation
         · Maintenance of systemic blood pressure
         · Erythropoietin secretion
         · Vitamin D3 metabolism
         · Gluconeogenesis

     Kidneys' Anatomical Structure
     The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs positioned in the retroperitoneum slightly above the waist, between the
     T12 and L3 vertebrae. The right kidney sits slightly lower than the left to accommodate the liver. Each kidney weighs
     approximately 135-150 g and is approximately 10-12 cm long. The adrenal glands are located on the upper pole of
     each kidney, and the spleen is connected anteriorly to the upper pole of the left kidney by the splenorenal
     ligaments.

     The exterior of the kidney has three protective layers: the renal fascia, which is the outermost layer; the perirenal fat
     capsule; and the renal capsule, which consists of fibrous connective tissue. The interior of the kidney is divided into
     three distinct areas: the outermost cortex, the medulla, and the renal pelvis. The renal cortex contains nephrons,
     the functional units of the kidney, which merge into the collecting ducts and the convoluted tubules. The renal
     medulla contains 8 to 18 renal pyramids with the bases located adjacent to the cortex and the apices connecting to
     the minor calyces (Sorano et al., 2023). The minor calyces drain into the major calyces, which are large collecting
     spaces near the ureters' superior edge. The renal papillae are openings at the bottom of the renal pyramids where
     urine enters the collecting ducts. The renal columns are cortical tissues that separate the pyramids and provide
     space for the interlobar arteries. The urine moves from the pyramids to the funnel-shaped renal pelvis in the center
     of the kidney to the ureters (see Figure 33.2).

     FIGURE 33.2 The renal columns serve to divide the kidney into 6-8 lobes and provide a supportive framework for vessels that enter and
     exit the cortex. The pyramids and renal columns taken together constitute the kidney lobes. (credit: modification of work from Anatomy and

     Kidneys' Vascular Structure
     The renal arteries branch off the aorta at the L1/L2 intervertebral disk level just inferior to the mesenteric artery.
     Each artery is 4-6 cm long and 5-6 mm in diameter. The renal artery divides into anterior and posterior branches
     before entering the kidney at the hilum, an indentation on the medial side of the organ that allows blood vessels,

lymphatic vessels, and nerves to enter and exit the kidney. The segmental arteries eventually form the arterioles
that supply the glomerular capillaries. The vasa recta is the network of capillaries that supply the proximal and
distal tubules and the loop of Henle.

Kidneys' Lymphatic Structure
Two separate lymphatic systems supply the kidney. One branch supplies the interior and the exterior of the renal
capsule in the cortex, and the other surrounds the arterial blood vessels. Both systems drain from the hilum into the
para-aortic lymph nodes.

Kidneys' Neural Structure
The sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system innervates the kidney. The splanchnic nerves from the
renal plexus control the constriction of the arterioles in the renal cortex. These nerves travel from the renal vessels
to the smooth muscle of the remaining areas of the nephron, including the juxtaglomerular cells that secrete renin.
Sympathetic stimulation results in constriction of the renal vessels and the release of renin. In addition, there are
pain receptors in the renal and urinary structures from the renal pelvis to the urinary meatus.

Nephrons

The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney and contains these structures (see Figure 33.3):

    · Glomerulus and Bowman's capsule, which together comprise the renal corpuscle
    · Proximal convoluted tubule, located in the renal cortex
    · Descending loop of Henle
    · Ascending limb in the renal medulla
    · Thick ascending limb
    · Distal convoluted tubule
    · Collecting duct

FIGURE 33.3 Various portions of the nephron differ in their capacity to reabsorb water and specific solutes. While much of the reabsorption
and secretion occur passively based on concentration gradients, the amount of water that is reabsorbed or lost is tightly regulated. (credit:

860  33 · Introduction to the Renal and Urinary Systems

     There are approximately 1 million nephrons in each kidney. There are two types of nephrons, which are labeled
     according to their anatomical position. Eighty-five percent of the nephrons are cortical nephrons, located in the
     outer renal cortex and extending partially into the medulla. The nephron loops are short and are supplied by the
     peritubular capillaries. The juxtamedullary nephrons are positioned at the junction of the renal cortex and the renal
     medulla. The nephron loop extends into the medulla and is surrounded by the vasa recta, a network of capillaries
     originating from the efferent arteriole. The cortical portion of the juxtamedullary nephron is also surrounded by the
     peritubular capillaries, which aid in the concentration and volume control of urine.

     Blood is filtered by the globe-shaped renal corpuscle, which contains the glomerulus and Bowman's capsule. The
     glomerulus is a tufted structure of fenestrated capillaries essential to filtration. The glomerulus is enclosed in a
     double-layered structure, the Bowman's capsule, which has two surfaces, the exterior parietal layer and the interior
     visceral layer. The parietal layer is composed of squamous epithelial cells. The visceral layer is composed of
     specialized epithelial cells called podocytes that encircle the glomerular capillaries. Extensions of the podocytes
     called pedicles also surround the capillaries, forming filtration slits or pores that also aid filtration. The space
     between the visceral and parietal layers, the capsular space or Bowman's space, becomes the lumen of the renal
     tubule. The fluid that is filtered from the glomerular capillaries moves to the renal tubule as filtrate.

     The mesangial cells, located around the glomerular capillaries, regulate the surface area that is available for
     glomerular filtration. The cells contract in response to the stretch of increased blood in the capillaries, decreasing
     the surface area. Conversely, the filtration surface area increases when the cells are relaxed. The cells contract in
     response to angiotensin II and endothelin and relax in response to atrial natriuretic peptides (ANPs) and nitric oxide.

     The renal tubule consists of three different areas with specialized structures and functions. Initially, the filtrate
     flows through the proximal tubule, which has straight sections and "convoluted" sections. This is the longest
     segment of the renal tubule, and the surface of the lumen has microvilli that increase the filtration surface area.

     The second area, the nephron loop (loop of Henle), has two sections: the descending limb and the ascending limb.
     The descending limb, which consists of simple squamous cells, is often identified as the thin descending limb,
     whereas the ascending limb is mostly composed of cuboidal epithelial cells and is called the thick ascending limb.

     The terminal portion of the nephron, the distal tubule, also contains straight and convoluted sections; however, the
     structure is composed of simple cuboidal epithelial cells without the microvilli. The fluid leaves the distal tubule and
     enters the collection system.

     The Juxtaglomerular Apparatus
     The macula densa cells are located at the boundary between the ascending loop of Henle and the distal tubules.
     These cells contact the juxtaglomerular cells of the smooth muscles of afferent and efferent arterioles to control
     glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and blood pressure.

     Additional Regulatory Functions of the Nephron
     Three additional functions of the nephron are important to discuss:

         · Erythropoietin production: When the partial pressure of dissolved oxygen in the blood (pO2) is decreased,
             erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone produced by the peritubular cells in the renal cortex, is released. The EPO
             stimulates the production of red blood cells by the bone marrow (Schoener & Borger, 2022).

         · Gluconeogenesis: The proximal tubules of the kidney are responsible for producing 40% of the glucose
             needed to maintain homeostatic glucose levels. The kidney increases glucose production in response to
             acidosis or when stimulated by stress hormones such as cortisol (Legouis et al., 2022).

         · Vitamin D3 conversion: Vitamin D from the diet and skin absorption is converted to 25-hydroxyvitamin D
             (25[OH]D) in the liver and then to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the active form of the vitamin, in the kidneys.
             Deficient vitamin D levels are associated with altered calcium balance and bone metabolism (Kim et al.,
             2021).

     Glomerular Filtration

     Glomerular filtration is the initial step in removing waste and concentrating the urine. The filtration membrane
     consists of three layers: the fenestrated glomerular capillary endothelial cells, the basal lumina, and the podocytes
     in the visceral layer of the glomerular or Bowman's capsule. The first layer, the openings in the fenestrated

     Access for free at openstax.org
33.1 · Introduction to the Renal System                                                                                   861

glomerular capillary endothelial cells, allows the movement of molecules up to 100 nanometers in size, which
means that platelets and blood cells are not filtered from the capillaries. The basal lumina is a thin layer of tissue
between the glomerular endothelial cells and the podocytes. The collagen fibers from this layer generate a mesh
that creates a second barrier. This collagen mesh blocks most plasma proteins by size and also blocks negatively
charged proteins regardless of size. The filtration slits or pores formed by the podocytes provide the third barrier to
filtration. These openings block plasma proteins from entering the filtrate. The filtrate consists of the fluids and
solutes that progress through the filtration membrane. Substances that are commonly included in the filtrate
include water, glucose, electrolytes, amino acids, and smaller proteins.

The Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)

The kidneys filter approximately 200 liters of fluid every day (Ogobuiro & Tuma, 2022). The normal glomerular
filtration rate is 120-125 mL per minute (Ogobuiro & Tuma, 2022). This value is influenced by the client's age,
weight, and muscle mass. Filtration is increased by the glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure and Bowman's
capsule oncotic pressure, and filtration is opposed by the glomerular oncotic pressure and the Bowman's capsule
hydrostatic pressure. Note that the oncotic pressure in the Bowman's capsule is normally near zero because
proteins and cells do not enter the capsule.

Three elements determine the critical net filtration pressure required for homeostatic glomerular filtration:

    · Glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure: The pressure in the glomerular capillary bed is 55 mm Hg and is the
        major filtration force (Ogobuiro & Tuma, 2022).

    · Glomerular capillary oncotic pressure: This pressure is determined by the oncotic pressure of the blood in the
        glomerulus. This pressure is higher than the average oncotic pressure because water is quickly filtered from
        the blood. This pressure opposes filtration because the increased osmotic pressure can pull the water from
        the filtrate into the arterioles.

    · Bowman's capsule hydrostatic pressure: The hydrostatic pressure is determined by the amount of fluid in the
        capsular space. The amount of fluid is determined by the rate at which the filtrate enters the capsular space,
        which is greater than the rate at which the filtrate empties into the lumen of the tubule. This pressure opposes
        filtration.

Autoregulation of the Glomerular Filtration Rate
Autoregulation of the GFR maintains homeostatic renal function when the systemic blood pressure (BP) is
abnormally increased or decreased. There are two intrinsic or local renal responses that respond to these
alterations: the myogenic response and tubuloglomerular feedback.

Myogenic Response
The myogenic response maintains the renal blood flow at homeostatic levels in response to the stretch of the
vascular smooth muscles of the afferent arterioles. When the systemic BP is elevated, the afferent arterioles are
stretched and the GFR is increased. The kidney responds by constricting the afferent arterioles, which decreases the
blood being filtered, returning the GFR to normal. When the systemic BP is decreased, the afferent arterioles are
stretched less than normal and the GFR declines. The kidney responds by dilating the smooth muscles of the
arterioles, which increases the renal blood flow and the GFR.

The myogenic response rapidly addresses alterations in the GFR; however, the response only occurs when the
systolic blood pressure is 80-180 mm Hg. When the systolic BP is above 180 mm Hg, additional smooth muscle
constriction is not possible. Conversely, when the pressure falls below 80 mm Hg, additional dilation of the
arterioles will not increase the GFR.

Tubuloglomerular Feedback
The macula densa cells located around the distal tubule react to the changes in the glomerular filtration rate. When
the filtration rate increases the amount of sodium and chloride, the ultrafiltrate also increases, which results in
additional absorption of these ions by the macula densa cells. The cells respond to these changes by releasing ATP
(adenosine triphosphate) from the basolateral membrane, which directly or indirectly constricts the afferent
arterioles. The ATP directly constricts the arterioles, and ATP converted to adenosine indirectly constricts the
afferent arterioles. This constriction decreases renal blood flow and returns the GFR to normal. When the filtration
rate decreases, less sodium and chloride are delivered to the macula densa cells, which triggers dilation of the
862  33 · Introduction to the Renal and Urinary Systems

     afferent arterioles and constriction of the efferent arterioles. This results in increased hydrostatic pressure that
     returns the GFR to normal. In addition to autoregulation, the tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism also
     contributes to renal homeostasis by regulating sodium secretion and renin release.

     Hormonal Actions Affecting the Glomerular Filtration Rate
     Several hormones regulate kidney function by stimulating or inhibiting renal blood flow. Two of these processes are
     described below.

     Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS)
     The primary function of the RAAS is to control systemic blood pressure and fluid balance; however, the system also
     contributes to homeostasis of the glomerular filtration rate and tubular reabsorption of electrolytes. Three
     conditions can trigger the system: sympathetic nerve stimulation, decreased glomerular hydrostatic pressure, and
     feedback from the macula densa cells in the glomerular feedback system.

     In response to decreased renal blood flow caused by decreased systemic blood pressure, the juxtaglomerular cells
     in the afferent arteriole trigger the release of renin. This action results in the conversion of angiotensinogen from the
     liver to angiotensin I. In the lung, the angiotensin-converting enzyme converts angiotensin I, activating angiotensin
     II. Angiotensin II constricts systemic and renal efferent arterioles; prompts reabsorption of sodium, chloride, and
     water by osmosis from the proximal tubule; releases aldosterone, which further increases sodium ion and water
     reabsorption in the distal tubule; and stimulates the thirst response.

     Atrial Natriuretic Peptides
     The atrial natriuretic peptides (ANPs) are released from the atria in response to increased atrial blood volume. The
     primary purpose of the ANPs is regulation of the systemic blood pressure; however, one part of that process involves
     increasing the GFR. In the glomerulus, the ANPs dilate the afferent arterioles and constrict the efferent arterioles.
     This increases the glomerular hydrostatic pressure, resulting in increased GFR, which increases the urinary output
     and decreases the blood pressure.

     Sympathetic Nervous System Effect on the GFR
     Stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system regulates blood pressure by constricting systemic blood vessels,
     including the afferent arterioles. The effect of this stimulation on the GFR varies according to the level of
     sympathetic response. When the sympathetic stimulation is low due to mild exercise, the juxtaglomerular cells
     release a weaker form of angiotensin II, which increases the GFR and the systemic BP. Conversely, when
     sympathetic stimulation is high due to blood loss or strenuous physical activity, large amounts of angiotensin II are
     secreted, constricting both the afferent and efferent arterioles, which decreases the GFR. This response protects

      Tubular Reabsorption (https://openstax.org/r/khanacademy)

       This article from Khan Academy discusses the process of tubular reabsorption in the nephron.

     Tubular Reabsorption

     The tubules are responsible for selective reabsorption of electrolytes, nutrients, and water from the filtrate and the
     return of these substances to the circulating blood volume. These mechanisms are responsible for moving water
     and substances from one area to another:

         · Active transport: Active transport uses energy, ATP, to move a substance across a membrane from an area of
             low concentration to an area of higher concentration of that substance.

         · Diffusion: Simple diffusion follows the concentration gradient and moves substances across a membrane from
             an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. This process does not require energy
             expenditure.

         · Facilitated diffusion: This process also moves substances along a concentration gradient; however, membrane
             receptors or channel proteins are required for the transfer (Ogobuiro & Tuma, 2022).

         · Secondary transport systems: Secondary transport systems, including symport and antiport structures, each

        require energy. Symport structures move two or more substances in the same direction simultaneously.
        Antiport structures move two or more substances across the cell membrane in different directions.

The Proximal Tubule
Approximately 65% of the filtrate is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. The active transport of elements by the
sodium/potassium pumps consumes 6%-8% of the daily ATP expenditure. The microvilli lining the tubule facilitate
rapid reabsorption of the following elements to support homeostasis (Zhang & Mahler, 2021):

    · Proximal tubular reabsorption
          Glucose: Secondary active transport with sodium
          Proteins and amino acids: Secondary active transport with sodium
          Sodium: Two-thirds actively reabsorbed
          Chloride: Symport reabsorption with sodium, diffusion
          Vitamins and lactate: Reabsorbed
          Bicarbonate ions: Symport reabsorption with sodium
          Water: Two-thirds reabsorbed osmotically

    · Loop of Henle reabsorption
          Water: Reabsorbed by osmosis
          Sodium: Reabsorbed by active transport
          Chloride: Reabsorbed by diffusion

    · Distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct reabsorption
          Water: Reabsorbed by osmosis
          Sodium: Reabsorbed by active transport
          Chloride: By symport and diffusion
          Bicarbonate: By antiport with chloride
          Calcium: Reabsorbed
          Potassium and hydrogen: Directed by hormones

Concentration of the Urine
The cells in the distal convoluted tubule are responsible for the final concentration of water and solutes in the urine.
The remaining water, sodium, chloride, calcium, and bicarbonate ions are reabsorbed as noted above. The cells are
hormonally controlled by aldosterone, antidiuretic hormone (ADH), and ANPs. Aldosterone, released by the adrenal
cortex, increases cellular permeability to sodium and increases the number of sodium and potassium pumps, which
increases sodium reabsorption from the filtrate. ADH is released from the posterior pituitary gland and facilitates
water reabsorption by opening the aquaporins in the tubular cells. These cells are impermeable to water when ADH
is absent, resulting in large volumes of water in the urine. The ANPs inhibit the action of aldosterone and ADH,
resulting in water retention and sodium absorption (Gewin, 2021).

Tubular Secretion

Tubular secretion is the movement of substances from the peritubular vessels into the tubular lumen to be excreted
in the urine. The substances either are moved by passive diffusion from the peritubular capillaries into the
interstitial space or are transported across the epithelial lumen of the nephron by active transport requiring ATPase.
The proximal tubules secrete nitrogenous waste products such as urea, ammonia, and creatinine; excess hydrogen
ions; and toxic substances including many protein-bound drugs that do not cross the glomerular basement
membrane. The distal tubules secrete potassium and hydrogen ions in response to the hormonal control noted
previously.

Common Conditions Affecting Kidney Function

Kidney function is affected by systemic disease, as discussed in the following section; however, several intrinsic/
intrarenal conditions can affect renal homeostasis:

    · Congenital abnormalities: These are alterations in anatomy or physiology that are present at birth. With renal
        agenesis and renal hypoplasia, the kidneys fail to develop in utero and the infant is born without kidneys (renal
        agenesis) or with only one kidney (renal hypoplasia). Renal agenesis is incompatible with extrauterine life, and
864  33 · Introduction to the Renal and Urinary Systems

             the infant is often stillborn. The infant can survive with a single kidney; however, additional congenital
             abnormalities usually threaten the infant's survival.
         · Genetic disorders: Multiple forms of polycystic kidney disease can present in childhood or adulthood. These
             fluid-filled cysts interfere with urine formation and increase the risk of infection and hemorrhage. The disease
             course is complicated by hypertension, progressive loss of kidney function, and pain. Additional renal
             conditions, such as renal calculi, are also common in this client population.
         · Neoplasms: General risk factors for renal neoplasms are similar to other types of cancer: smoking, obesity,
             hypertension, history of renal dialysis or transplant, and exposure to environmental toxins.

               Wilms tumor/nephroblastoma: Presents in childhood with the onset of hypertension and kidney
                   enlargement. It is the most common renal cancer in children and has a 90% five-year survival rate.

         · Acute and chronic pyelonephritis (infection): The renal system has multiple protective mechanisms against
             infection; however, the most common infections ascend from the ureters, bladder, and urethra. The usual
            causative agent is Escherichia coli. Infections associated with indwelling urinary catheters are common in
             hospitalized clients, and these infections can progress to chronic renal failure in susceptible clients.

         · Glomerulopathies: Glomerulopathies are disorders of the glomerular capillaries. These disorders can be due
             to systemic, autoimmune, or intrinsic renal alterations. Common manifestations include proteinuria,
             decreased GFR, hypertension, and edema. These disorders are progressive and commonly result in end-stage
             renal disease (ESRD).
               Nephrotic syndrome: A disorder associated with massive proteinuria, edema, and hypertension. It
                   commonly progresses to ESRD.

         · Renal calculi: Also called nephrolithiasis, urolithiasis, or kidney stones; are commonly composed of calcium
             crystals. Risk factors for stone formation include hypertension, red meat ingestion, obesity, family history of
             nephrolithiasis, prolonged immobility, vesicoureteral reflux, and hyperparathyroidism. Stones may be
             asymptomatic and excreted without further intervention; however, large stones can move from the kidney
             pelvis to the ureteral junction or further in the ureter, causing obstruction and pain (renal colic). Lithotripsy or
             endoscopy may be necessary to remove the obstruction. Preventive measures include maintaining oral fluid
             intake at 64-96 fluid ounces per day (or approximately 2-3 liters), avoiding additional calcium intake, and
             limiting dietary sodium and protein (National Kidney Foundation, 2019). Clients with recurrent stone
             formation require chemical analysis of the stones to address dietary restrictions.

     33.2 Renal-Associated Fluid Volume Excess

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 33.2.1 Describe the pathophysiology of fluid volume excess as it relates to the renal system.
         · 33.2.2 Identify clinical manifestations related to fluid volume excess as it relates to the renal system.
         · 33.2.3 Identify the etiology and diagnostic studies related to fluid volume excess as it relates to the renal

             system.

     Fluid Volume Excess and the Kidneys

     Fluid volume excess (FVE) is identified as hypervolemia, or increased blood volume. It is related to excessive intake
     or inadequate output of body water. In critically ill clients, infusion of crystalloid intravenous fluids can cause
     hypervolemia manifested by FVE. Additional primary causes of FVE include psychogenic water intoxication,
     syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), nephrotic syndrome, and liver cirrhosis.

     More commonly, FVE is due to damage to the renal system by some other disease state. The compensatory
     mechanisms that maintain homeostasis can also be diminished or inactivated by inflammatory processes,

infections, vascular compromise, obstruction, nephrotoxic molecules, or genetic defects that affect the kidney.
Altered kidney function resulting in FVE is often discussed in terms of prerenal, intrinsic renal (or intrarenal), and
postrenal causes.

Prerenal Conditions Associated with Fluid Volume Excess
The most common prerenal causes of FVE are altered renal perfusion due to a significant decrease in the circulating
blood volume resulting from hemorrhage, hypovolemia, burns, shock states, myocardial infarction and heart failure,
or occlusion or stenosis of the renal artery. The altered oxygen level resulting from decreased perfusion damages
the renal tubules, and the resulting FVE is relative to the extent of that damage. Depending on the precipitating
cause, the cellular injury may be limited to sloughing of the tubule cells into the lumen of the tubule, or the injury
may progress to tubular necrosis. Common causes include acute myocardial infarction (AMI), cerebral vascular
accident (CVA), and damage from medications or other chemicals.

Intrinsic/Intrarenal Conditions Associated with Fluid Volume Excess
Intrinsic kidney damage resulting in FVE may be due to acute or chronic changes associated with malignant
hypertension, ischemia due to transfusion reactions, rhabdomyolysis, nephrotoxic effects of aminoglycoside
antibiotics, heavy metals, recreational drugs, contrast media, infections such as acute glomerulonephritis,
interstitial diseases including pyelonephritis, acute allergic interstitial nephritis, pressure from tumor growth, or
stone formation in the renal pelvis or the ureters. Ischemic damage to the nephrons is intermittently distributed
along the nephron, whereas nephrotoxic damage is limited to the proximal tubule.

Postrenal Conditions Associated with Fluid Volume Excess
Obstruction of the urinary tract causes a backflow of urine into the kidneys. This increases intraluminal pressure in
the tubules, causes ischemia, and decreases the GFR, resulting in FVE. The common causes of obstruction include
benign prostatic hypertrophy, intra-abdominal tumors, neurogenic bladder, and ureteral obstruction that is often
caused by edema formation following diagnostic testing.

Clinical Manifestations of Fluid Volume Excess

The manifestations of fluid volume excess may vary according to the specific cause of the excess. Common
manifestations of FVE include (Lewis, 2022; Stickel et al., 2019):

    · Edema in dependent soft tissues
    · Ascites
    · Adventitious breath sounds (crackles or rales)
    · Jugular vein distention
    · Rapid weight gain

Diagnostic Studies

Laboratory tests can indicate how much kidney function has been altered by the underlying cause of the FVE. Fluid
volume excess decreases sodium, hematocrit, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum osmolarity values. Common
laboratory studies include (American Board of Internal Medicine, 2023; Padilla & Abadie, 2022):

    · Glomerular filtration rate: The GFR provides the most accurate laboratory assessment of renal function.
        Measurement of the actual filtration rate is possible; however, the procedures are costly and expose the client
        to either an insulin infusion or a radioisotope injection. The calculated estimate of the GFR is the result of a
        mathematical calculation based on the client's serum creatinine level, age, sex, ethnicity and weight. The
        Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation and the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology
        Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation are the most common equations used for estimating GFR in clients age 18
        and over (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, n.d.). The value is expressed as
        the filtration rate in milliliters per minute per average body surface area. The normal range is greater than or
        equal to 90 mL/minute/1.73 m2. GFR levels associated with FVE may be initially elevated; however,
        depending on the cause of the alteration and the resulting tubular damage, the GFR may fall below 60 mL/
        minute.

    · Sodium: The normal serum sodium level is 136-145 mEq/L. Hyponatremia results from increased fluid intake
        and may be manifested by FVE, depending on the client's kidney function. Mildly depressed levels may cause
866  33 · Introduction to the Renal and Urinary Systems

             nausea and malaise. Moderately depressed levels can cause progressive neurological alterations including
             headache and lethargy progressing to seizures, coma, and death. Pulmonary edema unrelated to cardiac
             events has also been reported.
         · Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): The normal BUN ranges from 8-20 mg/dL. The BUN varies inversely with the fluid
             volume balance; therefore, fluid volume excess will decrease the BUN.
         · Serum albumin: Decreased serum albumin levels result in the movement of fluid from the vascular space to
             the interstitial space, which increases edema. The normal range is 3.5-5.5 g/dL.
         · Hematocrit: The hematocrit value decreases with hypervolemia. The normal range for females is 37%-47%;
             for males, it is 42%-50%.
         · Serum osmolality: Serum osmolarity is determined by the concentration of all particles dissolved in a body
             fluid and is measured as the number of osmoles per liter. The particles are sodium and the sodium anions,
             which include chloride, bicarbonate, glucose, and urea. Normal serum osmolality is 275-295 mOsm/kg H2O.
             Decreased serum osmolarity, or hypo-osmolar serum, can be due to psychogenic polydipsia, SIADH, nephrotic
             syndrome, or liver cirrhosis (Najem et al., 2022).
         · Urine specific gravity: The normal specific gravity of urine is 1.005-1.030. The specific gravity of urine is near
             1.000 in a state of fluid volume excess, which indicates dilute urine.

     Additional diagnostic studies may include:

         · Ultrasonography of the abdomen, thorax, and vena cava
         · Renal biopsy
         · Chest x-ray
         · Kidney, ureters, and bladder x-ray

     Urethra

     Newly formed urine exits the kidney pelvis, flows through the ureters (see Figure 33.4), and enters the bladder at
     the trigone on the posterior surface. The volume of urine in the bladder triggers the micturition response, and the
     urine exits the body through the urethra.

Bladder

The urinary bladder is a hollow organ suspended from the parietal peritoneum and positioned posterior to the
symphysis pubis in the pelvic cavity. The bladder collapses when empty and can expand to accommodate 500-600
mL of urine. The wall of the bladder is composed of three layers. The outer layer, the adventitia, is areolar connective
tissue. The middle layer, the detrusor muscle, is composed of multidirectional smooth muscle tissue encircling the
urethra at the base of the bladder. The bladder lining is a mucous membrane that is continuous with the urethra.
Rugae, or internal folds of the mucosa, are visible when the bladder is empty and accommodate the stretch of the
bladder as it fills with urine.

Urine moves from the kidneys through the two ureters, which are approximately 25-30 cm long and 3-4 mm in
diameter, and enters the inferior surface of the bladder at the trigone. The ureters tunnel into the bladder surface,
and pressure on this area prevents the backflow of urine into the ureter. In addition, internally, sections of bladder
mucosal tissue covering the entry of the ureters also inhibit the backflow of urine; this backflow is called
vesicoureteral reflux.

Micturition Mechanism
Micturition, commonly called urination, is the process by which urine is discharged from the bladder. The process is
coordinated by the action of the central and peripheral nervous systems on the stretch receptors in the bladder wall,
the detrusor muscle fibers, and the internal and external urinary sphincters. Degenerative conditions such as
Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, and stroke are commonly associated with altered micturition. Spinal cord
injuries can disrupt signals to the bladder, causing alterations in the micturition process.

The urge to void is sensed when the bladder contains 150 mL of urine. If this urge is not accommodated, the loss of
voluntary control, resulting in urinary incontinence, can occur when the bladder contains 300-400 mL of urine. Once
micturition is complete, there is a normal residual volume of up to 50 mL of urine remaining in the bladder (Nandy &
Ranganathan, 2022).

Innervation of the Urinary System
The brain and spinal cord must direct the bladder and lower part of the urinary tract to release stored urine. Table
33.1 identifies the three different sets of nerves involved in the micturition process.

     Common Conditions Affecting the Urinary System
     A number of problems can affect the urinary system, including conditions that affect the ability to void properly and
     infections resulting from bacterial contamination of a normally sterile tract. This section will describe two common
     conditions, incontinence and urinary tract infection.

     Incontinence
     As noted in the previous section, micturition is a complex process that requires coordination between the central
     nervous system and the peripheral nervous system, adequate structure and function of the bladder and urethra, and
     cognitive control of the process. Urinary incontinence (UI) is defined as the involuntary loss of urine (Tran & Puckett,
     2022). The condition is more common in female clients; however, male clients also experience incontinence with
     associated conditions of the urinary system.

     There are multiple forms of UI, including:

     · Urge incontinence: The client experiences a sudden strong urge to void and frequently does not have sufficient
        time to respond to the urge before urine leaks from the bladder. It is often the result of an overactive detrusor
        muscle. Risk factors include age, infection, and obstruction of the bladder outlet by an enlarged prostate
        gland. This form of UI is also common in clients with degenerative nerve diseases such as Parkinson disease,
        multiple sclerosis, or a history of stroke, due to CNS damage.

     · Stress incontinence: This is caused by a sudden increase in intra-abdominal pressure as with sneezing,
        coughing, and bending, causing the urine to leak from the bladder. This form of UI may be due to loss of pelvic
        muscle support of the bladder and urethra. Risk factors include estrogen depletion, obesity, childbirth trauma,
        and cancer therapies. There is also evidence that damage to the spinal nerves due to diabetes may also
        contribute to the loss of support.

     · Mixed incontinence: This presents with combined symptoms of urge and stress incontinence. This type of
        incontinence is prevalent in older female clients.

     · Overflow incontinence: This type of UI results from obstruction of the urethra, which limits the amount of
        urine that is emptied with each void. This increases the residual volume of urine, which can lead to stasis of
        the urine and infection. This condition is most common in older adult male clients with benign prostatic
        hypertrophy.

     · Functional incontinence: This form of incontinence results from a factor other than urinary system alterations.
        It often presents with other deficits such as immobility. The client has an intact urinary system but cannot
        respond quickly enough to avoid incontinence.

     Diagnosis of the type of UI is made through review of the client's voiding diary, review of the client's history, and
     urodynamic studies. Treatment is aimed at eliminating the underlying cause, strengthening the pelvic floor
     structures, the use of drugs to modify detrusor activity, and surgery.

     CLINICAL TIP

 Assessing Incontinence

  The voiding diary is one of the most important assessment tools for the diagnosis and treatment of all types of
  incontinence. The nurse provides the client with basic instructions and a template for recording liquid intake,
  urinary output, and any occurrences of incontinence. This information can be used by the health care providers to
  evaluate the client's symptoms.

Urinary Tract Infection
A urinary tract infection (UTI) develops when bacteria enter the urinary system, causing an infection in any part of
the urinary tract. As described earlier, pyelonephritis is a kidney infection. Cystitis is bladder inflammation usually
caused by bacteria. Risk factors for urinary tract infections include increasing age, female sex, diabetes, obesity,
congenital defects, neurogenic bladder, vesicoureteral reflux, and catheterization of the urinary tract. Careful
monitoring of susceptible clients is required to prevent recurrent infections. The use of urinary catheters is a
significant concern for hospitalized clients. The current recommendation is for short-term use only when necessary.
Successful treatment depends on identifying the causative agent and ensuring that all prescribed anti-infectives are
consumed.

  This Picmonic online resource reviews the causes and treatments of urinary stress incontinence.

Urethra

The urethra transports urine from the base of the bladder to outside the body. The mucosal lining is composed of
transitional epithelium, smooth muscle, and connective tissue. The urine exits the urethra at the external meatus.
The internal urinary sphincter, consisting of smooth muscle, surrounds the urethra as it exits the bladder. Control of
the internal sphincter is involuntary. The location of the external urinary sphincter is sex-specific and is discussed in
the following sections. The two sphincters coordinate the flow of urine from the bladder.

Female Urethra
The female urethra is approximately 3-4 cm long, and the external urinary sphincter surrounds the urethra as it
exits the pelvic diaphragm just behind the pubic bone. The urethra is then connected to the anterior vaginal wall,
which is a critical requirement for urinary continence. The external urinary meatus is anterior to the vaginal orifice.

Male Urethra
The male urethra is approximately 20 cm in length and carries urine and semen. It consists of four areas. The first
section, the preprostatic urethra, which is composed of transitional epithelium tissue, passes from the inferior
surface of the bladder to the prostate gland. The second section, the prostatic urethra, is completely encircled by
the prostate gland and is approximately 3-4 cm long. The third section, the membranous urethra, goes through the
floor of the pelvis and the external urinary urethra and then enters the penis. The final section, the spongy urethra,
extends to the tip of the penis, traveling through the corpus spongiosum. This segment of the urethra is
approximately 15 cm long.

34.5 Thiazide and Thiazide-Like Diuretics

INTRODUCTION Diuretic therapy is used to increase urinary output for the treatment of edematous conditions,
hypertension, heart failure, liver failure, acute and chronic renal diseases, and nephrotic syndrome. There are four
groups of diuretics: loop, osmotic, potassium-sparing, and thiazide/thiazide-like. Each targets a specific area of the
nephron, resulting in the inhibition of sodium and water reabsorption.

34.1 Introduction to Diuretics

By the end of this section, you should be able to:
    · 34.1.1 Discuss fluid volume excess and its impact on renal system disorders.
    · 34.1.2 Explain the implications of diuretic use for fluid volume excess with renal system disorders.

Fluid Volume Excess and the Renal System

The renal system normally contributes to the homeostasis of extracellular fluid volume by regulating the glomerular
filtration rate (GFR), which is the rate at which the kidneys filter blood, and the reabsorption of sodium and water.
Successful maintenance of this balance depends on both intrinsic (internal) renal mechanisms and extrinsic
(external) systemic mechanisms.
Intrinsic Renal Response to Fluid Volume Excess
Increased fluid volume triggers an intrinsic response from the kidneys, referred to as renal autoregulation.
874  34 · Diuretic Drugs

     Autoregulation depends on two physiologic processes: the myogenic response and tubular glomerular feedback.
     When cardiovascular fluid volume increases, the smooth muscle of the renal blood vessels stretches, stimulating
     the myogenic response. This response causes afferent arterioles to contract in response to increased volume. In
     turn, this action decreases the GFR by reducing the blood flow to the renal vessels. The tubuloglomerular feedback
     process decreases the GFR through the macula densa by reducing sodium reabsorption and inhibiting renin
     production. These actions by the kidneys are effective only when the pressure in the arterioles is 80-180 mm Hg
     (Dalal et al., 2022).

     Extrinsic Renal Response to Fluid Volume Excess
     Outside of the kidneys when there is excess fluid volume, the circulating blood volume increases, stretching the
     walls of the right atrium and thereby triggering atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) secretion and reducing secretion of
     antidiuretic hormone (ADH). The ANP activation dilates afferent arterioles and constricts efferent arterioles, which
     increases the GFR. The ANP also decreases sodium reabsorption in the collecting duct and inhibits the
     renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) response to promote vasodilation and sodium excretion. Each
     nephron segment has a specific sodium entry mechanism that dictates the effect of decreased ADH secretion. In
     the loop of Henle, the sodium transporting cells respond to decreased ADH levels by reducing the reabsorption of
     sodium, potassium, and chloride. Decreased ADH secretion also decreases sodium and water reabsorption in the
     proximal and distal tubules. Under normal circumstances, these actions increase urinary output and decrease fluid
     volume and blood pressure.

     Diuretic Use and the Renal System

     Diuretic therapy decreases circulating blood volume to reduce blood pressure and resolve interstitial edema.
     Diuretic drugs inhibit either the specific sodium reentry mechanism for the nephron segments that regulate sodium,
     potassium, and chloride or water reabsorption in the proximal and distal tubules. As noted in Figure 34.2, loop
     diuretics affect sodium, potassium, and chloride levels or reabsorption in the thick ascending loop of Henle. Osmotic
     diuretics inhibit water reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubule and the collecting duct. Potassium-sparing
     diuretics inhibit sodium reabsorption in the collecting tubule, and thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics decrease
     sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule. Different diuretics are often used in combination to take
     advantage of the complementary effects of individual drugs.

Barriers to Effective Treatment
The effectiveness of a specific diuretic is related to its active site in the nephron, its bioavailability, the dosing
schedule, and the client's daily salt intake. Under normal circumstances, the kidney quickly reestablishes a balance
between sodium intake and sodium and water excretion, so effective diuretic therapy must be appropriately timed.
In addition, two compensatory renal responses to diuretic therapy can limit a drug's effectiveness: diuretic
resistance and diuretic braking (Wilcox et al., 2020). Diuretic resistance occurs when the maximum dose of a loop
diuretic fails to produce the anticipated effect on fluid volume status because the successive doses of the drug
trigger hypertrophy of the distal tubule, which increases sodium reabsorption. Diuretic braking is a progressive
decrease in urinary output after repeated doses of loop diuretics. This renal response is due in part to increased
sodium reabsorption in the nephron. Chronic diuretic administration also results in decreased fluid volume, which
stimulates the RAAS system and increases aldosterone secretion.

Diuretic Therapy for Acute Kidney Injury
Loop diuretics are most frequently prescribed for clients with acute kidney injury (AKI) to decrease the risk of
additional kidney damage and the development of hypervolemia, or fluid overload (Hegde, 2020). Diuretic therapy
is not recommended for preventing AKI, and the effectiveness of the therapy is limited in clients with
hypoalbuminemia. Hypoalbuminemia commonly occurs in individuals with AKI because loop diuretics are protein
bound, meaning they are not filtered by the glomeruli but are delivered directly to the proximal tubules and then
secreted into the lumen of the nephrons. Effective diuretic therapy requires administering doses that meet the
minimum or threshold dose for the specific drug but do not exceed the ceiling doses, the point at which the drug is
no longer effective.

Diuretic Therapy for Chronic Renal Disease
Diuretics are used to treat chronic renal disease (CRD), also referred to as chronic kidney disease (CKD), to
regulate fluid volume, increase the effectiveness of other antihypertensive drugs, and lower blood pressure.
Standard practice has been to use thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics when the GFR is at or above 30 mL/hour and
loop diuretics when the GFR is less than 30 mL/hour (Jo et al., 2023). However, research is being conducted that
challenges this practice. Recent research indicates that thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics are safe and effective in
clients with chronic renal disease (Teles et al., 2023).

Diuretic Therapy for Nephrotic Syndrome
Nephrotic syndrome is a disorder associated with proteinuria, edema, and hypertension. There is not a consensus
regarding the use of diuretic therapy to treat edema secondary to sodium retention and hypoalbuminemia
associated with nephrotic syndrome. Loop diuretics are largely protein bound, which means that delivery of the drug
to the nephron is less efficient and clearance of the diuretic is increased in those with nephrotic syndrome. Results
of research investigating the administration of albumin prior to, or in combination with, loop diuretics to improve
delivery of the loop diuretic to the active site in the tubule in clients with hypoalbuminemia are inconclusive. A
recent meta-analysis revealed coadministration of albumin with furosemide might enhance diuresis, but further
research is needed (Lee et al., 2021). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor drugs or angiotensin II
receptor blocker drugs may be used to decrease the renal excretion of albumin, thereby improving the action of the
diuretics. Loop diuretics are often used with thiazide or thiazide-like drugs to reduce edema because the combined
action may be more effective than either drug type by itself. As noted above, as the GFR declines, the effectiveness
of diuretic therapy also declines.

  The kidney plays an integral role in many body functions. Within the kidney, the nephron is the functional unit
  carrying out these tasks. Depending on their type, diuretics exert their effects on different parts of the nephron.
  This Pixorize animation reviews the structure and function of the nephron.

Commonly Assessed Laboratory Tests
Routine blood and urine tests can measure kidney function and indicate kidney damage. A chemistry panel
876  34 · Diuretic Drugs

     measures several electrolytes and includes tests that indicate renal function.

     Sodium
     The therapeutic serum sodium level is 136-145 mEq/L (Padilla & Abadie, 2022). Higher or lower levels can have
     serious adverse effects. Lower levels, referred to as hyponatremia, can cause a range of symptoms. Mild
     hyponatremia can cause nausea and malaise. Moderate to severe hyponatremia can cause progressive neurologic
     alterations, including headache and lethargy progressing to seizures, coma, and death. Pulmonary edema unrelated
     to cardiac events has also been reported. Thiazide diuretic therapy can result in severe hyponatremia, especially in
     older adults who also consume large amounts of water. Hypernatremia, serum sodium levels above the therapeutic
     range, can cause cognitive dysfunction ranging from lethargy and confusion to seizures. Other signs and symptoms
     include orthostatic blood pressure changes, tachycardia, oliguria, and dry mucous membranes. Osmotic diuretic
     administration creates a diuresis that contains water losses in excess of sodium losses.

     Potassium
     The therapeutic serum potassium level is 3.5-5.0 mEq/L (Padill & Abadie, 2022). Higher or lower levels can have
     serious negative effects. Hypokalemia, or serum potassium levels that are lower than therapeutic, causes muscle
     weakness. The severity of manifestation depends on the potassium value and the cause and duration of the deficit.
     Potassium levels around 3.0 mEq/L cause mild to moderate muscle weakness. Potassium levels less than 2.5 mEq/L
     produce severe muscle weakness, including effects on respiratory muscles and life-threatening electrocardiogram
     (ECG) changes. Clients taking loop diuretics or thiazide diuretics are at risk for hypokalemia because these
     medications cause loss of potassium along with sodium. Hyperkalemia, or serum potassium levels that are higher
     than therapeutic, can develop with the use of potassium-sparing diuretics. Mild and moderate hyperkalemia can be
     asymptomatic, but life-threatening cardiac symptoms or paralysis can occur at levels greater than 6.5 mEq/L. The
     rate at which the potassium level shifts is more important than the level itself. Clients with chronically elevated
     potassium levels are less likely to have symptoms, whereas sudden increases are more likely to cause severe
     symptoms in clients with previously normal potassium levels (Simon et al., 2023).

     Blood Urea Nitrogen
     The amount of urea nitrogen in the blood, which is one type of waste product in the blood, varies inversely with the
     estimated GFR (eGFR; see below). However, the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is also influenced by the client's fluid
     volume status. The BUN is not identified as a critical indicator of the effectiveness of diuretic therapy. The
     therapeutic range is 8-20 mg/dL (Padilla & Abadie, 2022).

     Creatinine
     Serum creatinine is the waste product of muscle tissue metabolism. It is completely cleared by the kidneys, which
     means that creatinine levels can be used to assess kidney function. Significant renal impairment may occur before
     the creatinine level increases. The serum creatinine value is used to calculate eGFR. Therapeutic levels vary:
     0.5-1.0 mg/dL in females and 0.7-1.2 mg/dL in males (Padilla & Abadie, 2022). Dietary intake of red meat affects
     creatinine levels.

     Serum creatinine and urine creatinine can be compared to estimate renal function; however, the relationship
     between the two values changes as the GFR falls, and this comparison requires collecting urine over 24 hours as
     directed. As a result, it is more common to use the serum creatinine level alone. Accurate results from a 24-hour
     urine collection depend upon the client's ability to follow the protocol for urine collection (Shahbaz & Gupta, 2023).

     Glomerular Filtration Rate
     The GFR provides the most accurate laboratory assessment of renal function but is not easily measured. The eGFR
     is calculated based on the client's serum creatinine level, age, sex, and weight. The value is expressed as the
     filtration rate in milliliters per minute per average body surface area. The therapeutic range in adults is 120-130
     mL/minute/1.73 m2 but can decline with age to about 75 mL/minute/1.73 m2 at age 70 (Maddukuri, 2022). Levels
     greater than 180 mL/minute/1.73 m2 indicate hyperfiltration, which may be the initial sign of diabetes. Decreased
     filtration rate is associated with advancing age and declining renal function. An eGFR value less than 60 mL/minute/
     1.73 m2 for 3 consecutive months indicates chronic renal disease, and an eGFR value less than 15 mL/minute/1.73
     m2 indicates kidney failure or end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

Lipid Profile
Loop diuretics and thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics may increase serum levels of cholesterol, low density
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides. All these components are measured in a lipid profile laboratory test.

Uric Acid
Uric acid is a waste product of purine metabolism. It is excreted largely by the kidneys and the gastrointestinal
system. Elevated uric acid levels are associated with gout, which is associated with joint and soft tissue injury, most
commonly in the big toe. Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics increase reabsorption of this waste product in the
proximal renal tubules. Uric acid is measured in a separate laboratory test. The therapeutic uric acid level is 2.5-8.0
mg/dL (Padilla & Abadie, 2022).

Urinalysis
A urinalysis can detect signs of kidney disease. In addition to measuring creatinine, urine tests determine the
presence of uric acid, glucose, and albumin in the urine. Urine osmolality and output are also measured. Therapeutic
urine output is 30 mL/hour; an individual is considered oliguric if their urine output is less than 0.5 mL/kg/hour
(Berry, 2022).

  CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

  The client taking a diuretic should:

      · Take all diuretics as prescribed by their health care provider.
      · Take a baseline pulse and blood pressure measurement before starting the diuretic.
      · Monitor and record their pulse and blood pressure regularly to share with their health care provider,

          reporting any significant changes as defined and directed by the health care provider.
      · Maintain adequate intake of fluids as prescribed by their health care provider.
      · Follow a low-sodium diet as prescribed by their health care provider.
      · Elevate their feet and legs or walk, if they are able, to reduce swelling.
      · Take the drug early in the day to avoid nocturia.
      · Weigh themselves before starting the diuretic and every day at the same time of day. When weighing

          themselves, clients should use the same scale and wear the same amount of clothing. They should record
          their weights for review by the health care provider and to be able to track changes.
      · Report weight increase of more than 2-3 pounds per day or more than 5 pounds in 1 week.
      · Immediately report any concerning symptoms, including difficulty breathing, chest pain, lightheadedness,
          dizziness with position change, muscle weakness, confusion, significant decrease in urinary output, or
          irregular heart rate.
      · Avoid orthostatic hypotension by changing position slowly and using assistive devices as necessary.

  The client taking a diuretic should not:

      · Change the dose or discontinue the medication without consulting their health care provider.
      · Take over-the-counter medications or supplements without consulting their health care provider or

          pharmacist.

     Loop diuretics are the most frequently prescribed type of diuretic drug. They are used to treat fluid volume excess
     and edema associated with heart failure, hypertension, cirrhosis, and renal disease. Loop diuretics act at different
     points in the nephron to increase sodium and water losses.

     Introduction and Use

The drugs work by inhibiting the action of the sodium-potassium-chloride (Na-K-2Cl or NKCC2) cotransporters in
the luminal membrane and increasing water excretion. Blocking the NKCC2 cotransporter blocks potassium
reabsorption and triggers calcium and magnesium losses. Loop diuretics are commonly recommended for treating
edematous conditions and fluid volume excess associated with heart failure and renal disease. They are approved
for treating hypertension but are usually prescribed in combination with other antihypertensives (Huxel et al.,
2023). The most frequently used loop diuretics, furosemide, torsemide, and bumetanide, are recommended for
treating specific conditions according to their half-life and bioavailability characteristics.

Furosemide, a frequently prescribed loop diuretic, treats edematous conditions and fluid volume excess in heart
failure, liver failure, and acute and chronic renal disease, including nephrotic syndrome (Khan et al., 2023). It can be
given orally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously. The bioavailability of oral doses of furosemide is
approximately 50%, and the drug has a shorter half-life (1.5-2 hours) than other loop diuretics, which means that a
continuous intravenous infusion may be more effective than intermittent doses in critically ill clients (Khan et al.,
2023). Furoscix was approved in 2022 for subcutaneous delivery of a daily metered dose of furosemide by an on-
body infuser for outpatient clients with New York Heart Association class II or III chronic heart failure (Dahiya et al.,
2022).This delivery system is intended for clients in the home setting for whom oral furosemide administration has
limited effectiveness.

Torsemide exhibits a stronger diuretic effect than furosemide does (Yifan et al., 2021). The drug is used to treat
heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, and chronic renal disease, and it is used with other antihypertensive drugs to treat
hypertension (Kanderi & Vaitla, 2023). It can be administered orally or intravenously. The bioavailability of
torsemide given by mouth or intravenously is 80%, and the duration of action is 6-8 hours (Kanderi & Vaitla, 2023).

Bumetanide is used to treat clients who do not respond to other loop diuretics, have severe renal disease, or require
larger diuretic doses (Sidhu & Puckett, 2023). It is used to manage heart failure, hypertension, hypercalcemia,
oliguria, and ascites associated with liver failure, and it may also replace furosemide in clients with additional risk
factors for ototoxicity. The drug can be administered orally, intramuscularly, or intravenously.

Table 34.2 lists common loop diuretics and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications

     Loop diuretics primarily cause diuresis-induced electrolyte imbalances (Huxel et al., 2023). These alterations are
     more common in older adults and clients with inadequate fluid intake. Other common adverse effects include
     headache, dizziness, and postural hypotension. Metabolic effects may include hyperlipidemia, metabolic alkalosis,
     and hyperglycemia due to impaired glucose tolerance. Drug-induced pancreatitis also has been reported, most often
     in clients with a history of pancreatitis. Less common reactions include impotence, thrombocytopenia due to the
     secretion of antibodies, thrombotic events related to hypovolemia, and ototoxicity due to rapid intravenous
     administration.

     Loop diuretics should be used with care in older adults and clients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other
     risk factors for fluid volume and electrolyte alterations, such as dehydration and increased glucose tolerance.
     Clients who are allergic to sulfa may possibly experience a mild reaction when using loop diuretics.

     Severe dehydration or anuria is a contraindication to any diuretic (Arumugham & Shahin, 2023). Loop diuretics are
     contraindicated in clients with sensitivity to one of the individual drugs (furosemide, torsemide, or bumetanide) and
     in clients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome due to the probability of a sensitivity reaction.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Use of Diuretics in Older Adults

Research indicates that older adults have an increased risk of falling associated with diuretic use. Various
adverse effects associated with diuretic use contribute to fall risk, including orthostatic hypotension, increased
urine output causing more frequent trips to the bathroom, increased risk of fluid and electrolyte disorders
leading to cognitive changes, and effects on bone mass and muscle strength.

          SAFETY ALERT

      Loop Diuretics

       Clients taking both furosemide and digoxin must be monitored for signs of digoxin toxicity, including bradycardia,
       nausea, vomiting, visual changes (halos), and cardiac arrhythmias. Clients taking loop diuretics as well as lithium
       must be monitored for toxic blood levels of lithium carbonate, which can develop because diuretics inhibit the
       kidneys' excretion of the drug.

      (Sources: DailyMed, Furosemide tablet, 2012; Huxel et al., 2023)

     Nursing Implications

     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking loop diuretics:

         · Monitor the client for adverse effects related to diuresis.
         · Assess the client's blood pressure and heart rate before the initial dose and then intermittently during drug

             therapy on an ongoing basis to monitor for orthostatic hypotension.
         · Assess the client for signs of dehydration, including dry mucous membranes, poor skin turgor, and increased

             thirst.
         · Monitor laboratory results for electrolyte imbalances and signs of renal dysfunction.
         · Monitor urine output to evaluate the medication's effectiveness.
         · Assess the client's body weight at baseline and on an ongoing basis to monitor fluid retention.
         · Assess the client's extremities and dependent areas for edema.
         · Assess the client for adverse effects, drug and food interactions, and contraindications.
         · Assess the client's understanding of the disease process and the treatment plan, including medication

             administration, dietary restrictions, and when to call the health care provider.
         · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

             teaching guidelines.

          CLINICAL TIP

      Intravenous Administration of Furosemide

       Furosemide can be administered intravenously as a bolus injection or as a continuous or intermittent infusion for
       larger doses. A bolus dose should be administered slowly over 1-2 minutes. Rapid infusion rates of loop diuretics
       may trigger temporary or permanent hearing loss in susceptible clients.

  CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

  The client taking a loop diuretic should:

      · Follow a modified sodium diet with moderate intake of potassium-rich foods to counteract potassium
          losses.

      · Avoid potential food interactions, including black licorice and alcohol.
      · Maintain the prescribed fluid intake to avoid dehydration.
      · Monitor for and report any skin changes.
      · Change position slowly when going from a lying or sitting position to standing to avoid orthostatic

          hypotension.
      · Notify their health care provider if they experience headaches or dizziness.

  The client taking a loop diuretic should not:

      · Self-adjust a dose without consulting their health care provider.
      · Take this medication at night; daytime administration will avoid nocturnal urinary frequency caused by the

          diuretic effect of the medication.
      · Drive or operate machinery if experiencing dizziness.

34.3 Osmotic Diuretics

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 34.3.1 Identify the characteristics of osmotic diuretic drugs used for fluid volume excess and renal
        system disorders.

    · 34.3.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of osmotic diuretic drugs used
        for fluid volume excess and renal system disorders.

    · 34.3.3 Describe nursing implications of osmotic diuretic drugs used for fluid volume excess and renal
        system disorders.

    · 34.3.4 Explain the client education related to osmotic diuretic drugs used for fluid volume excess and
        renal system disorders.

Osmotic diuretics decrease sodium and water reabsorption in the proximal tubule and the loop of Henle, increasing
water loss. Mannitol, the primary osmotic diuretic, is typically used to treat increased intracranial and intraocular
pressure.

Introduction and Use

Mannitol is a large sugar molecule that is readily filtered by the glomeruli and is not reabsorbed by the tubules. The
resulting osmotic force increases the loss of sodium and water. Although mannitol is also approved to promote
diuresis for acute renal failure and for excretion of toxic substances, it is used most commonly to treat increased
intracranial pressure and increased intraocular pressure (Tenny et al., 2022). Mannitol reduces intracranial and
intraocular pressures by moving water from the cells into the circulation. In the brain, mannitol creates an osmotic
gradient that draws water across the blood-brain barrier. In the eye, mannitol draws water from the vitreous humor
into the circulation, which decreases the pressure on the retina. Mannitol therapy requires close monitoring because
of the risks for fluid volume excess, electrolyte imbalances, and adverse renal and neurologic effects of increased
osmotic pressure.

Hypertonic saline solutions may be used in place of mannitol therapy because the saline solution does not cause
884  34 · Diuretic Drugs

     hypovolemia in critically ill clients who may already be hypovolemic, hypotensive, or actively bleeding. There is
     some evidence that hypertonic saline solutions also improve cerebral perfusion and cellular oxygenation (Shi et al.,
     2020). In addition, in contrast to mannitol, the saline solution can be infused temporarily through a peripheral vein
     until central venous access is available, and it does not require special reconstitution or delivery systems. Moreover,
     the therapies are associated with similar clinical outcomes.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications

     Mannitol, like other diuretics, can cause electrolyte abnormalities and dehydration. It can cause heart failure
     secondary to the rapid fluid shift of water into the intravascular space. Administration of the drug has also been
     associated with the development of AKI in clients with normal renal function. If warm temperatures are not
     maintained during administration, mannitol can precipitate into crystals, causing vascular and end-organ damage. It
     is also possible for leakage of mannitol across the blood-brain barrier to cause a rebound increase in intracranial
     pressure (Tenny et al., 2022).

     The client's kidney function must be adequate to manage the increased diuresis that mannitol will produce. It
     should be avoided in clients with anuria or previous renal damage caused by mannitol, and it should be used with
     caution in clients with decreased renal function. It should not be used for clients who are severely dehydrated or
     who have existing electrolyte abnormalities that could be exacerbated by its administration. Mannitol should not be
     used in clients with congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema.

          SAFETY ALERT

      Osmotic Diuretics

       Renal function should be monitored in all clients receiving mannitol. Acute renal failure can occur not only in
       clients with preexisting renal disease but also in clients with normal renal function.

Nursing Implications

The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking mannitol:

· Administer the medication through a dedicated IV line in a large central vein (DailyMed, Mannitol, 2023).
· Use only filtered tubing to administer the medication (DailyMed, Mannitol, 2023).
· Avoid administering mannitol simultaneously with blood products.
· Check the medication vial for the presence of crystals. If they are present, warm the solution to 140ºF,

   vigorously agitate the vial, and then cool the medication to body temperature before administering (DailyMed,
   Mannitol, 2023).
· Monitor the infusion site for signs of extravasation during administration.
· Carefully monitor the client's fluid volume status by assessing vital signs and weight.
· Monitor lung sounds for congestion and other signs of heart failure or circulatory overload.
· Monitor laboratory values for electrolyte imbalances.
· Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client
   teaching guidelines.

CLINICAL TIP

Mannitol Administration

Monitor the insertion site during the infusion for signs of extravasation because extravasation of mannitol can
result in the development of compartment syndrome in the arm in which it is infusing. Compartment syndrome is
a state of increased pressure in a closed compartment containing bone and fascia, resulting in tissue injury.

     Potassium-sparing diuretics increase urinary output by inhibiting sodium reabsorption in the distal tubules and by
     decreasing potassium and hydrogen ion secretion and blocking the mineral corticoid sites. These drugs are
     commonly used in combination with other diuretics to modify potassium losses.

     Introduction and Use

     Potassium-sparing diuretics affect the reabsorption of sodium and the excretion of potassium in the connecting and
     collecting tubules by inhibiting the sodium transporters and blocking the mineral corticoid receptors. In contrast to
     the actions of other diuretics, when the potassium-sparing drugs inhibit sodium reabsorption in this area of the
     nephron, potassium excretion is decreased, thus preserving serum potassium levels.

     All potassium-sparing diuretics are used to treat or prevent hypokalemia associated with the use of loop diuretics
     and thiazide diuretics. The diuretic action of potassium-sparing diuretics is weaker than in other diuretic types, and
     the onset of action is delayed by as much as 3 days; however, the drugs are often used in combination with more
     potent diuretics to prevent or treat hypokalemia, heart failure, and hypertension.

     Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that competes with the aldosterone (mineralocorticoid) receptors in
     the distal tubule and collecting duct of the nephron. It is approved to treat hypokalemia, primary
     hyperaldosteronism, heart failure, edema resulting from cirrhosis, and edema resulting from nephrotic syndrome
     that is resistant to other treatments. Spironolactone is often added as the fourth drug to treat resistant
     hypertension, which is defined as failure to reach blood pressure target levels when the client is receiving adequate
     doses of three antihypertensive drugs. In the early landmark Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES),
     spironolactone was found to reduce mortality from all causes by 30% in clients with heart failure (Patibandla et al.,
     2022). In 2017, the American Heart Association recommended spironolactone as the treatment of choice in clients
     with class II-IV heart failure with a potassium level less than 5 mEq/L and creatinine clearance greater than 30 mL/
     hr (Patibandla et al., 2022). In this client population, spironolactone decreased hospital readmission rates,
     myocardial fibrosis, hypertrophy of cardiac muscle, and extracellular fluid volume. The drug is used off-label as part
     of gender-affirming hormone therapy and to treat hirsutism (excessive hair growth in a male growth pattern) and
     acne.

     Amiloride is recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated essential hypertension and chronic heart failure
     (Almajid & Cassagnol, 2022). Several potential off-label uses for amiloride include treatment of increased urinary
     output associated with lithium therapy, insulin-induced edema, and multiple myeloma. Triamterene is a potassium-
     sparing diuretic that also increases the excretion of magnesium. Triamterene is used to treat edema associated with
     heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, ascites due to cirrhosis, hypertension, and hyperkalemia.

     SAFETY ALERT

     Potassium-Sparing Diuretics

     Clients taking potassium-sparing diuretics are accordingly at risk for hyperkalemia and its associated adverse
     effects. Hyperkalemia can cause arrhythmias and cardiac arrest if untreated.

     (Source: Simon et al., 2023)

     Nursing Implications

     The nurse should do the following for clients taking potassium-sparing diuretics:

         · Assess and monitor the client's heart rate and blood pressure and perform a physical assessment to
             auscultate lung sounds and check for the presence of edema.

         · Monitor the client's weight for any significant increases (2 pounds in one day or 5 pounds in 1 week), which
             could indicate fluid retention.

         · Monitor laboratory tests for electrolyte imbalances.
         · Monitor the client's ECG for any changes in cardiac rhythm.
         · Assess and monitor for drug and food interactions.
         · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for additional

   CLINICAL TIP

Dietary Potassium

Clients should be cautioned about consuming salt substitutes, bananas, and other potassium-rich foods when
taking potassium-sparing diuretics. Clients often associate "water pills" with the need for additional dietary
potassium.
(Source: DailyMed, Spironolactone, 2020)

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking a potassium-sparing diuretic should:
    · Follow a balanced diet with limited intake of potassium-rich foods to decrease the risk of hyperkalemia.
    · Take medications consistently regarding food (take either with or without food).
    · Report gynecomastia, menstrual irregularities, and the onset of any additional endocrine alterations.

The client taking a potassium-sparing diuretic should not:
    · Use potassium-based salt substitutes.
    · Take nonsteroid anti-inflammatory medications without consulting their health care provider because
        these can increase potassium levels.

  FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

  Potassium-Sparing Diuretics

  Spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic that also antagonizes aldosterone receptor sites, may cause the
  development of several tumor types when administered at high doses that exceed current recommendations.

  Amiloride, a potassium-sparing diuretic, may cause hyperkalemia, either alone or when combined with
  hydrochlorothiazide and ACE inhibitors.

  Triamterene, a potassium-sparing diuretic, may cause hyperkalemia, either alone or when combined with
  hydrochlorothiazide. This is more likely to develop in clients with renal impairment and diabetes.

34.5 Thiazide and Thiazide-Like Diuretics

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 34.5.1 Identify the characteristics of thiazide and thiazide-like diuretic drugs used for fluid volume excess
        and renal system disorders.

    · 34.5.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of thiazide and thiazide-like

        volume excess and renal system disorders.

Introduction and Use

The thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics treat hypertension and edema. They are considered first-line therapies for
hypertension, although their antihypertensive effects are not well understood. They treat edema related to
congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, and acute and chronic renal diseases, including nephrotic syndrome, acute
glomerulonephritis, and chronic renal failure. Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics are frequently used in combination
890  34 · Diuretic Drugs

     with other antihypertensives and diuretic types.

     Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics have three major properties: inhibition of sodium reabsorption, increased
     reabsorption of calcium, and creation of mild extracellular fluid losses:

         · Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics inhibit the reabsorption of sodium in the distal convoluted tubule by
             competing with chloride on the Na-Cl transporter, resulting in the loss of chloride and the passive loss of
             sodium; however, the therapy decreases reabsorption of only 3%-5% of the sodium in the filtrate. This
             transporter is similar to the NKCC in the loop of Henle. The drugs also exert some inhibitory effect on sodium
             reabsorption in the proximal tubules and the collecting ducts; however, this diuretic action is countered by the
             additional reabsorption of sodium in the same area of the nephron.

         · Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics increase the rate of calcium reabsorption in two ways. First, the drugs
             directly increase the reabsorption rate of calcium that normally occurs in the distal tubule. Second, the drugs
             decrease extracellular fluid volume by limiting reabsorption of sodium, and this volume change indirectly
             triggers increased calcium reabsorption into the proximal tubule.

         · Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics block sodium reabsorption from the distal convoluted tubule; this can
             result in hyponatremia, which increases water loss. The drugs also create mild extracellular fluid loss, which
             can decrease the tubular volume in the loop of Henle, resulting in decreased free water loss.

     Hydrochlorothiazide is one of the most commonly used diuretics. Metolazone is a thiazide-like diuretic that, unlike
     the thiazide drugs, is also effective in chronic renal disease because it does not affect the GFR. In addition,
     metolazone does not trigger the RAAS, which means that the use of metolazone combined with a loop diuretic can
     minimize diuretic resistance and increase renal response with fewer adverse effects (Bond et al., 2022).
     Chlorthalidone is a thiazide-like diuretic with prolonged action (48-72 hours).

     Table 34.7 lists common thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications

     The adverse effects of thiazide diuretics are related to the sodium losses and the ionic imbalance created by those
     losses (Akbari & Khorasani-Zedah, 2022). Adverse effects include metabolic alkalosis, hypercalcemia,
     hyperglycemia, hyperuricemia, hyperlipidemia, photosensitivity reactions, hyponatremia due to decreased
     reabsorption, and hypokalemia due to action of the sodium-potassium pump in the distal convoluted tubule. Their
     photosensitizing effects also appear to increase the risk of skin cancer (Shin et al., 2019).

     Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics are contraindicated in individuals with sulfonamide allergy. Sensitivity reactions
     occur most commonly in clients who experience frequent allergic reactions and less commonly than previously
     believed in sulfa-sensitive clients. Reactions can include rash, hives, angioedema, wheezing, and anaphylaxis
     (Akbari & Khorasani-Zedah, 2022). Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics can increase the risk of digoxin toxicity, and
     the drugs also should not be administered with lithium. Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics should be used with
     caution in clients with renal disease and are contraindicated for clients who are anuric.

     Nursing Implications

     The nurse should do the following for clients taking thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics:

         · Assess the client's blood pressure before giving the initial dose and then intermittently during drug therapy on
             an ongoing basis.

         · Monitor for evidence of cardiac changes by assessing heart rate and ECG rhythm strips.
         · Evaluate the client's response to therapy as evidenced by decreased edema.
         · Monitor the client's urine output and laboratory tests for electrolyte imbalances.
         · Assess and monitor the client for other adverse effects, drug and food interactions, and contraindications.
         · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for additional

             client teaching guidelines.

          CLINICAL TIP

      Accurate Assessment of Client's Fluid Volume Status

       Clients with heart failure are often hospitalized to correct fluid volume overload. Nurses are responsible for
       accurate physical assessment, data collection, and documentation of the client's fluid volume status, which is
       critical for effective diuretic therapy. The nurse should monitor the client's response to treatment by measuring
       urine output, monitoring their weight daily, auscultating lung sounds for rales or crackles, and assessing the
       client's lower extremities and other dependent areas to determine whether the edema is decreasing.

       (Source: Malik et al., 2022)

       CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

       The client taking a thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic should:

           · Follow a balanced diet with moderate intake of potassium-rich foods.
           · Wear sunscreen and avoid excessive sun exposure because of risk for photosensitivity reactions.

       The client taking a thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic should not:

INTRODUCTION Urinary and bladder disorder drugs are medications used to treat various conditions affecting the
urinary system and bladder. These drugs target symptoms or underlying causes of these disorders to alleviate
symptoms and improve the function of the urinary system. Commonly used urinary and bladder disorder drugs will
be discussed in this chapter.

35.1 Urinary Anti-infectives

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 35.1.1 Identify the characteristics of urinary anti-infective drugs used for urinary and bladder disorders.
    · 35.1.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, contraindications, and interactions of urinary

        anti-infective drugs used for urinary and bladder disorders.
    · 35.1.3 Describe nursing implications of urinary anti-infective drugs used for urinary and bladder

        disorders.
    · 35.1.4 Explain the client education related to urinary anti-infective drugs used for urinary and bladder

        disorders.
Urinary anti-infectives are a class of drugs specifically used to treat infections of the urinary tract, including the
bladder, urethra, ureters, and kidneys (Figure 35.2). They are designed to target and eliminate the bacteria or other
898  35 · Urinary and Bladder Disorder Drugs

     microorganisms causing urinary infection.

     FIGURE 35.2 These structures of the human urinary system are present in both males and females. (credit: modification of work from
     Microbiology. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

     In this section of the chapter, common urinary anti-infectives will be discussed in greater detail. The choice of
     medication depends on various factors, such as type of infection, its severity, the presence of underlying conditions,
     client allergies, and local resistance patterns. The health care provider will prescribe the appropriate urinary anti-
     infective for the client based on these criteria.

     Culture and susceptibility studies should be performed prior to starting urinary anti-infectives. These studies should
     also be considered when selecting and modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of these studies, local
     epidemiology and susceptibility patterns (e.g., the institutional antibiogram) should be considered for the empiric
     selection of therapy.

     Nitrofurantoin

     Nitrofurantoin is specifically indicated for treating urinary tract infections (UTIs) due to susceptible strains of
     Escherichia coli, enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and certain susceptible strains of Klebsiella and Enterobacter
     species (Squadrito & del Portal, 2023).

     Adverse reactions can include chronic, subacute, or acute pulmonary hypersensitivity; hepatic reactions, including
     hepatitis; neurologic conditions such as asthenia, vertigo, headache, and drowsiness; exfoliative dermatitis;
     erythema multiforme; and gastrointestinal reactions such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and anorexia. A
     typical effect of nitrofurantoin is brown discoloration of the urine.

     Nitrofurantoin is contraindicated in clients with impaired renal function, impaired hepatic function, or known
     hypersensitivity. This drug should not be prescribed to pregnant clients after the 37th week of pregnancy, during
     labor, or when the onset of labor is imminent, because it can lead to a decrease in the fetus's or newborn's red blood
     cell count. Nitrofurantoin is also contraindicated during lactation and for newborns 1 month old or younger.
     Nitrofurantoin should be used cautiously in older clients due to potential impaired renal and hepatic function. It is
     contraindicated in all clients with a creatinine clearance of less than 60 mL due to the increased risk of toxicity
     because of impaired excretion of the drug. (Nitrofurantoin is in the Beers Criteria® (https://openstax.org/r/
     agsjournals) list of medications with specific guidelines for use in older clients.)

          CLINICAL TIP

      Nitrofurantoin and Urine Color

       Nitrofurantoin may turn the urine brown. This is an expected effect of the medication and does not harm the
       client.

     Trimethoprim and Sulfamethoxazole

     The combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) is indicated to treat UTIs due to susceptible

strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, and
Proteus vulgaris (Kemnic & Coleman, 2022). However, it is recommended that initial episodes of uncomplicated
UTIs be treated with a single effective antibacterial agent rather than this combination.

The most common adverse reactions are gastrointestinal disturbances, such as nausea, vomiting, and anorexia;
photosensitivity; and allergic skin reactions such as rash and urticaria. More serious adverse reactions include
severe cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, as well as fulminant hepatic necrosis, blood
dyscrasias, hyperkalemia, and anaphylaxis or circulatory shock.

TMP/SMX is contraindicated in clients with hypersensitivity to trimethoprim, sulfonamides, or any of their
constituents (commonly referred to as "sulfa drugs"); a history of drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia with the
use of trimethoprim and/or sulfonamides; megaloblastic anemia due to folate deficiency; or severe renal or hepatic
insufficiency. It is also contraindicated in infants younger than 2 months of age and in clients taking dofetilide.

CLINICAL TIP

TMP/SMX and Photosensitivity

TMP/SMX may cause photosensitivity. Nurses should instruct clients to avoid direct sunlight due to the increased
risk of sunburn or skin rash with exposure.

Fosfomycin Tromethamine

Fosfomycin tromethamine granules for oral solution are indicated for clients with uncomplicated UTIs (acute
cystitis) due to susceptible strains of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis (Abbott et al., 2020; DailyMed,
Fosfomycin tromethamine, 2022).

Adverse effects include diarrhea, vaginitis, nausea, headache, dizziness, asthenia, and dyspepsia. Fosfomycin
tromethamine is contraindicated in clients with known sensitivity to the drug or any of its components.

Methenamine Hippurate

Methenamine hippurate tablets are indicated for prophylactic or suppressive treatment of frequently recurring UTIs
when long-term therapy is considered necessary. This drug should be used only after other appropriate
antimicrobial agents have eradicated the infection (DailyMed, Methenamine hippurate, 2021; Heltveit-Olsen et al.,
2022).

Minimal adverse effects have been reported with the use of this drug, including nausea, upset stomach, dysuria, and
rash. Contraindications include severe renal or hepatic insufficiency and severe dehydration.

Table 35.1 lists common urinary anti-infectives and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

     Nursing Implications

     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking urinary anti-infectives:

     · Before administering the drug, check the client's medical history, current drug list, and allergies.
     · Before administering the drug, confirm the results of baseline laboratory tests, including, but not limited to,

        urinalysis, urine culture and sensitivity, complete blood cell count, and renal and hepatic function levels.
     · For clients receiving nitrofurantoin, monitor for acute and subacute signs of respiratory reactions, such as

        dyspnea, chest pain, chills, fever, and cough, and notify the health care provider if these develop.
     · For clients receiving TMP/SMX, monitor for early signs of blood dyscrasias, such as sore throat, fever, or pallor,

        and notify the health care provider if these develop.

 · Monitor intake, output, and urine specific gravity. Report significant decreases in urinary output to the health
     care provider.

 · Report any signs of superinfection, such as stomatitis, anogenital discharge, or itching, to the health care
     provider.

 · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client
     teaching guidelines.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking a urinary anti-infective should:

    · Increase their daily fluid intake (avoiding substances that cause diuresis, such as caffeine), if not
        contraindicated, to avoid the development of kidney stones.

    · Rinse their mouth out thoroughly after taking nitrofurantoin because this drug may stain the teeth.
    · Ask the health care provider before taking certain urinary anti-infectives, such as nitrofurantoin, if they are

        pregnant, are thinking of becoming pregnant, are breastfeeding, or are considering giving these
        medications to an infant younger than 1 month of age because they may cause serious adverse effects
        such as blood dyscrasias, anemia, and fetal abnormalities.
    · Avoid excessive exposure to sunlight when taking TMP/SMX because photosensitivity may occur, and sun
        exposure may cause sunburn or skin rash.

The client taking a urinary anti-infective should not:

    · Crush tablets or open capsules unless directed by a pharmacist because these drugs may cause
        esophageal or stomach irritation.

    · Stop taking the drug unless directed by the health care provider. Drugs in this class help eliminate bacteria
        in the body and can result in a worsening infection if the drug course is stopped early. Stopping early may
        also contribute to antibiotic resistance.

  FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

  Urinary Anti-infectives

  Nitrofurantoin may cause acute, subacute, or chronic pulmonary reactions (such as diffuse interstitial
  pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis, or both). Monitoring for these conditions is warranted.

  Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) may cause acute eosinophilic pneumonia, acute and delayed
  lung injury, interstitial lung disease, and acute respiratory failure resulting in prolonged mechanical ventilation,
  extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), the need for lung transplantation, or death. Monitoring for these
  conditions is warranted.

35.2 Urinary Antispasmodics, Antimuscarinics, and Anticholinergics

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 35.2.1 Identify the characteristics of urinary antispasmodic, antimuscarinic, and anticholinergic drugs
        used for urinary and bladder disorders.

    · 35.2.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, contraindications, and interactions of urinary

        drugs used for urinary and bladder disorders.

Urinary antispasmodics, antimuscarinics (which are a subtype of the cholinergic system), and anticholinergics are
902  35 · Urinary and Bladder Disorder Drugs

     different terms used to describe medications that work to relax the detrusor muscles of the bladder and reduce
     involuntary muscle contractions. These drugs are commonly used to treat conditions characterized by frequent
     urination, urgency, and sometimes urinary incontinence.

     Antispasmodics

     Urinary antispasmodics are medications that alleviate spasms or involuntary contractions of the bladder muscles.
     They affect the urinary detrusor muscle, causing it to relax the bladder, allowing for increased bladder filling and
     thereby reducing urinary urgency and episodes of urinary incontinence.

     Oxybutynin Chloride
     Oxybutynin chloride is indicated for the relief of symptoms of bladder instability associated with voiding in clients
     with detrusor instability due to neurogenic bladder, overactive bladder, or detrusor overactivity (e.g., urgency,
     frequency, urinary leakage, urge incontinence; Dwyer et al., 2022).

     Adverse effects include insomnia, dizziness, headache, blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, nausea, dyspepsia,
     angioedema, and urinary retention. Contraindications include urinary and gastric retention, uncontrolled narrow
     angle glaucoma, and hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components.

     Mirabegron
     Mirabegron is a selective beta-3 adrenoceptor agonist that enhances bladder smooth muscle relaxation and is used
     to treat overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency (O'Kane et
     al., 2022).

     Adverse effects include hypertension, urinary retention, and angioedema. Contraindications include hypersensitivity
     to the drug or any of its constituents.

     Flavoxate Hydrochloride
     Flavoxate hydrochloride counteracts smooth muscle spasm of the urinary tract and exerts its effect directly on the
     muscle (DailyMed, Flavoxate hydrochloride, 2019).

     Adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, vertigo, headache, mental confusion, tachycardia,
     palpitations, urticaria, and blurred vision. It is contraindicated in clients with pyloric or duodenal obstruction,
     obstructive intestinal lesions or ileus, achalasia, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, or obstructive uropathies of the lower
     urinary tract.

     Antimuscarinics and Anticholinergics

     Antimuscarinics are drugs within the anticholinergic class that block the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter
     involved in muscle contractions, including those of the bladder. (See Drugs to Treat Myasthenia Gravis and
     Alzheimer's Disease and Drugs to Treat Parkinson's Disease and Multiple Sclerosis for more on muscarinic and
     cholinergic receptors.) By blocking the effects of acetylcholine, antimuscarinics help reduce the overactivity of the
     bladder muscles, thereby reducing urgency and urinary frequency (Loloi et al., 2022).

     Anticholinergics, like antimuscarinics, block the action of acetylcholine; however, anticholinergics have a broader
     scope of activity, affecting various organs and systems in the body that are regulated by acetylcholine. In the context
     of urinary and bladder disorders, anticholinergics work by inhibiting the stimulation of bladder muscles, reducing
     their contractions and associated symptoms. The term "antimuscarinic" is often used interchangeably with
     "anticholinergic" when referring to medications used for overactive bladder.

     Trospium Chloride
     Trospium chloride is indicated for treating overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency,
     and urinary frequency (Araklitis et al., 2020).

     Adverse effects include dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia, headache, and urinary retention. Trospium chloride is
     contraindicated in clients with urinary or gastric retention, uncontrolled narrow angle glaucoma, or hypersensitivity
     to the drug or any of its components.

     Solifenacin Succinate
     Solifenacin succinate is used in the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence,

urgency, and frequency (Araklitis et al., 2020).

Adverse effects include dry mouth, constipation, UTI, dizziness, blurred vision, dry eyes, and urinary retention. It is
contraindicated in clients with urinary and gastric retention, hypersensitivity, or uncontrolled narrow angle
glaucoma.

Tolterodine Tartrate
Tolterodine tartrate is indicated for use in clients with an overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary
incontinence, urgency, and frequency (Narain & Parmar, 2023).

Adverse effects include dry mouth, fatigue, dizziness, constipation, dysuria, dry skin, and weight gain. It is
contraindicated in clients with urinary retention, gastric retention, uncontrolled narrow angle glaucoma, or
hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components.

Table 35.3 lists common urinary antispasmodic, antimuscarinic, and anticholinergic drugs and typical routes and
dosing for adult clients.

     Nursing Implications

     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking urinary antispasmodics, antimuscarinics, or
     anticholinergics:

     · Before administering the drug, check the client's medical history, current drug list, and allergies.
     · Educate the client regarding anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth, urinary retention, constipation, and

        visual disturbances such as blurred vision and sensitivity to light because these are common adverse effects
        of these drugs.
     · Monitor the client's urine output for signs of urinary retention, such as the inability to empty the bladder,
        distended bladder, and anxiousness because this is a serious adverse effect, and the client may need an
        intervention such as a urinary straight catheter to empty the bladder.
     · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for additional
        client teaching guidelines.

  CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

  The client taking a urinary antispasmodic, antimuscarinic, or anticholinergic should:

      · Take oxybutynin chloride with water on an empty stomach for better absorption.
      · Use sugarless candy, gum, or a saliva substitute for dry mouth, which is an adverse effect of these drugs.
      · Wear sunglasses because eye sensitivity, blurred vision, and visual disturbances may occur.
      · Increase dietary intake of fiber and increase fluid intake, if not contraindicated, to help reduce the risk of

          constipation.

  The client taking a urinary antispasmodic, antimuscarinic, or anticholinergic should not:

      · Take additional doses or more oxybutynin chloride than prescribed because doing so can cause serious
          adverse effects such as urinary retention and urinary infections from reflex.

      · Become overheated while taking oxybutynin or urinary antimuscarinics or anticholinergics because these
          drugs cause body temperature to increase and could lead to heat stroke.

      · Take these drugs with alcohol because alcohol may cause increased depression of the central nervous
          system, resulting in drowsiness, dizziness, and possibly seizures.

  FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

  Oxybutynin Chloride

  Oxybutynin chloride and drugs containing oxybutynin chloride may cause angioedema (swelling similar to hives)
  of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx when taken orally. This condition may interfere with breathing and require
  hospitalization or emergency treatment. Monitoring is warranted.

35.3 Urinary Analgesics

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 35.3.1 Identify the characteristics of urinary analgesic drugs used for urinary and bladder disorders.
    · 35.3.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, contraindications, and interactions of urinary

        analgesic drugs used for urinary and bladder disorders.
    · 35.3.3 Describe nursing implications of urinary analgesic drugs used for urinary and bladder disorders.
    · 35.3.4 Explain the client education related to urinary analgesic drugs used for urinary and bladder

        disorders.

Urinary analgesics are medications used to relieve pain and discomfort associated with the urinary tract. They are
primarily used to treat conditions such as UTIs and interstitial cystitis (also known as bladder pain syndrome).
Urinary analgesics work by numbing or reducing the sensitivity of the urinary tract, thus alleviating pain during
urination.

It is important to note that urinary analgesics do not treat the underlying cause of the pain (such as bacterial
infection in the case of UTIs); rather, they provide symptomatic relief. Therefore, it is crucial for the client to consult
with a health care provider to determine the cause of urinary pain and to receive appropriate treatment.
Additionally, urinary analgesics should be used only as directed and for a limited time because prolonged use
without addressing the underlying cause may mask important signs and symptoms and delay appropriate diagnosis
and treatment.

Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride

Phenazopyridine hydrochloride, an azo dye, is indicated for the symptomatic relief of pain, burning, urgency,
frequency, and other discomfort arising from irritation of the lower urinary tract mucosa caused by infection, trauma,
surgery, endoscopic procedures, or the passage of catheters (Eastham & Patel, 2022). This drug should not be used
for more than 2 consecutive days to avoid potentially masking a bacterial infection requiring antibiotics.

     CLINICAL TIP

     Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride and Urine Color

     Phenazopyridine hydrochloride may turn the urine, saliva, or tears a reddish-orange color. This is an expected
     effect of the medication and does not harm the client.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications

     Adverse effects include headache; rash; pruritus; gastrointestinal disturbance; reddish-orange color of saliva, tears,
     or urine; hemolytic anemia; and renal and hepatic toxicity. Phenazopyridine hydrochloride is contraindicated in
     clients with hypersensitivity and in those with renal insufficiency.

     Nursing Implications

     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking urinary analgesics:

     · Before administering the drug, check the client's medical history, current drug list (including over-the-counter
        medications), and allergies.

     · Before administering the drug, assess the client's renal and liver function because these drugs may cause
        renal or hepatic toxicity in clients who have insufficiency in these areas.

     · Notify the health care provider if the client continues to have urinary issues.
     · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for additional

        client teaching guidelines.

  CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

  The client taking a urinary analgesic should:

      · Take the medication as directed by their health care provider.
      · Report any use of over-the-counter medications that may contain phenazopyridine hydrochloride to the

          health care provider because concomitant use may cause renal toxicity.
      · Report any urinary tract symptoms that do not resolve or worsen to the health care provider because

          treatment may need to be modified.

  The client taking a urinary analgesic should not:

      · Take extra doses of this medication because doing so may cause serious adverse effects such as
          hemolytic anemia or renal or hepatic toxicity.

      · Wear contact lenses while taking phenazopyridine hydrochloride because it may stain them a reddish-
          orange.

      · Drink alcohol while taking urinary analgesics because their interaction may cause serious effects such as
          confusion, disorientation, and cardiac arrhythmias.

      · Take this medication longer than 2 days because doing so could mask symptoms of a bacterial infection
          that is not resolving.

35.4 Urinary Stimulants

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 35.4.1 Identify the characteristics of urinary stimulant drugs used for urinary and bladder disorders.
    · 35.4.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, contraindications, and interactions of urinary

        stimulant drugs used for urinary and bladder disorders.
    · 35.4.3 Describe nursing implications of urinary stimulant drugs used for urinary and bladder disorders.
    · 35.4.4 Explain the client education related to urinary stimulant drugs used for urinary and bladder

        disorders.

Urinary stimulants stimulate the smooth muscles of the urinary bladder. These drugs work by activating the
muscarinic receptors of the bladder, leading to increased bladder contractions and improved bladder emptying.
They are primarily prescribed for urinary retention or to improve bladder function in individuals with certain
neurologic conditions, such as a spinal cord injury.

Bethanechol Chloride

Bethanechol chloride (Duvoid) is indicated for acute postoperative and postpartum nonobstructive (functional)
urinary retention and for neurogenic atony of the urinary bladder with retention (Padda & Derain, 2022).

Determine the minimum effective dose by giving 5-10 mg initially and repeating the same amount at hourly
intervals until a satisfactory response occurs or until a maximum of 50 mg has been given (DailyMed, Bethanechol
chloride, 2022).

The drug's effects sometimes appear within 30 minutes, usually peak between 60 and 90 minutes, and persist for
approximately 1 hour (DailyMed, Bethanechol chloride, 2022).

Adverse Effects and Contraindications

Common adverse effects include malaise, urinary urgency, headache, vasomotor response, sweating, and miosis.
Contraindications include hyperthyroidism, peptic ulcer disease, asthma, pronounced bradycardia, hypotension,
coronary artery disease, seizure, Parkinson's disease, and hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components.

Table 35.6 is a drug prototype table for urinary stimulants featuring bethanechol chloride. It lists drug class,
mechanism of action, adult dosage, indications, therapeutic effects, drug and food interactions, adverse effects, and
contraindications.

          severe hypotension and bradycardia.

35.5 Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 35.5.1 Identify the characteristics of phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors used to treat benign prostatic
        hyperplasia.

    · 35.5.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, contraindications, and interactions of
        phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia.

    · 35.5.3 Describe nursing implications of phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors used to treat benign prostatic
        hyperplasia.

    · 35.5.4 Explain the client education related to phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors used to treat benign
        prostatic hyperplasia.

Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are a class of medications primarily used to treat erectile dysfunction and,
in some cases, pulmonary hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). These drugs work by blocking the
action of an enzyme called phosphodiesterase type 5, which is responsible for breaking down cyclic guanosine
monophosphate (cGMP) in the body; cGMP is a molecule that plays a crucial role in relaxing smooth muscles and
increasing blood flow to various tissues, including the penis and the lungs.

Tadalafil

Tadalafil (Cialis) is the PDE5 inhibitor that has been approved by regulatory agencies to treat both erectile
dysfunction and lower urinary tract symptoms associated with BPH. This chapter covers tadalafil in relation to BPH
only. Tadalafil works by relaxing the smooth muscles in the prostate and bladder, which can help improve urine flow
and reduce the urinary symptoms caused by prostate enlargement. These effects are achieved through the drug's
effect on cGMP, the same pathway that plays a role in erectile function.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications

Common adverse effects include headache, dyspepsia, back pain, myalgia, nasal congestion, pain in limbs, flushing,
cough, and UTI. The drug is contraindicated in clients who are taking nitrates or guanylate cyclase stimulants or who
are hypersensitive to the drug or any of its components (DailyMed, Tadalafil, 2023).

Table 35.7 is a drug prototype table for phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors for treatment of BPH featuring tadalafil. It
lists drug class, mechanism of action, adult dosage, indications, therapeutic effects, drug and food interactions,
adverse effects, and contraindications.

     Nursing Implications

     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking PDE5 inhibitors to treat BPH:

     · Before administering the drug, check the client's medical history, current drug list (including over-the-counter
        medications and alcohol), and allergies.

     · Before administering the drug, determine the client's regular or intermittent use of organic nitrates.
        Concomitant use of these with tadalafil can cause a sudden drop in blood pressure to an unsafe level,
        resulting in dizziness, syncope, or myocardial infarction (DailyMed, Tadalafil tablet, 2023).

     · Monitor for erections lasting longer than 4 hours and for priapism (painful erections lasting longer than 6
        hours).

     · Monitor closely for sudden vision or hearing loss because this can be a serious adverse effect of tadalafil.
     · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for additional

        client teaching guidelines.

     CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

     The client taking a PDE5 inhibitor for BPH should:

INTRODUCTION This chapter focuses on the human reproductive systems and the medications used for various
reproductive conditions. The chapter reviews the structure and function of the female and male reproductive
systems and the hormones involved. Topics for the female reproductive system include menstruation,
contraception, labor and delivery, postpartum, hormone replacement therapy, and menopause. Contraceptive
methods are explored, including oral, topical, implanted, injected, and inserted, as well as indications,
contraindications, and side effects of each. The chapter also examines medications used during the peripartum
period. Additionally, it discusses menopause and drugs used to manage bone health. Topics for the male
reproductive system include hormonal conditions, sexual performance, and andropause.
People often use the words "female" and "male" to describe two different concepts: our sense of gender identity
and our biological sex as determined by our X/Y chromosomes, hormones, sex organs, and other physical
characteristics. For some people, gender identity is different from biological sex, or their sex assigned at birth. In
this chapter, "female" and "male" refer to biological sex only, and the typical reproductive anatomy of individuals
with XX and XY chromosomes is discussed.

     36.1 Review of the Female Reproductive System

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 36.1.1 Describe the structure and function of the female reproductive system.
         · 36.1.2 Discuss common conditions that affect the female reproductive system.

     Structure and Function of the Female Reproductive System

     The female reproductive system (also referred to as the ovarian reproductive system) is made up of internal and
     external organs (see Figure 36.2). The external parts, known also as the vulva (see Figure 36.3), include the labia
     majora, labia minora, clitoris, vaginal and urethral openings, and the mons pubis. The internal organs are the vagina,
     cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries (Hoare & Kahn, 2022; Netter, 2022).

     The labia majora provide protection to the other external organs. The labia minora cover the openings to the urethra
     and the vagina. The clitoris is the junction of the labia minora and is the organ that allows sexual arousal to occur.
     The mons pubis is the small, rounded area made up of fat that sits just above the vulva. Pubic hair grows from the
     mons (Hoare & Kahn, 2022; Netter, 2022).

     The uterus, or womb, is where a fertilized egg implants to develop into the fetus. If an egg is not fertilized and
     implanted, the uterus sheds its inner lining in the process usually known as menstruation or a period. The vagina is
     the birth canal, which connects the cervix, the lowest end of the uterus, to the outside of the body. During labor, the
     cervix gradually dilates to allow the fetus to enter the vagina. Strong contractions push the fetus through the vagina
     to the point where the fetus is born, meaning it has been delivered outside the body (Betts et al., 2023; Hoare &
     Kahn, 2022; Netter, 2022).

     FIGURE 36.2 The internal ovarian reproductive system facilitates fertilization and fetal development during pregnancy, or menstruation if
     eggs are not fertilized or implanted. It is located within the pelvis and includes the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries.

Hormones

The major hormones affecting the female reproduction system are secreted from three locations in the body. The
hypothalamus secretes a hormone known as the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). The anterior pituitary is
stimulated by GnRH to secrete two hormones: Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing hormone (LH).
Finally, the ovaries (gonads) themselves secrete estrogen and progesterone (gonadotropins) in response to FSH
and LH released by the anterior pituitary. Each of these hormones is released during the monthly menstrual cycle,
but in different amounts depending on the stage of the cycle. Estrogen and progesterone are gonadotropins.

GnRH is a critical hormone in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, acting as the central regulator. It is
responsible for regulating the start of puberty, onset of menstrual cycle, development of sex characteristics, and
ovulation. GnRH is also responsible for producing the gonadal sex hormones, LH and FSH (Casteel & Singh, 2023).

FSH and LH stimulate the development of ovarian follicles and the release of mature ova (eggs) from mature
follicles. Additionally, FSH and LH prepare the body for pregnancy and support pregnancy until the time of delivery.

Estrogen is produced in three types: estradiol, estriol, and estrone. It initiates the development of the female
genitalia and breast tissue and plays many roles during pregnancy to conserve energy for the fetus, increase
metabolism, increase uterine motility, and other actions to prepare the body for pregnancy and delivery.
Progesterone performs many of the same functions as estrogen does, to promote maturation of sex organs, prepare
the body for pregnancy, and maintain a healthy uterine environment for development of the fetus.

The adrenal cortex secretes gonadocorticoids (gonadotropins), which are the sex hormones. Male hormones
(androgens/testosterone) and female hormones (estrogen) are secreted in opposite sexes in very small amounts.
However, they have minimal effect on the opposite sex (testosterone in females and estrogen in males) because
hormones from the testes and ovaries override them. In menopause, androgen has more of a masculinization effect
on females because the ovaries secrete less estrogen (Nassar, 2023).

Menstrual Cycle

The menstrual cycle refers to the monthly changes in hormones and reproductive organs that usually occurs on a
28-day cycle. The length of the cycle is different for each client and may be shorter or longer or even irregular for
some individuals. The first menstrual cycle is known as menarche and generally begins around age 12, with some
clients starting earlier and some not starting until their mid-teens. Each menstrual cycle begins with the first day of
bleeding from the uterus. The bleeding is the discharge of blood and endometrial tissue, the lining of the uterus,
which had been prepared for the implantation of a fertilized egg. Bleeding lasts around 5 days, though the length of
time is individualized. Approximately 14 days after the first day of the cycle, ovulation occurs. The ovary releases an
egg, and it travels through the fallopian tubes to the uterus to be fertilized and implanted. If no fertilization occurs,
918  36 · Reproductive Health Drugs

     the egg, along with the endometrial content, is expelled from the uterus, and the bleeding starts another menstrual
     cycle (McLaughlin, 2023; Rosner et al., 2022).

     Hormones play a key role in the menstrual cycle through increased or decreased secretion from the hypothalamus,
     anterior pituitary, and ovaries. At the start of each cycle, the ovaries increase the production of estrogen until about
     day 14, when ovulation occurs; estrogen production then sharply decreases. During the second half of the cycle,
     estrogen secretion increases until about day 20 and then decreases to its lowest point when menstruation restarts,
     marking day 1 of a new cycle. Progesterone secretion, in contrast, is low until just before ovulation and then
     increases sharply, reaching a peak on about day 20. It then decreases gradually and remains low until the next
     ovulation at days 12-14 (McLaughlin, 2023; Rosner et al., 2022).

     GnRH, LH, and FSH stimulate target cells (the cells that respond to a specific hormone) in the ovaries, causing the
     increased production of estrogen and progesterone. The hormone GnRH is secreted in bursts that vary in amplitude
     and frequency. The variations of amplitude and frequency also impact the start of other hormonal changes that
     regulate the menstrual cycle. Testosterone and progesterone decrease the frequency of GnRH bursts, whereas
     estrogens increase the frequency (Casteel & Singh, 2023). Additionally, LH and FSH increase the number and size of
     the target cells. Both LH and FSH secretion rise slightly at the start of the menstrual cycle, decrease, and then
     sharply increase immediately before day 14, or ovulation. They decrease significantly and rapidly after ovulation and
     remain steady until just before the start of a new cycle (McLaughlin, 2023; Rosner et al., 2022).

     Figure 36.4 shows the phases of hormonal secretion.

  Dr. Paulien Moyaert is a Belgian nuclear medicine resident and science communicator. In this video, Dr. Moyaert
  explains the hormonal changes that occur during the menstrual cycle.

Pregnancy

Pregnancy means that an egg produced by the ovary has been released, fertilized by sperm, and implanted into the
lining of the uterus and has begun to grow into a fetus. During pregnancy, the client will not have monthly menstrual
cycles.

Three main groups of medications are related to pregnancy and will be discussed later in the chapter:
contraceptives for clients who do not want to become pregnant, fertility medications for females who need help to
become pregnant and maintain the pregnancy, and medications used during labor and delivery.

Menopause

Once a client has passed the age when they have regular monthly cycles, they have entered perimenopause. During
perimenopause, the monthly menstrual cycle generally becomes irregular. A client may experience a missed cycle
for one month and then have a period the following month. Cycles may occur closer together, the actual bleeding
time may be shorter, and the amount of bleeding may decrease. Menopause is diagnosed once a client has not had
any monthly cycles for 12 consecutive months (Peacock & Ketvertis, 2022; Mayo Clinic, 2023b; North American
Menopause Society (NAMS) 2022 Hormone Therapy Position Statement Advisory Panel, 2022).

Menopause can occur in a client as early as their 30s until their mid-50s, with an average age of 51 years. Clients
who experience menopause younger than age 40 are considered to have early menopause, usually the result of a
genetic or chromosomal problem. Surgical menopause happens when the ovaries are surgically removed.
Additionally, induced menopause may occur as the result of medications or radiation therapy that damages the
ovaries. Whatever the reason for menopause, the signs and symptoms will be the same (Peacock & Ketvertis, 2022;
Mayo Clinic, 2023b; NAMS 2022 Hormone Therapy Position Statement Advisory Panel, 2022).

During menopause, certain conditions develop that are the result of decreased hormones, specifically estrogen and
progesterone. Vaginal dryness, hot flashes, night sweats, mood changes, weight gain, trouble sleeping, and thinning
hair are what most clients experience during menopause. The intensity of each menopausal condition is
individualized, so comparing one person's experience to another person's is not supportive to individual clients
(Hariri & Rahman, 2023; NAMS 2022 Hormone Therapy Position Statement Advisory Panel, 2022; Mayo Clinic,
2023b; Peacock & Ketvertis, 2022).

One primary concern of menopause is the loss of bone mass, which can lead to fractures. This topic will be covered
in more detail in the next section.

     36.2 Hormonal, Contraception, and Infertility Drugs

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 36.2.1 Identify the characteristics of the hormonal therapy, contraception, and infertility drugs used to
             treat female reproductive disorders.

         · 36.2.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of hormonal therapy,
             contraception, and infertility drugs used to treat female reproductive disorders.

         · 36.2.3 Describe nursing implications of hormonal therapy, contraception, and infertility drugs used to
             treat female reproductive disorders.

         · 36.2.4 Explain the client education related to contraception, hormonal therapy, and infertility drugs used
             to treat female reproductive disorders.

     Hormonal Drugs

     Hormonal drugs are derived from natural sources or manufactured to mimic the body's hormones. Hormonal drugs
     can be used for numerous conditions from contraception to menopause. They can replace the body's natural
     hormones when insufficient amounts are produced. They can also simulate or produce a state that is necessary for a
     specific reason. Contraception is an example in which hormonal drugs are used to create an environment that is not
     conducive to fertilization and implantation of an egg in the uterus.

     Estrogens
     Estrogen is produced in the body in four types: estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), and estetrol (E4) (Hariri &
     Rehman, 2023). Indications for the use of estrogen include hormone replacement therapy (HRT) during
     menopause to relieve signs and symptoms such as vaginal dryness, hot flashes, mood swings, and painful
     intercourse. One type of estrogen, estradiol, can also be used as HRT for hypogonadism and ovarian failure (medical
     or physiological). Estradiol is available in a multitude of types and combinations, and dosages vary with the
     indication and use, the administration method, and its combined form (DailyMed, Estradiol, 2021; Hariri & Rahman,
     2023).

     Estrogens are administered in several ways. If administered orally, they are absorbed well from the gastrointestinal
     tract, metabolized by the liver, and excreted in urine. Depending on the dose, estrogens can inhibit or promote
     ovulation. Other positive effects include preservation of calcium and phosphorus and stimulation of bone growth.

     Table 36.1 lists two forms of estrogen therapy that are synthetic but identical to the body's natural hormone and
     typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Adverse effects of estrogens are related mostly to the retention of fluids. Migraine headaches, bloating, weight gain,
mood depression, stroke, and cardiovascular disease are known adverse reactions and can be life-threatening.

Contraindications for estrogens include hormone-positive breast cancer, undiagnosed uterine bleeding, and active
or history of thrombophlebitis or thromboembolism. Pregnancy and breastfeeding are also contraindications
because estrogens cross the placenta and enter breast milk. Estrogens must be used cautiously in conditions that
are affected or exacerbated by fluid retention, such as migraine headaches with an aura, renal or cardiac
dysfunction, and hypertension. Obesity and age greater than 35 are circumstances when estrogens should be used
cautiously, if at all.

cardiovascular events such as stroke and heart attack in postmenopausal clients.
It can significantly increase the risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal clients.
It should not be used to prevent dementia as part of hormone replacement therapy.

Progestins
Progestins include progesterone and its derivatives. They can function as both a stimulant and an inhibitor to
manage the secretion of pituitary gonadotropins. One of the properties of progestins is their ability to prevent
follicular maturation and ovulation. They accomplish this by inhibiting the secretion of pituitary gonadotropins and
decreasing LH secretion. Progestins thicken cervical mucus, which hinders sperm migration and changes the
endometrium to decrease the likelihood that an egg can be implanted. These properties make progestins an
excellent contraceptive medication. Progestins are metabolized by the liver and excreted in urine.

Progesterone is used for several reasons. It can be added to estrogen in postmenopausal HRT to reduce the risk of
endometrial cancer. It is also used for amenorrhea and for dysfunctional uterine bleeding. It can be administered
orally, intramuscularly, intrauterine, and as a gel, depending on the intended effect of the drug. Progesterone dosage
for HRT varies, as does the number of days it is used per month.

Desogestrel, drospirenone, medroxyprogesterone, norethindrone, and levonorgestrel are progestins. Desogestrel
and drospirenone are used only in combination form for contraception.

  clinical trials have shown health risks. The Mayo Clinic discusses hormone replacement therapy and whether it is
  right for certain clients.

Contraceptives

Contraceptives are a group of medications, generally natural or synthetic hormone preparations, used to prevent
pregnancy. Hormonal contraceptive medications work at distinct stages within the female (ovarian) reproductive
system and use a variety of methods to interrupt the normal cycle of hormone release, egg fertilization, and/or
implantation. Hormonal contraceptives can be oral, topical, vaginal, injectable, or implantable.

One important fact concerning all contraceptives, except male and female condoms, is that they do not prevent
sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Therefore, client education about this topic is crucial. Another major
consideration about contraceptives is that none of them is 100% effective in preventing pregnancy. There is a risk
that sexual intercourse, even with the use of contraceptives, can lead to pregnancy (Britton et al., 2020).

Synthetic forms of estrogen and progestin are the hormones used in contraceptive drugs. These drugs contain either
an estrogen-progestin combination or progestin alone. Estrogen works by the negative feedback loop to decrease
the secretion of LH and FSH from the anterior pituitary gland. With lower levels of LH and FSH, a dominant follicle
will not develop, and a mature egg will not be released from the follicle (Britton et al., 2020; Casey, 2022; Cooper et
al., 2020).

Progestin thickens the cervical mucous and prevents sperm from reaching the egg. It also changes the endometrium
so that the environment of the uterus is less favorable for egg implantation. Refer to the previous section regarding
hormones for specific information about estrogen and progestin.

The combination oral contraceptives (COC) and progestin-only contraceptives (POP) make up two types of oral
contraceptive pills. The third type is a continuous or extended-use pill, which means the pills are taken without any
pause for an indefinite time. This contraceptive regimen allows for increased ovulation suppression and medication
adherence, is more satisfactory for the user, and decreases both scheduled and breakthrough bleeding over time
(Britton et al., 2020; Casey, 2022; Cooper et al., 2020).

     CLINICAL TIP

 Dealing with Side Effects of Birth Control Methods

  The most frequent side effects of all birth control methods are nausea and breakthrough bleeding. Instructing
  the client to take the medication before going to bed is one of the best ways to manage nausea so that the client
  is asleep when the worst of the nausea occurs. Eating small meals frequently, avoiding spicy and greasy foods,
  and drinking ginger ale or clear liquids are other ways to alleviate nausea. The nausea should go away after about
  3 months.

  Breakthrough bleeding can be frustrating to the client. However, this should also subside after 3 months. Some
  clients may have only spotting and some may have times of heavy bleeding other than their period (if
  contraceptive method allows for monthly cycle to continue).

  There is no way to determine which client will have which side effects. Every individual's experience is different.
  The body is adjusting to new levels of hormones, and this process takes about 3 months. Emotional support to
  the client is also important. Some clients may need to try more than one contraceptive pill or method to find the
  best fit for their situation.

Oral and Injectable Contraceptives
Oral contraceptives are pills that contain either a combination of estrogen and progestin or progestin alone. Oral
contraceptives are prescribed based on a client's medical history, needs, and risk factors. Combined oral
contraceptives (COCs) contain estrogen and progestin in varying dosages. The type of progestin varies with each
COC depending on the individual client's needs and medical status. There are three different categories of COCs.
Monophasic contraceptive pills contain a fixed ratio of estrogen and progestin. Biphasic COCs contain a fixed dose of
estrogen with a varying dose of progestin. Triphasic COCs contain low doses of both estrogen and progestin with a
926  36 · Reproductive Health Drugs

     varying dose of estrogen (Britton et al., 2020; Casey, 2022; Mayo Clinic, 2023a; Cooper et al., 2020).

     Injectable contraceptives are hormones that are injected, usually intramuscularly, at specific intervals to provide the
     same birth control protection as oral contraceptives (Britton et al., 2020; Casey, 2022; Cooper et al., 2020).

     Table 36.5 lists common forms of COCs and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

     Progestin-only contraceptives are used when estrogen is not appropriate for the client's situation. For instance, the
     client may have significant risk factors such as obesity, smoking, hypertension, and age over 35 years. These are
     also commonly used by clients who are breastfeeding, as they have less effect on the breast milk supply than oral
     contraceptives containing estrogen. Medroxyprogesterone, norethindrone, and levonorgestrel are progestin-only
     contraceptives. The injectable contraceptive medroxyprogesterone is administered intramuscularly or
     subcutaneously (Britton et al., 2020; Casey, 2022; Cooper et al., 2020).

Contraceptive Options (https://openstax.org/r/womenshealth)

Birth Control Methods is a client education site that discusses birth control options and resources for obtaining
them.

Intrauterine and Implanted Contraceptives
In addition to oral and injectable contraceptives, intrauterine devices (IUDs) and implanted contraceptive devices
are available. The advantages to these forms of contraception are their long-term effects and ease of use. They do
not require remembering to take daily pills or scheduling appointments for injections. However, they do have side
effects, like any hormonal medication. Additionally, because they are inserted into the body, risks of infection and
migration (moving) or dislodgement of the devices exist (Andersen & Spanfeller, 2022; Britton et al., 2020; Casey,
2022; Madden, 2023).

IUDs have become the most commonly used contraceptive method in the world and are among the most effective
types of contraceptives. IUDs are small T-shaped devices that are placed inside the uterus via the cervix. Five types
of IUDs are used in the United States. Four of them are hormonal. They release small amounts of progestin
(levonorgestrel) into the body. They also have a positive effect of making monthly periods lighter. Further, these
IUDs may decrease the risk of ovarian, endometrial, and cervical cancers (Andersen & Spanfeller, 2022; Casey,
2022; Madden, 2023).

The fifth type is copper. It works by stimulating the body's immune response, creating an unfavorable uterine
environment for the sperm, and preventing pregnancy. It may initially increase bleeding with periods and between
periods; however, the bleeding should lessen to an acceptable level. Hormonal IUDs can last for 3-8 years,
depending on the specific hormone and dose, and the copper type lasts for 10 years (Andersen & Spanfeller, 2022;
Britton et al., 2020; Casey, 2022; Madden, 2023).

Another type of birth control method is the implanted device. The device comes as a single soft, radiopaque, flexible
implant (4 cm in length × 2 mm in diameter) that contains 68 mg etonogestrel, 15 mg barium sulfate, and 0.1 mg
magnesium stearate. It comes with the insertion device in the package. The contraceptive is implanted under the
skin of the inner upper arm. It has the same action, use, contraindications, and side effects as any other
contraceptive containing levonorgestrel. The primary risk is infection or dislodgement of the implant. This device
lasts for 3 years and is a highly effective contraceptive method (Britton et al., 2020; Casey, 2022; DailyMed,
Nexplanon, 2022).

Table 36.7 lists the four hormonal IUD types and dosing for adult clients.

TABLE 36.7 Drug Emphasis Table: Hormonal IUDs (source: https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/)

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Contraindications include active STI or recent pelvic infection, pregnancy, cancer of the cervix or uterus, or
unexplained vaginal bleeding. Hormonal IUDs should not be used by clients who have had breast cancer.

Side effects include bleeding and spotting as the uterus adjusts to the IUD. Other adverse effects include abdominal
pain, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and expulsion of the IUD. Extremely rare is the possibility
that an IUD may cause uterine perforation.

For a copper IUD, the bleeding and spotting may last up to 6 months. The insertion of the IUD may be
uncomfortable, and the client may experience some cramping and backache for a day or two after the procedure.
The pain can be managed using ibuprofen or acetaminophen and heating pads. Other side effects include nausea,
928  36 · Reproductive Health Drugs

     cramping, ovarian cysts, and mood changes. The most concerning complications of all IUDs are infection, expulsion,
     or perforation; however, the risk for these complications is extremely low (Andersen & Spanfeller, 2022; Britton et
     al., 2020; Casey, 2022; Madden, 2023).

     Other Contraceptive Methods
     Two other hormonal contraceptive methods are a transdermal patch and a vaginal ring. The patch contains an
     estrogen-progestin combination and is applied weekly for 3 weeks and left off for 1 week. The vaginal ring also
     contains a combination of estrogen-progestin and is inserted once and left in place for 3 weeks. The ring is removed
     for 1 week before a new ring is inserted. Both methods are based on a 4-week cycle (Britton et al., 2020; Casey,
     2022).

     In 2018 the FDA approved a new vaginal ring that is reused for a year (Center for Devices and Radiological Health,
     2018). It is used according to the same cycle of 3 weeks in place and 1 week out. The difference is that between
     cycles it can be washed and stored and then reused.

     Specific client teaching for the vaginal ring includes properly placing and removing the ring and properly disposing of
     the monthly ring or cleaning and storage of the yearly ring. If the ring is removed for more than 3 hours, clients
     should be advised to use a backup contraceptive method concurrently for 7 days (Britton et al., 2020; Casey, 2022).

     Client teaching for the patch includes correct opening of the package; placing the patch on clean, dry skin on the
     buttocks, upper outer arm, lower abdomen, or upper body; pressing it firmly for 10 seconds; and not placing the
     patch on the breasts (Britton et al., 2020; Casey, 2022).

     All contraceptive drugs, regardless of form, are derived from the hormones estrogen and progestin. Refer to Table
     36.1 and Table 36.3 for information related to mechanism of action, indication, therapeutic effects, side effects,
     contraindications, and food and drug interactions.

1. The nurse completes the initial assessment for Susan. Which finding is the most important regarding
    counseling about contraceptive medications?
       a. Weight and BMI
       b. Sexual history
       c. Smoking
       d. Migraine headache

2. After discussing all the options for contraception with Susan and considering that Susan does not want
    children, which method do Susan and the nurse think may be the best for her?
       a. Oral, daily combination hormone pill
       b. Depo-Provera injection once every 3 months
       c. Hormonal IUD
       d. Copper IUD

Initiating Contraceptives
The oral and transdermal methods can be initiated using a first-day start method, a quick start method, or a Sunday
start method. All are equally effective. The first-day start method means the client starts the contraceptive on day
1 of their menstrual cycle and continues as directed. The quick start method means that the client starts the
contraceptive immediately, regardless of the timing of their menstrual period. This is week one. The individual
continues to take the pills or apply the patch as directed. One advantage of the quick start method is that the client
can begin taking the medication the day they receive the medication. The Sunday start method means the client
will start using the contraceptive on the first Sunday following the start date of their period. Then the client
continues to take the pills or apply the patch as directed. A disadvantage of the Sunday start method is that clients
may forget to start on the correct date and then must wait until after their next period to begin taking the medication
(Britton et al., 2020; Casey, 2022; Cooper et al., 2020).

Infertility Drugs

Infertility drugs constitute a highly specialized class of drugs. The content in this chapter is intended to give the
reader an introduction to the topic. Infertility can occur for numerous reasons that are beyond the scope of this
930  36 · Reproductive Health Drugs

     chapter to detail. Some causes of infertility are related to impaired hormone secretion from the reproductive system
     and the thyroid. Other causes include blockages or conditions that require surgical intervention to resolve. This
     chapter will cover only the drugs used to promote fertility.

     Some clients cannot become pregnant without exogenous treatment, meaning they will need medications
     administered to assist their body's reproductive system to ovulate and for the egg to mature. Some medications
     directly stimulate the follicles and ovulation; others stimulate the hypothalamus to increase the secretion of FSH
     and LH, which then lead to follicle and ovary development and maturation.

     These medications are typically used only for clients who have functioning ovaries and who have been unable to
     become pregnant after at least 1 year of trying. However, if a client is over age 35, fertility drugs are generally used
     after 6 months of trying. The other purpose of infertility drugs is for people who want multiple follicles developing in
     order to harvest ova for in vitro fertilization.

     One important aspect of fertility treatment is the complex schedule for taking each medication and when
     intercourse should take place to increase the chance of egg fertilization. Additionally, provider appointments may
     not be easy to facilitate if the client lives a distance from the clinic or is limited by their personal situation in
     scheduling appointments at the clinic. Further, if the client is self-administering injections, they will need
     instructions and supplies.

     Table 36.9 lists common infertility drugs and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

     Drug                             Routes and Dosage Ranges

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Adverse effects of infertility drugs include a significant risk of multiple births and birth defects. Ovarian
     overstimulation is another side effect that is manifested by abdominal pain, distention, ascites (fluid accumulation
     in the abdomen), and pleural effusion. Headache, fluid retention, ovarian enlargement, uterine bleeding, nausea,
     and fever are additional side effects.

     Infertility drugs are contraindicated when the client has primary ovarian failure, thyroid or adrenal dysfunction,
     ovarian cysts, or idiopathic uterine bleeding or is pregnant. Clients with respiratory issues or who are breastfeeding
     should use caution before deciding to take fertility medications.

     Table 36.10 is a drug prototype table for infertility drugs featuring clomiphene. Clomiphene is a selective estrogen
     receptor modulator (SERM) with both estrogen antagonist and agonist effects that increase gonadotropin release as
     well as increase production of FSH and LS. The ultimate effect is ovarian follicular growth (Carson & Kallen, 2021).

Nursing Implications

The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking hormone therapy, contraceptives, or infertility drugs:

· Assess client's baseline health status to include medical history, physical exam, and complete medication
   history, including herbal remedies and over-the-counter (OTC) medications.

· Assess for factors that increase the client's risk of adverse effects including personal and family history of
   cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, cerebral vascular accident, hypertension, and thrombotic
   events including venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolism).

· Assess smoking history and alcohol use.
· Assess pregnancy and lactation status (for contraceptive use).
· Assess for presence of or risk of sexually transmitted infection (for clients obtaining contraception).
· Assess client's emotional status and support system.
· Identify any factors that may affect the client's ability to adhere to the medication regime.
· Obtain serum and urine specimens as ordered.
· Assist with gynecological exam as needed.
· Assess baseline sexual development for prepubescent clients taking hormone therapy.
· Obtain baseline vital signs and weight and monitor at each follow-up appointment.
· Assess client's understanding of the drugs to be used--actions, side effects, contraindications, administration

   method, and schedule-and provide instruction as indicated.
· Provide information in a calm, supportive, nonjudgmental manner.
· Assist the client with their choice of contraceptive method according to individual needs and preferences.
· Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

   teaching guidelines.
932  36 · Reproductive Health Drugs

       CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

       The client taking a hormone therapy, contraceptive, or infertility drug should:

           · Understand the purpose, effect, and side effects of the medication(s).
           · Be able to follow the drug schedule (daily, cyclical).
           · Be able to self-administer drug as ordered (topical, transdermal, oral, injection).
           · Verbalize the importance of taking medications at the same time and what to do for missed doses.
           · For clients using contraceptives, understand the need for using a barrier or nonhormonal birth control

               method to prevent pregnancy when beginning contraception and any time 3 or more consecutive doses of
               oral contraceptive are missed. The alternate method should generally be used for a minimum of 7 days.
           · For clients using contraception, understand that it does not protect against STIs, so barrier methods
               (condoms) must be used to prevent the spread of infections.
           · For clients with transdermal patches or vaginal rings, understand what to do when they are dislodged or
               removed during the active time.
           · For clients with an implanted contraceptive device, understand the potential complications of infection
               and migration of the device.
           · Report problems such as breakthrough bleeding and any intolerable side effects to the health care
               provider.
           · Avoid prolonged exposure to sunlight (hormone therapy).
           · Recognize any change in vision and/or problems with contact lenses (hormone therapy).
           · Initiate smoking cessation in the manner most suited to the client (medication, support group, etc.).
           · Clients taking infertility medications should understand the possibility of multiple births.
           · Dispose of any sharps in a safe manner.
           · Clients taking infertility medications should be able to follow the schedule for sexual intercourse as
               determined to maximize chances for pregnancy success.
           · Report new health problems to the health care provider in a timely manner.
           · Notify the health care provider immediately of chest pain and/or shortness of breath; any pain, swelling,
               and/or redness in calves; severe headache; signs and symptoms of stroke; and any significant change in
               mood (depression).
           · Notify the health care provider before taking any new medication or OTC/herbal remedies.
           · Maintain follow-up appointments.

       The client taking a hormone therapy, contraceptive, or infertility drug should not:

           · Smoke because of the increased risk of blood clots (hormone therapy, contraceptives).
           · Discontinue or alter the dose of the medication without consulting with their health care provider.

     36.3 Uterine Motility Drugs and Lactation Considerations

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 36.3.1 Identify the characteristics of uterine motility drugs used during pregnancy and labor.
         · 36.3.2 Explain the indications, actions, contraindications, and adverse reactions of uterine motility drugs

             used during pregnancy and labor.
         · 36.3.3 Describe nursing implications for uterine motility drugs used during pregnancy and labor.
         · 36.3.4 Explain the client education related to uterine motility drugs used during pregnancy and labor.
         · 36.3.5 Briefly discuss maternal and fetal health considerations when using medications during

             pregnancy, labor, and delivery.
         · 36.3.6 Briefly describe nursing implications and client education regarding medication use while

             breastfeeding.

     Uterine motility drugs are used during labor to stimulate contractions (oxytocics) or to induce abortion
     (abortifacients). Other medications (tocolytics), such as terbutaline, are used to delay contraction in the event of
     premature labor.

Lactation is the secretion of breast milk by the mammary glands. Some medications can pass from breast milk to
the infant. Thus, when the lactating client must take medications, consideration must be given to the possible
harmful effects on the infant. Because this content is highly specialized and used only in maternal health, this
section will cover only basic information.

Uterine Motility Drugs

Uterine motility drugs affect the movement (contractions) of the uterus. Motility drugs may either increase or
decrease uterine contractions, depending on the client's specific situation. Fetal distress, abnormal fetal
presentation, fetal demise, and maternal hemorrhage might be reasons to increase uterine contractions and
facilitate delivery. On the other hand, premature labor may be a reason to slow uterine contractions. Generally,
these medications are administered in an acute-care setting with monitoring equipment available.

Oxytocics
Oxytocics are used to induce and increase uterine contractions during labor. The two drugs in this category are
methylergonovine and oxytocin. These drugs are administered in labor and delivery or postpartum units in a medical
facility where the client can be monitored closely.

Methylergonovine is administered IM or via IV immediately after delivery and then orally for up to 1 week as needed.
Methylergonovine works directly on the uterine smooth muscle to prevent postpartum hemorrhage. It also helps
with uterine involution, the process whereby the uterus gradually resumes its prepartum size and weight. The IM
dose is 1 mL (0.2 mg) after delivery of the anterior shoulder, after delivery of the placenta, or during the puerperium
(several weeks after childbirth). Dosage may be repeated as required at intervals of 2-4 hours. The IV dose is 1 mL
(0.2 mg) administered slowly over a period of no less than 60 seconds (DailyMed, Methylergonovine, 2020).

Oxytocin is administered by intravenous infusion starting at 1-2 mU/minute and gradually increased in increments
of no more than 1-2 mU/minute until a normal labor contraction pattern is established. Oxytocin works by exerting a
selective action on the smooth musculature of the uterus, which stimulates rhythmic contractions of the uterus,
increases the frequency of existing contractions, and improves muscle tone of the uterus. It can be used to facilitate
labor contractions as well as to prevent postpartum hemorrhage.

Table 36.11 lists common oxytocics with typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

Drug                                              Routes and Dosage Ranges

Methylergonovine  1 mL (0.2 mg) intramuscularly or intravenously (IV) (IV dose administered slowly over a
   (Methergine)   period of no less than 60 seconds).

                  Continuous infusion: 1 mL (10 units/mL) combined with 1000 mL of an isotonic diluent such

                  as lactated Ringer's solution.

Oxytocin          Initial dose: No more than 1-2 mU/minute; may be gradually increased in increments of no
(Pitocin)         more than 1-2 mU/minute until normal labor contraction pattern established.
                  To control postpartum bleeding: 10-40 units added to 1000 mL of a nonhydrating diluent.

                  Rate adjusted as necessary to control uterine atony.

                  1 mL (10 units) of oxytocin intramuscularly after delivery of placenta.

TABLE 36.11 Drug Emphasis Table: Oxytocics (source: https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/)

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Methylergonovine is contraindicated or used cautiously in clients who have coronary artery disease, diabetes, or
hypercholesterolemia because it may increase the risk for more serious side effects. Kidney and liver disease are
also conditions that may require caution when using methylergonovine because of delayed metabolism and
excretion of the drug. Pregnancy, hypertension, and toxemia are contraindications for the drug. One notable
drug-food interaction is grapefruit and grapefruit juice (DailyMed, Methylergonovine, 2020).

Side effects include worsening of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, abdominal pain,
headache, and increased blood pressure. Other less-common side effects include chest pain or discomfort; difficult
or labored breathing; dizziness; pounding or irregular heartbeat; pain or discomfort in the arms, jaw, back, or neck;
and puffiness around the eyes, face, lips, or tongue (DailyMed, Methylergonovine, 2020).
934  36 · Reproductive Health Drugs

     Oxytocin is contraindicated in hypersensitivity, obstetric emergencies that negatively affect either the birthing
     parent or fetus, during fetal distress, when vaginal delivery is inadvisable or fetal positions/presentations are not
     favorable for delivery, and in uterine contraction pattern dysfunction.

     The maternal side effects of oxytocin include nausea, vomiting, cardiac dysrhythmias, uterine hypertonicity, uterine
     rupture, postpartum hemorrhage, pelvic hematoma, water intoxication, and dilutional hyponatremia. Side effects for
     the fetus include bradycardia and other cardiac dysrhythmias, impaired fetal oxygenation, permanent brain or
     central nervous system (CNS) damage, and retinal hemorrhage.

     Tocolytics
     Tocolytics are drugs used to delay contractions to prevent premature labor and the associated risks, including death
     of the infant. Magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) is the drug used for this purpose. The indications for a tocolytic drug are
     premature labor after 20 weeks' gestation and generally prior to the 34th week. The purpose of using a tocolytic is
     to delay labor long enough (24 hours-7 days) to administer corticosteroids to the birthing parent. This allows for

fetal lung development to progress to a point where the fetus has enough surfactant to prevent respiratory distress
after delivery.

MgSO4 acts as a CNS and muscular depressant by preventing the peripheral neuromuscular transmission of
acetylcholine. Also, MgSO4 is a calcium antagonist, thus blocking calcium from entering cells and causing muscle
contractions.

As a tocolytic agent, MgSO4 use is controversial. Its primary use is controlling the seizures of preeclampsia or
eclampsia in the birthing parent. It can possibly slow uterine contractions long enough to administer corticosteroids
to the birthing parent, but current research does not support this belief. MgSO4 is a drug that can cause sudden and
severe adverse effects, and the client must be monitored closely. Any change in mental status such as decreased
level of consciousness or confusion, sudden drop in blood pressure, loss of patellar reflex, depressed respirations,
or hypermagnesemia should be treated immediately to prevent complete cardiovascular collapse and death. The
treatment for magnesium toxicity is intravenous calcium gluconate or calcium chloride.

MgSO4 can also be significantly detrimental to the fetus. It can cause hypocalcemia, skeletal demineralization,
osteopenia, and bone and skeletal abnormalities if used more than 5-7 days during fetal development. The infusion
during labor can lead to heart rate changes, hypotonia, respiratory depression, and possibly death.

action, adult dosage, indications, therapeutic effects, drug and food interactions, adverse effects, and
contraindications.

     Abortifacients
     Abortifacients are medications used to evacuate the uterus via powerful contractions. These contractions empty the
     uterus of implanted trophoblasts, the cells that become the placenta, and prevent any fertilized egg from being
     implanted. Abortifacients are used during weeks 12-20 to terminate a pregnancy or to expel the fetus in cases of
     fetal demise. Carboprost and mifepristone are the drugs in this category.

     The topic of abortion is highly controversial in the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Roe v.
     Wade precedent in 2022. Thus, each U.S. state now writes and enacts its own legislation regarding abortion. In
     some states, health care professionals can be criminally charged for various actions related to abortions. Because
     nurses may be in situations that could involve some aspect of abortion, they should be cognizant of the abortion
     laws in the state where they practice. Each state's nurses' association and board of nursing, as well as the American
     Nurses Association, are resources nurses can contact for any questions or concerns about abortion laws. (See this
     American Nurses Association website on Sexual and Reproductive Health (https://openstax.org/r/nursingworld) for
     additional resources.)

     Nursing Implications
     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking uterine motility drugs:

     · Assess client's medical and drug history as appropriate for the setting.
     · Determine drug allergies.
     · Assess client's labor and delivery status (active, complicated, patterns, cervical dilation, contractions, etc.)
     · Assess client's mental and neurological status and vital signs, as well as fetal status, and monitor throughout

        procedure and as indicated.
     · Initiate appropriate maternal and fetal monitoring equipment such as cardiac monitor and fetal heart rate

        monitor.
     · Assess any contraindications/precautions for the specific medication to be used.
     · Determine age of fetus (for abortifacients).
     · Monitor laboratory values as ordered and indicated.
     · Provide emotional support.
     · Establish seizure precautions as needed.
     · Initiate and maintain intravenous access.
     · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

        teaching guidelines.

   CLINICAL TIP

Administration of Mifepristone

    · Inform the client that uterine bleeding and uterine cramping will occur
    · Advise the client that serious and sometimes fatal infections and bleeding can occur very rarely.
    · Mifepristone tablets, 200 mg, are only available through a restricted program called the Mifepristone REMS

        (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) Program:
          Clients must sign a Client Agreement Form.
          Mifepristone tablets are only available by or under the supervision of certified prescribers or by
              certified pharmacies on prescriptions issued by certified prescribers.

    · Misoprostol must be taken with mifepristone and within the specified time in order for a successful
        termination of pregnancy.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking a uterine motility drug should:

    · Understand the indications, side effects, and contraindications of the specific drug being used in their
        situation.

    · Be able to give informed consent to the use of the drugs (if necessary).
    · Report any serious side effects (prolonged severe cramping, heart palpitations, chest pain, difficulty

        breathing or shortness of breath, muscle weakness).
    · If drug is used at home, take medication as prescribed.
    · Contact the health care provider with any questions or concerns.
    · Go to the nearest hospital emergency department for emergent situations (fever, severe abdominal pain,

        prolonged heavy bleeding, or syncope) or for abdominal pain or discomfort, general malaise, weakness,
        nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea occurring more than 24 hours after taking misoprostol.

The client taking a uterine motility drug should not:

    · Stop taking or take a different dose of the medication than prescribed by their health care provider.
    · Clients taking methylergonovine should avoid consuming grapefruit or grapefruit juice.
    · Smoke or drink alcohol.
    · Engage in sexual activity.
    · Exercise or engage in strenuous activity.

  FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

  Mifepristone

  Mifepristone can significantly increase the risk of death due to sepsis.

Drugs During Pregnancy and Lactation

Drug therapy must be approached cautiously during pregnancy, as some medications may have serious effects for
the pregnant client or the fetus. Medications can be passed to the fetus through the placental membrane. Some
medications are teratogenic, meaning they can cause serious birth defects, especially if given within the first
trimester. The most critical period for fetal development is from conception to day 58-60 when major fetal organs
form. Although some medications can pose risks of harm to the fetus, some maternal conditions such as pregnancy-
induced hypertension or gestational diabetes may also cause harm. The situation must be viewed from a
perspective of risks versus benefits to the birthing parent and fetus/infant. The emphasis for medications that treat
a maternal condition is on choosing the safest drug from a class and monitoring the client more closely. In this way,
the risks can be mitigated, even if not eliminated.
940  36 · Reproductive Health Drugs

     After delivery, special precautions are still needed for clients who are breastfeeding, as some medications can be
     transferred to the infant through breast milk. The National Library of Medicine (NLM) maintains the LactMed®
     database (https://openstax.org/r/ncbinlmnihgov) of drug information on relevant medications that clients who are
     breastfeeding may be exposed to (National Library of Medicine, n.d.). When assessing clients, nurses should
     determine if clients are breastfeeding and review the clients' medications for any potential concerns. Nurses should
     instruct clients to contact their health care provider first before taking any medication while breastfeeding to reduce
     the risk of adverse effects on the infant.

     36.4 Bisphosphonates, Calcium Preparations, Vitamin D, and Estrogen
     Receptor Modulators

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 36.4.1 Identify the characteristics of bisphosphates, calcium, vitamin D, and estrogen receptor modulator
             drugs used to treat osteoporosis.

         · 36.4.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of bisphosphates, calcium,
             vitamin D, and estrogen receptor modulator drugs used to treat osteoporosis.

         · 36.4.3 Describe nursing implications of bisphosphates, calcium, vitamin D, and estrogen receptor
             modulator drugs used to treat osteoporosis.

         · 36.4.4 Explain the client education related to bisphosphates, calcium, vitamin D, and estrogen receptor
             modulator drugs used to treat osteoporosis.

     Bisphosphonates, calcium preparations, vitamin D, and estrogen receptor modulators may seem out of context in
     this chapter; however, they are included because of their effects on postmenopausal clients who no longer produce
     sufficient estrogen and are at increased risk of osteopenia and osteoporosis. Osteopenia is a condition in which
     bone mass is decreased, causing bones to become weaker. Osteoporosis is a condition in which bone mass has
     decreased to the point that bones become brittle and are much more likely to fracture (Fink, 2019; Zareef &
     Jackson, 2021; National Institutes of Health, 2022).

     (See Thyroid and Parathyroid Disorder Drugs for more information regarding bisphosphonates, calcium
     preparations, and vitamin D.)

     Bisphosphonates

     Bisphosphonates are a category of drugs used to prevent and treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal clients. Vitamin
     D and calcium may be used as an adjunct with bisphosphonate therapy. Weight-bearing exercises, such as walking
     for 30 minutes several days a week, should be included as part of client education. Routine bone density testing
     should be scheduled to determine the effectiveness of the drug therapy (Ganesan et al., 2022).

     Table 36.16 lists common bisphosphonates and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Adverse effects of bisphosphonates include decreased serum calcium and serum phosphate levels, arthralgia,
     myalgia, stomach pain, difficulty swallowing, heartburn, and irritation or pain of the esophagus. One major adverse
     effect from bisphosphonate therapy is osteonecrosis of the jaw (Madhumati & Gonegandla, 2020). The

bisphosphonate accumulates in the jaw at a higher rate than in other bones and causes increased new bone
formation. As a result, the older bone lacks sufficient blood supply and begins to die or become necrosed. This
complication occurs more often in clients with cancer and in those who have invasive dental procedures. Thus,
invasive dental procedures should not be performed while a client is receiving bisphosphonates.

Contraindications to bisphosphonates include any esophageal abnormality that prevents adequate and timely
emptying of the stomach. Additionally, bisphosphonates should not be used if the client is unable to sit up or stand

Calcium Preparations

Calcium, the most abundant mineral in the body, is necessary for bone development and bone maintenance. In fact,
about 98% of the body's calcium is stored in the bones. Calcium from food and supplements is absorbed by both
active transport and passive diffusion across the intestinal mucosa. Vitamin D is essential for calcium absorption
and for maintaining adequate calcium levels. Estrogen is also important for maintaining bone health; thus, during
menopause when females produce less estrogen, they have a considerable risk of developing osteopenia and
osteoporosis (National Institutes of Health, 2022).

Food sources of calcium include dairy, salmon, dark green vegetables (broccoli, kale, spinach), and other foods with
high levels of oxalic acid such as sweet potatoes, rhubarb, and beans. Calcium supplements vary widely as to their
source and the amount of calcium contained in the tablets (National Institutes of Health, 2022).

Calcium supplements include calcium acetate, calcium citrate, calcium gluconate, and calcium chloride. Calcium
supplements used to treat osteoporosis and osteopenia are administered orally; dosages depend on the specific
type of calcium supplement being prescribed and the reason for its use. Calcium carbonate and calcium citrate are
942  36 · Reproductive Health Drugs

     the two most common forms of calcium used in supplements. Calcium has varying rates of absorption depending on
     the specific supplement, an individual's level of stomach acid, and the fat content in a meal eaten when a calcium
     supplement is taken. The greater the fat content, the less calcium is absorbed. Calcium gluconate and calcium
     chloride are administered intravenously and used for serious and life-threatening acute hypocalcemia,
     hyperkalemia, and certain cardiac emergencies. See Fluids and Electrolytes, Vitamins, Minerals, and Alternative
     Therapies for more information about calcium and Vitamin D.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Adverse effects of calcium supplements are usually GI related and include abdominal pain, gas, bloating,
     constipation, and nausea. Hypercalcemia can lead to poor muscle tone, renal insufficiency, weight loss, fatigue,
     polyuria, and heart arrhythmias.

     Contraindications and precautions are necessary depending on the client's chronic diseases and other medications
     being taken. Clients with heart disease and renal disease may need closer monitoring of calcium levels. Calcium
     supplements generally decrease stomach acid necessary for the metabolism and absorption of other medications.
     Levothyroxine is one example; it should be taken at least 30 minutes prior to or 2 hours after calcium. So a complete
     medication history is important in planning calcium supplementation.

     Vitamin D

     Along with calcium supplements, vitamin D should be taken either as a separate supplement or included in the
     calcium supplement. The best source of vitamin D is sunlight. The appropriate amount of time for sun exposure is
     determined by the skin type based on Fitzpatrick's skin typing, which ranges from I (fair skin that burns easily) to VI
     (skin that is always tan) (National Institutes of Health, 2022; Sakamoto, 2019; Zareef & Jackson, 2021). The use of
     sunscreen during sun exposure is controversial as far as the effect on vitamin D; however, the client should take care
     to avoid sunburn (AIM at Melanoma Foundation, n.d.).

     Other sources of vitamin D include fatty fish (such as trout, salmon, tuna, and mackerel) and fish liver oils and
     fortified foods such as milk and cereals (National Institutes of Health, 2022).

     Estrogen Receptor Modulators

     Estrogen receptor modulators (ERMs) are not hormones. They are estrogen receptor site agonists or antagonists.
     ERMs possess some of the positive effects of estrogen and have fewer adverse effects. Raloxifene and toremifene
     are the drugs discussed in this section.

     Raloxifene
     Raloxifene is used to prevent and treat postmenopausal osteoporosis by increasing bone density. Contraindications
     include allergy, pregnancy, and lactation. Caution should be used for clients with a history of deep vein thrombosis
     and/or smoking because of the risk of clot development. Adverse effects are like those of estrogen and can include
     skin rash and edema. Raloxifene dosage is 60 mg daily orally.

36.5 Review of the Male Reproductive System

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 36.5.1 Describe the structure and function of the male reproductive system.
    · 36.5.2 Discuss common conditions that affect the male reproductive system.

Structure and Function of the Male Reproductive System

The male reproductive system (also referred to as the testicular reproductive system) is made up of internal and
external organs (see Figure 36.5). The external organs include the scrotum, testes, epididymis, and penis. The
internal organs are the vas deferens, prostate gland, ejaculatory ducts, seminal vesicles, bulbourethral (Cowper's)
glands, and urethra (Betts et al., 2023; Netter, 2022).

The scrotum is a loose, sac-like cavity that holds the testicles and provides a controlled temperature for them since
temperature within the scrotum is lower than in the body itself. The testicles produce sperm, which fertilize an egg
from a female. The epididymis carries the formed sperm into the vas deferens, which then empties the sperm into
the ejaculatory duct in the body of the prostate gland. Two seminal vesicles, one on each side of the prostate, also
empty into the ejaculatory duct. From the ejaculatory duct, the sperm enter the urethra. The bulbourethral
(Cowper's) glands secrete mucus into the urethra, and both the mucus and sperm are carried outside the body
through the urethra. The penis contains sensory nerves that respond to sexual stimulation and cause the penis to
become enlarged and elongated. Contractions of the penis allow the sperm, along with other secretions, to empty
outside the body. The primary target would be the uterus where the sperm fertilizes the egg, creating the embryo
that implants into the uterus and further develops into the fetus (Betts et al., 2023; Netter, 2022). (Refer to Section
36.1.)

     Hormones

     Some of the same hormones that are produced in individuals assigned female at birth are also produced in those
     assigned males at birth, and those include GnRH and the gonadotropins, LH and FSH. As discussed in Review of the
     Female Reproductive System, GnRH is produced in the hypothalamus. When GnRH is secreted, it acts on the
     anterior pituitary to secrete FSH and LH, which regulate sex steroid production from the gonads. In males, the
     gonads are the testes (ovaries in females) which produce testosterone (also considered an androgen). Testicular
     hormones are responsible for the development of male sex organs and secondary sex characteristics, including hair
     distribution (pubic area, axillae, facial, and chest), voice deepening, heavier bone structure, increased hematocrit,
     and fat distribution. Additionally, testosterone can self-limit its own secretion through the negative feedback loop.
     When levels of testosterone are high, feedback to the hypothalamus inhibits the secretion of GnRH. Negative
     feedback to the anterior pituitary renders it less responsive to GnRH stimuli (Casteel & Singh, 2023; Nassar, 2023).

     Andropause

     Andropause occurs with aging and represents a time of decreased production of testosterone, atrophy of interstitial
     cells, and lessened sexual activity. Andropause is comparable to female menopause. The decrease of testosterone
     can produce depression, fat redistribution, and decreased libido. Not all male clients experience andropause.

36.6 Androgens, Antiandrogens, and Anabolic Steroids

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 36.6.1 Identify the characteristics of androgen, antiandrogen, and anabolic steroid drugs used to treat
        reproductive disorders.

    · 36.6.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of androgen, antiandrogen,
        and anabolic steroid drugs used to treat reproductive disorders.

    · 36.6.3 Describe nursing implications of androgen, antiandrogen, and anabolic steroid drugs used to treat
        reproductive disorders.

    · 36.6.4 Explain the client education related to androgen, antiandrogen, and anabolic steroid drugs used to
        treat reproductive disorders.

Androgens, antiandrogens, and anabolic steroids drugs are natural and synthetic forms of testicular hormones. They
are used to treat hypogonadism, delayed male puberty, and some types of female breast cancer. They can also be
used off-label for stimulation of appetite and to increase muscle mass in malignancy and acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (Ganesan et al., 2023).

Androgens

Androgens are sex hormones. Testosterone is the primary androgen and is produced in the testes. The other
androgens are produced in the adrenal glands. Testosterone is responsible for the growth and development of male
sex organs and the secondary sex characteristics such as voice deepening, hair distribution, and redistribution of
muscle and fat. It also contributes to bone growth, red blood cell production, decreased excretion of calcium in the
urine, and the retention of sodium, potassium, and phosphorous.

Hypogonadism is the condition where the testes are undeveloped and fail to produce androgen, sperm, or both.
Males with hypogonadism do not experience puberty. Delayed puberty is when the sex characteristics do not
develop at the expected time in puberty. Clients experiencing either condition may need exogenous hormone
therapy to develop sex organs and secondary sex characteristics.

The prototype androgen is testosterone. It comes in oral, parenteral, topical, implantable, and buccal forms. Dosage
and frequency vary depending on the form of the drug and the individual need of the client. Table 36.20 lists
common androgens and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

Drug                 Routes and Dosage Ranges

    Testosterone     Male hypogonadism/delayed puberty:
(Depo-testosterone,  Depo-testosterone: 50-400 mg intramuscularly every 2-4 weeks.
                     Androderm: 4 mg/day transdermal patch (adjusted per serum testosterone
     Androderm)      concentration).

Fluoxymesterone      Male hypogonadism/delayed puberty: 5-20 mg daily orally.
   (Halotestin)      Breast cancer treatment in postmenopausal females: 10-40 mg/day orally.

Methyltestosterone   Hypogonadism, delayed puberty in males: 10-50 mg daily orally.

(Methitest)          Breast cancer treatment in postmenopausal females: 50-200 mg/day orally.

TABLE 36.20 Drug Emphasis Table: Androgens (source: https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/)

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
The adverse effects of testosterone for males include gynecomastia, prolonged penile erections, and decreased
ejaculatory volume. For females taking testosterone for advanced breast cancer, side effects are generally related to
masculinization--voice deepening, clitoral enlargement, and hirsutism. Menstrual irregularities and amenorrhea may
develop in premenopausal clients.

Androgens are contraindicated in hypersensitivity to the drug, male breast and prostate cancer, and serious cardiac,
hepatic, or renal disease. Additionally, testosterone must be used cautiously in prepubescent clients because of the
possibility of early bone maturation and early closure of the epiphyseal growth plates. This condition can lead to
stunted growth. When young clients are on testosterone therapy, they need radiographs every 6 months to monitor
bone maturation.
948  36 · Reproductive Health Drugs

     Clients with preexisting gynecomastia may have a worsening of the condition. Older clients may have an increased
     risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer. Clients with BPH may develop urethral obstruction.
     Testosterone is contraindicated for pregnant clients because it can cause masculinization of the female fetus, and
     the risks of the drug outweigh the potential benefits for pregnant clients. See Urinary and Bladder Disorder Drugs for
     more about BPH and its treatment.

     Antiandrogens
     Antiandrogens are medications that compete with testosterone for androgen-receptor binding sites; in other words,
     they work against androgens and testosterone. Antiandrogens either prevent these hormones from binding to
     proteins in the target cells or decrease the amount of a hormone produced. Antiandrogens are used to treat
     advanced prostate cancer. Bicalutamide is the primary medication used. It should be taken in combination with a
     gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog to treat metastatic prostate cancer.

     Antiandrogens are frequently used in combination with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs to treat advanced
     prostate cancer (Freedland & Abrahamsson, 2021). These two groups of medications have different mechanisms of
     action, but both decrease testosterone to nonexistent levels comparable to surgical castration.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Contraindications for the use of antiandrogens are allergy to the drug or its components and liver dysfunction or
     elevated liver enzymes. The adverse effects of antiandrogens include gynecomastia, breast pain, hot flashes,

Anabolic Steroids
Anabolic steroids are analogues of testosterone developed for use in tissue building in conditions such as illness or
surgery that have caused significant wasting of tissue, weight loss, and depletion of red blood cells. Oxandrolone is
the primary anabolic steroid. It is indicated for weight gain and cancer treatment. The dosage for oxandrolone is 2.5
mg-20 mg, two to four times daily, administered orally.

Both androgens and anabolic steroids stimulate protein synthesis in skeletal muscle and thus increase the buildup
of cellular tissue. They also stimulate increased production of red blood cells. For those reasons, androgens and
anabolic steroids are used in clients who are debilitated by chronic illnesses (e.g., cancer, HIV, anemias), trauma,
long-term steroid use, or surgery in order to increase muscle mass, gain weight, repair tissue, and increase red
blood cell count (Ganesan et al., 2023).

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
In general, anabolic steroids can cause electrolyte imbalances, liver damage, insomnia, weight gain, acne,
depression, anxiety, aggression, increased cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels, hypertension, and
changes in the structure of the left ventricle of the heart (DailyMed, Oxandrolone tablet, 2022).

The adverse effects in prepubertal clients include phallic enlargement, hirsutism, and increased skin pigmentation.
In postpubertal clients, side effects can include decreased testicular function and testicular atrophy, gynecomastia,
priapism, baldness, and changes in libido. Prostate problems, especially in older clients, may also be a side effect of
950  36 · Reproductive Health Drugs

     these drugs. Female clients may experience hirsutism, voice deepening, clitoral enlargement, baldness, reduced
     breast volume, and menstrual irregularities (DailyMed, Oxandrolone tablet, 2022).

     These medications are contraindicated in allergy to the drug, pregnancy and lactation, liver or coronary heart
     disease, nephrosis, hypercalcemia, and breast or prostate cancer in males (DailyMed, Oxandrolone tablet, 2022).

     All anabolic steroids are DEA Schedule III drugs; however, anabolic steroids and testosterone have been misused by
     many athletes, both professional and amateur, for the purposes of bodybuilding and enhancing physical
     performance in sports (Chegeni et al., 2021; Ganesan et al., 2023; Schneider et al., 2020). These drugs are not
     approved to be used for bodybuilding or enhancing physical performance and, thus, are not prescribed by health
     care professionals for those purposes, nor are they permitted by athletic competition boards.

36.7 Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 36.7.1 Identify the characteristics of phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor drugs used to treat erectile
        dysfunction.

    · 36.7.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of phosphodiesterase 5
        inhibitor drugs used to treat erectile dysfunction.

    · 36.7.3 Describe nursing implications of phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor drugs used to treat erectile
        dysfunction.

    · 36.7.4 Explain the client education related to phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor drugs used to treat erectile
        dysfunction.

Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are used to treat erectile dysfunction. PDE5 is an enzyme located within
the walls of blood vessels that impacts blood flow. PDE5 inhibitors prevent the PDE5 enzyme from functioning,
which results in the relaxation of the blood vessels and increased blood flow. PDE5 inhibitors work in cases when
blood flow to the corpus cavernosum is inadequate, such as in aging or due to vascular or neurological problems.
However, these medications cannot be used for every cause of erectile dysfunction, and they do have serious side
effects if taken incorrectly, such as taking more than one dose in 24 hours or taking with nitroglycerin. Sildenafil,
tadalafil, avanafil, and vardenafil are the common PDE inhibitors. (Use of PDE5 inhibitors for treating benign
prostatic hyperplasia is discussed in Urinary and Bladder Disorder Drugs).

Table 36.24 lists common PDE5 inhibitors and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

Drug                                   Routes and Dosage Ranges

Sildenafil  50 mg orally, as needed, approximately 60 minutes before sexual activity.
 (Viagra)   Dose range: 25-100 mg. Maximum of 1 dose/day.

Tadalafil   10 mg orally, as needed, approximately 60 minutes before sexual activity. Dose range: 5-20 mg.
 (Cialis)   Maximum of 1 dose/day.

Avanafil    100 mg orally, as needed, as early as approximately 15 minutes before sexual activity.
(Stendra)   Dose range: 50-200 mg. Maximum of 1 dose/day.

  Vardenafil 10 mg orally, as needed, approximately 60 minutes before sexual activity. Dose range: 5-20 mg.
   (Levitra) Maximum of 1 dose/day.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications

Contraindications for PDE5 inhibitors include the concomitant use of nitrates or alpha-adrenergic blockers,
medications often prescribed for cardiovascular problems. The drug interaction can cause life-threatening
hypotension and death. Another contraindication is any obstructive condition or anatomical deformation of the
penis (DailyMed, Viagra, 2019; Dhaliwal & Gupta, 2023).

Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the nonmalignant enlargement of the prostate gland. This condition usually
begins in mid-life and increases in prevalence as male individuals age. Studies have reported that about 8% of
males in the fourth decade of life have BPH. That number increases significantly to about 50% in the sixth decade of
life and 80% in the ninth decade of life (GBD 2019 Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Collaborators, 2022; Ng & Barahdi,
2022). Two primary classes of medications used to treat BPH are alpha blockers and 5-alpha-reductase
inhibitors.

BPH is also associated with complications such as urinary tract infection, acute urinary retention, urolithiasis, and
acute renal failure as well as impacting other aspects of life, such as sleep quality, mood, social and sexual well-
being, and safety related to increased falls (GBD 2019 Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Collaborators, 2022).

Alpha Blockers

Alpha blockers are indicated to treat BPH. They work by relaxing the smooth muscle of the bladder neck and
prostate to allow for an easier flow of urine. Alpha blockers include alfuzosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin, silodosin, and
terazosin. Clients with smaller prostates often experience results more quickly.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Adverse effects might include dizziness and hypotension, especially when combined with other drugs that lower
     blood pressure. Retrograde ejaculation may occur, a harmless condition in which semen goes back into the bladder
     instead of out the tip of the penis. Other adverse effects include priapism, somnolence, dry mouth, dyspnea, fatigue,
     palpitations, headache, upper respiratory infections, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, constipation, nausea, and
     impotence.

     Since clients with BPH could have coexisting erectile dysfunction, they may also take PDE5 inhibitors. Concomitant
     use of alpha blockers and PDE5 inhibitors can cause a severe drop in blood pressure. Additionally, signs and
     symptoms of prostate cancer and BPH are similar. Thus, ruling out cancer as the underlying issue is a priority before
     initiating alpha blockers.

     5-Alpha-Reductase Inhibitors

     The 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors such as finasteride and dutasteride block conversion of testosterone to
     dihydrotestosterone, resulting in shrinkage of the prostate gland. Improvement is not seen until the client has been
     on the medication for several weeks. Maximum results should occur about 6 months after the start of treatment.
     The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) can be decreased about 50%, and the prostate volume may be reduced by as
     much as 25% (Ng & Baradhi, 2022; Salisbury & Tadi, 2023).

     Indications for 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors are BPH and male pattern baldness, but this section focuses only on

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Adverse effects related to 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors include erectile dysfunction, decreased ejaculatory volume,
decreased libido, gynecomastia, orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and weakness. Dutasteride may be combined
with an alpha blocker to enhance the treatment of BPH. If so, the client has a greater chance of experiencing
orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and weakness.

Nursing Implications

The nurse should do the following for clients using alpha blockers or 5-alpha reductase inhibitors:

· Conduct history and physical to determine any underlying condition, such as prostate cancer, that should be
   treated first. Also determine other medical conditions that may be impacting urological health (diabetes,
   cardiovascular, obesity, etc.).

· Obtain medication history, noting any medications that may interact with alpha blockers or alpha reductase
   inhibitors (drugs that may cause hypotension or dizziness).

· Obtain necessary laboratory and diagnostic testing.
· Assess smoking and alcohol use.
· Assess balance and alertness because hypotension and dizziness are side effects of both alpha blockers and

   alpha reductase inhibitors. Somnolence is a side effect of alpha blockers.
· Provide emotional support and resources for client.
· Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client
958  36 · Reproductive Health Drugs

          teaching guidelines.

     CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

     The client taking an alpha blocker or a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor should:

         · Understand the medication's purpose, side effects, contraindications, and precautions. Take alpha blocker
             medications ½ hour following the same meal each day (either breakfast or dinner/evening meal).

         · Understand the risks to females, especially pregnant females, of handling crushed or broken tablets
             (5-alpha-reductase inhibitors).

         · Monitor any signs and symptoms of adverse effects and report them to the health care provider.
         · Know how to manage the side effects of specific 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor therapy, especially related to

             safety (risk of falls).
         · Know how to manage the side effects of specific alpha blocker therapy (dizziness, priapism, hypotension).
         · Verbalize the importance of follow-up appointments to manage the medication regimen and to observe for

             adverse effects.
         · Understand drug, food, and/or herbal interactions that could be harmful.
         · Use caution when driving, operating machinery, or performing other tasks requiring alertness when taking

             alpha blockers.

     The client taking an alpha blocker or a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor should not:

         · Change position quickly when taking alpha blockers to minimize the risk of postural hypotension,
             especially when taking other medications that lower blood pressure.

         · Not allow females of childbearing age to handle 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors, especially if the tablets are
             crushed or broken.

INTRODUCTION Transgender and nonbinary health care encompasses many aspects. This chapter begins by listing
and defining some of the preferred terms used to refer to transgender and nonbinary individuals. An important issue
for nurses and other health care professionals to remember is that each transgender or nonbinary individual may
have their own preferred words. Therefore, an important first step in caring for these clients is finding out what
those words are.
This chapter then introduces the medications used to enhance or modify sexual characteristics including nursing
implications and client education. Some of the medications in this chapter are also covered in Reproductive Health
Drugs, but this chapter focuses on their use for adjusting sexual characteristics.

37.1 Overview of Transgender and Nonbinary Health

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 37.1.1 Differentiate among terms related to gender identity.
    · 37.1.2 Identify clinical manifestations related to gender dysphoria.
Often, gender nonconforming individuals do not experience health care access in an accepting, nonthreatening,
affirming, and supportive climate. In fact, some individuals have been so traumatized by their experiences that they
forgo important medical care and preventive services. Numerous articles (Brooker & Loshak, 2020; Dickerson,
2022; Gonzales & Henning-Smith, 2017; Kinney & Cosgrove, 2022; Kirkland et al., 2021; Milionis et al., 2022; Sirufo
et al., 2022) discuss barriers and challenges to adequate and sensitive health care for gender nonconforming
964  37 · Transgender and Nonbinary Drugs

     individuals. The full range of barriers and challenges are too numerous to recount in this chapter; however, all health
     care professionals, whether they work exclusively within the transgender and nonbinary population or in general
     health care settings, should be knowledgeable about the various needs of the transgender and nonbinary
     population.

     Additionally, a self-assessment concerning personal bias and beliefs about transgender and nonbinary individuals is
     necessary for any health care professional who interacts with these particular clients. Understanding one's own
     beliefs and feelings, and acknowledging any bias or prejudice, is the first step in a nurse's acceptance of transgender
     and nonbinary individuals' decisions. Being respectful and professional is important for creating and maintaining a
     trusting relationship with transgender and nonbinary clients (Barredo, 2020).

     Terms Related to Gender Identity

     Gender identity describes a person's deeply held beliefs about which, if any, gender they identify with--man,
     woman, gender fluid, or nonbinary. A person's gender identity is not always the same as the sex assigned at birth
     and is not always related to an individual's sexual organs or sex characteristics. Instead, it refers to how an
     individual sees themselves and presents themselves to others as male and/or female.

     The following terms are used to discuss gender-related topics. Individual clients will have their own terms to
     describe themselves, and the nurse must clarify those with each client. A client may find some terms to be
     offensive, and their use would compromise trust in the nurse-client relationship (Annie E. Casey Foundation, 2023;
     Barredo, 2020; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023; International Society for Sexual Medicine, n.d.;
     National Center for Transgender Equality, 2016; Rafferty et al., 2018; T'Sjoen et al., 2019).

         · Gender dysphoria a deep sense of unease, anxiety, or discomfort that may occur in people whose gender
             does not align with their sex assigned at birth.

         · Gender expression refers to ways in which a person outwardly expresses their gender identity. Gender
             expression includes behavior, clothing, body characteristics, and/or voice. Gender expression may or may not
             conform to what is considered socially acceptable male and female behaviors and characteristics.

         · Gender fluid refers to a person who does not identify with a single fixed gender or has an unfixed gender
             identity.

         · Nonbinary is used to describe individuals whose gender identity does not fit into the man-woman dichotomy
             and who do not identify with one gender over another. The term may be used to include individuals who are
             gender fluid and/or transgender.

         · Transgender is a broad term used by individuals whose sex assigned at birth does not match their gender
             identity. Some transgender individuals are assigned male at birth but identify as a woman; others are assigned
             female at birth but identify as a man. Some transgender individuals do not identify strongly as a man or a
             woman, or they may identify as a combination of both genders. Some transgender individuals choose to have
             medical treatment to physically transition into the gender with which they identify; others choose not to
             undergo treatment. The male-to-female (MTF) and female-to-male (FTM) abbreviations are used in this
             chapter to refer to the procedure of transitioning.

         · The term transsexual is an older term that may be interchangeable with the term transgender; however,
             transsexual has different meanings depending on the individual's preference, the cultural context, societal
             norms, and the historical meaning of the word. In addition, transsexual can be used by some to identify
             individuals who have undergone medical treatment and surgery to make their bodies physically match the
             gender with which they identify.

         · Cisgender describes individuals whose sex assigned at birth and gender identity are congruent. A cisgender
             person assigned male at birth identifies as a man, and a cisgender person assigned female at birth identifies
             as a woman.

     Clinical Manifestations of Gender Dysphoria

     Gender dysphoria is a medical diagnosis that describes the condition of an individual who is experiencing social and
     mental distress because of gender identity issues. The feelings may range from unease to severe distress and can
     impair the individual's ability to function in society. Going to school, work, and other social events can be associated
     with fear and anxiety about harassment or mistreatment (Klein, 2023; Matsuda, 2022; National Center for
     Transgender Equality, 2016; Selby, 2022). The individual feels that their sex assigned at birth is incongruent with

their gender identity. These individuals are often adolescents or young adults who have faced a great deal of socially
negative experiences because they do not identify with the sex that was assigned to them at birth. Zaliznyak et al.
(2020) collected data from more than 200 transgender individuals and found that gender dysphoria tends to start
very early in life. Among their study participants, the earliest memories of gender dysphoria generally began around
4 1/2 years of age, with the majority of participants experiencing gender dysphoria memories by age 7.

Gender dysphoria does not occur in every transgender individual, nor is every person who experiences gender
dysphoria transgender (National Center for Transgender Equality, 2016). For those who do experience gender
dysphoria, typical manifestations include depression, anger, anxiety, body aversion, posttraumatic stress disorder,
hopelessness, violence, self-harm, and suicide. Some individuals with gender dysphoria may dress differently,
change their name to match their perceived gender, and make other outward changes that are congruent with their
gender identity (Klein, 2023; Matsuda, 2022; National Center for Transgender Equality, 2016; Selby, 2022).

Supporting Intersex People

Intersex is a general term used to describe people whose sex traits, reproductive anatomy, hormones, or
chromosomes are different from the usual two ways human bodies develop. Some intersex traits are recognized at
birth, while others are not recognizable until puberty or later in life. Intersex people and transgender people are not
the same (and they are not interchangeable terms); many transgender people have no intersex traits, and many
intersex people do not consider themselves transgender. Furthermore, most recent literature refers to the atypical
conditions themselves as "differences of sex development," (DSD); nurses may find relevant guidance and evidence
with that terminology, even though many intersex people do not use it to refer to themselves and some reject the
terminology (Sandberg, 2022; Davis, 2013).

Most in the nursing, medical, and intersex community reject unnecessary surgeries intended to make a baby
conform to a specific gender assignment (Behrens, 2020). If a physical trait or medical condition prohibits a baby
from urinating or performing another bodily function (which is very rare), surgery may be needed. In other cases,
intersex people may require hormonal therapies similar to those described below. Treatment of intersex clients,
especially adolescents and adults, can be complex: Diagnoses, decisions, and therapies may have implications
regarding the client's gender identity, gender role behavior, and sexual functioning, as well as physical and
psychological outcomes (Sandberg, 2022; Warne, 2005).

Hormonal Therapy Guidelines for Transgender and Nonbinary Clients

Drug therapy of any kind is affected by several factors, including gender at birth, transgender status, weight, and
overall health. Renal and liver cytochrome expression, renal or liver disease, age, and gastric pH also affect
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Webb et al. (2020) explored the literature regarding drug dosing for
transgender individuals. In some cases, the dosing was comparable; for example, a transgender male's
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were like those of a cisgender male, and drug dosing could be the same.
However, appropriate dosing also depended on the length of time an individual had been on hormonal therapy.
Thus, the nurse must ensure that any transgender client has been properly assessed for these factors and
communicate this information to the health care provider, pharmacist, and other health care professionals as
needed.

37.2 Feminizing Hormonal Therapy

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 37.2.1 Identify the characteristics of feminizing hormonal drugs used for transgender and nonbinary
        therapy.

    · 37.2.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of feminizing hormonal drugs
        used for transgender and nonbinary therapy.

    · 37.2.3 Describe nursing implications of feminizing hormonal drugs used for transgender and nonbinary
        therapy.

    · 37.2.4 Explain the client education related to feminizing hormonal drugs used for transgender and
        nonbinary therapy.
966  37 · Transgender and Nonbinary Drugs

     The hormones used for female reproductive health, which are covered in Reproductive Health Drugs, are also
     discussed in this chapter; complete information for the drugs can be found there. Discussion in this chapter focuses
     on use of the medications for developing female secondary sex characteristics in individuals who were assigned
     male at birth and choose to undergo male-to-female (MTF) transition. These sex characteristics include fat
     redistribution around the hips, skin softening and decreased oiliness, growth of breast tissue, decreased muscle
     mass and strength, loss of facial hair, decreased libido and ejaculation volume, and decreased testicle size (Figure
     37.2). The adverse effects of female hormone therapy are related to cardiovascular conditions such as myocardial
     infarction, stroke, and thromboembolic events. However, studies of transgender individuals are still limited in
     number, and more research is needed to explore the effects of female hormones on male clients (Deutsch, 2016;
     Hembree et al., 2017; Ramsay & Safer, 2023; Unger, 2016). Further transition would include surgery to remove the
     testes, as well as other feminizing surgical procedures (Mount Sinai, n.d.-b).

     Spironolactone

     Spironolactone is a nonspecific aldosterone blocker. Its primary use is as a potassium-sparing diuretic to manage
     hypertension. However, its action of blocking male sex hormone receptors, the androgen receptors, decreases the
     production of testosterone, the male hormone responsible for secondary sex characteristics (DailyMed
     Spironolactone, 2023; Deutsch, 2016; Hembree et al., 2017; Mayo Clinic, 2021a; Ramsay & Safer, 2023; Unger,
     2016). Spironolactone is used for 4-8 weeks alone, and then estrogen is usually added. Spironolactone can cause
     impotence and gynecomastia (breast tissue enlargement) in males, a desired effect for males transitioning to
     females.
     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Contraindications include allergy to the drug, hyperkalemia, renal disease, and anuria (absent urine production and
     output). The primary adverse effect is hyperkalemia, which could be life-threatening and must be monitored closely.
     Hyperkalemia may manifest as lethargy, confusion, ataxia, muscle cramps, cardiac dysrhythmias (irregular heart
     rhythms), or gastrointestinal symptoms (DailyMed, Spironolactone, 2023; Unger, 2016).
     Table 37.1 is a drug prototype table for spironolactone. It lists drug class, mechanism of action, adult dosage,

SAFETY ALERT

Spironolactone

Spironolactone may cause hyperkalemia because it is a potassium-sparing medication. The nurse should monitor
the client's potassium levels and cardiac and renal function. Potassium may be found in intravenous fluids, salt
substitutes, and some fruits and vegetables (including oranges, bananas, raisins and other dried fruits, and dark
green and yellow vegetables).

Estrogen

The purpose of estrogen is to continue the development of secondary female sex characteristics. Estrogen works
through a negative feedback loop to suppress gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary gland and results in reduced
androgen production. Usually, estrogen alone will not achieve sufficient androgen control. Thus, antiandrogenic
therapy, in the form of spironolactone, may need to be added to the client's medication regimen. Although this may
seem contrary to the information regarding spironolactone--that is, starting spironolactone first and then adding
estrogen--both regimens are acceptable. The specific medication regimen depends on the individual's needs
(Deutsch, 2016; Hembree et al., 2017; Mayo Clinic, 2021a; Ramsay & Safer, 2023; Unger, 2016).

Clients will notice the onset of these characteristics: smaller testicles; fewer erections and a decrease in ejaculation;
decreased libido; decreased male pattern baldness; breast development; softer, less oily skin; less muscle mass;
and more body fat. These changes will usually begin 1-6 months after treatment starts. The full effect will take 2-3
years (Deutsch, 2016; Hembree et al., 2017; Mayo Clinic, 2021a; Ramsay & Safer, 2023; T'Sjoen et al., 2019; Unger,
2016).

Estradiol is the most potent form of estrogen and is naturally produced in the body. Estradiol is extremely beneficial
prior to menopause and for use as postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy. It provides significant protection
against cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. It has been shown to work well in MTF transgender therapy also.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     A major contraindication for estrogen is a personal or family history of blood clots in the leg (deep vein thromboses)
     or lungs (pulmonary emboli). Estrogen should be used cautiously in clients who smoke, have obesity, or have
     hypertension (Mayo Clinic, 2021a; T'Sjoen et al., 2019; Unger, 2016).

     Adverse effects of estrogen can include major cardiovascular problems (cardiac disease, elevated cholesterol,
     stroke, and hypertension), elevated prolactin levels, nipple discharge, and infertility (Mayo Clinic, 2021a; Milionis et
     al., 2022; T'Sjoen et al., 2019; Unger, 2016).

Progesterone

Progesterone is a hormone that is classified as a progestin and aids in the development of secondary female sexual
characteristics. Progestins are metabolized by the liver and excreted in urine. Contraindications, precautions, and
adverse events are similar to those for estrogen. (See Reproductive Health Drugs for more information about
progesterone).

Progesterone can cause fluid retention and may adversely affect conditions that are worsened by fluid retention,
including cardiovascular and renal diseases, asthma, and migraine headaches (DailyMed, Medroxyprogesterone,
2020). Clients undergoing MTF transition sometimes request progesterone to enhance breast enlargement.
However, because there is no evidence that this is effective and because this treatment involves risks, progesterone
therapy is not routinely used in transgender treatment (Hembree et al., 2017; T'Sjoen et al., 2019).

Table 37.4 is a drug prototype table for progesterone in the context of MTF transition treatment. It lists drug class,
mechanism of action, adult dosage, indications, therapeutic effects, drug and food interactions, adverse effects, and
contraindications. Most information regarding the use of progesterone in MTF transgender treatment is inconclusive
because few studies have been conducted in this context (Deutsch, 2016; Hembree et al., 2017; Milionis et al.,

     FDA BLACK BOX WARNING

     Estrogen Plus Progestin Therapy

     The Women's Health Initiative (https://openstax.org/r/whi) studies demonstrated an increased risk of invasive
     breast cancer in clients treated with estrogen plus progestin therapy.

     Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Analogs

     The action of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs decreases the amount of testosterone produced,
     which lessens the development of male secondary sex characteristics. GnRH analogs have been used for
     transitioning transgender adults. They may allow the client to reduce the dose of estrogen and eliminate
     spironolactone from the treatment regimen. However, GnRH analogs tend to be more expensive than spironolactone
     and may not be covered by medical insurance. Additionally, GnRH analogs require repeated injections or multiple
     daily nasal sprays. For these reasons, GnRH analogs may not be the best choice for some clients (Deutsch, 2016;
     Hembree et al., 2017; Hruz, 2020).

     One of the primary benefits of GnRH analog therapy is that once therapy is discontinued, the sex characteristics of
     the sex assigned at birth return. Therefore, a client who decides not to pursue transgender treatment will not have
     permanent changes to their body (Hembree et al., 2017; Hruz, 2020).

     On the other hand, few studies have been completed regarding the use of GnRH analogs. Thus, some of the long-
     term effects, adverse effects, exact dosing, and best administration method have not been determined. Adverse
     effects that appear to be related to GnRH analog therapy include decreased bone density, diminished adult height,
     and impaired spatial memory (Hembree et al., 2017; Hruz, 2020).

Finasteride

Finasteride is a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor essential for the development of male sex characteristics before birth,
such as the formation of external genitalia. It acts to inhibit the conversion of testosterone to 5-alpha-
dihydrotestosterone. Finasteride does not block the production or action of testosterone. Thus, it has less
antiandrogenic effect than spironolactone does (DailyMed, Finasteride, 2018; T'Sjoen et al., 2019). However, it is a
good choice for individuals who are unable to take spironolactone because of contraindications or other physiologic
concerns or who lack the finances or insurance coverage to obtain spironolactone (Deutsch, 2016; Unger, 2016).

The therapeutic effects of finasteride in the context of MTF transition are the same as the adverse effects when it is
used for male pattern hair loss. It results in decreased libido, decreased ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, and breast
enlargement. The daily dose is 1-5 mg orally. Finasteride has no confirmed drug or food interactions (DailyMed,
Finasteride, 2018); T'Sjoen et al., 2019; Unger, 2016).

   SAFETY ALERT

Finasteride

Females of childbearing age, particularly those who are pregnant, should not handle finasteride, especially if the
tablets are broken. The medication can be absorbed and negatively affect genital development in a male fetus.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Finasteride is contraindicated for use in female clients and during pregnancy. Additionally, those who are pregnant
should not handle crushed or broken pills because finasteride can cause abnormalities of the external genitalia in a
male fetus. Adverse effects may include breast tenderness, testicular pain, depression, breast cancer, and liver
toxicity (DailyMed, Finasteride, 2018; Unger, 2016).

     CLINICAL TIP

     Target for Hormone Therapy

     A reasonable target for hormone therapy for transgender female clients is to reduce testosterone levels to the
     typical range of 30-100 ng/dL found in cisgender female individuals without producing an above-normal level of
     estradiol (less than 200 pg/mL). This is accomplished by administering an antiandrogen and estrogen.

     (Source: Boston University, n.d.)

     Nursing Implications

     The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking feminizing hormones:

         · Assess baseline health, including underlying medical conditions, current medications, and pertinent
             laboratory and diagnostic results.

         · Be cognizant of the client's feelings, values, and culture in order to render sensitive care.
         · Monitor for feminizing and adverse effects every 3 months for the first year and then every 6-12 months and

             as needed for problems.
         · Monitor serum testosterone and estradiol levels at follow-up visits, with a practical target in the female range

             (testosterone, 30-100 ng/dL; estradiol, less than 200 pg/mL).
         · Monitor prolactin and triglyceride levels before the client starts hormone therapy and at follow-up visits.
         · Monitor potassium levels if the client is taking spironolactone.
         · Perform bone mineral density screening before the client starts hormone therapy if they are at risk for

             osteoporosis. Otherwise, start screening at age 60 or, if sex hormone levels are consistently low, earlier.
         · Screen MTF clients for breast and prostate cancer appropriately.
         · Ensure that the client understands issues related to family planning and has had an opportunity to meet with a

             family planning specialist to discuss options because of the fertility-related effects of these drugs. Resources
             are available for various options, such as freezing sperm or donating sperm to a partner or another person who
             will carry a pregnancy.

 · Ensure that the client is aware of and has access to resources such as community organizations, specialty
     clinics and hospitals, and support groups.

 · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client
     teaching guidelines.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking a feminizing hormone should:

    · Know the names, actions, effects, side effects, contraindications, precautions, and drug and food
        interactions related to their medications.

    · Understand the schedule for medication administration: time, dosage, and route.
    · Understand the importance of keeping all medications away from children.
    · Be able to self-administer parenteral or transdermal medications.
    · Notify the health care provider regarding any serious or particularly uncomfortable adverse effects,

        including hives, swelling of the lips or mouth, severe mood changes, irregular heart rhythm, muscle
        cramps, and seizures.
    · Be aware of fertility considerations and the available options.
    · Continue to attend wellness visits and schedule routine diagnostic procedures such as for prostate and
        breast cancer prevention.
    · Be aware of community resources for transgender individuals such as health care and support groups.

     37.3 Masculinizing Hormonal Therapy

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you should be able to:

         · 37.3.1 Identify the characteristics of masculinizing hormonal drugs used for transgender and nonbinary
             therapy.

         · 37.3.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of masculinizing hormonal
             drugs used for transgender and nonbinary therapy.

         · 37.3.3 Describe nursing implications of masculinizing hormonal drugs used for transgender and
             nonbinary therapy.

         · 37.3.4 Explain the client education related to masculinizing hormonal drugs used for transgender and
             nonbinary therapy.

     The hormones used for reproductive health, covered in Reproductive Health Drugs, are also discussed in this
     chapter; complete information for the drugs can be found there. Discussion in this chapter focuses on use of the
     medications to develop male secondary sex characteristics in individuals who were assigned female at birth and
     choose to undergo female-to-male (FTM) transition. Further transition would include chest masculinization surgery,
     hysterectomy, and creation of external male genitalia (Mount Sinai, n.d.-a).

     The overall effects of masculinizing hormonal drugs on the female body include the growth of facial hair and
     increased body hair, deepening of the voice, redistribution of subcutaneous fat, increased muscle mass, hairline
     recession, and, possibly, male pattern baldness (Figure 37.3). Sexual and gonadal effects include an increase in
     libido, clitoral growth, vaginal dryness, and cessation of menses (Deutsch, 2016; Hembree et al., 2017; Mayo Clinic,
     2021b; Unger, 2016).

     Although male hormone therapy produces some of the secondary male characteristics in females who are
     transitioning to males, it also has adverse effects that may be problematic. Possible complications include weight
     gain, acne, male pattern baldness, sleep apnea, elevated cholesterol, hypertension, polycythemia, type 2 diabetes,
     infertility, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, increased risk for heart disease, drying and thinning of the
     vaginal lining, pelvic pain, and clitoral discomfort (Mayo Clinic, 2021b).

     One major consideration for any transgender male is the danger the hormones pose to a fetus. Testosterone in
     particular is teratogenic, but other hormones are as well (Rodriguez-Wallberg et al., 2022). Thus, the nurse must
     ensure that a female client transitioning to male has had a negative pregnancy test.

Androgens

Androgens are a group of male hormones, including testosterone. They can be endogenous (produced in the body)
or synthetic (developed in a laboratory). All forms of androgens assist with the development of male secondary sex
characteristics (Deutsch, 2016; Hembree et al., 2017; Mayo Clinic, 2021b; T'Sjoen et al., 2019; Unger, 2016). In the
case of FTM transition, synthetic androgens must be administered exogenously because the female body does not
produce them.

Androgens increase the retention of nitrogen, sodium, potassium, and phosphorous and decrease the urinary
excretion of calcium. Therefore, a female client transitioning to male should be evaluated for any underlying
condition that would be affected by increased levels of these electrolytes, primarily cardiac and renal disorders
(DailyMed, Testosterone cypionate, 2018).

   SAFETY ALERT

Androgens and Diabetic Medication

Androgens can decrease blood glucose levels in clients with diabetes. Dosages of insulin and other hypoglycemic
medications must be monitored and possibly decreased to prevent dangerous hypoglycemic events.
(Source: DailyMed, Testopel, 2018)

Danazol
Danazol is a synthetic androgen that inhibits pituitary gonadotropins and in turn suppresses ovarian response to the
pituitary. Danazol has weak properties and acts similarly to testosterone. In females it causes masculinization
effects. Generally, the pituitary-suppressive action of danazol is reversible.

Contraindications to danazol include hypersensitivity; undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding; markedly impaired
hepatic, renal, or cardiac function; pregnancy; breastfeeding; androgen-dependent tumor; and active thrombosis or
thromboembolic disease or a history of such events. Danazol may cause some fluid retention, so it should be used
cautiously in clients with conditions that may be affected by excess fluid, including epilepsy, migraine, cardiac or
renal dysfunction, polycythemia, and hypertension. Danazol should also be used with caution inclients with diabetes
(DailyMed, Danazol, 2023).

Testosterone
Testosterone is a hormone responsible for the development of male sex organs and secondary sex characteristics.
These characteristics include the male pattern of hair distribution (pubic area, axillae, face, and chest), deepening of
the voice, heavier bone structure, increased hematocrit, and differences in fat distribution (T'Sjoen et al., 2019).
Testosterone undecanoate is an androgen and anabolic steroid medication used mainly to treat low testosterone
levels in male clients. It is also used to promote secondary sex characteristics in females transitioning to males
(DailyMed, Aveed, 2021; T'Sjoen et al., 2019).

A realistic target for hormone therapy for FTM transition is to administer testosterone until testosterone levels are
within the typical male physiologic range (320-1000 ng/dL).

Table 37.7 lists common forms of testosterone and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

     Fluoxymesterone and Methyltestosterone

     Fluoxymesterone and methyltestosterone are anabolic steroids. Their use in FTM transition is to assist in the
     development of secondary male sex characteristics. Contraindications and precautions include pregnancy; diabetes;
     and liver, renal, or cardiac disease. Adverse effects include acne, heart or blood vessel problems, stroke, liver
     problems, mental or mood problems, and infertility. For more information regarding anabolic steroids, see
     Reproductive Health Drugs.

     Progesterone

     Progesterone has some minor anabolic and adrenergic properties that can help with development of male
     characteristics (increased hair growth) and suppression of female characteristics (decreased breast size). See
     Reproductive Health Drugs for more information about progesterone. For individuals who do not want therapies that
     contain estrogen, are at risk for thromboembolic complications, or have other contraindications, progesterone is an
     alternative to estrogen.

Nursing Implications

The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking masculinizing hormones:

· Assess baseline health, including underlying medical conditions, current medications, and pertinent
   laboratory and diagnostic results.

· Be cognizant of the client's feelings, values, and culture in order to render sensitive care.
· Be knowledgeable about drug actions, side effects, contraindications, and precautions and assess the client's

   knowledge and understanding.
· Obtain a hematocrit and lipid profile before the client starts hormone therapy and at follow-up visits.
· Monitor virilizing and adverse effects every 3 months for the first year and then every 6-12 months.
· Assess serum testosterone at follow-up visits, with a practical target in the male range of 400-700 ng/dL.

   Peak levels for clients taking parenteral testosterone can be measured 24-48 hours after injection. Trough
   levels can be measured immediately before injection.
· Screen for bone mineral density before clients at risk for osteoporosis start hormone therapy. Otherwise,
   screening can start at age 60 or, if sex hormone levels are consistently low, earlier.
· Screen clients with cervixes or breasts appropriately.
· Ensure that the client understands issues related to family planning and has had an opportunity to meet with a
   family planning specialist. Resources are available for various options, such as freezing eggs or donating eggs
   to a partner or gestational surrogate.
· Ensure that the client is aware of and has access to resources such as community organizations, specialty
   clinics and hospitals, and support groups.
· Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client
   teaching guidelines.

     Testosterone enanthate (subcutaneous) and testosterone undecanoate (oral) can cause blood pressure
     increases that can increase the risk for major adverse cardiovascular events, including nonfatal myocardial
     infarction, nonfatal stroke, and cardiovascular death, especially in clients with cardiovascular risk factors or
     established cardiovascular disease. Before initiating testosterone enanthate, consider the client's baseline
     cardiovascular risk and ensure blood pressure is adequately controlled. Additionally, blood pressure should be
     monitored throughout the treatment period and risk versus benefits evaluated for clients who develop
     cardiovascular risk factors or disease while on treatment.

INTRODUCTION The eye is a major sensory organ through which a person obtains information about the external
environment. Furthermore, examination of the inner eye can provide information about systemic conditions, such as
hypertension or diabetes mellitus. It is essential to recognize the structures and functions of the eye to help
facilitate understanding about ocular drug therapy. This chapter begins by introducing the complex structures of the
eye along with their functions. It then discusses various ocular disorders, such as refractive disorders, local
ophthalmic infections or inflammation, and treatment of glaucoma.

38.1 Introduction to the Eyes

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 38.1.1 Describe the structures and functions of the eyes.
    · 38.1.2 Differentiate between glaucoma and other ocular disorders.

Eye Structures and Functions

The human eye is an extension of the brain. Diseases of the brain are sometimes diagnosed by abnormalities seen in
the eye. There are eye symptoms that can be benign or progress with age, such as cataracts, whereas other ocular
symptoms can be red flags for neurological conditions.

     The eye consists of internal and external structures (see Figure 38.2). Internal ocular structures include (Garrity,
     2022b; Rehman et al., 2022):

         · Pupil: Allows light to enter the eye, sends neural signals, and begins the process of sight. The pupil is the
             round black opening in the middle of the iris that responds to light by constricting when light enters and
             dilating when light is reduced.

         · Iris: The color of the eye surrounding the black pupil. The iris controls the size of the pupil based on the
             amount of light. This is an essential nursing assessment because deviations from normal size or unequal size
             pupils can indicate pathology.

         · Sclera: The "white of the eye." The sclera helps maintain the eye's shape and functions as a protective layer
             from injury.

         · Anterior chamber: Located between the back of the cornea and front of the lens, this chamber contains
             aqueous humor, which is the tissue fluid of the eye. The fluid provides continuous nourishment to the lens
             and cornea because they have no capillaries of their own.

         · Posterior chamber: An extension of the anterior chamber located between the lens and retina that contains
             vitreous humor. This has a gel-like consistency that can thin as one ages and lead to a retinal breach
             (American Society of Retina Specialists, 2023).

         · Macula: Responsible for central vision and produces the clearest visual detail.
         · Fovea: A small depression in the macula and the area for central vision where visual acuity is the highest.
         · Lens: A transparent structure that lies directly behind the pupil and transmits and focuses light to form images

             on the retina and for accommodation purposes. It is attached to the ciliary muscle.
         · Optic nerve: The second cranial nerve; it has sensory functions and transmits electrical impulses from the

             retina to the brain's visual cortex, which displays them as a visual representation.
         · Retina: The innermost nerve layer, containing microscopic photoreceptor cells to detect light. These receptors

             are called rods and cones. Rods are the receptors for night vison and help with peripheral vision. Cones are for
             daytime vision; they help with central vision and can detect color as well. There are three distinct types of
             cones, each sensitive to a different color: red, green, or blue.

     Intraocular pressure (IOP) is the fluid pressure caused by the amount of aqueous humor in the anterior chamber. A
     normal IOP is 10-21 mm Hg (Begum, 2023). The pressure is maintained by having the same amount of fluid come
     in as the amount of fluid leaving the front of the eye. Excess IOP is an important risk factor for glaucoma. Untreated

elevated IOP can lead to blindness. Abnormally low IOP, known as hypotony, can lead to eye wasting.

External ocular structures (see Figure 38.3) include (Garrity, 2022a):

    · Eyelids and eyelashes: These protect the eye, acting as barriers against foreign bodies, bright light, and small
        irritants, such as dust.

    · Conjunctiva: The mucous membrane lining the eyelids. When this becomes inflamed, it is referred to as
        conjunctivitis, which is caused by allergies, certain bacteria, or viruses.

    · Cornea: An avascular tissue barrier that protects the eye and will result in blurry vision if scratched. The
        cornea is the main structure that bends light entering the eye to allow the eye to focus clearly on an image.
        Refraction errors can manifest as nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism (described further later in
        this section).

    · Extrinsic muscles of the eye: There are a total of six, and they are attached to the bony orbit and to the surface
        of the eye. There are four rectus muscles (lateral, medial, superior, and inferior) that move the eye up and
        down or side to side. The two oblique muscles (superior and inferior) rotate the eyes.

FIGURE 38.3 The external ocular structures help protect the eye. (credit: modification of work from Anatomy and Physiology 2e.

Fluid is produced by the lacrimal gland located at the upper, outer corner of the eye. This fluid flows continuously,
but the amount increases due to irritation and certain emotions. Small lacrimal ducts take the fluid to the anterior
surface of the eye. When a person blinks, the fluid spreads, which moistens and washes the surface of the eye. The
fluid also contains an enzyme called lysozyme that can inhibit growth of bacteria on the surface of the eye.

There are two small openings at the medial canthus, which is the corner of the eye near the nose. These take the
fluid to the lacrimal sac that leads to the nasolacrimal duct. Here the fluid empties into the nasal cavity. This is the
reason that noses run when a person cries. If the increase in fluid exceeds the capacity of the drainage system, the
excess fluid overflows the eyelids and becomes tears. This is known as lacrimation.

Eye Disorders

Healthy vision requires three basic components: formation of retinal images, stimulation of rods and cones, and
nerve impulse conduction to the brain. Malfunction of any of these can disrupt vision. Eye disorders range from
common refractive errors that can be treated with the use of eyeglasses, contact lenses, or surgery to more serious
conditions such as glaucoma, macular degeneration, and ocular inflammation and infection.

Topical ophthalmic agents play a prominent role in managing many eye disorders. These drugs are intended for
direct administration into the conjunctiva of the eye. This route limits systemic absorption, thereby decreasing the
risk of adverse effects. Various eye disorders will be addressed in this section. The following section will discuss
relevant drugs for specific eye conditions.

Refractive Errors
Refraction of light rays is the deflection or bending of rays as they pass through one object and into another of
greater or lesser density. Refractive errors occur when the shape of the eye keeps light from focusing directly on
986  38 · Ophthalmic Drugs

     the retina, thereby distorting how objects are seen. When looking at a distant object, the ciliary muscle is relaxed,
     causing the lens to have a flat shape. If looking at a near object, the ciliary muscle contracts, causing the lens to
     have a convex shape. The lens should be able to quickly adjust from far to near vision and vice versa. It is the only
     adjustable structure within the refractory system.

     Errors in refraction can be addressed with surgical and nonsurgical interventions. In some cases, a vision
     prescription can correct how light is refracted on the retina (National Eye Institute, 2022). There are four main
     refractive errors:

         · Hyperopia, referred to as farsightedness, is characterized by seeing close objects out of focus; however,
             distant objects are clearly seen. The light refracts behind the retina to cause this distortion. This is because
             the eyeball is too short or the lens is too thin.

         · Myopia, referred to as nearsightedness, is characterized by seeing distant objects out of focus; however, close
             objects are clearly seen. The light refracts in front of the retina to cause this distortion. This is because the
             eyeball is too elongated or the lens is too thick.

         · Astigmatism occurs when light is focused on multiple points along the retina, rather than just a single point.
             This occurs when the cornea or the lens has a different shape than normal, often shaped more like a football
             than a baseball (Boyd, 2022a).

         · Presbyopia occurs as the eye ages and is characterized by lens thickening and loss of elasticity. This change
             occurs around age 45. Clients may begin to use over-the-counter reading glasses for close-up reading
             (National Eye Institute, 2020).

          LINK TO LEARNING

      Refractive Errors

       Access multimedia content (https://openstax.org/books/pharmacology/pages/38-1-introduction-to-the-eyes)
       The American Academy of Ophthalmology has a video entitled "Vision Loss and Refractive Error," presented by
       the University of Wisconsin Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences. It discusses topics such as
       myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, and presbyopia.

     Glaucoma
     Glaucoma is a group of diseases characterized by a decrease in peripheral vision due to an obstruction of aqueous
     humor that increases IOP, which can damage the optic nerve. This leads to diminished and/or distorted vision.
     Glaucoma can be an inherited condition or occur spontaneously. Black, Hispanic, and Asian clients have a higher risk
     for glaucoma. Also at higher risk are clients older than 40 years, those with thinner corneas, those with chronic eye
     inflammation, and those taking medications that are known to increase eye pressure (Boyd, 2022b).

     Multiple parameters are assessed when screening for glaucoma, including:

         · IOP: Average values are 10-21 mm Hg (Begum, 2023).
         · Corneal thickness: Measured in microns with an average cornea thickness of 555 microns. Thinner corneas

             may result in artificially low pressure readings, potentially missing a glaucoma diagnosis. Similarly, thicker
             corneas may cause artificially elevated pressure readings, potentially creating a false glaucoma diagnosis
             (Glaucoma Research Foundation, 2022).
         · Optic nerve: A healthy optic nerve is intact and generally does not show asymmetry or cupping (Waisberg &
             Micieli, 2021).

          CLINICAL TIP

      Anxiety Can Affect IOP

       The nurse should be aware that a client's anxiety can artificially increase an IOP reading. It is important to
       acknowledge the client's wariness about the tonometer touching the cornea, but the nurse should reassure the
       client that a numbing drop is used alleviate any perceived discomfort.

Clients are considered "glaucoma suspects" if they have risk factors for glaucoma, including elevated IOP, optic
nerve damage, visual field defect, or a strong family history of glaucoma (Ahmad, 2018).

The two forms of glaucoma are open-angle glaucoma (the most common form) and closed-angle glaucoma. Open-
angle glaucoma occurs when the trabecular meshwork becomes occluded and cannot drain the continuous
production of aqueous humor. Often there are no early symptoms. Eventually, the client begins to lose peripheral
vision (Mayo Clinic, 2022). Open-angle glaucoma typically progresses slowly with small increases in IOP over time.
Treatments include ophthalmic drops as well as surgical treatments such as trabeculectomy, a glaucoma drainage
implant that allows aqueous humor to drain through an artificial bleb (a surgically created hole) into the body for
processing, and corneal transplant.

Closed-angle glaucoma progresses suddenly with a sudden rise in IOP. Clients can become blind with little warning.
This condition is precipitated by either displacement of the iris or pupil dilation. Both cover the trabecular
meshwork, preventing the exit of aqueous humor. IOP increases rapidly to dangerous levels when the angle
between the cornea and iris becomes significantly narrowed. Symptoms can include sudden headache, eye pain,
and/or blurred vision. Immediate treatment by an ophthalmologic specialist can limit ocular disability by widening
the canal of Schlemm in a procedure known as canaloplasty.

Macular Degeneration
Macular degeneration occurs when the central portion of the retina inhibits central vision but maintains peripheral
vision. Macular degeneration occurs in some clients as the macula ages. There are two types of degeneration:

    · Dry macular degeneration (DMD) often has characteristic drusen, which consists of yellow lipid retinal
        deposits. There is no cure for DMD; however, there is some evidence that various nutritional and vitamin
        intakes, including vitamin C, lutein, and leafy green vegetables, can slow the progression (American
        Optometric Association, n.d.; Mrowicka et al., 2022).

    · Wet macular degeneration (WMD) is characterized by the growth of new subretinal blood vessels, which are
        often fragile and leaky. This leakage lifts the macula from its normal place, quickly causing permanent injury.
        There is no cure for WMD, but it can be treated with laser technology and intraocular medication injections
        (National Retina Institute, 2023).

Ocular Inflammation and Infection
Ocular inflammation and infection occur when the eye has become inflamed or infected through either illness or
injury. Conjunctivitis, referred to as pink eye, occurs when the thin layer of tissue in front of the eye becomes
irritated and red, often producing a sticky coating on the eyelashes. These symptoms can increase tear production,
produce a sensation of a foreign body in the eye, and cause the client to rub their eyes. Conjunctivitis can be caused
by a bacterial or viral infection, allergy, or irritant, such as a stray eyelash or after swimming in a chlorinated pool.
Bacterial conjunctivitis is often treated with ocular antibacterials, in the form of either an ointment or a solution
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019). Complications are rare; however, they can include eye scarring
or a secondary infection such as meningitis (National Health Service, 2023).

There are numerous other infections and inflammatory conditions of the eye that occur at different ocular
anatomical sites, including:

    · Episcleritis occurs between the conjunctiva and sclera and has a similar presentation to conjunctivitis (Johns
        Hopkins Medicine, n.d.; Schonberg & Stokkermans, 2023).

    · Keratitis is characterized by corneal inflammation that can cause ulceration. Keratitis is considered a medical
        emergency. The client will need a timely diagnosis and treatment plan because extensive ulceration can lead
        to blindness. Keratitis is associated with infectious and noninfectious causes (Singh et al., 2023).

    · Uveitis is an inflammation of the middle part of the eye called the uvea. Though infection can be a factor,
        uveitis is largely considered autoimmune secondary to other systemic diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis
        and reactive arthritis (Rosenbaum, 2019). Uveitis is characterized by eye pain, eye redness, and photophobia.
        It is essential that the client seek timely diagnosis and treatment with ocular corticosteroids to avoid vision
        loss.

    · A chalazion occurs when meibomian glands become occluded. It presents with edema and pain on the eyelid
        and is initially treated with warm wet compresses several times per day, but it may also require antibiotics and
        possible surgical intervention.
988  38 · Ophthalmic Drugs

         · A hordeolum (stye) is a red, painful bump near the edge of the eyelid that looks like a pimple or boil. A stye
             has an infectious cause and often responds to warm wet compresses. Oral antibiotics are sometimes needed
             to successfully treat a hordeolum (American Academy of Ophthalmology, 2022).

         · Orbital cellulitis is an infection of the fat and muscles around the eye caused by pathogens, trauma, or
             spreading of infection from the sinuses. Orbital cellulitis can be serious and lead to brain abscess and vision
             loss. The client may present with a fever, eye pain, and a bulging eye. A dental history should also be reviewed
             because a dental abscess can track upward into the orbits. Treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics
             until the actual organism can be identified (Satar et al., 2021). Once the organism has been determined,
             appropriate antibiotics can be started.

         · Obstruction or inflammation of the lacrimal gland or the lacrimal sac can occur. When the lacrimal gland is
             inflamed, this is termed dacryoadenitis. If the lacrimal sac is inflamed, this is referred to as dacryocystitis.
             Treatment consists of warm compresses, ocular antibacterials, and oral antibiotics as needed. The Crigler
             massage is sometimes recommended to release material from the affected tear duct by pressing a clean index
             finger inward against the lacrimal sac and massaging downward toward the nose (Hu et al., 2022).

         · Keratoconjunctivitis sicca is dryness of the conjunctiva and cornea. The dry eyes can be the result of too few
             tears being produced or tears that evaporate too quickly. This condition is characterized by inflammation of
             the ocular surface and lacrimal glands.

     Administration of Ophthalmic Drugs

     It is important for the nurse to communicate with the client prior to eye medication administration to set
     expectations regarding drug indications and administration technique. This helps ensure that the client can
     participate in ocular medication administration and support medication efficacy.

     Administration of Solution or Drops
     To properly administer solution or drops, the client should:

       1. Check the expiration date prior to administration, and discard if expired.
       2. Wash and dry hands thoroughly before administering eye medication.
       3. Shake the bottle gently to ensure the medication is evenly distributed, especially if the drug is a suspension.
       4. Tilt head back and stare upward so the medication does not directly hit the eyeball.
       5. Pull the lower eyelid away from the eye to form a pouch and instill the prescribed number of drops into the

             conjunctival sac.
       6. Release the eyelid slowly.
       7. Close the eye and look downward for 1-2 minutes.
       8. Apply gentle pressure to the corner of the eye where the upper and lower lids meet closest to the nose for

             30-60 seconds to prevent systemic absorption.

     The client should wait at least 2 minutes between drops if needing to administer more than one drop of the same
     medication; they should wait at least 5 minutes between drugs if a different ocular medication is prescribed.

     The client should not:

         · Allow the dropper to touch their eye or any other surface.
         · Rub the eyes after administration.
         · Rinse the eyedropper.
         · Use eye drops that have changed color.
         · Wear contact lenses before or several minutes after administration.
         · Administer eye drops if they have injured their eye because the drops can cause pain and make the injury

             worse.

          CLINICAL TIP

      Geriatric and Pediatric Administration

       Older adults or others needing assistance with administration should try a device that can attach to the
       medication bottle, making it easier to hold the bottle and administer the drops. These products are available at

     Access for free at openstax.org

  pharmacies and where medical supplies are sold. If the client's hands shake, they can approach the eye from the
  side with the hand resting on the side of the face. They can also wrap a cloth or paper towel around the bottle
  and dropper to make it larger and easier to grip.

  For pediatric clients, if possible, have a second person available to help position the child and keep them still
  during administration. If the child will not open their eyes, place the drops in the inner corner of the eye so when
  they open their eyes the medication will fall in.

Administration of Ointment
To properly administer ointment, the client should:

  1. Wash and dry hands thoroughly before administering eye medication.
  2. Hold the tube between their hands for 2-4 minutes to warm the ointment.
  3. Tilt their head back and stare upward.
  4. Pull the lower eyelid away from the eye to form a pouch.
  5. Hold the tube about 1 inch above the eye and place a thin layer of approximately 0.25-0.5 inches inside the

        lower lid.
  6. Close the eyes for 1-2 minutes and roll the eyes around in all directions so the ointment melts and gets

        dispersed over the entire eye.
  7. Wipe away any excess ointment from the eyes.
  8. Wait 30 minutes before applying a second ointment (if prescribed).

The client should not:

    · Rub their eyes after administration.
    · Wear contact lenses during treatment, unless told otherwise, because the contact lenses can become

        damaged.
    · Use after the recommended time, to prevent an eye infection.
    · Drive or operate heavy machinery. Ointments are thick and can cause transient blurred vision.
    · Apply ointment if they have sustained an eye injury because the ointment can cause pain or make the injury

        worse.

     CLINICAL TIP

 Combination Prescription for Both Drops and Ointment

  Some individuals may have to administer drops and ointment, depending on their prescribed medications. It is
  crucial the drops are instilled first. The client should then wait 5-10 minutes before applying the ointment. If
  they do it in the reverse order, the ointment may get washed away and will be ineffective.

             disorders.

     Ocular Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatories

     Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to prevent and treat eye inflammation. They can help
     relieve symptoms of pain and swelling from eye conditions or injuries or after eye surgery. Diclofenac sodium and
     ketorolac tromethamine are both used to treat postoperative ocular inflammation after cataract extraction. They are
     also used to treat ocular pain and photophobia in clients undergoing corneal refractive surgery. To manage these
     conditions, drugs are administered directly into the affected eye(s).

     Table 38.1 lists common ocular nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

     Drug                             Routes and Dosage Ranges

      Diclofenac   For postoperative ocular inflammation after cataract extraction:
        sodium     0.1% ophthalmic solution: 1 drop to the affected eye(s) 4 times daily, starting 24 hours after
       (Voltaren   cataract surgery and continuing for 2 weeks after the postoperative period.
                   For ocular pain and photophobia in clients undergoing corneal refractive surgery:
     Ophthalmic)   0.1% ophthalmic solution: 1-2 drops to the operative eye(s) within 1 hour before surgery.
                   Within 15 minutes after surgery, apply 1-2 drops to the operative eye(s). Instill 1-2 drops 4
                   times daily for up to 3 days.

                   For reduction of postoperative ocular inflammation and ocular pain after cataract surgery or

        Ketorolac  corneal refractive surgery:
     tromethamine  0.5% ophthalmic solution: 1 drop into the affected eye(s) 4 times daily beginning 24 hours after

     (Source: Institute for Safe Medication Practices, 2023)

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Adverse effects are essentially identical for both drugs. Although administering drugs using the ophthalmic route
     causes minimal systemic effects, they still can occur. The potential exists for prolonged bleeding due to interference
     with the aggregation (clumping) of thrombocytes (platelets). Blood can enter the aqueous humor, resulting in a
     hyphema (a collection of blood in the anterior chamber of the eye). The blood usually will dissipate on its own over
     time. In some susceptible clients, such as those with corneal denervation, dry eye syndrome, diabetes mellitus, or
     rheumatoid arthritis, continued use of topical NSAIDs over 14 days may result in epithelial breakdown, corneal
     thinning, erosion, ulceration, or perforation. If any of these occur, they can impair vision. Clients who exhibit
     evidence of corneal epithelial breakdown should immediately discontinue use of the topical NSAIDs and must be

closely monitored to ensure proper healing of the cornea.

All ophthalmic NSAIDs and corticosteroids may slow or delay healing. Concurrent use of these drugs may increase
the potential for further healing difficulties. Combining any ophthalmic NSAID with latanoprost will diminish the
therapeutic effect of latanoprost.

Ocular NSAIDs are contraindicated for clients with a history of severe NSAID or acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin)
hypersensitivity.

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking ocular nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories:
992  38 · Ophthalmic Drugs

         · Assess client's visual acuity periodically.
         · Monitor for any signs or symptoms of bleeding, especially in the eye.
         · Have the client return-demonstrate the application of the drops and/or ointment to ensure they are using the

             proper technique.
         · Encourage the client to get assistance from others or use adaptive devices to minimize the risk of fall or injury

             until their vision improves.
         · Assess for tearing, eye discharge, irritation, and/or facial swelling.
         · Monitor severity of pain.
         · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

             teaching guidelines.

       CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

       The client taking an ocular nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory should:

           · Notify the provider of any signs or symptoms of keratitis: red eye, sensation of a foreign substance in the
               eye, eye pain, decreased vision, or sensitivity to light.

           · Read the medication label before using; eye medications and ear medications are similarly packaged.
           · Avoid contamination of the prescribed product because this can cause infection or damage vision.

       The client taking an ocular nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory should not:

           · Drive or operate machinery until vision clears.

     Ocular Immunosuppressants

     In ocular inflammation, immunosuppressants are used as steroid-sparing agents to control the inflammation, with a
     goal of long-lasting remission and prevention of the threat to vision. Likewise, these agents are utilized to
     "reprogram" the immune system to alleviate or reduce the lymphocytes from attacking and causing recurrent
     autoimmune destruction of healthy ocular tissue (Liu et al., 2023). Although several drugs could be used,
     cyclosporine is the predominant one.

     Systemic immunosuppressants are used in some cases for inflammatory eye diseases because they can prevent
     potential permanent vision loss. This treatment strategy is deployed often for uveitis and other ocular conditions
     when other treatments have failed (Kopplin, 2020).

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Because there is minimal systemic absorption, most of the adverse effects are local. Hypersensitivity reactions such
     as ocular redness, blurry vision, and lid swelling can occur; therefore, the client should be aware and observed for
     signs of this (College of Optometrists, 2023). It is rare for the drug to cause an anaphylactic reaction.

     No true contraindications exist when giving this drug via the ophthalmic route. If a client is already
     immunocompromised from a different condition, it is important for them to contact their provider if they begin to
     experience signs of infection. If topical corticosteroids are given concurrently with cyclosporine, this can increase
     the chances of infection because both drugs can decrease the immune response.

     Table 38.3 is a drug prototype table for ocular immunosuppressants featuring cyclosporine. It lists drug class,
     mechanism of action, adult dosage, indications, therapeutic effects, drug and food interactions, adverse effects, and

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking ocular immunosuppressants:

· Monitor for signs/symptoms of hypersensitivity, such as facial swelling, inflamed tongue, or shortness of
   breath.

· Ensure the client understands the proper technique for instilling the drop by having them return-demonstrate
   the procedure.

· Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client
   teaching guidelines.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking an ocular immunosuppressant should:

    · Invert the unit dose vial several times until there is a uniform, white emulsion.
    · Use the medication immediately upon opening and discard the remaining solution straightaway.
    · Be careful not to touch the tip of the vial to their eye or other surface to avoid the potential for eye injury or

        contamination.
    · Notify the provider of any possible allergic reactions, such as a swollen face, throat, eyes, and/or tongue or

        shortness of breath.
    · Remove their contact lenses prior to instilling the drops. Client can reinsert contacts 15 minutes after

        administration.
    · Wait at least 15 minutes to instill other drops or apply ointments.

Ocular Corticosteroids

Ophthalmic steroids are applied topically for a variety of inflammatory conditions, such as allergic conjunctivitis,
uveitis, iritis, and herpes zoster keratitis. In addition, they are beneficial in the treatment of chemical and thermal
burns along with foreign body injury. Ophthalmic steroids are also useful in postocular surgery to decrease
994  38 · Ophthalmic Drugs

     inflammation and scar tissue formation. It is best these drugs are used on a short-term basis to minimize adverse
     effects (Fung et al., 2020). Dexamethasone and prednisolone are the two main drugs used to decrease ocular
     inflammation.

     Dexamethasone
     Dexamethasone is a more potent ocular corticosteroid and has a longer duration of action than prednisolone. For
     ocular use, this drug is available in ophthalmic drops and ophthalmic ointment. It can be used as monotherapy
     (alone) or in combination with other medications, such as antibiotics. Some dexamethasone dosage forms contain a
     sulfite that may cause an asthmatic episode or an allergic reaction ranging from urticaria to life-threatening
     anaphylaxis in those who have a sensitivity to sulfites (DailyMed, Maxidex, 2006).

     Prednisolone Sodium Phosphate
     For ocular use, this drug is available in ophthalmic drops.

     Table 38.4 lists common ocular corticosteroids and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

     Adverse Effects and Contraindications
     Most of the serious adverse effects occur when the drug is being used for a prolonged period of time. Extended use
     may cause increased IOP, which may result in glaucoma. Anyone using these products for more than 10 days should
     routinely have their intraocular pressure checked. In addition, the optic nerve may become damaged, which will
     cause visual acuity defects and loss of vision in certain fields. Subcapsular cataract formation is also a potential
     adverse effect. Many viral, bacterial, and fungal infections of the cornea or conjunctiva may be exacerbated;
     therefore, corticosteroids are contraindicated in those with an active infection (DailyMed, Prednisolone, 2023).

     If too much drug enters the system, clients on antidiabetic agents or warfarin will need to have their dose adjusted.

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking ocular corticosteroids:

· Teach the client the proper way to administer the medication and to avoid contamination.
· Assess for therapeutic effects, including decreased eye pain, redness, and irritation.
· Make the environment safe for ambulation because the drug can cause transient blurry vision. Ensure

   adequate lighting and a clear path to the bathroom.
· Assess for increased eye pain, drainage, headache, prolonged blurred vision or changes in visual acuity, and

   sensitivity to light.
· Apply warm, wet compresses over affected eye(s) to help reduce inflammation and/or discomfort.
· Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

   teaching guidelines.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking an ocular corticosteroid should:

    · Follow the tapering instructions given by the prescriber to avoid adrenal gland insufficiency. Usually
        tapering occurs over a few weeks or months depending on how long steroids were taken.

    · Notify their health care provider immediately if they experience excess fatigue, weight loss, increased
        urine output, confusion, irregular heart rhythm, or dizziness during titration. This may indicate the drug is
        being stopped too quickly.

    · Immediately contact their health care provider if they develop any sudden visual changes, undergo
        trauma, or develop an infection.

    · Wear sunglasses when outside to reduce the sensitivity to light.
996  38 · Ophthalmic Drugs

       The client taking an ocular corticosteroid should not:

           · Wear contact lenses for at least 15 minutes after instillation of the drug because one of the preservatives
               in dexamethasone could be absorbed by soft contact lenses, making the drug less effective.

           · Drive or participate in hazardous activities until their vision is clear.

     Ocular Antibacterials

     Topical antibacterials are used to treat ophthalmic infections and to prevent infection after ocular surgery. Bacterial
     infections are and will remain contagious until treated for 24-48 hours. There are various antibacterials that have
     ophthalmic uses. These agents are active against numerous gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. They are
     generally used to treat infections involving the conjunctiva or cornea, such as conjunctivitis, keratitis, corneal ulcers,
     and blepharitis. The choice of antibiotic depends on the pathogen causing the infection. Additionally, many different
     combination preparations are available. Caution should be exercised when administering these products with regard
     to the select agent, strength, and formulation. Unfortunately, the risk of superinfection is high when using
     ophthalmic antibiotics due to contamination of the eyedropper or tube. Counseling on the proper technique of
     administration is a critical teaching point to help reduce the risk of superinfection.

     Various drug classifications are used to treat ocular infections. Some of these include fluoroquinolones
     (ciprofloxacin), aminoglycosides (gentamycin, neomycin), macrolides (erythromycin), and a combination drug that
     includes neomycin. Ocular neomycin can be prescribed in several ways: neomycin, polymyxin B, and bacitracin;
     neomycin, polymyxin B, and hydrocortisone; neomycin, polymyxin B, and dexamethasone; or neomycin, polymyxin
     B, and gramicidin. Polymyxin is considered a polypeptide bactericidal antibiotic, while bacitracin is a bactericidal
     and bacteriostatic polypeptide antibiotic. Dexamethasone and hydrocortisone are corticosteroids (discussed in the
     previous section). The choice of the medication may depend on many factors. One important factor to consider is
     whether the client wears contact lenses.

     Gentamicin Sulfate
     Gentamicin sulfate has bactericidal effects that interfere with bacterial synthesis. This class of medication is used
     primarily against aerobic gram-negative bacilli, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis,
     and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The drug has no effects on anaerobic bacteria. In addition to the uses of
     ciprofloxacin, gentamicin can be used for blepharitis, acute meibomianitis (inflammation of the meibomian gland),
     and dacryocystitis (inflammation of the lacrimal sac) (DailyMed, Gentamicin, 2022).

     Neomycin Sulfate/Polymyxin B Sulfate/Gramicidin
     This combination antibiotic product has multiple mechanisms of action. First, it works similar to gentamicin by
     interfering with bacterial synthesis. This drug is mainly used in the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis and
     blepharitis. Sometimes it is necessary to administer both a corticosteroid and an antibacterial, such as for
     inflammatory ocular infections or traumas. Even if there is no active infection, corticosteroids reduce the body's
     immune response, and if this is clinically concerning based on the client's health, an antibacterial may be added as a
     prophylactic measure.

     Erythromycin
     This drug is the first-line agent in treating simple cases of bacterial conjunctivitis. It prevents the further growth of
     bacteria rather than directly destroying them. Interestingly, because this drug is administered via ointment form,
     even if it stays on the eyelid and eyelashes, it still provides a therapeutic effect despite the medication not being
     directly on the conjunctiva (DailyMed, Erythromycin, 2023).

     In newborns born to someone with active disease, 1 cm of ointment is administered one time right after delivery to
     prevent eye infections, especially gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum (GON) and chlamydial ophthalmia. If left
     untreated, these infections can cause serious eye problems, including corneal scarring, ocular perforation, and
     blindness as early as 24 hours after birth. Erythromycin is the only FDA-approved drug for this purpose.

     Table 38.6 lists common ocular antibacterials and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Ocular antibacterials can cause blurred vision; therefore, safety factors must be in place to prevent falls (uncluttered
environment, adequate lighting, walking devices in reach). Hypersensitivity reactions to these drugs or any of their
components can occur even with the first dose, so the nurse must make clients aware of this and tell them to seek
treatment immediately. The drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of a skin rash.

Use of antibacterials over a prolonged period can deplete the normal flora, causing a superinfection. If this occurs,
the treatment plan may need to be modified to add an antifungal agent. If the superinfection is bacterial, the
overgrowth of this new organism may be resistant to the antibiotic's activity, and another appropriate antibacterial
will need to be initiated.

Because they have a broad spectrum of activity against multiple organisms, ocular antibacterials are often overused,
which can lead to the development of bacterial resistance. If purulent discharge, inflammation, or pain becomes
worse, the client should discontinue the drug and contact a health care provider.

During the first 7 days of treating a corneal ulcer with ciprofloxacin drops, a nonharmful white crystalline precipitate
commonly forms on the corneal defect. This precipitate will resolve on its own and causes no corneal damage
998  38 · Ophthalmic Drugs

     (DailyMed, Ciprofloxacin, 2022).

     If ciprofloxacin is concurrently given with a systemic fluoroquinolone, arthropathy (tendon inflammation and tendon
     rupture) can occur. This usually occurs in young and older populations.

        breathing.
    · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

        teaching guidelines.

  CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

  The client taking an ocular antibacterial should:

      · Wash off any eye makeup and wash hands thoroughly prior to medication administration.
      · Understand that they are still contagious until they have been receiving medication for 24-48 hours.
      · Seek immediate attention if experiencing any hypersensitivity reactions such as severe eye redness or

          irritation of the eye, eyelids, lips, or face.
      · Notify their health care provider if symptoms are not improving or are worsening.
      · Protect eyes by wearing sunglasses when outside.

  The client taking an ocular antibacterial should not:

      · Drive or operate machinery with blurred vision.
      · Wear contact lenses during the course of treatment.

Ocular Antivirals

Antiviral agents are used to treat herpes simplex ocular infections and primary keratoconjunctivitis. Trifluridine
(Viroptic) is the most commonly administered antiviral ophthalmic drug. This is a locally active drug and is available
in solution form. Systemic absorption is negligible, which reduces the risk of systemic adverse effects. This drug
does not affect liver or kidney function. The overall action of this drug is to suppress viral replication. If there are no
signs of improvement after 7 days of therapy or if there is incomplete re-epithelialization, continued use of this drug
is not recommended and another therapy should be considered (DailyMed, Trifluridine, 2021).

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Because this drug is locally acting, it causes very few adverse effects. Most of them are ocular-related. Continuous
administration of trifluridine for periods exceeding 21 days should be avoided because of potential ocular toxicity.
Rare adverse effects include keratitis sicca, hyperemia, epithelial keratopathy, and increased IOP. This drug is
considered carcinogenic and can be extremely harmful if it enters the bloodstream; therefore, safety precautions
such as handwashing and wearing gloves must be in place.

There are no true contraindications except for hypersensitivity to the drug's active and nonactive ingredients. If a
client has a known sensitivity to any of the ingredients, the drug should be avoided (DailyMed, Trifluridine, 2021).

      Nursing Implications
      The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking ocular antivirals:

      · Dispose of the drug or container by adhering to the biohazard procedures of the facility.
      · Refrigerate the solution at 36°F-48°F.
      · Teach the client proper handling, administration, and disposal of the drug.
      · Assess for a decrease in conjunctival erythema and potential adverse effects.
      · Assess for manifestations of retinal detachment, such as floaters, flashes of light, or a shadow falling over

         their vision.
      · Take precautions when caring for the client because viral infections are contagious.
      · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

         teaching guidelines.

      CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

      The client taking an ocular antiviral should:

          · Immediately notify the health care provider if they experience reduced vision, floaters, flashes of light, or a
              curtain-like shadow over their field of vision because these could be signs of retinal detachment.

          · Use the proper technique when administering and discarding any of the drug or container.
          · Store the medication in the refrigerator to maintain its potency.
          · Thoroughly wash face, hands, and any exposed skin after handling medication.
          · Understand that viral infections are contagious and may remain so until they are completely gone.

      The client taking an ocular antiviral should not:

          · Instill the eye drops if they are not at room temperature because this can cause injury and pain.
          · Assume that the organism has been fully eliminated because herpes lies dormant until something triggers

              it to become active.

      Ocular Antifungals

      Topical antifungals are active against a variety of yeast and filamentous fungi. Some of these include candida,

                                                          38.2 · Ocular Anti-inflammatories and Anti-infectives         1001

aspergillus, cephalosporium, fusarium, and penicillium. The only FDA-approved drug for ocular fungal infections is
natamycin (Natacyn). This is a polyene antibiotic. Although the activity against fungi is dose-related, this drug is
predominantly fungicidal. Because it is prepared in a suspension formula, it must be shaken well before using.
Approximately 2% of this drug enters the body systemically, but this is an insufficient concentration to cause
systemic issues. Most of the drug adheres to the cornea for desired periods of time without causing secondary
damage. This drug does not enter intraocular fluid; therefore, it does not increase eye pressure. Continuation of
therapy is determined by clinical picture and laboratory studies.

It may be helpful to decrease the dosage gradually at 4- to 7-day intervals to ensure the replicating organism has
been eliminated. Failure to improve within 10 days indicates that the organism may not be related to a fungus. If
true, the organism may be resistant to natamycin, and a different drug may be prescribed.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
There are no true contraindications except for hypersensitivity to the drug's active and nonactive ingredients. If one
has a known sensitivity to any of the ingredients, the drug should be avoided (DailyMed, Natacyn, 2023).

Table 38.9 is a drug prototype table for ocular antifungals featuring natamycin. It lists drug class, mechanism of
action, adult dosage, indications, therapeutic effects, drug and food interactions, adverse effects, and
contraindications.

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking ocular antifungals:

· Shake the medication well so all the particles are evenly mixed.
· Be observant for any manifestations of hypersensitivity (e.g., skin rash, hives, eye pain, or swelling of the face,

   lips, or tongue), and provide treatment immediately (Cleveland Clinic, 2023b).
· Assess for therapeutic effects (e.g., decreased eye pain, redness, and tearing along with increased visual

   acuity).
· Be certain the medication is being correctly administered and no doses are missed, because fungal infections
1002  38 · Ophthalmic Drugs

              are very difficult to treat.
          · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

              teaching guidelines.

        CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

        The client taking an ocular antifungal should:

            · Notify the health care provider if experiencing hives, difficulty breathing, tunnel vision, chest pain,
                dyspnea, alteration in visual acuity, or paresthesia ("pins and needles" sensation) because these may
                represent adverse reactions.

        The client taking an ocular antifungal should not:

            · Use before the suspension has been adequately shaken and there is a uniform mixture.
            · Wear contact lenses before treatment is completed. If this is not feasible, contact lenses can be inserted

                no earlier than 15 minutes after the drug has been administered.

      38.3 Ocular Anesthetics and Lubricants

      LEARNING OUTCOMES
      By the end of this section, you should be able to:

          · 38.3.1 Identify the characteristics of ocular anesthetic and lubricant drugs used to treat eye disorders.
          · 38.3.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of ocular anesthetic and

              lubricant drugs used to treat eye disorders.
          · 38.3.3 Describe the nursing implications of ocular anesthetic and lubricant drugs used to treat eye

              disorders.
          · 38.3.4 Explain the client education related to ocular anesthetic and lubricant drugs used to treat eye

              disorders.

      Ocular Anesthetics

      Local anesthesia blocks nerve conduction of sensory impulses and motor impulses from the periphery to the CNS.
      Sodium channels are blocked to inhibit increases in permeability of the nerve membrane required for an action
      potential. Because the initiation and propagation of action potentials is deterred, sensation cannot be transmitted
      from the source of stimulation to the brain.

      Several ophthalmic procedures require adequate local anesthesia of the eyes. Some of these procedures include
      measurement of intraocular pressure, removal of foreign bodies, repairing corneal damage with sutures, Lasik
      surgery, conjunctival scraping, and gonioscopic examination to detect signs of glaucoma. Prolonged use of a topical
      ocular anesthetic may produce permanent corneal opacification with accompanying loss of vision (Sharifi et al.,
      2022).

           CLINICAL TIP

       Identifying Names of Local Anesthetics

        All ocular anesthetic medications end in the suffix "caine." This is useful to know when the nurse does not
        recognize the drug's name but can identify it is an anesthetic based on its suffix.

      Proparacaine HCL
      Proparacaine is a topical anesthetic used prior to surgical operations such as cataract extraction. This drug has a
      rapid onset with a short duration; therefore, it is usually given in repeated doses. Also, clients should not touch the
      eye while it is numb to avoid accidental injury due to the insensitivity of the eye (Mayo Clinic, 2023b).

      Tetracaine HCL
      This drug has a slow onset with a long duration of action. It may only need to be administered once. Clients should

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Local effects of stinging, burning, or redness can occur. Prolonged use or misuse can lead to corneal epithelial
toxicity, resulting in opacity of the cornea with varying levels of vision loss. With the use of proparacaine, a rare,
severe, immediate, apparently hyperallergic corneal reaction may occur, characterized by acute, intense, and diffuse
epithelial keratitis; a gray, ground-glass appearance; sloughing of necrotic epithelium; corneal filaments (strands
composed of degenerated epithelial cells and mucus that adhere to the cornea); and iritis (inflammation of the iris)
with descemetitis (membrane inflammation) (DailyMed, Proparacaine, 2023).

      Nursing Implications
      The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking ocular anesthetics:

          · Conduct a thorough preoperative assessment including past experience with ocular surgery, cardiac and
              respiratory issues, pain tolerance, past medical history, allergies, and medication list, including use of
              anticoagulants.

          · Perform postoperative assessment as prescribed. Be especially aware of pain level because this indicates the
              anesthesia is wearing off.

          · Ensure there is adequate lighting and lack of clutter to promote client safety.
          · Frequently remind clients not to touch their eyes while the eye is still numb to avoid ocular injuries.
          · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

              teaching guidelines.

        CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

        The client taking an ocular anesthetic should:

            · Tell the health care provider about a history of falls, ambulation deficits, and the use of ambulatory aids.
                Ocular anesthetic drops can alter perception and potentially lead to a fall.

            · Inform the health care provider if there is a progressive deterioration in vision.
            · Let the nurse know if they are experiencing any ocular pain.

        The client taking an ocular anesthetic should not:

            · Touch their eyes while still numb from ocular anesthetics to avoid accidental injury due to insensitivity of
                the eye.

            · Attempt to ambulate independently if vision is unclear.

      Ocular Lubricants

      Eye lubricants are used to temporarily relieve burning, irritation, and discomfort caused by dry eyes. They serve as a
      protector from further eye irritation. These products come in various forms: gel, ointment, emulsion, and solution.
      Most of these can be found over-the-counter (OTC); therefore, it is important clients follow the printed instructions.
      Some ophthalmic lubricants are antimicrobial and reduce the risk of infection. Others constrict blood vessels and
      reduce redness in the eye; still others contain zinc sulfate, an astringent that dries the mucus and relieves eye
      irritation.

      Artificial tears and white petrolatum/mineral oil are more similar than different (Khan, n.d.). Artificial tears come in
      solution form. The active ingredients are glycerin and propylene glycol, which are clear isotonic solutions and should
      not be used if the color changes or the solution becomes cloudy. White petrolatum/mineral oil is available as an
      ointment. The active ingredients are mineral oil and white petrolatum.

      Table 38.12 lists common ocular lubricants and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking ocular lubricants:

· For the client who is intubated and is not spontaneously blinking, who is unconscious, or who is unable to
   close their eyes and blink, the nurse must assess the eye frequently and use a damp cloth to remove prior
   lubricant to avoid buildup or crusting.

· Observe the client's entire face and cleanse the areas around the eyes and face to promote hygiene and avoid
   infection.

· Evaluate therapeutic effectiveness of medication and observe for hypersensitivity reactions such as rash,
   dizziness, difficulty breathing, or itching or swelling of the face, tongue, or throat.

· Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client
   teaching guidelines.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking an ocular lubricant should:

    · Be careful not to contaminate the tip of the dispenser because this may cause an eye infection.
    · Notify the health care provider if symptoms are not improving or are getting worse.
    · Use appropriate technique when instilling the lubricant.

The client taking an ocular lubricant should not:

    · Continue using the medication if they experience eye pain, vision changes, continued redness, or irritation
        of the eyes.

    · Double the dose if they missed one (Cleveland Clinic, 2023a).
    · Drive or engage in hazardous activity until vision has cleared.

      38.4 Antiglaucoma Drugs

      LEARNING OUTCOMES
      By the end of this section, you should be able to:

          · 38.4.1 Identify the characteristics of antiglaucoma drugs used to treat glaucoma-related eye disorders.
          · 38.4.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of antiglaucoma drugs used to

              treat glaucoma-related eye disorders.
          · 38.4.3 Describe the nursing implications of antiglaucoma drugs used to treat glaucoma-related eye

              disorders.
          · 38.4.4 Explain the client education related to antiglaucoma drugs used to treat glaucoma-related eye

              disorders.

      There are two common forms of glaucoma: primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), which is the most common form,
      and acute angle-closure (narrow-angle) glaucoma. These differ with respect to underlying pathology and treatment.
      Treatment of POAG focuses on reducing elevated IOP, the only risk factor that can be modified. Although no cure
      exists, reducing IOP can slow or even cease disease progression. Drugs lower IOP by either promoting aqueous
      humor drainage or reducing the production of aqueous humor. First-line drugs belong to three classes: beta-
      adrenergic blockers (beta blockers), alpha-2 adrenergic agonists, and prostaglandin analogs. Carbonic anhydrase
      inhibitors are considered second-line drugs. All of these medications are available in ophthalmic form, which is the
      preferred route. Because these classifications lower IOP by different mechanisms, combined therapy is usually
      more effective than monotherapy. If sufficient amounts of drug enter the circulation, systemic adverse effects may
      occur (Farkouh et al., 2016).

      Angle-closure glaucoma is triggered by displacement of the iris where it covers the trabecular meshwork. The angle
      between the cornea and the iris is greatly reduced. This prevents aqueous humor from leaving the anterior chamber.
      IOP levels increase rapidly to dangerous levels. The client will complain of severe ocular pain and headache.
      Permanent vision loss may occur within 24-48 hours if left untreated. Treatment consists of a combination of drugs
      to suppress symptoms. Once the IOP is reduced to a safe level, the client will undergo surgery on the iris. This is
      performed to allow unobstructed outflow of aqueous humor.

      Nonadherence is an issue for POAG drugs for multiple reasons. These include the asymptomatic nature of the
      condition such that clients may feel drug therapy is unnecessary, frequent dosing intervals, multiple drugs to
      administer, and age-related issues (see the box below). It is essential to emphasize to the client the importance of
      having regular eye exams to track progress or identify complications (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
      2020).

        SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

        Older Adults

        Glaucoma affects older adults more than any other population. Due to the complexity of treatment, older adults
        may struggle with following the treatment plan. This occurs for various reasons including:

            · Forgetfulness due to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia
            · Inability to remember in which sequence to administer the multiple drugs
            · High cost
            · Inability to properly instill eye medication
            · Medication causing temporary blurry vision, leading to an increased risk for falls

        Concerns related to specific drug classifications include:

            · Beta blockers may exacerbate heart failure in those who have a history of this condition.
            · Alpha-2 agonists can cause orthostatic hypotension, creating a risk for falls.
            · Those with inadequate renal function should avoid carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.

      Beta-Adrenergic Blockers

POAG. These drugs are suitable for both initial and maintenance therapy. Beta blockers, in conjunction with other
drugs, are also used for emergency management of acute narrow-angle glaucoma. Some ophthalmic beta blockers
can be absorbed in sufficient amounts to create systemic adverse effects, including angina, upper respiratory
infection, and muscle or joint pain (Haga et al., 2022); therefore, health care personnel and clients should be aware
of these. This classification of drugs does not cause miosis like other classes and must be used in combination for
angle-closure glaucoma.

In some clients, the lowering of intraocular pressure may require a few weeks to stabilize. More information on
systemic administration of this classification can be found in Antihypertensive and Antianginal Drugs.

Betaxolol Hydrochloride (Cardioselective)
Betaxolol is a selective blocker for the beta-1 adrenergic receptors. The onset of this drug generally occurs within 30
minutes, and peak effect is reached in about 2 hours after administration. A single dose has a duration of 12 hours.
Studies have shown clients treated with this drug for up to 3 years have maintained lowered IOP levels (DailyMed,
Betaxolol, 2023).

Timolol Hydrochloride (Nonselective)
The onset of timolol is 30 minutes. Peak effects occur in 1-2 hours, and the duration of action is 24 hours. This
allows the drug to be given once daily. Clients studied over a period of 1 year exhibited well-maintained IOP levels
(DailyMed, Timolol, 2023).

CLINICAL TIP

Identifying Names of Beta Blockers

All beta blockers end in the suffix "olol." This is useful to know when the nurse does not recognize the drug's
name but can identify it is a beta blocker based on its suffix.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Ocular beta-adrenergic blockers are contraindicated in clients who have a known hypersensitivity to any of the
ingredients. They also are contraindicated in clients with sinus bradycardia, second- or third-degree AV block,
cardiogenic shock, or severe heart failure.

Ocular adverse effects of beta-adrenergic blockers include eye pain, itching or discomfort, corneal sensitivity, eye
erythema, keratitis, and photophobia. Although there is less concern about systemic effects when using beta
blockers topically, some systemic absorption can occur when direct pressure is not applied to the medial canthus to
1008  38 · Ophthalmic Drugs

      occlude the nasolacrimal sac. If adequate amounts of drug reach the circulation, the client may experience some
      systemic adverse effects. These effects may include bradycardia, hypotension, heart block, or worsening of heart
      failure. Dyspnea and bronchospasm can occur in clients with severe respiratory conditions like chronic obstructive
      pulmonary diseases (COPD) and asthma who are taking a nonselective beta blocker (timolol) but are less likely to
      occur with cardioselective agents (betaxolol). Additionally, CNS effects including dizziness, vertigo, lethargy, and
      headaches have been associated with the use of beta blockers. Because of the potential effect on heart rate, beta
      blockers may mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia in clients with diabetes (DailyMed, Timolol, 2023).

      Nursing Implications
      The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking beta-adrenergic blockers:

          · Review the client's cardiovascular and respiratory history.
          · Obtain information about the client's smoking and alcohol use.
          · Monitor the client's heart rate and rhythm.
          · Periodically assess blood pressure.
          · Assess respiratory status, such as respiratory rate, lung sounds, and difficulty breathing.

 · Monitor for signs of hypoglycemia in clients with diabetes.
 · Emphasize the importance of holding pressure against the lacrimal sac at the medial canthus when

     administering.
 · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

     teaching guidelines.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking a beta-adrenergic blocker should:

    · Notify their provider if they are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.
    · Notify the health care provider if dizziness, shortness of breath, wheezing, excess fatigue, peripheral

        edema, or palpitations occur.
    · Be certain they occlude the inner canthus to avoid systemic absorption.
    · Identify signs/symptoms of hypoglycemia and monitor blood glucose levels if they have diabetes because

        these drugs may mask hypoglycemia.

The client taking a beta-adrenergic blocker should not:

    · Change positions quickly to avoid falls (especially older adults) because this may cause dizziness, which
        may result in a fall.

    · Wear contact lenses during administration and for 15 minutes afterward.
    · Operate machinery if feeling dizzy or lightheaded.

Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors

This classification of drugs reduces IOP by decreasing production of aqueous humor. They are not as effective as
others; however, they are very beneficial when used as an adjunct therapy with other drug classes. Carbonic
anhydrase is an enzyme found in many tissues of the body, including the eye. It speeds up the reaction of hydrating
carbon dioxide and dehydrating carbonic acid.

During chronic use, dorzolamide accumulates in red blood cells (RBCs) as it binds to carbonic anhydrase. When the
drug is stopped, it will wash out of the RBCs (DailyMed, Dorzolamide, 2021). Brinzolamide and dorzolamide have the
same effects. A combination drug consisting of dorzolamide and timolol exists. The combination provides an
additive effect for decreasing the production of aqueous humor. The therapeutic and adverse effects of timolol are
discussed in a previous section of this chapter.

Table 38.16 lists common carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

Drug                                              Routes and Dosage Ranges

Brinzolamide 1% solution  1 drop, 3 times daily.
            (Azopt)

Dorzolamide 2% solution 1 drop, 3 times daily when used alone.

(Trusopt)                 1 drop, twice daily if used in combination with other topical glaucoma treatment.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Clients with sulfonamide hypersensitivity can experience severe or even fatal reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson
syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, hepatic necrosis, aplastic anemia, or agranulocytosis. Sensitivity can occur
regardless of the route of administration. If there are any signs of an allergic reaction, the client should notify the
provider immediately. Local ocular adverse effects occur with chronic administration (DailyMed, Brinzolamide,
2023). Although acid-base imbalance and electrolyte disturbances primarily occur with the oral form, the potential
should be considered with clients receiving this classification via the topical route. The risk of metabolic acidosis is
compounded with concurrent use of high-dose salicylic acid. These adverse effects do disappear once the
underlying condition is treated (Tang et al., 2023). Other adverse effects include alopecia, chest pain, conjunctivitis,
diarrhea, diplopia (double vision), dizziness, dry mouth, dyspnea, dyspepsia, eye fatigue, hypertonia,

      Nursing Implications
      The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking carbonic anhydrase inhibitors:

      · Monitor potassium levels periodically in clients with impaired renal function.
      · Assess for signs/symptoms of metabolic acidosis, such as rapid breathing in clients with impaired renal

         function.
      · Teach the client that they may experience a bitter taste and that this is not harmful.
      · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

         teaching guidelines.

      CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

      The client taking a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor should:

          · Be acclimated to the medication before operating machinery because they may experience fatigue,
              tiredness, or dizziness.

          · Be aware that they may experience a bitter taste, stinging, burning, or conjunctival irritation.
          · Stop taking the drug and contact their health care provider if they develop conjunctivitis or eyelid edema.
          · Contact the health care provider immediately with any manifestations of ocular or systemic allergic

              reactions, such as skin rash, jaundice, right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, or easy bruising (Mayo Clinic,
              2023a).

medication will bind to the contacts.

Prostaglandin Analogues

These drugs are as effective as beta blockers without the serious adverse effects. The recommended daily dosage
produces the same reduction in IOP as does twice-daily timolol. Prostaglandin analogues are considered first-line
agents for glaucoma, especially in clients with cardiac conditions. In contrast to beta blockers, these drugs lower
IOP by relaxing the ciliary muscle to facilitate aqueous humor outflow. If the drug is given more frequently or at a
higher dose, this action can have the opposite effect and decrease the IOP-lowering effect (DailyMed, Latanoprost,
2023).

Latanoprost
The onset of action for latanoprost occurs in about 3-4 hours, and peak effect is reached in 8-12 hours. This drug
has a 24-hour duration of action (DailyMed, Latanoprost, 2023).

Bimatoprost
The actions and adverse effects of bimatoprost are the same as those of latanoprost. When marketed as Latisse, it is
used for the specific purpose of increasing eyelash length, darkening lashes, and making the lashes thicker
(DailyMed, Bimatoprost, 2022).

Travoprost
The actions and adverse effects of travoprost are the same as those of latanoprost. This drug was found to be more
effective in Black clients than in other groups. The reason for this is unknown (DailyMed, Travoprost, 2020).

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
On rare occasions and for reasons unknown, this drug classification can cause migraines. The most common
adverse effect is ocular hyperemia, which is engorgement of ocular blood vessels.

There are two main contraindications: hypersensitivity and active intraocular inflammation. Clients with iritis or
uveitis should not use this drug because the inflammation may worsen, which could have negative effects on vision

      Nursing Implications
      The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking prostaglandin analogues:

      · Assess for ocular changes, including hyperemia, pruritus, conjunctivitis, and visual disturbances.
      · Explain the hyperpigmentation changes that can occur so the client is not alarmed. Be certain the client is

         aware that the hyperpigmentation of the iris is usually permanent, but the darkened skin of the eyelids more
         than likely will resolve.
      · Assess for hypersensitivity reactions, both locally and systemically, including stinging, painful eyes and blurry
         vision.
      · Explain that the medication should be administered at bedtime.
      · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

      CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

      The client taking a prostaglandin analogue should:

          · Notify the health care provider of ocular redness, swelling, or visual changes.
          · Administer the medication at bedtime as ocular pressure is typically highest in the morning, so usage at

              night is a timely intervention to address an expected higher ocular pressure by morning.
          · Observe for the hyperpigmentation changes and increase in eyelash length.

Rho Kinase Inhibitors

This drug class was approved in 2017. It decreases IOP by increasing aqueous humor outflow through the
trabecular meshwork. The exact mechanism is unknown. Clinical trials have shown up to a 5 mm Hg reduction in the
baseline IOP (DailyMed, Rhopressa, 2023).

The 0.02% solution of netarsudil (Rhopressa) is used to reduce IOP in clients with POAG. This drug is typically taken
in the evening because IOP is elevated in the morning. The solution should not be administered while wearing
contact lenses.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Conjunctival hyperemia is the most common ocular adverse effect. Clients may experience discomfort and
erythema in the early phase of treatment; however, these will subside as the drug is continued. Corneal verticillata
(gray-brown opacities) were noted to develop at 4 weeks of therapy. This reaction did not affect visual acuity. Most
corneal verticillata will disappear once the medication is discontinued. Besides the physical aspect, conjunctival
hemorrhage is harmless and will resolve on its own. Other common adverse reactions include conjunctival
hemorrhage, corneal staining, blurred vision, increased lacrimation, and reduced visual acuity. Safety and
effectiveness in clients under age 18 have not been established. Hypersensitivity is currently the only major
contraindication (DailyMed, Rhopressa, 2023).

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking rho kinase inhibitors:

· Inform the client they may experience discomfort and redness upon instillation during the initial treatment

              phase, but this will subside.
          · Encourage the client not to discontinue medication based on the adverse effects without contacting the health

              care provider.
          · Maintain a safe environment to prevent falls.
          · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

              teaching guidelines.

        CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

        The client taking a rho kinase inhibitor should:

            · Notify the health care provider of eye swelling or changes in vision or if they experience conjunctivitis or
                eyelid discomfort.

            · Understand the eye changes are mainly harmless and will subside spontaneously or once the drug is
                stopped.

        The client taking a rho kinase inhibitor should not:

            · Double up on a dose if one is missed because this is not well tolerated.
            · Wear contact lenses during administration and for 15 minutes afterward because the preservative in the

                medication will bind to the contacts.
            · Stop taking the drug without contacting the health care provider.

      Alpha-2 Adrenergic Agonists

      Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists work by reducing aqueous outflow to lower pressure. Combigan is an alpha-2
      adrenergic agonist combined with a beta blocker (timolol). This drug synergistically uses both mechanisms of action
      to reduce IOP. If an ocular beta blocker is contraindicated, an alpha-2 adrenergic agent can be used alone.
      Brimonidine (Alphagan P) has a rapid onset of action with a half-life of 2 hours. Brimonidine reduces aqueous humor
      production and increases uveoscleral outflow in clients with POAG and ocular hypertension. It may have properties
      in delaying optic nerve degeneration and may protect retinal neurons from dying due to ischemia.

      A fixed-dose combination drug consisting of brimonidine and timolol exists. The combination provides an additive
      effect for decreasing the production of aqueous humor. The therapeutic and adverse effects of each drug class are
      discussed previously in this chapter.

      Adverse Effects and Contraindications
      Brimonidine is contraindicated in those under age 2 because they are at a higher risk of CNS depression. Severe
      cardiovascular disease and vascular and cerebral insufficiency can be aggravated by this drug classification
      (DailyMed, Brimonidine, 2023). There has been a causal relationship noted between depression and alpha-2
      agonists. Because the alpha-2 adrenergic receptors are part of the CNS, dilation of the pupils can occur, which will
      further impede the outflow of aqueous humor and exaggerate closed-angle glaucoma.

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking alpha-2 adrenergic agonists:

· Review the client's past medical history and medications.
· Monitor the client's blood pressure and heart rate periodically.
· Assess the client's mental status and alertness.
· Maintain a safe environment and reduce risk of falls.
· Evaluate the upper respiratory system for cough, sinus pressure, dyspnea, and nasal dryness.
· Check for hypersensitivity reaction.
· Emphasize to the client the importance of keeping follow-up appointments with their health care provider.
· Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

   teaching guidelines.

CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

The client taking an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist should:

    · Notify the health care provider of severe headaches, visual disturbance, dizziness, syncope, excessive
        fatigue, difficulty concentrating, or vision changes.

    · Check their blood pressure and heart rate at least weekly while maintaining a log of readings.

The client taking an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist should not:

    · Wear contact lenses during administration and for 15 minutes afterward because the preservative in the
1016  38 · Ophthalmic Drugs

                medication will bind to the contacts.
            · Drive or engage in activity that requires attention and concentration until they know how the medications

                affects them.
            · Get up quickly and ambulate because the drug can cause orthostatic hypotension and dizziness.

INTRODUCTION The human ear is composed of multiple structures that aid in providing balance, spatial sensation,
and hearing. The ear is an extension of the central nervous system. Cognition can be compromised when sound is
not effectively transmitted. This chapter will address the structure and function of the ear, common ear disorders,
and otic medications.

39.1 Introduction to the Ears

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 39.1.1 Describe the structures and functions of the ears.
    · 39.1.2 Identify common types of ear disorders.

Ear Structure and Function

The ear is connected to the central nervous system through inputs from the vestibulocochlear nerve--the eighth
cranial nerve--which transmits sound from the inner ear to the auditory cortex in the temporal lobe of the brain. The
vestibulocochlear nerve splits into the vestibular and cochlear nerves. The vestibular nerve controls motion and
position; the cochlear nerve transmits signals from the cochlea to the temporal lobe in the brain so that sound can
be heard. Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is the most common type of hearing loss and accounts for the majority
of all hearing loss. SNHL refers to any cause of hearing loss due to a pathology of the cochlea, auditory nerve, or
central nervous system (Tanna et al., 2023).
1022  39 · Otic Drugs

      The external ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear comprise the ear, as shown in Figure 39.2. The external ear--also
      called the outer ear, pinna, or auricle--structures include the ear lobe and cartilage. The external ear also consists of
      the external auditory canal, whose function is to transmit sound waves to the eardrum (also called the tympanic
      membrane). The external auditory canal gathers sound from outside the body and transmits it to the middle ear.
      This canal accumulates ear wax that typically self-cleans through daily chewing, grinding, and yawning motions
      (Sevy et al., 2023).

      FIGURE 39.2 Structures of the ear include the external ear, middle ear, and inner ear. (credit: modification of work from Anatomy and
      Physiology 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

      The tympanic membrane is the window from the outer ear into the middle ear. The middle ear consists of the
      tympanic membrane, tympanic cavity, and ossicles, which include three small bones: the malleus, incus, and
      stapes. The purpose of the middle ear is to transmit sound from the tympanic membrane to the inner ear. The
      tympanic cavity surrounds the three ossicles. The malleus, incus, and stapes transmit oscillatory vibrations from
      one small bone to another; the delicate stapes sends sound to the inner ear in a highly coordinated relay system.
      The tympanic membrane can rupture from infection, barotrauma, or the use of cotton swabs.

      The Eustachian tube connects the middle ear to the back of the nose. It has three major functions:

          · To protect the middle ear from infection
          · To equalize air pressure on both sides of the eardrum for normal vibration
          · To drain secretions from the middle ear

      The inner ear is well protected within the temporal bone of the skull. The inner ear consists of the cochlea, the
      semicircular canals, and the vestibular and cochlear nerves. The cochlea translates sound waves into electrical
      impulses through mechanical stimulation of tiny hair cells that the brain can then interpret to recognize sounds. The
      semicircular canals sense head rotations to allow proprioception--the body's ability to sense movement, action, and
      location--and balance. These canals contain fluid known as lymph and must be clear of debris such as small crystals
      called otoliths (Casale et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2020).

      The inner ear is part of the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, clients' complaints about hearing can also be a
      sign of a more serious CNS disease process. The nurse should listen carefully to the client's description of hearing
      issues and communicate concerns with the provider. Muffled hearing can represent a range of concerns from ear
      wax buildup to multiple sclerosis or neurosyphilis (Ramchandani et al., 2020). The nurse must also be aware of the
      ears' structure and function, both within the parameters of normal function and when the client sustains a serious

 The Ear

  Access multimedia content (https://openstax.org/books/pharmacology/pages/39-1-introduction-to-the-ears)
  This 4-minute client education video describes the three parts of the ear: the external ear, the middle ear, and
  the inner ear.

Ear Disorders

This section describes common ear disorders for which pharmacological drops or solutions are prescribed. Selected
common ear conditions for which systemic medications are prescribed will be reviewed as well.

Eustachian Tube Dysfunction and Post-Viral Syndrome
Barotrauma can result in a ruptured eardrum due to Eustachian tube dysfunction, which occurs when the air
pressure in the middle ear does not equalize with ambient pressure. This can occur with sudden pressure changes,
such as when flying or scuba diving. A ruptured eardrum can heal spontaneously or may require surgical
intervention (Cleveland Clinic, 2022a). The Eustachian tube can become blocked during and after an upper
respiratory infection as well. After an upper respiratory infection, the Eustachian tube may remain swollen, causing
pain, muffled sound, or a feeling of fullness in the ear.

Tinnitus
Tinnitus is an ear disorder characterized by ringing or other annoying sounds in the ear. Tinnitus can be age-related,
exacerbated by loud noises, or a result of circulation issues. Some medications can cause tinnitus, and hearing may
not always fully return after stopping the medication. Medications associated with tinnitus include nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), some antibiotics, anticancer medications, and antidepressants (Kim et al., 2021). The
mechanism of these intrusive sounds is related to damaged hairs in the cochlea. Although there is no cure for
tinnitus, there are treatments--including sound generators and stress management--that can help clients better
cope with distracting sounds (Cleveland Clinic, 2022b; National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication
Disorders, n.d.).

Ménière's Disease
Ménière's disease occurs when there is excess fluid in the inner ear. The cause is largely unknown. Ménière's
disease can have a hereditary component, or it can be triggered by viral or bacterial pathogens. This condition is
characterized by hearing loss, vertigo, increased sweating, nausea, and vomiting. The nurse must implement fall
precautions when caring for a client with Ménière's disease because vertigo can predispose them to falls, including
falls with injuries. There is no cure for Ménière's disease, and though it does not affect life expectancy, it interferes
with the client's quality of life. Corticosteroids and antihistamines are offered as potential treatments and have
varying effects (Webster et al., 2023).

Otitis Externa
Otitis externa (also known as swimmer's ear) is an inflammation and/or infection of the external ear canal
characterized by itchiness, pain, and a red ear canal. Otitis externa occurs in swimmers as well as older adults and
those with poorly controlled diabetes. It can be exacerbated by using hearing aids, ear buds, and stethoscopes. The
nurse should report client complaints of itchy, painful ear(s) to the provider because an untreated infection can
spread to the bones and deep tissues of the ear canal and lead to skull osteomyelitis (Bruschini et al., 2019).

Otitis Media
Otitis media is an inflammation or infection of the middle ear. It typically occurs when the client has a cold, upper
respiratory infection, or secondhand smoke exposure. Children are more likely to develop otitis media because of
their horizontal Eustachian tube architecture, which increases the likelihood of fluid being trapped, causing an
infection. Bottle feeding has been identified as a contributing factor to otitis media. Infants that breastfeed have
fewer otitis media infections due to the oligosaccharides that are in breast milk, which function as prebiotics. These
substances help infants develop their immune system to fight off infection. In addition, the breastfeeding infant
utilizes a sucking motion, resulting in a negative pressure vacuum, thereby reducing pooling of breast milk (Bowatte
et al., 2015). Though the incidence of otitis media in adults is less, adults can also develop otitis media. Eustachian
1024  39 · Otic Drugs

      tube edema can narrow the diameter of the tube, allowing fluid to back up to the middle ear.

      There are three major types of otitis media: acute otitis media, otitis media with effusion, and chronic otitis media
      with effusion (Johns Hopkins Medicine, n.d.). Acute otitis media is characterized by ear discomfort, in addition to
      systemic symptoms including fever and pain. Acute otitis media is frequently treated with systemic antibiotics, otic
      antibiotics, or a combination of both.

      Otitis media with effusion occurs when some fluid remains after an infection has cleared and presents as fullness in
      the ear. Often decongestants or nasal steroids are prescribed to treat these symptoms. Antibiotics are not
      appropriate at this stage when no infection persists. The condition may become long-term and return although no
      infection is present.

      Acute otitis media in adults can cause significant complications; therefore, adults are treated with antibiotic therapy
      (Limb et al., 2023). In general, antibiotic therapy is used more judiciously in children to avoid antibiotic resistance
      and side effects.

      Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo
      Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a condition of the inner ear where otoliths--crystals of calcium
      carbonate--migrate into the inner ear fluid and cause a false sense of spinning. Otolith displacement occurs in older
      adults and those with a history of a blow to the head. BPPV is characterized by dizziness and a spinning sensation
      and may result in nausea and vomiting. Long after a head trauma, these symptoms can be triggered by a changing
      head position or keeping the head in one position for an extended period. Episodes can last for a few minutes and
      are disconcerting to the client, who is at risk of falling.

        SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

        Candida auris

        Nurses must be aware of an emerging deadly fungal infection of the ear known as Candida auris. This fungal
        infection was first found in a Japanese person's ear canal in 2009. Since then, there have been more than 3,000
        systemic cases in the United States and more than 7,000 cases where the fungus has been found but has not
        yet caused infection (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023a, 2023b). C. auris must be reported to
        the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for tracking. Cases in the United States have occurred in
        health care settings largely among immunocompromised clients. Current treatment includes a drug class,
        echinocandins, that act on the Candida species. Echinocandins include anidulafungin (Eraxis), caspofungin
        (Cancidas), and micafungin (Mycamine).

      Communicating with a Client with Hearing Impairment

      There are different causes of hearing loss--including congenital hearing loss, aging, prolonged exposure to noise,
      and trauma--that are outside of the scope of this chapter. However, when treating clients with otic medications, the
      client's hearing may be impaired by these medications or by the underlying ear condition the nurse is treating. The
      following guidelines can assist the nurse when working with these clients (UCSF Health, n.d.):

          · Face the client with the hearing impairment directly when communicating.
          · Refrain from talking while in another room or area away from the client.
          · Do not shout; rather, speak slowly, clearly, and distinctly.
          · Pause between concepts to ensure you are understood before continuing.
          · If the hearing-impaired client does not seem to understand a word or phrase, rephrase the message.
          · Avoid interrupting the client.
          · Provide the client with written information such as a schedule and directions and ask them to repeat the

              specifics.

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 39.2.1 Identify the characteristics of anti-inflammatory and anti-infective drugs used to treat ear
        disorders.

    · 39.2.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of anti-inflammatory and anti-
        infective drugs used to treat ear disorders.

    · 39.2.3 Describe nursing implications of anti-inflammatory and anti-infective drugs used to treat ear
        disorders.

    · 39.2.4 Explain the client education related to anti-inflammatory and anti-infective drugs used to treat ear
        disorders.

Otic Anti-inflammatories

Anti-inflammatory drugs block substances in the body that cause inflammation. Otic anti-inflammatories are used
for the treatment of superficial bacterial infections of the external auditory canal (i.e., otitis externa) caused by
susceptible organisms. Anti-inflammatory medications frequently are administered in combination with antibiotics.
A treatment response should occur within 48-72 hours, otherwise the provider should reassess (Medina-Blasini &
Sharman, 2023).

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Adverse effects are rare; however, clients can experience allergic reactions characterized by rash, itching, and
redness. Dizziness may occur. Prolonged usage can result in a superinfection that requires additional medications to
resolve.

Table 39.1 is a drug prototype table for otic anti-inflammatories featuring neomycin and polymyxin B sulfates, and
hydrocortisone otic solution (Cortisporin). It lists drug class, mechanism of action, adult and pediatric dosage,

      Nursing Implications
      The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking otic anti-inflammatories:

          · Recognize and monitor for serious and other potential side effects. Rarely, anaphylaxis can occur with the first
              dose.
                Clients with latex allergies may need to use an alternative (latex-free) dropper for administration.

          · Perform hand hygiene before administering otic anti-inflammatory medication.
          · Educate the client on ear position and time to remain in a lying position after instillation.
          · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

              teaching guidelines.

        CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

        The client taking an otic anti-inflammatory should:

            · If this is the first time using these drugs, administer with another person present for assistance in case a
                serious allergic reaction occurs.

            · Always wash their hands before handling a bottle of otic drops and be mindful of the bottle cap to ensure
                that it remains as germ-free as possible.

            · Roll the bottle of otic drops between their hands for a few moments to warm the drops. Instillation of cold
                drops can cause dizziness.

            · Administer the drops with the pinna in an upward position; it should remain up during otic drop instillation.
            · Keep the ear facing up for about 5 minutes for the drop(s) to bathe the ear canal and minimize the amount

                of medication leakage (Mayo Clinic, 2023).
            · Use a latex-free dropper if they have a latex allergy.

        The client taking an otic anti-inflammatory should not:

            · Heat the drops above body temperature because administering drops that are too warm can damage the
                ear canal.

            · Drive or operate machinery until any occurrences of dizziness and vertigo have subsided.
            · Use cotton swabs in their ears due to the risk of perforation and further irritation and injury (Cleveland

                Clinic, 2022a).
            · Use the medication for longer than the prescribed duration.

      Otic Topical Anti-infectives

      Otic anti-infectives are indicated for clients who have otitis externa. Topical anti-infectives are prescribed to treat
      bacterial infections but are ineffective for viral infections. If the infection does not improve after 1 week of
      treatment, cultures and susceptibility tests should be repeated to verify the identity of the organism and to
      determine whether the therapy should be changed.

      Table 39.2 lists common otic topical anti-infectives and typical routes and dosing for adult and pediatric clients.

      Nursing Implications
      The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking otic anti-infectives:

      · Recognize and monitor for serious and potential side effects, primarily a rash or any evidence of
         hypersensitivity to quinolones. Anaphylaxis can occur. Clients with latex allergies need to use a latex-free
         dropper to administer.

      · Perform hand hygiene before administering.
      · Educate the client on ear position and time to remain in a lying position after instillation.
      · Monitor complete blood count, if ordered, for decreased eosinophils.
      · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

         teaching guidelines.

      CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

      The client taking an otic topical anti-infective should:

          · Report ear pain or worsening of itching to the health care provider; they may need an ear swab to test for
              superinfection if used for an extended period.

          · Always wash their hands before handling a bottle of otic drops and be mindful of the bottle cap to ensure
              that it remains as germ-free as possible.

          · Roll the bottle of otic drops between hands for a few moments to warm the drops. Instillation of cold

This video from Tacoma Community College demonstrates the proper procedure for administering otic
medication to an adult client.

For pediatric clients, review these instructions from the American Academy of Pediatrics (https://openstax.org/r/
healthychildren).

Systemic Anti-infectives for Infections of the Ear

Systemic otic anti-infectives are indicated for clients who have otitis media. Acute otitis media in adults can cause
significant complications; therefore, most adults are treated with antibiotic therapy (Limb et al., 2023). Antibiotic
therapy is used more judiciously in children to avoid antibiotic resistance and side effects. High-dose amoxicillin is
the first-line choice for both children and adults (Danishyar & Ashurst, 2023). If high-dose amoxicillin is not
effective, high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate is the second-line treatment. For clients with penicillin allergies or non-
responders, azithromycin or cefdinir are two alternatives that can be considered.

Table 39.4 lists common otic systemic anti-infectives and typical routes and dosing for adult and pediatric clients.

      Nursing Implications
      The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking systemic anti-infectives for otic conditions:

      · Recognize and monitor for serious and potential side effects including signs of allergic reactions and new
         onset of diarrhea.

      · Follow dosing instructions carefully, particularly with amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin). Different forms of
         Augmentin contain different amounts of amoxicillin but the same amounts of clavulanic acid, so the strengths
         are not interchangeable. For example, two 250 mg Augmentin tablets are not the equivalent of a 500 mg
         tablet. If a client is prescribed 500 mg, the client must take the 500 mg tablet, not two 250 mg tablets.

      · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client
         teaching guidelines.

      CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

      The client taking an otic systemic anti-infective should:

          · Report episodes of diarrhea to their health care provider.
          · Take all their antibiotic(s) as prescribed.
          · Keep follow-up appointments.

      The client an otic systemic anti-infective should not:

          · Share antibiotics with others.

    · 39.3.4 Explain the client education related to antihistamines, decongestants, and cerumenolytic drugs
        used to treat ear disorders.

Antihistamines

Antihistamines decrease congestion of mucous membranes, which might decrease corresponding obstruction of
tubes within the ear. Antihistamines are used primarily to treat allergies and manage symptoms related to upper
respiratory infections. Selected first-generation antihistamines are included here. Please refer to Upper Respiratory
Disorder Drugs for a more detailed review of antihistamine medications.

Table 39.6 lists common antihistamines for ear disorders and typical routes and dosing for adult and pediatric
clients.

Drug              Routes and Dosage Ranges

Chlorpheniramine  Adults and children 12 years: 4 mg tablet orally every 4-6 hours as needed. Maximum
      maleate     dose: 6 tablets/day.
                  Children 6-12 years: ½ of a 4 mg tablet every 4-6 hours. Maximum dose: 3 tablets/day.
(Chlor-Trimeton)  Children <6 years: Do not use.

   Cetirizine     Adults and children >6 years: 10 mg once daily; do not take more than 10 mg in 24 hours. A
hydrochloride     5 mg product may be appropriate for less severe symptoms.

    (Zyrtec)

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
The use of antihistamines in clients with hypertension can further increase blood pressure. Clients at risk for cardiac
dysrhythmia, such as a prolonged QT interval on an electrocardiogram, should communicate with their provider
before taking a first-generation antihistamine like diphenhydramine due to potential proarrhythmic effects
(Williamson, 2022). Since antihistamines have a drying effect, clients with glaucoma and urinary retention should
avoid taking an antihistamine. Antihistamines exacerbate the sedating effects of tranquilizers and alcohol, which
can lead to respiratory depression and injuries from falls. Due to antihistamines' blocking effects on acetylcholine,
they can also cause constipation.

      TABLE 39.7 Drug Prototype Table: Diphenhydramine (source: https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/)

      Nursing Implications
      The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking antihistamines:

      · Monitor the client for potential side effects including drowsiness or oversedation.
      · Educate the client to refrain from driving or operating machinery while taking these medications because they

         can cause drowsiness and impair cognitive function.
      · Educate the client to guard against potential constipation by increasing fiber and fluid intake.
      · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

         teaching guidelines.

      CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

      The client taking an antihistamine should:

          · Be aware that antihistamines can cause drowsiness.
          · Keep fluids or hard candy on hand to manage symptoms of dry mouth.
          · Maintain adequate fiber and fluid intake to reduce likelihood of experiencing constipation.

      The client taking an antihistamine should not:

          · Drive or operate machinery when feeling drowsy.

      Decongestants

      Decongestants are medications that shrink swollen blood vessels and tissues in the nose to reduce nasal
      congestion, which can facilitate drainage to relieve ear congestion. They can be used to manage symptoms of an
      upper respiratory illness or prophylactically when flying to decrease discomfort associated with changes in air
      pressure. These medications should be used with caution in clients with a history of heart disease, thyroid disorder,
      diabetes, or hypertension. Alternatives include using saline nasal spray, room humidification, or being in a room with

a hot shower running that creates a steamy environment. (For more detailed information on decongestants, please
see Upper Respiratory Disorder Drugs.)

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Decongestants should be avoided in clients who have a history of hypertension or heart disease because these
medications can raise blood pressure and stimulate the heart. They can increase intraocular pressure in clients who
have glaucoma; particularly among clients with benign prostatic hypertrophy, decongestants can inhibit the ability to
void.

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking decongestants:

· Monitor the client's blood pressure, especially if they have a history of hypertension, and report elevated
   readings to the provider.

· Monitor the client's blood glucose levels if the client has diabetes and report elevated readings to the provider.
· Be aware that decongestants can raise intraocular pressure. This can be especially concerning for clients with

   glaucoma. Assess the client for any visual changes, eye pain or irritation, or headache. Report any findings to
   the provider.
1034  39 · Otic Drugs

       · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client
           teaching guidelines.

      CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

      The client taking a decongestant should:

          · Talk to their health care provider before starting a decongestant, especially if underlying health conditions
              exist.

          · Check their blood pressure while taking decongestants if they have prehypertension/hypertension.
          · Monitor their blood glucose levels while taking decongestants if they have prediabetes/diabetes.
          · If they have glaucoma, check with their ophthalmologist about decongestant use and report any visual

              changes, eye pain, or headache.
          · Take decongestants for the shortest amount of time possible and do not take multiple decongestants from

              different decongestant classes.
          · Clients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) and decongestants can experience hypertensive

              crisis (Edinoff et al., 2022).

      Otic Cerumenolytics

      Typically, the body naturally expels earwax; however, sometimes a buildup occurs requiring the administration of
      medication to facilitate its removal. A commonly prescribed cerumenolytic is carbamide peroxide (Debrox). The
      drops work by releasing oxygen to soften and encourage spontaneous extrusion of cerumen. They also have a weak
      antibacterial effect.

      Table 39.9 is a drug prototype table for otic cerumenolytics featuring carbamide peroxide. It lists drug class,
      mechanism of action, adult and pediatric dosage, indications, therapeutic effects, drug and food interactions,

INTRODUCTION The skin, in addition to being the largest organ of the body, is a very complex organ that serves as
the body's primary defense system. Maintaining healthy skin prevents organisms from entering a host's body to
cause infections. Any disruption in the skin's integrity creates an open portal for transmission of disease. In addition
to protection, the skin aids in thermoregulation, reception of sensory stimuli, and excretion of wastes. This chapter
will explore common disruptions of the skin and their associated treatments that promote healthy skin.

40.1 Introduction to the Skin and Its Function

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 40.1.1 Discuss the skin and its two major layers.
    · 40.1.2 Identify the five layers of the epidermis and their purposes.
    · 40.1.3 Describe the two layers of the dermis and their purposes.
    · 40.1.4 Explain the role of the hypodermis as it relates to the skin and dermatologic disorders.
The epidermis, the dermis, and the hypodermis are the layers that comprise the skin. The foundation of the skin is
known as the hypodermis (also subcutaneous tissue or superficial fascia). The hypodermis is composed of fatty
tissues and membranes that hold the dermis to the underlying muscle (see Figure 40.2).
1040  40 · Dermatologic Disorder Drugs

      FIGURE 40.2 The three basic skin layers are the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis. (credit: modification of work from Anatomy and
      Physiology 2e. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

      Above the hypodermis lies the dermis. The dermis is rich in vascularity, nerves, and sensory receptors embedded in
      a more elastic, collagenous system of fibers. The bottom dermal sublayer--the reticular layer--is much thicker and
      more vascular than the other skin layers and contains more nerve and sensory functions. The uppermost
      sublayer--the papillary layer--contains papillae, which extend upward into the epidermis to hold the dermis and
      epidermis together. The papillary layer also contains phagocytes, which act to destroy bacteria that may penetrate
      the epidermis. New dermal growth pushes skin cells through the dermis and upward into the epidermis.

      The epidermis is the outermost layer of skin comprising the external skin surface of humans. Unlike the dermis, the
      epidermis does not contain blood vessels and nerves, but is composed mainly of cellular sublayers that protect the
      dermis. The basal layer (stratum basale) is the foundation of the epidermis in areas where the stratum lucidum is
      not present. (The stratum lucidum is an additional layer that provides a thicker layer of epidermis in areas that need
      more protection, such as the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.) The basal layer is the only epidermal
      sublayer that is not made from keratin cells. This layer bonds to the dermis to connect it to epidermal tissues. The
      remaining sublayers of the epidermis are composed of keratinocytes, cells that are protein based, giving rise to hair,
      nail, and skin cells that are strong and water-resistant. Just above the basal layer is the spinous layer (stratum
      spinosum), which is composed of a depth of 8-10 cells that have spiny processes that help to hold the cell layers
      together. Encompassed in this layer are Langerhans cells, which eliminate foreign bacteria and wastes that enter
      the spinous layer, providing protection from invading organisms.

      Human skin has a high mitotic rate and has more rapid cell development and cell death than many other body
      tissues. In addition to rapid growth, skin cells travel from the dermis through the epidermis until they die and are
      shed from the outermost skin surface. The third sublayer of the epidermis is the granular layer (stratum
      granulosum), which is composed of a depth of 3-5 keratinous cells that are flatter and more protein based than the
      other sublayers. These cells essentially die, leaving behind a fibrous protein layer that gives rise to the fourth layer,
      the cornified layer (stratum corneum). The cornified layer is the outermost layer that forms the visible, external skin
      and is 20-30 cells thick (Yousef et al., 2022).

      When conditions threaten skin integrity, prompt diagnosis and treatment enable the primary defense of the body
      systems to remain strong. As skin integrity becomes compromised, bacteria, other organisms, and contaminating
      substances may enter the body through breaks in the skin. Dermatologic medications assist in healing breaks in the
      skin, preventing infection, and maintaining healthy skin.

  treatment for people of color. Skin conditions in darker-skinned individuals often present differently than in
 lighter-skinned individuals. This article from American Family Physician (https://openstax.org/r/aafporg)

  clients with darker skin (Frazier et al., 2023).

40.2 Acne Drugs

LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

    · 40.2.1 Identify the characteristics of drugs used to treat acne.
    · 40.2.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of drugs used to treat acne.
    · 40.2.3 Describe nursing implications of drugs used to treat acne.
    · 40.2.4 Explain the client education related to drugs used to treat acne.

Acne vulgaris (acne) is a skin condition in which sebum--dead skin cells--and bacteria accumulate in a skin pore.
The pore becomes clogged and allows bacterial growth, which causes the surrounding skin to erupt in skin lesions
or vesicles. Although acne is typically considered a condition of adolescents and young adults, occasionally it may
continue into adulthood, especially in female clients. Oily skin, hormonal changes, family history, and some
medications may cause or exacerbate acne. Acne presents as multiple pustules, papules, or nodules on the skin,
particularly on the face but also on the back, upper arms, and trunk (Sutaria et al., 2023). Figure 40.3 shows the
development of acne within a pore.

FIGURE 40.3 Acne is a result of overproductive sebaceous glands, which leads to the formation of pustules and inflammation of the skin.

Effective treatment of acne begins with proper skin hygiene. In addition to cleansing and exfoliating the skin,
treatment also focuses on reducing inflammation and decreasing bacteria on the skin. Both systemic and topical
medications are used to manage acne to achieve these goals.

Systemic Acne Drugs

Systemic medications for the treatment of acne consist mainly of oral anti-infectives used to reduce bacterial
colonization in skin pores. This reduces inflammation and infection, allowing pustules and lesions to heal while also
preventing further development of acne. These anti-infectives include tetracyclines such as tetracycline
hydrochloride, minocycline hydrochloride, and doxycycline. Clindamycin, a lincosamide antibiotic, may also be used.
1042  40 · Dermatologic Disorder Drugs

      Drugs such as these specifically treat organisms affecting the skin, including streptococcal and staphylococcal
      bacteria.

      Table 40.1 lists common systemic acne drugs and typical routes and dosing for adult and pediatric clients.

Topical Acne Drugs

Topical acne medications are often used in combination with systemic acne medications to provide better
management of acne. Topical therapy is applied directly to the skin that is affected by the presence of acne lesions.
Azelaic acid 15% and benzoyl peroxide 2.5% are used in both acne and rosacea to eliminate bacteria and decrease
inflammation as well as to reduce oil on the skin. Salicylic acid, another topical treatment, assists in acne treatment
by exfoliating dead skin cells to reduce pore blockages, reducing inflammation, and decreasing sebum secretion.
Adapalene 1% topical ointment, when applied to the areas affected by acne, helps to differentiate skin cells and
reduces the accumulation of cells in skin pores. Tazarotene, another topical treatment for acne, is thought to assist
with reducing fine lines and discolorations in the skin. It is thought that this medication may also play a role in the
reduction of scarring from acne lesions. Tretinoin 0.025% ointment, a retinoid, benefits clients undergoing
treatment for severe acne. The actions of topical retinoids are not fully understood but are thought to increase cell
mitosis and decrease cell cohesion to prevent clogging of skin pores (DailyMed, Tretinoin, 2019).

      Adverse Effects and Contraindications
      Adverse effects for topical acne medications most often involve localized skin redness, scaling, itching, and burning.
      These may worsen when adapalene is used concomitantly with other substances that cause irritation or dry skin.
      For this reason, contraindications include the use of other non-approved substances, soaps, and cleansers that
      cause skin irritation. Other contraindications are sun or other ultraviolent light and the use of occlusive
      dressings--those that do not allow air or moisture to get in or out.

  SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
  Topical Acne Drugs

  Adolescents using topical acne medications are at high risk of discontinuing treatment prematurely because of
  improved symptoms, side effects, and the need to use multiple products or treatments. Research suggests that
  monotherapy, treatment with oral medications, and/or anticipatory guidance on side effects can increase an
  adolescent client's adherence to the prescribed therapy.

  (Source: Habeshian & Cohan, 2020)

Nursing Implications

The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking acne drugs:

    · Assess and thoroughly document skin condition baseline.
    · Assess and monitor the client for adverse effects, drug and food interactions, and contraindications.
    · Evaluate and document the client's response to current treatment and overall improvement of skin condition.
    · Assess the psychosocial impact of acne on individual clients.
    · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client

        teaching guidelines.

  CLIENT TEACHING GUIDELINES

  The client taking a systemic acne medication should:

      · Take prescribed medications exactly as directed.
      · Report side effects such as skin redness, excessive dryness, or peeling to their health care provider.
      · Use birth control methods as instructed and avoid pregnancy.
      · Refrain from breastfeeding.
      · Follow up with appointments as instructed.

  The client taking a topical acne medication should:

      · Take prescribed medications exactly as directed.
      · Report side effects such as skin redness, excessive dryness, or peeling to their health care provider.
      · Cleanse skin thoroughly before applying medication.
      · Apply only a thin layer of medications to the affected areas only.
      · Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes.

      40.3 Psoriatic Drugs

      LEARNING OUTCOMES
      By the end of this section, you should be able to:

          · 40.3.1 Identify the characteristics of drugs used to treat psoriasis.
          · 40.3.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of drugs used to treat

              psoriasis.
          · 40.3.3 Describe nursing implications of drugs used to treat psoriasis.
          · 40.3.4 Explain the client education related to drugs used to treat psoriasis.

      Psoriasis is a T-lymphocyte-mediated autoimmune disease that mainly affects the skin. In many cases, however, it
      also affects the eyes, joints, and nails. Plaque psoriasis is the subtype of psoriasis that affects the skin. In this
      condition, skin cells mature faster than normal, resulting in white-silvery plaques on body surfaces with red,
      erythematous lesions below (see Figure 40.4). The head and scalp, eyes, elbows, knees, and back are primarily
      affected by these plaques. Plaque psoriasis may range from very mild with few lesions to severe, with large areas of
      disfiguring plaques. Treatment of psoriasis involves combination systemic and topical therapies used to decrease
      inflammation, exfoliate skin plaques, and decrease the mitotic rate and maturation of skin cells.

      FIGURE 40.4 Psoriatic plaques can be widespread on the body. (credit: "The back of this patient displayed numerous erythematous
      patches dispersed over the entirety of his back that was diagnosed as a case of psoriasis, an erythematous skin condition characterized by
      irregular red patches covered by a dry scaly hyperkeratotic stratum corneum."/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Public Domain)

      Systemic Psoriatic Drugs

      Systemic drugs used in the treatment of psoriasis include methoxsalen and acitretin. Methoxsalen is not effective as
      a monotherapy. It is used in combination with ultraviolet (UV) light therapy to increase its effects. A safety concern
      with the use of this medication is that when clients are exposed to other sources of UV light, such as the sun, they
      may experience severe skin burns. Methoxsalen is reserved for treatment of severe psoriasis that has been
      nonresponsive to other therapies.
      Acitretin, a retinoid, may be used alone or in combination with UV therapy or other medications to treat severe,
      refractory psoriasis. Like other retinoids, acitretin requires very specific monitoring and prescribing limitations,
      especially with consideration of reproductive health. Prescriptions cannot be given until pregnancy tests and other
      screenings have been completed and results verified (DailyMed, Acitretin, 2023).
      Table 40.5 lists common systemic psoriatic drugs and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.

Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Systemic psoriatic drugs that are classified as retinoids may cause systemic effects such as hypersensitivities,
hypervitaminosis A syndrome, myocardial infarction, stroke, thromboembolism, neuropathy, yeast infections,
capillary leak syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis, and skin fragility. These drugs are contraindicated in clients with pre-
existing cardiac, renal, and hepatic conditions. As mentioned, methoxsalen may cause severe burning of the skin
when clients are exposed to UV light. Use in clients receiving UV treatments and who are exposed to the sun may be
contraindicated or require dose reductions. Retinoids, such as acitretin, are contraindicated for those who could
become pregnant, are pregnant, or are breastfeeding.

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking systemic psoriatic drugs:
1048  40 · Dermatologic Disorder Drugs

          · Ensure that clients have met required screening to receive prescriptions for systemic psoriatic medications.
          · Assess and thoroughly document baseline skin condition.
          · Assess and monitor the client for adverse effects, drug and food interactions, and contraindications.
          · Evaluate and document the client's response to current treatment and overall improvement of skin condition.
          · Assess the psychosocial impact of psoriasis on individual clients.
          · Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See the end of this

              section for client teaching guidelines.

      Topical Psoriatic Drugs

      Topical therapies for treating psoriasis decrease the mitotic rate and differentiation of skin cells in the epidermis.
      Calcipotriene, a vitamin D analog, blocks vitamin D receptors in the skin to decrease skin cell production. Clobetasol,
      a topical steroid, reduces inflammation associated with psoriasis. This medication is only used in clients over 12
      years of age. Application of clobetasol is limited to those areas that are not on the face, genitals, and axillae. It is
      important to remember that clients may experience systemic steroidal effects. For this reason, clobetasol should be
      limited to use for 2 weeks or less.

      Coal tar is another topical medication that treats the itching, redness, and scaliness associated with psoriasis. Coal
      tar, along with anthralin, should not be applied to the skin surrounding the psoriatic lesions. Petrolatum or zinc oxide
      ointments may be used to coat the normal surrounding tissues before medication administration to protect the
      normal tissue. Tazarotene, as with treatment for acne, is thought to assist with reducing discolorations in the skin
      and may also play a role in reduction of scarring from psoriatic lesions.

      Table 40.7 lists common topical psoriatic drugs and typical routes and dosing for adult and pediatric clients.

      Drug                              Routes and Dosage Ranges

      Adverse Effects and Contraindications
      Topical treatments for psoriasis are contraindicated for areas of open skin, mucous membranes, genitals, and the
      face. Adverse effects may be related to improper use of these medications. Applying too much or too often may
      cause excessive drying and irritation of the skin. Redness, flaking, or broken areas may also develop with improper
      use (DailyMed, Tazarotene, 2023).

Nursing Implications
The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking topical psoriatic drugs:

· Assess and thoroughly document baseline skin condition.
· Observe for hypersensitivity reactions or worsening of symptoms.
· Assess for prolonged use or excessive application by clients.
· Evaluate and document the client's response to current treatment and overall improvement of skin condition.
· Assess the psychosocial impact of psoriasis on individual clients.
· Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See the end of this

   section for client teaching guidelines.

Biologic Psoriatic Drugs

Biologic response modifiers and monoclonal antibodies are used in the treatment of psoriasis and other
autoimmune diseases to reduce inflammation. Etanercept and infliximab decrease inflammation in psoriasis by
inhibiting the action of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), substances within the body that stimulate immune responses
and produce inflammatory effects. Adalimumab and ustekinumab are monoclonal antibodies that help to decrease
inflammation as well but do so by affecting T-cell response through the inhibition of interleukin-12 and
interleukin-23.

Table 40.9 lists common biologic psoriatic drugs and typical routes and dosing for adult and pediatric clients.

Drug                                                  Routes and Dosage Ranges

      The use of biologic drugs in psoriasis is associated with hypersensitivity reactions to the proteins that comprise
      these drugs. Because these drugs suppress the immune system to reduce inflammation, they can increase a client's
      risk for serious, often life-threatening infections. Additionally, the immunosuppressive effects can cause secondary
      malignancies to develop, especially lymphomas. These medications are contraindicated for those clients who have
      infections, immunosuppressive conditions, or who may be taking other immunosuppressive treatments.

      By the end of this section, you should be able to:

          · 40.4.1 Identify the characteristics of drugs used to treat miscellaneous dermatologic disorders and
              burns.

          · 40.4.2 Explain the indications, actions, adverse reactions, and interactions of drugs used to treat
              miscellaneous dermatologic disorders and burns.

          · 40.4.3 Describe nursing implications of drugs used to treat miscellaneous dermatologic disorders and
              burns.

          · 40.4.4 Explain the client education related to drugs used to treat miscellaneous dermatologic disorders
              and burns.

      In addition to acne and psoriasis, there are other common skin conditions for which clients may receive treatment.
      In this chapter they are divided into miscellaneous dermatologic conditions and burns.

      Miscellaneous Dermatologic Disorders

      This section focuses on the most common dermatological disorders not yet discussed, including cutaneous warts,
      atopic dermatitis (eczema), contact dermatitis, impetigo, and rosacea.

      Cutaneous Warts
      Cutaneous warts are a form of localized viral infection, resulting in the familiar raised lesions known as warts
      (Figure 40.5). Current therapies in the treatment of warts include medications that chemically burn these lesions,
      thus eliminating them. Cantharidin is one such drug. As a vesicant, cantharidin causes local tissue necrosis on those
      surfaces to which it is applied. This necrosis will eventually result in the sloughing of the wart and elimination of the
      virus.

      FIGURE 40.5 A cutaneous wart has an irregular shape and surface. (credit: "Filiform wart on the eyelid" by Schweintechnik/Wikimedia
      Commons, Public Domain)

      Atopic Dermatitis (Eczema)
      Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is another skin condition that requires pharmacological treatment. Unlike conditions
      characterized solely by local irritation, atopic dermatitis is a systemic disease that has genetic predispositions,
      involves the immune system, and also has environmental influences. This condition has also been linked to other
      disorders, including asthma and hay fever (National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases,

      Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                         40.4 · Other Dermatologic Condition Drugs and Topical Anti-infectives for Burns  1053

2022). The etiology is not clearly understood, but treatment involves using oral and topical medications to relieve
the characteristic lesions of atopic dermatitis (Figure 40.6). Hydrocortisone and pimecrolimus are often used
topically to treat atopic dermatitis.

FIGURE 40.6 Atopic dermatitis/eczema characteristically appears as red, dry patches. (credit: "This image depicts a close view of a
cutaneous lesion known as nummular eczema, which also goes by the names nummular dermatitis, or discoid eczema, which presents
itself as round [PHIL 16526], or oval-shaped erythematous, itchy patches" by Susan Lindsley/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
Public Domain)

Contact Dermatitis
Contact dermatitis is an acute inflammation caused by aggravating factors that results in swollen, red, itchy lesions
(Figure 40.7). Substances that may cause contact dermatitis include, but are not limited to, soaps, cosmetics,
jewelry, and poison ivy/oak. Treatment focuses on decreasing inflammation and providing comfort and decreased
pain and itching. Hydrocortisone, when applied to areas of contact dermatitis, acts to decrease inflammation,
relieving the red, warm, edematous symptoms. In addition to hydrocortisone or other corticosteroid ointments,
calamine lotion also may be used to reduce itching and promote healing. This solution is made by combining zinc
oxide and ferric oxide, which, when applied to the skin, soothes the affected area and reduces itching and burning at
the site.

      FIGURE 40.7 Contact dermatitis is acute inflammation resulting from direct contact with irritants. (credit: "This photograph depicts an
      individual's arm with a blistering poison oak rash."/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Public Domain)

      Impetigo
      Impetigo is a cutaneous bacterial infection that occurs on the upper surface of the skin (Figure 40.8). Typically,
      impetigo is seen in infants and children, although it may occasionally be seen in adults. The causative organisms are
      most often Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria. Treatment encompasses application of
      mupirocin, a topical antibacterial. Retapamulin, another topical anti-infective used in impetigo, selectively inhibits
      protein synthesis to stop bacterial growth. Topical treatment with these agents usually clears impetigo, but if
      impetigo persists and is severe, oral antibiotics may be needed.

      FIGURE 40.8 Impetigo is characterized by vesicles, pustules, or bullae that rupture, producing sores covered by honey-colored crusts.

Rosacea
Rosacea is a skin condition that develops from an inflammatory process, causing redness, swelling, prominent small
vessels, and papular lesions on the face (Figure 40.9). Metronidazole, an antifungal, is used in the treatment of
rosacea to reduce redness and inflammatory lesions. Nurses should note that when absorbed systemically,
metronidazole interacts negatively with many other medicines. When alcoholic beverages are mixed with
metronidazole, a life-threatening disulfiram-like reaction may occur, resulting in palpitations, diaphoresis, flushing,
nausea, and tachycardia (Stokes & Abdijadid, 2019). Sodium sulfacetamide, another treatment for rosacea, is
antibacterial in function and is used to cleanse the skin and eliminate bacteria. Clients with sulfa allergies should
not use sodium sulfacetamide.

FIGURE 40.9 Rosacea, consisting of red bumps and broken blood vessels, occurs on the face. (credit:"Rosacea. Erythema and
telangiectasia are seen over the cheeks, nasolabial area and nose. Inflammatory papules and pustules can be observed over the nose. The

      SAFETY ALERT

      Topical Steroids

      When using topical steroids, the application sites should not be covered with an occlusive dressing. Breathable
      gauze dressings may be used. Topical corticosteroids are meant to exert a local effect; however, when these
      medications are covered with an occlusive dressing, systemic absorption may occur, leading to systemic side
      effects of the drug.

      Adverse Effects and Contraindications
      Adverse effects associated with topical medications for skin disorders include hypersensitivities. This is especially
      associated with mupirocin. Localized irritation, redness, and peeling may be noted with these medications as well.
      When covered with occlusive dressings, clients may experience systemic absorption, resulting in the likelihood of
      systemic effects. For this reason, occlusive dressings are contraindicated.

      Steroid compounds are contraindicated in fungal infections. Long-term use of pimecrolimus, a calcineurin inhibitor,
      has been associated with the development of lymphomas. For this reason, long-term use is contraindicated.

and mafenide acetate are two topical anti-infectives used in the treatment and prevention of infection for localized
second- and third-degree burns. As with sodium sulfacetamide, these medications are sulfa compounds that should
not be administered to those with sulfa allergies. The nurse should take care to maintain a sterile environment when
applying these medications to aid in preventing bacterial transfer to the client. To remain effective, burns should be
completely covered with cream at all times to prevent bacterial colonization (DailyMed, Sulfamylon, 2023).

APPENDIX A

International System of Units

The International System of Units (abbreviated SI for Système Internationale) is a system of units of measurement
that was established in 1960 and consists of base units and derived units of measurement. This system, more
commonly known as the metric system, is periodically updated and maintained by the General Conference on
Weights and Measures (GCWM).

The SI system is the most widely used measurement system internationally; however, the United States has not fully
adopted the system. It continues to use the U.S. customary system of measurement, except in health care. The
common base units and derived units include body mass index, length, mass, temperature, and volume. Table A1
shows the common units derived from the SI and used in health care. Table A2 shows the common prefixes for this
system.

For additional information on the SI system, refer to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
(https://openstax.org/r/nistgovpml) website.

ANSWER KEY

Chapter 1

Case Study

1. b. The client is well above the recommended 4 grams/day dose based on the manufacturer's

recommendation for acetaminophen. Taking the drug every 4 hours equates to taking the drug six times/day

(                 ). Taking more than 4 grams of acetaminophen in 24 hours can cause acute

liver problems. Educating the client about the importance of safe dosing guidelines can prevent future

problems.

2. c. Visits to health care providers may be reduced when clients self-medicate, following the directions that

come with the medication, for minor ailments.

Review Questions

 1. d. Acetaminophen is the generic form of the drug Tylenol, and they have the same active ingredients. Either
      formulation would be acceptable.

 2. b. Both drugs belong under Schedule II and are highly addictive.
 3. b. Ibuprofen is the generic name for Motrin; Motrin is the brand or trade name for ibuprofen. The chemical

      name for ibuprofen is 2-(4-isobutylphenyl) propanoic acid.
 4. a. Generic drugs have the same active ingredients but may have different inactive ingredients.
 5. d. Decreased GI motility causes increased transit time in the gut, which increases the time for absorption of

      the drug. Toxicity may result.
 6. c. Toxicity is the greatest concern in this older client who is also underweight. Therefore, this client may

      require a lower dose of the drug.
 7. b. IP collaboration has many advantages, including decreased hospitalization costs, improved client safety,

      and improved communication regarding team goals.
 8. a. The FDA is the regulatory agency tasked with the responsibility of ensuring that all drugs are safe and

      effective for all individuals across the lifespan.
 9. b. Phase II incorporates a relatively small number of volunteers with the disease the drug is designed to treat.
10. b. The first action by the nurse should be to assess the client's medication history and whether or not the

      client is taking the medications as prescribed. All other actions will be performed, but the assessment should
      be completed first.

        drug levels rise because they are not properly eliminated from the body.
    7. d. A narrow therapeutic index indicates that it has a narrow safety margin, thus requiring frequent monitoring

        for drug toxicity.
    8. c. Because a portion of an oral dose of a medication is inactivated by the first-pass effect in the liver, a drug

        that has been administered IV may now require a larger oral dose to achieve a therapeutic effect.
    9. d. The best course of action is to request the pharmacy to send up a liquid form of the medicine because that
1072 Answer Key

Review Questions

    1. c. Targeted therapy is administered to selectively kill cancer cells without harming healthy cells.
    2. a. The nurse should continue with the treatment because the client's lifetime total of doxorubicin is within the

        maximum lifetime limit of 550 mg/m2.
    3. a. Leucovorin is administered with fluorouracil to enhance the effectiveness of fluorouracil.
    4. d. To avoid infection, the client with myelosuppression should avoid cat litter boxes.
    5. c. Pembrolizumab heightens T-lymphocyte activity, predisposing clients to the development of immune-

        mediated conditions.
    6. c. Tumor lysis syndrome occurs when cancer cells are destroyed, releasing cellular debris and electrolytes

        into the blood, resulting in hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis.
    7. d. Tamoxifen, an antiestrogen administered to treat breast cancers that are hormone-receptor positive, is

        taken for 5 years.
    8. b. Doxorubicin should not be administered to clients who have a left ventricular ejection fraction less than

        55%. Since this client has an ejection fraction of 58%, the nurse would administer the medication as
        prescribed.
    9. b. Because this client has a low absolute neutrophil count, the nurse anticipates an order for filgrastim to
        stimulate stem cell production of white blood cells.
  10. a. Rituximab has a high risk for causing a sensitivity reaction, so the client must be premedicated with
        diphenhydramine and acetaminophen.

Review Questions

    1. b. The central nervous system (CNS) is composed of the brain and the spinal cord. Therefore, the nurse would
        recognize that an ischemic stroke involves deficits originating in the CNS.

    2. d. The cerebellum, located below the cerebrum, controls coordination of movement and postural adjustment.
    3. a. The cervical vertebrae are located in the neck region of the body.
    4. d. The autonomic nervous system regulates involuntary responses by regulating cardiac muscle and smooth

        muscle contraction in addition to gland activity.
    5. c. The parasympathetic nervous system, or "rest and digest" system, is activated when the body is relaxed

        and not under actual or perceived stress.
    6. b. The sympathetic nervous system, or "fight or flight system," is activated when the body is under actual or

        perceived stress to ready the body's response to a potential threat.
    7. b. Neurotransmission is the nervous system's communication process by which electrical signals are sent

        down the axon and transformed into chemical messengers.
    8. a. The most common neurotransmitters of the autonomic nervous system are acetylcholine and

        norepinephrine.
    9. b. Medications that stimulate the release of acetylcholine are known as parasympathomimetic due to their

        mimicking of the parasympathetic nervous system.
  10. d. The beta1 adrenergic receptor would be indicated in this instance. Specifically, this medication would be a

        beta1 blocker.

Chapter 10

Case Study

    1. c. These drugs prevent the enzyme cholinesterase from breaking down ACh, allowing more of this
        neurotransmitter to accumulate in the synapses and continuing to stimulate the cholinergic receptors at the
        NMJ. This stimulation causes increased skeletal muscle contraction.

    2. b. MG is an autoimmune disease in which the client produces antibodies that destroy functional receptors at
        the NMJ, causing muscle weakness.
1076 Answer Key

Review Questions

    1. a. The drug will cross the blood-brain barrier, has a 70-hour half-life, and is unaffected by oral intake.
    2. b. Because a decreased level of ACh is present in this disease, decreasing the action of AChE can help reduce

        the symptoms because less ACh will be broken down.
    3. a. The patch needs to be changed every 24 hours, not weekly. All the other options are correct statements.
    4. b. Memantine is an NMDA receptor antagonist. When too much calcium enters the cell, it makes it extremely

        excitable, interfering with cognition. Too much calcium is toxic. Normally, glutamate binds to the NMDA
        receptors for a brief period, allowing the calcium channel to open. Glutamate then dissociates from the
        receptors and magnesium binds to the NMDA receptors, closing the calcium channel and preventing further
        calcium from entering.
    5. c. Propranolol is a nonselective beta blocker; therefore, one would be concerned about extremely low heart
        rate plus bronchoconstriction.
    6. b. There is a potential for serious and life-threatening skin rashes when using this drug. Stevens-Johnson
        syndrome, a disorder of the skin and mucous membranes characterized by a painful rash that disseminates,
        is one example. Blisters form, and eventually the top skin layer will die and shed.
    7. c. The drug was prescribed as a disintegrating tablet, so it must completely dissolve on the tongue. It is not to
        be chewed, crushed, or swallowed whole.
    8. d. The AChE inhibitors prescribed for myasthenia gravis increase muscle strength and muscle relaxation.
        Since clients may have drooping of the eyes due to muscle weakness, the ability to raise the eyelids
        independently is evident of increased muscle strength.
    9. c. Because the client's dose was increased, they are at risk for cholinergic crisis. This is characterized by
        increased urine output, diarrhea, vomiting, excess salivation, and diaphoresis.
  10. b. If there is cholinergic toxicity, an anticholinergic should be given to counteract the signs and symptoms. For
        instance, atropine will increase the heart rate and decrease intestinal motility and inhibit contraction of the
        detrusor muscle.

Chapter 11

Case Study

    1. c. This is concerning because this drug has the potential to exacerbate dysrhythmias.
    2. a. This drug is a cholinergic blocker (anticholinergic). According to the Beers Criteria®, these drugs should not

        be used in those over the age of 60 years and with a history of BPH that causes urinary retention. This could
        worsen from the anticholinergic.

Review Questions

    1. b. The nurse is evaluating the therapeutic effectiveness of the drugs. The client being able to perform more
        activities of daily living indicates the drugs are working.

    2. b. Because the client cannot swallow well, this drug is the best to meet their needs. It is available in a patch
        form and is administered transdermally.

    3. c. This client is experiencing neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
    4. c. This drug can be used to manage relapses in clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), primary progressive

        (PPMS), relapsing-remitting (RRMS), and secondary progressive (SPMS).
    5. a. Insomnia occurs with this drug because it metabolizes to methamphetamine and amphetamine, causing

        stimulation. If taken too late in the day, sleep could be disrupted.
    6. c. This drug can exacerbate tuberculosis. If a tuberculin skin test and chest radiograph (x-ray) are positive,

        the client must be treated for TB before starting the prescribed drug.
    7. b. High-protein meals will interfere with levodopa absorption and entrance into the brain.
    8. d. This drug causes euphoria, which can diminish impulse control.
    9. c. Benztropine is an anticholinergic. One of the adverse effects of this classification is the potential to

        increase intraocular pressure; therefore, it should be avoided in clients with glaucoma.
  10. a. These block dopamine receptors in the striatum, resulting in diminished therapeutic effects of levodopa

        and augmented Parkinsonian symptoms.

    1. b. Fluoxetine has a stimulant effect and may interfere with sleep if taken close to bedtime. Therapeutic
        effects take 4-6 weeks.

    2. a. If someone has an undiagnosed bipolar disorder, placing them on an antidepressant without a mood
        stabilizer can induce mania.

Review Questions

    1. b. The drug blocks muscarinic receptors and causes anticholinergic effects. This results in reduced salivation
        (xerostomia), decreased peristalsis (constipation), and relaxation of the detrusor muscle, causing urinary
        retention.

    2. b. Rapid, pressured speech is a classic sign of mania. If the drug level is considered subtherapeutic, this
        means it is not working favorably. The other options indicate the manic behavior is being well managed.

    3. c. This demonstrates the child's ability to remain focused on the task at hand.
    4. c. The brain has to adapt to these types of drugs. Although a person can feel some benefit in 2 weeks, full

        effects can take 4-6 weeks. It is important to emphasize this to the client or else they will simply stop taking
        the drug.
    5. b. Tremors, pseudoparkinsonism, and akinesia are extrapyramidal side effects that can occur with
        haloperidol.
    6. d. Whole milk and aged cheeses are high in tyramine and therefore should be avoided.
    7. c. Clozapine can cause a significant decrease in the neutrophil count, increasing the risk of infection. Also,
        abrupt discontinuation of clozapine can result in significant complications for client treatment. To ensure the
        client does not have a gap in the treatment, this is a modification to the REMS program.
    8. c. This is a norepinephrine dopamine reuptake inhibitor. SSRIs, SNRIs, and MAOIs all cause some degree of
        sexual dysfunction.
1078 Answer Key

    9. a. Zolpidem is useful for initiating sleep (sleep latency) and ensuring the client stays asleep during the night.
  10. a. Because this drug is a stimulant, it should not be taken near the evening or it will interrupt sleep.

Chapter 14

Unfolding Case Study

    1. c. Because this client is taking both aspirin and ibuprofen (which are both NSAIDs), and because she is taking
        ibuprofen on an as-needed basis, it is important to determine how much ibuprofen the client is taking.

    2. d. This dose exceeds the 3200 mg maximum dose for ibuprofen and, based on the client's report of black
        tarry stools, has already caused gastric bleeding.

    3. c. Hydromorphone is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine that is used to treat moderate to severe pain.
    4. a. The use of an opioid, such as hydromorphone, with alcohol can result in sedation and respiratory

        depression.

Review Questions

    1. b. The client's pain is considered chronic because it has been going on for more than 3 months.
    2. c. Pain is a subjective rating, and the nurse should define pain as "whatever the client says it is." Therefore,

        the nurse should administer the pain medication.
    3. d. Eight tablets of 500 mg acetaminophen is 4000 mg, which is the amount of acetaminophen that should not

        be exceeded in a day.
    4. c. Ibuprofen is the only option that is an anti-inflammatory drug.
    5. b. The affected nerves were damaged by the varicella-zoster virus. Shingles pain, or postherpetic neuralgia,

        develops in up to 50% of individuals over the age of 65 who contract the disease.
    6. b. Naloxone works as an opioid receptor antagonist and is the drug of choice to quickly reverse the effects of

        opioid intoxication, which is indicated here by the client's unresponsiveness and shallow breathing.
    7. d. This client most likely experienced a reaction to histamine caused by morphine. This adverse reaction is

        most often seen with morphine and codeine, which is converted into morphine.
    8. b. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist that can be used orally and intramuscularly to aid clients who are

        attempting to quit using opioids. While the client is taking naltrexone, any opioids taken will not be able to
        activate opioid receptors, blunting the effects of opioids and the feelings of euphoria.
    9. b. Tolerance is a natural occurrence in clients receiving chronic opioid agonists. It frequently requires the
        dosage of the opioid agonist to be increased to achieve adequate pain management.
  10. c. Severe shivering with chills (also known as rigors) may occur in clients who received anesthesia. The
        treatment of choice for this is meperidine. Because of the well-known toxicities of meperidine in older adults
        and those with poor renal function, it should almost never be used for pain.

    1. b. This is important to assess in case the client is prescribed buprenorphine or naltrexone to avoid withdrawal
        symptoms.

    2. d. Diarrhea is a common symptom of opioid withdrawal and can occur if clients continue to use opioids while
        taking the opioid antagonist naltrexone.

    3. a. This is the only medication of the four listed that is indicated for smoking cessation.
    4. b. The client's quit date should be one week after starting varenicline, to reduce withdrawal symptoms and

    4. a. This client is experiencing the triad of opioid overdose symptoms (respiratory depression, CNS depression,
        and miosis). This client requires quick reversal of these effects, so naloxone should be administered.

    5. c. The naloxone in this drug makes it so that if it is injected instead of being used orally, it will prevent the
        buprenorphine from causing as much euphoria as it would by itself.

    6. a. Because of the short-acting nature of naloxone, it is imperative to call emergency services after naloxone
        administration to get definitive care prior to the client re-sedating.

    7. b. Facial flushing is one of the most characteristic reactions seen in clients consuming alcohol while using
        disulfiram.

    8. d. Seizures are one of the most severe and potentially life-threatening effects that can be seen with alcohol
        withdrawal.

    9. c. This is an important counseling point to avoid having the client receive excessive doses of nicotine, leading
        to toxicity.

  10. a. Because bupropion is primarily used as an antidepressant and can reduce cravings during smoking
        cessation, it is an ideal medication to treat both conditions.

Chapter 16

Review Questions

    1. c. The QRS complex represents ventricular depolarization, which occurs as the electrical impulse moves
        through the ventricle to prompt contraction.

    2. a. The right ventricle pumps blood into the pulmonary artery and is subject to increased pressure in clients
        with pulmonary arterial hypertension.

    3. b. The coronary arteries supply the heart tissue with blood.
    4. d. With the exception of the pulmonary artery, all arteries carry oxygenated blood to various tissues for use.
    5. b. Both ventricles pump nearly simultaneously (ventricular systole). While the ventricles are pumping, both of

        the atria are filling (atrial diastole). The atria do not pump simultaneously with the ventricles.
    6. a. The signal starts in the sinoatrial node and passes through the atrioventricular node to get to the ventricles.

        From there, it travels through the bundles of His and Purkinje fibers.
    7. c. Automaticity is when the tissue is able to spontaneously generate an action potential, leading to

        spontaneous depolarization. Tissues with automaticity can act as the pacemaker of the heart.
    8. a. The ECG gives information about heart rhythm; abnormal rhythms are known as arrhythmias or

        dysrhythmias. Although some information about structural heart disease can be garnered from an ECG, other
        diagnostic methods such as echocardiography or biopsy would be needed to confirm the remaining
        diagnoses.
    9. d. The SA node, known as the pacemaker of the heart, has the property of automaticity and sends out
        electrical impulses 60-100 times/minute.
  10. d. Bradycardia describes a slow heart rate (less than 60 beats per minute), and tachycardia describes a fast
        heart rate (faster than 100 beats per minute).

Chapter 17

Case Study

    1. c. Based on the ECG data (no discernable P waves and narrow QRS complexes) and heart rate (greater than

    2. d. Beta-adrenergic blockers such as metoprolol are an option for treating atrial fibrillation with rapid
        ventricular response.

Review Questions

    1. c. Metoprolol is a beta-adrenergic blocker that slows the heart rate. If a client takes too much metoprolol,
        they may experience bradycardia.

    2. c. Verapamil is a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. It can decrease cardiac contractility, which can
        exacerbate congestive heart failure.

    3. b. Procainamide is a sodium channel blocker antidysrhythmic drug, but it also has activity as a potassium
1080 Answer Key

      channel blocker. Potassium blocker drugs require monitoring of the QT interval.
 4. d. Quinidine is associated with a high incidence of diarrhea. Because diarrhea can cause electrolyte

      abnormalities, excessive diarrhea should be reported to the health care provider.
 5. b. Metoprolol is a beta-adrenergic blocker. Beta-adrenergic blockers can cause fatigue.
 6. a. Potassium channel blockers slow repolarization and are associated with torsade de pointes, a serious

      ventricular dysrhythmia.
 7. b. Amiodarone can cause photosensitivity resulting in a bluish-gray color of sun-exposed skin.
 8. b. Metoprolol tartrate does not require inpatient initiation. Dofetilide and sotalol require inpatient initiation.

      Mexiletine is used for ventricular arrhythmias.
 9. c. Diltiazem and verapamil have FDA warnings concerning interactions with simvastatin. Diltiazem and

      verapamil inhibit the metabolism of simvastatin, increasing simvastatin plasma levels and the risk for adverse
      effects.
10. a. Because digoxin is eliminated by the kidneys, acute kidney injury puts the client at risk for digoxin toxicity.

1. c. Based on the American Heart Association Blood Pressure Category criteria, the client has hypertension
    stage 2 (systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg or higher and diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg or higher).

2. c. Renal function tests are likely to be ordered for Hahn to evaluate the function of her kidneys because both
    hypertension and diabetes can cause kidney damage. Kidney function should also be evaluated before
    starting pharmacological treatment for hypertension.

3. c. ACE inhibitors, such as enalapril, can cause hyperkalemia (an elevated serum potassium level), so the
    nurse should advise the client not to use potassium-containing salt substitutes.

4. b. The client who smokes should be advised to stop smoking to aid in blood pressure control and reduce the
    risk for coronary artery disease. Other nonpharmacologic treatments for hypertension include weight
    reduction, salt restriction, exercising 30-40 minutes four times/week, and limiting alcohol intake.

5. d. Constipation is an adverse effect of verapamil, so the nurse instructs Hahn to increase her daily fiber intake
    to help reduce this effect.

6. a. In a heart-healthy diet, the client should reduce her intake of red meat. This statement indicates a need for
    further teaching.

Review Questions

1. d. Hypertension stage 2 is classified as a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher or a diastolic blood

pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher.

2. b. Benazepril is an ACE inhibitor and may be used alone or in combination with other drugs in the

management of hypertension and heart failure. A therapeutic effect of the medication is a normal blood

pressure reading; 126/76 mm Hg falls within the AHA guidelines for normal blood pressure.

3. a. Nadolol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocker used to treat hypertension and other cardiac disease

processes. Nadolol inhibits beta 1 and beta 2. Blockade of beta 2 receptors in the lungs causes

bronchospasm; thus, nadolol is contraindicated in clients with asthma.

5. d. Transdermal nitroglycerin is prescribed as a maintenance medication for stable angina, which takes 30-60

minutes for therapeutic effects to begin. The patch should be applied around the same time every day and

worn for 12-14 hours and then removed for 10-12 hours to avoid client tolerance.

6. d. Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker. Grapefruit juice increases blood levels of verapamil by inhibiting its

metabolism. The excess amount of medication can intensify the medication's hypotensive effect, placing the

client at an increased risk for syncopal episodes.

7. b. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic and can deplete potassium levels in the body. Clients should eat

foods rich in potassium. Clients should monitor themselves for signs of hypokalemia such as fatigue,

tachycardia, muscle weakness, and leg cramps.

    6. c. Given the context of a high school football player with these signs and symptoms, the nurse should
        recognize that the student may be misusing steroids. This question can help the nurse further assess the
1090 Answer Key

        situation.
    7. d. Invasive dental procedures should not be planned during bisphosphonate therapy because of the high risk

        of developing bisphosphonate-induced osteonecrosis of the jaws (BIONJ).
    8. a. Impaired liver function is a serious side effect of antiandrogen medications. Clients on bicalutamide have

        developed liver failure and died. Liver function must be monitored closely.
    9. b. Bone density testing should be scheduled routinely to determine the effectiveness of the drug therapy.
  10. a. In this case, the anabolic steroid would be used to improve health status, indicated by increased

        hemoglobin.

Chapter 37

Review Questions

    1. a. The most important action for a nurse caring for transgender and nonbinary clients is to self-assess their
        own personal attitudes, beliefs, and feelings regarding these clients.

    2. c. This is an intended effect of hormonal therapy for individuals undergoing MTF transition.
    3. b. This is the only condition listed that is not a contraindication for testosterone therapy.
    4. c. Hypertension is often treated with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, which could cause

        hyperkalemia when given concomitantly with spironolactone.
    5. b. Hyperkalemia is the most common and most serious adverse effect of spironolactone. Cardiac

        dysrhythmias and muscle cramps are indications of hyperkalemia and should be reported.
    6. a. Finasteride is highly toxic to a fetus. Any female who is pregnant or of childbearing age should avoid

        contact with this medication, especially if the tablet is broken or crushed.
    7. a. Testosterone therapy cannot be started in a pregnant client because of the dangers to the fetus.
    8. b. A client transitioning from female to male who has not had gender-affirming surgery still has female organs

        and still needs regular screenings for cervical and breast cancer.
    9. d. Spironolactone is an androgen blocker but does not block testosterone. Because the client is unsure about

        whether to transition, spironolactone is an appropriate choice because changes in sexual characteristics with
        spironolactone are reversible.
  10. b. Androgens may decrease blood glucose levels; therefore, any hypoglycemic medication is likely to need a
        dosage adjustment.

Chapter 38

Review Questions

    1. a. Gloves should be worn when handling this drug because it has the potential to cause cancer.
    2. b. Erythromycin is the only FDA-approved eye medication used for ophthalmia neonatorum and is given

        directly after birth.
    3. a. A "glaucoma suspect" has risk factors for glaucoma including elevated intraocular pressure, optic nerve

        damage, visual field deficit, or a strong family history of glaucoma.
    4. d. Infections, such as eye infections, that are anatomically close to the brain can result in complications such

        as a secondary infection like meningitis.
    5. c. Prostaglandin analogues cause hyperpigmentation of the eyelids and increase eyelash length and

        thickness.
    6. b. Travoprost is more effective in Black clients than non-Black clients.
    7. d. If the client does not apply pressure to the nasolacrimal area to reduce drainage of this beta-blocking

        ocular medication into the systemic circulation, a drop in heart rate can occur.
    8. d. A known effect of prolonged ocular corticosteroids is an increased occurrence of cataracts.
    9. a. Serious side effects of ocular antiviral medications include retinal detachment, which is manifested by

        floaters and flashes of light.
  10. a. Because the drug is nonselective, it can bind to and block both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors.

        When it binds to beta-2 receptors, it results in a decrease in heart rate, thus masking the signs of tachycardia
        often seen with hypoglycemia.

Chapter 39

Review Questions

    1. b. The Eustachian tube connects the middle ear to the back of the nose and protects the middle ear from
        infection.

    2. c. Decongestants such as pseudoephedrine may be given to relieve ear congestion and pressure.
    3. d. Decreasing sodium intake can help reduce distracting sounds.
    4. d. The client with a hearing impairment needs the nurse to be patient and provide them with time to

        communicate.
    5. c. The client should avoid touching the tip of the dropper or inside of the cap with the hand or to any surface

        to avoid contamination.
    6. c. Pain and ear itching are signs that a superinfection may be present, in which case an ear swab will be

        needed to test for a superinfection.
    7. c. Diarrhea can develop with antibiotic use and should be reported to the provider.
    8. c. Decongestants are known to elevate serum glucose.
    9. b. The nurse should examine the ear canal to determine if the cerumen (earwax) has been expelled.
  10. a. Ménière's disease is characterized by hearing loss, vertigo, increased sweating, nausea, and vomiting.

Chapter 40

Case Study

    1. b. Red, scaling skin on the scalp and elbows and joint pain are findings consistent with psoriasis.
    2. b. Coal tar is very damaging to unaffected skin and therefore should not be applied outside of the lesion

        borders. Zinc oxide or petrolatum should be used to protect the wound margins.

Review Questions

    1. c. Adalimumab decreases the mitotic rate of skin cells to decrease scaling plaques in psoriasis.
    2. a. Risks for embryo/fetal loss or abnormalities prevent the use of tretinoin during pregnancy.
    3. c. Tetracycline drugs, when taken by children under the age of 8 years, may cause damage to bones and

        teeth; therefore, they are contraindicated in this population.
    4. b. Psoriasis treatment requires exfoliation to remove plaque formation and drugs to decrease rapid skin cell

        growth to prevent plaques.
    5. a. Covering topical steroids may cause both local irritation and systemic absorption of the drug.
    6. d. Impetigo is a localized infection that requires treatment with antibiotics to eliminate the causative bacteria.
    7. a. Acitretin is contraindicated in clients with decreased renal function.
    8. a. Applying a nonocclusive dressing to protect the area is appropriate, but applying an occlusive dressing is

        contraindicated because it will increase the systemic effects of the medication.
    9. c. With proper treatment, most forms of acne can be controlled with resolution or improvement in skin

        lesions.
  10. c. Drinking alcoholic beverages when taking metronidazole results in a disulfiram-like reaction, which is

        evidenced by diaphoresis, hypotension, and nausea/vomiting.
