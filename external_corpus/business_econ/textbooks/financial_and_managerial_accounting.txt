    Why did I create this accounting
                     textbook?

First...
   Textbook prices for introductory accounting courses are

typically very high and new editions are frequently introduced,
limiting the resale value and use of older editions. Simply put,
a free, open-source textbook increases accessibility by
eliminating the cost barrier. Free is my favorite price!

                                          Second...
      Accounting textbooks also commonly seen as... BORING!

Can learning accounting be
interesting?

This book is uniquely constructed to integrate reading, video
tutorials, links and practice to make learning... dare I write it...

                                                                                      Welcome! | 1
FUN! OK, maybe that's overstating a bit, but this is not your
typical accounting text.

   Throughout the chapters, you'll find links to short videos
(screencasts in YouTube). Each is like a mini-lecture, 4-7
minutes where I'm teaching a nugget of content. I use humor
(check out the James Bond reference in the chapter on long-
term debt) and silly examples to highlight important concepts
and make them memorable.

   In a few cases, you'll be taken to links for other types of
resources- interactive learning opportunities. Don't just pass
them by! Engage in these activities to experience "active
reading."

   Links to professional organizations and government entities
are also provided- to connect what we're learning to the "real
world."

   Also sprinkled throughout are "Your Turn" text blocks. In
each, you're asked to practice the concept, computation, or
accounting entries just presented in the text. The solution is
provided for you to learn- take advantage of these
opportunities to test your understanding.

   I'm excited to share this resource with you and I look forward
to learning accounting together!

   Sincerely,
   Lolita Paff, Ph.D.

INTRODUCTION

                                                                                  Introduction | 5

Financial Accounting -
The Public Language
of Business

Accounting is the process of organizing, analyzing, and
communicating financial information that is used for decision-
making. Financial information is typically prepared by
accountants--those trained in the specific techniques and
practices of the profession. This course explores many of the
topics and techniques related to the accounting profession.
While many students will directly apply the knowledge gained
in this course to continue their education and become
accountants and business professionals, others might pursue
different career paths.

   A solid understanding of accounting can for many still serve
as a useful resource. In fact, it is hard to think of a profession
where a foundation in the principles of accounting would not
be beneficial. Therefore, one of the goals of this course is to
provide a solid understanding of how financial information is
prepared and used in the workplace, regardless of your
particular career path.

   A traditional adage states that "accounting is the language of
business." While that is true, you can also say that "accounting
is the language of life." At some point, most people will make
a decision that relies on accounting information. For example,
you may have to decide whether it is better to lease or buy
a vehicle. Likewise, a college graduate may have to decide
whether it is better to take a higher-paying job in a bigger city
(where the cost of living is also higher) or a job in a smaller
community where both the pay and cost of living may be
lower.

   In a professional setting, a theater manager may want to
know:

   Was the most recent play profitable?
   How many tickets do we need to sell to break-even? Or, to

      achieve a target profit?

By cloudhoreca. Pixabay Pixabay license

Similarly, the owner of the local plumbing business may want
to know:

   Is it worthwhile to pay an employee to be "on call" for
      emergencies during off-hours and weekends?

   What should be the business's minimum charge for a
      house call?

Whether personal or professional, accounting information
plays a vital role in all of these decisions.
8 | Financial Accounting - The Public Language of Business
By PCB-Tech. Pixabay Pixabay license

You may have noticed that the decisions in these scenarios
would be based on factors that include both financial and non-
financial information. For instance, when deciding whether to
lease or buy a vehicle, you would consider not only the monthly
payments but also such factors as vehicle maintenance and
reliability.

   The college graduate considering two job offers might weigh
factors such as working hours, ease of commuting, and options
for shopping and entertainment. The theater manager would
analyze the proceeds from ticket sales and sponsorships as
well as the expenses for production of the play and operating
the concessions. In addition, the theater manager should
consider how the financial performance of the play might have
been influenced by the marketing of the play, the weather
during the performances, and other factors such as competing
events during the time of the play. All of these factors, both
financial and non-financial, are relevant to the financial
performance of the play.

   In addition to the additional cost of having an employee "on

               Financial Accounting - The Public Language of Business | 9
call" during evenings and weekends, the owner of the local
plumbing business would consider non-financial factors in the
decision. For instance, if there are no other plumbing
businesses that offer services during evenings and weekends,
offering emergency service might give the business a strategic
advantage that could increase overall sales by attracting new
customers.

   This course explores the role that accounting plays in society.
You will learn about financial accounting, which measures the
financial performance of an organization using standard
conventions to prepare and distribute financial reports.
Financial accounting is used to generate information for
stakeholders outside of an organization, such as:

   owners,
   stockholders,
   lenders,
   governmental entities such as Internal Revenue Service

      (IRS website)

Financial accounting is also a foundation for understanding
managerial accounting, which uses both financial and non-
financial information as a basis for making decisions within an
organization with the purpose of equipping decision makers
to set and evaluate business goals by determining what
information they need to make a particular decision and how
to analyze and communicate this information. Managerial
accounting information tends to be used internally, for such
purposes as budgeting, pricing, and determining production
costs. Since the information is generally used internally, you
do not see the same need for financial oversight in an
organization's managerial data.

   You will also note in your financial accounting studies that
there are governmental and organizational entities that
oversee the accounting processes and systems that are used in

10 | Financial Accounting - The Public Language of Business
financial accounting. These entities include organizations such
as the

   Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC website),
   Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB website),
   American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA

      website),
   Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB

      website).

The PCAOB was created after several major cases of corporate
fraud, leading to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, known as
SOX. If you choose to pursue more advanced accounting
courses, especially auditing courses, you will address the SOX in
much greater detail.

   For now, it is not necessary to go into greater detail about
the mechanics of these organizations or other accounting and
financial legislation. You just need to have a basic
understanding that they function to provide a degree of
protection for those outside of the organization who rely on the
financial information.

   Whether or not you aspire to become an accountant,
understanding financial and managerial accounting is
valuable and necessary for practically any career you will
pursue.

Characteristics, Users
and Sources of
Accounting
Information

Financial Accounting Information

The ultimate goal of accounting is to provide information that
is useful for decision-making. Users of accounting information
are generally divided into two categories: internal and
external. Internal users are those within an organization who
use financial information to make day-to-day decisions.
Internal users include managers and other employees who use
financial information to confirm past results and help make
adjustments for future activities.

   External users are those outside of the organization who use
the financial information to make decisions or to evaluate an
entity's performance. For example, investors, financial analysts,
loan officers, governmental auditors, such as IRS agents, and
an assortment of other stakeholders are classified as external
users, while still having an interest in an organization's financial
information.

   Organizations measure financial performance in monetary
terms. In the United States, the dollar is used as the standard
measurement basis. Measuring financial performance in
monetary terms allows managers to compare the
organization's performance to previous periods, to
expectations, and to other organizations or industry standards.

12 | Characteristics, Users and Sources of Accounting Information
Financial accounting is one of the broad categories in the study
of accounting. While some industries and types of
organizations have variations in how the financial information
is prepared and communicated, accountants generally use the
same methodologies--called accounting standards--to
prepare the financial information.

   Virtually every activity and event that occurs in a business has
an associated cost or value and is known as a transaction. Part
of an accountant's responsibility is to quantify these activities
and events. In this course you will learn about the many types
of transactions that occur within a business. You will also
examine the effects of these transactions, including their
impact on the financial position of the entity.

   Accountants often use computerized accounting systems to
record and summarize the financial reports, which offer many
benefits. The primary benefit of a computerized accounting
system is the efficiency by which transactions can be recorded
and summarized, and financial reports prepared. In addition,
computerized accounting systems store data, which allows
organizations to easily extract historical financial information.

Common computerized accounting systems include
QuickBooks, which is designed for small organizations, and
SAP, which is designed for large and/or multinational
organizations. QuickBooks is popular with smaller, less
complex entities. It is less expensive than more sophisticated
software packages, such as Oracle or SAP, and the QuickBooks
skills that accountants developed at previous employers tend
to be applicable to the needs of new employers, which can
reduce both training time and costs spent on acclimating new
employees to an employer's software system. Also, being
familiar with a common software package such as QuickBooks
helps provide employment mobility when workers wish to
reenter the job market.

   While QuickBooks has many advantages, once a company's
operations reach a certain level of complexity, it will need a
basic software package or platform, such as Oracle or SAP,
which is then customized to meet the unique informational
needs of the entity.

   Financial accounting information is mostly historical in
nature, although companies and other entities also incorporate
estimates into their accounting processes. For example, you
will learn how to use estimates to determine bad debt
expenses or depreciation expenses for assets that will be used
over a multiyear lifetime. That is, accountants prepare financial
reports that summarize what has already occurred in an
organization. This information provides what is called feedback
value. The benefit of reporting what has already occurred is
the reliability of the information. Accountants can, with a fair
amount of confidence, accurately report the financial
performance of the organization related to past activities. The
feedback value offered by the accounting information is
particularly useful to internal users. That is, reviewing how the
organization performed in the past can help managers and
other employees make better decisions about and
adjustments to future activities.

14 | Characteristics, Users and Sources of Accounting Information
   Financial information has limitations, however, as a
predictive tool. Business involves a large amount of uncertainty,
and accountants cannot predict how the organization will
perform in the future. However, by observing historical
financial information, users of the information can detect
patterns or trends that may be useful for estimating the
company's future financial performance. Collecting and
analyzing a series of historical financial data is useful to both
internal and external users. For example, internal users can use
financial information as a predictive tool to assess whether
the long-term financial performance of the organization aligns
with its long-term strategic goals.

   External users also use the historical pattern of an
organization's financial performance as a predictive tool. For
example, when deciding whether to loan money to an
organization, a bank may require a certain number of years of
financial statements and other financial information from the
organization. The bank will assess the historical performance in
order to make an informed decision about the organization's
ability to repay the loan and interest (the cost of borrowing
money). Similarly, a potential investor may look at a business's
past financial performance in order to assess whether or not
to invest money in the company. In this scenario, the investor
wants to know if the organization will provide a sufficient and
consistent return on the investment. In these scenarios, the
financial information provides value to the process of allocating
scarce resources (money). If potential lenders and investors
determine the organization is a worthwhile investment, money
will be provided, and, if all goes well, those funds will be used by
the organization to generate additional value at a rate greater
than the alternate uses of the money.

Managerial Accounting Information

Managerial accounting information is different from financial
accounting information in several respects. Accountants use
formal accounting standards in financial accounting. These
accounting standards are referred to as generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP) and are the common set of rules,
standards, and procedures that publicly traded companies
must follow when composing their financial statements. The
previously mentioned Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB website), an independent, nonprofit organization that
sets financial accounting and reporting standards for both
public and private sector businesses in the United States, uses
the GAAP guidelines as its foundation for its system of
accepted accounting methods and practices, reports, and
other documents.

   Since most managerial accounting activities are conducted
for internal uses and applications, managerial accounting is
not prepared using a comprehensive, prescribed set of
conventions similar to those required by financial accounting.
This is because managerial accountants provide managerial
accounting information that is intended to serve the needs
of internal, rather than external, users. In fact, managerial
accounting information is rarely shared with those outside of
the organization. Since the information often includes strategic
or competitive decisions, managerial accounting information is
often closely protected. The business environment is constantly
changing, and managers and decision makers within
organizations need a variety of information in order to view or
assess issues from multiple perspectives.

   Accountants must be adaptable and flexible in their ability
to generate the necessary information management decision-
making. For example, information derived from a
computerized accounting system is often the starting point
for obtaining managerial accounting information. But

16 | Characteristics, Users and Sources of Accounting Information
accountants must also be able to extract information from
other sources (internal and external) and analyze the data
using mathematical, formula-driven software (such as
Microsoft Excel).

   Management accounting information as a term
encompasses many activities within an organization. Preparing
a budget, for example, allows an organization to estimate the
financial performance for the upcoming year or years and plan
for adjustments to scale operations according to the
projections. Accountants often lead the budgeting process by
gathering information from internal (estimates from the sales
and engineering departments, for example) and external
(trade groups and economic forecasts, for example) sources.
These data are then compiled and presented to decision
makers within the organization.

   Examples of other decisions that require management
accounting information include whether an organization
should repair or replace equipment, make products internally
or purchase the items from outside vendors, and hire
additional workers or use automation.

   Management accounting information uses both financial
and nonfinancial information. This is important because there
are situations in which a purely financial analysis might lead
to one decision, while considering nonfinancial information
might lead to a different decision. For example, suppose a
financial analysis indicates that a particular product is
unprofitable and should no longer be offered by a company.
If the company fails to consider that customers also purchase
a complementary good (you might recall that term from your
study of economics), the company may be making the wrong
decision. For example, assume that you have a company that
produces and sells both computer printers and the
replacement ink cartridges. If the company decided to
eliminate the printers, then it would also lose the cartridge
sales. In the past, in some cases, the elimination of one

       Characteristics, Users and Sources of Accounting Information | 17
component, such as printers, led to customers switching to
a different producer for its computers and other peripheral
hardware. In the end, an organization needs to consider both
the financial and nonfinancial aspects of a decision, and
sometimes the effects are not intuitively obvious at the time of
the decision. the table below offers an overview of some of the
differences between financial and managerial accounting.

Accounting in Different
Organizations

We can classify organizations into three categories: for profit,
governmental, and not for profit. These organizations are
similar in several aspects. For example, each of these
organizations has inflows and outflows of cash and other
resources, such as equipment, furniture, and land, that must
be managed. In addition, all of these organizations are formed
for a specific purpose or mission and want to use the available
resources in an efficient manner--the organizations strive to
be good stewards, with the underlying premise of being
profitable. Finally, each of the organizations makes a unique
and valuable contribution to society. Given the similarities, it is
clear that all of these organizations have a need for accounting
information and for accountants to provide that information.

   There are also several differences. The main difference that
distinguishes these organizations is the primary purpose or
mission of the organization, discussed in the following sections.

For-Profit Businesses

As the name implies, the primary purpose or mission of a for-
profit business is to earn a profit by selling goods and services.
There are many reasons why a for-profit business seeks to earn
a profit. The profits generated by these organizations might be
used to create value for employees in the form of pay raises
for existing employees as well as hiring additional workers. In
addition, profits can be reinvested in the business to create
value in the form of research and development, equipment
upgrades, facilities expansions, and many other activities that

20 | Accounting in Different Organizations
make the business more competitive. Many companies also
engage in charitable activities, such as donating money,
donating products, or allowing employees to volunteer in the
communities. Finally, profits can also be shared with
employees in the form of either bonuses or commissions as
well as with owners of the business as a reward for the owners'
investment in the business. These issues, along with others,
and the associated accounting conventions will be explored
throughout this course.

   In for-profit businesses, accounting information is used to
measure the financial performance of the organization and
to help ensure that resources are being used efficiently.
Efficiently using existing resources allows the businesses to
improve quality of the products and services offered, remain
competitive in the marketplace, expand when appropriate, and
ensure longevity of the business.

   For-profit businesses can be further categorized by the types
of products or services the business provides. Let's examine
three types of for-profit businesses: manufacturing, retail (or
merchandising), and service.

Manufacturing Businesses

A manufacturing business is a for-profit business that is
designed to make a specific product or products.
Manufacturers specialize in procuring components in the most
basic form (often called direct or raw materials) and
transforming the components into a finished product that is
often drastically different from the original components.

   As you think about the products you use every day, you are
probably already familiar with products made by
manufacturing firms. Examples of products made by
manufacturing firms include automobiles, clothes, cell phones,

                                          Accounting in Different Organizations | 21
computers, and many other products that are used every day
by millions of consumers.

   Later, you will examine the process of job costing, learning
how manufacturing firms transform basic components into
finished, sellable products and the techniques accountants use
to record the costs associated with these activities.

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

Manufacturing

Think about the items you have used today. Make a list of
the products that were created by manufacturing firms. How
many can you think of? Think of the many components that
went into some of the items you use. Do you think the items
were made by machines or by hand?

   If you are in a classroom with other students, see who has
used the greatest number of items today. Or, see who used the
item that would be the most complex to manufacture.

   If you are able, you might consider arranging a tour of a local
manufacturer. Many manufacturers are happy to give tours of
the facilities and describe the many complex processes that
are involved in making the products. On your tour, take note
of the many job functions that are required to make those
items--from ordering the materials to delivering to the
customer.

Retail Businesses

22 | Accounting in Different Organizations
Manufacturing businesses and retail (or merchandising)
businesses are similar in that both are for-profit businesses
that sell products to consumers. In the case of manufacturing
firms, by adding direct labor, manufacturing overhead (such as
utilities, rent, and depreciation), and other direct materials, raw
components are converted into a finished product that is sold
to consumers. A retail business (or merchandising business),
on the other hand, is a for-profit business that purchases
products (called inventory) and then resells the products
without altering them--that is, the products are sold directly
to the consumer in the same condition (production state) as
purchased.

   Examples of retail firms are plentiful. Automobile dealerships,
clothes, cell phones, and computers are all examples of
everyday products that are purchased and sold by retail firms.
What distinguishes a manufacturing firm from a retail firm is
that in a retail firm, the products are sold in the same condition
as when the products were purchased--no further alterations
were made on the products.

   Did you happen to notice that the product examples listed
in the preceding paragraph (automobiles, clothes, cell phones,
and computers) for manufacturing firms and retail firms are
identical? If so, congratulations, because you are paying close
attention to the details. These products are used as examples
in two different contexts--that is, manufacturing
firms make these products, and retail firms sell these
products. These products are relevant to both manufacturing
and retail because they are examples of goods that are both
manufactured and sold directly to the consumer. While there
are instances when a manufacturing firm also serves as the
retail firm (Dell computers, for example), it is often the case
that products will be manufactured and sold by separate firms.

 CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE
 NIKEiD

  NIKEiD is a program that allows consumers to design and
  purchase customized equipment, clothes, and shoes. In
  2007, Nike opened its first NIKEiD studio at Niketown in New
  York City.1 Since its debut in 1999, the NIKEiD concept has
  flourished, and Nike has partnered with professional athletes
  to showcase their designs that, along with featured consumer
  designs, are available for purchase on the NIKEiD website.

  24 | Accounting in Different Organizations
Assume you are the manager of a sporting goods store that
sells Nike shoes. Think about the concept of NIKEiD, and
consider the impact that this concept might have on your store
sales. Would this positively or negatively impact the sale
of Nike shoes in your store? What are steps you could take to
leverage the NIKEiD concept to help increase your own store's
sales?

   Considerations like this are examples of what marketing
professionals would address. Nike wants to ensure this concept
does not negatively impact the existing relationships it has,
and Nike works to ensure this program is also beneficial to its
existing distribution partners.

Service Businesses

As the term implies, service businesses are businesses that
provide services to customers. A major difference between
manufacturing and retail firms and service firms is that service
firms do not have a tangible product that is sold to customers.
Instead, a service business does not sell tangible products to
customers but rather provides intangible benefits (services) to
customers. A service business can be either a for-profit or a not-
for-profit business. The figure below illustrates the distinction
between manufacturing, retail, and service businesses.

   Examples of service-oriented businesses include hotels, cab
services, entertainment, and tax preparers. Efficiency is one
advantage service businesses offer to their customers. For
example, while taxpayers can certainly read the tax code, read
the instructions, and complete the forms necessary to file their
annual tax returns, many choose to take their tax returns to
a person who has specialized training and experience with
preparing tax returns. Although it is more expensive to do so,

                                         Accounting in Different Organizations | 25
many feel it is a worthwhile investment because the tax
professional has invested the time and has the knowledge to
prepare the forms properly and in a timely manner. Hiring a
tax preparer is efficient for the taxpayer because it allows the
taxpayer to file the required forms without having to invest
numerous hours researching and preparing the forms.

   The accounting conventions for service businesses are
similar to the accounting conventions for manufacturing and
retail businesses. In fact, the accounting for service businesses
is easier in one respect. Because service businesses do not sell
tangible products, there is no need to account for products
that are being held for sale (inventory). Therefore, while we
briefly discuss service businesses, we'll focus mostly on
accounting for manufacturing and retail businesses.

YOUR TURN

Categorizing Restaurants

So far, you've learned about three types of for-profit businesses:
manufacturing, retail, and service. In some cases, firms such as
Dell serve as both manufacturer and retailer.

   Now, think of the last restaurant where you ate. Of the three
business types (manufacturer, retailer, or service provider), how
would you categorize the restaurant? Is it a manufacturer? A
retailer? A service provider? Can you think of examples of how
a restaurant has characteristics of all three types of businesses?

   Solution
   Answers will vary. Responses may initially consider a
restaurant to be only a service provider. Students may also
recognize that a restaurant possesses aspects of a
manufacturer (by preparing the meals), retailer (by selling
merchandise and/or gift cards), and service provider (by
waiting on customers).

Governmental Entities

A governmental entity provides services to the general public
(taxpayers). Governmental agencies exist at the federal, state,
and local levels. These entities are funded through the issuance
of taxes and other fees.

   Accountants working in governmental entities perform the
same function as accountants working at for-profit businesses.
Accountants help to serve the public interest by providing to
the public an accounting for the receipts and disbursements
of taxpayer dollars. Governmental leaders are accountable to

                                         Accounting in Different Organizations | 27
taxpayers, and accountants help assure the public that tax
dollars are being utilized in an efficient manner.

   Examples of governmental entities that require financial
reporting include federal agencies such as the Social Security
Administration, state agencies such as the Department of
Transportation, and local agencies such as county engineers.

   Students continuing their study of accounting may take a
specific course or courses related to governmental accounting.
While the specific accounting used in governmental entities
differs from traditional accounting conventions, the goal of
providing accurate and unbiased financial information useful
for decision-making remains the same, regardless of the type
of entity. Government accounting standards are governed by
the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). This
organization creates standards that are specifically appropriate
for state and local governments in the United States.

Not-for-Profit Entities

To be fair, the name "not-for-profit" can be somewhat
confusing. As with "for-profit" entities, the name refers to the
primary purpose or mission of the organization. In the case of
for-profit organizations, the primary purpose is to generate a
profit. The profits, then, can be used to sustain and improve
the business through investments in employees, research, and
development, and other measures intended to help ensure the
long-term success of the business.

   But in the case of a nonprofit (not-for-profit) organization the
primary purpose or mission is to serve a particular interest or
need in the community. A not-for-profit entity tends to depend
on financial longevity based on donations, grants, and
revenues generated. It may be helpful to think of not-for-profit
entities as "mission-based" entities. It is important to note that
not-for-profit entities, while having a primary purpose of

28 | Accounting in Different Organizations
serving a particular interest, also have a need for financial
sustainability. An adage in the not-for-profit sector states that
"being a not-for-profit organization does not mean it is for-
loss." That is, not-for-profit entities must also ensure that
resources are used efficiently, allowing for inflows of resources
to be greater than (or, at a minimum, equal to) outflows of
resources. This allows the organization to continue and
perhaps expand its valuable mission.

   Examples of not-for-profit entities are numerous. Food banks
have as a primary purpose the collection, storage, and
distribution of food to those in need. Charitable foundations
have as a primary purpose the provision of funding to local
agencies that support specific community needs, such as
reading and after-school programs. Many colleges and
universities are structured as not-for-profit entities because the
primary purpose is to provide education and research
opportunities.

   Similar to accounting for governmental entities, students
continuing their study of accounting may take a specific
course or courses related to not-for-profit accounting. While
the specific accounting used in not-for-profit entities differs
slightly from traditional accounting conventions, the goal of
providing reliable and unbiased financial information useful for
decision-making is vitally important.

YOUR TURN

Types of Organizations

Think of the various organizations discussed so far. Now try to
identify people in your personal and professional network who

                                         Accounting in Different Organizations | 29
work for these types of agencies. Can you think of someone in
a career at each of these types of organizations?

   One way to explore career paths is to talk with professionals
who work in the areas that interest you. You may consider
reaching out to the individuals you identified and learning
more about the work that they do. Find out about the positive
and negative aspects of the work. Find out what advice they
have relating to education. Try to gain as much information as
you can to determine whether that is a career you can envision
yourself pursuing. Also, ask about opportunities for job
shadowing, co-ops, or internships.

   Solution
   Answers will vary, but this should be an opportunity to learn
about careers in a variety of organizations (for-profit including
manufacturing, retail, and services; not-for-profit; and
governmental agencies). You may have an assumption about a
career that is based only on the positive aspects. Learning from
experienced professionals may help you understand all aspects
of the careers. In addition, this exercise may help you confirm
or alter your potential career path, including the preparation
required (based on advice given from those you talk with).

Stakeholders

The number of decisions we make in a single day is staggering.
For example, think about what you had for breakfast this
morning. What pieces of information factored into that
decision? A short list might include the foods that were
available in your home, the amount of time you had to prepare
and eat the food, and what sounded good to eat this morning.
Let's say you do not have much food in your home right now
because you are overdue on a trip to the grocery store.
Deciding to grab something at a local restaurant involves an
entirely new set of choices. Can you think of some of the factors
that might influence the decision to grab a meal at a local
restaurant?

YOUR TURN

Daily Decisions

Many academic studies have been conducted on the topic of
consumer behavior and decision-making. It is a fascinating
topic of study that attempts to learn what type of advertising
works best, the best place to locate a business, and many other
business-related activities.

   One such study, conducted by researchers at Cornell
University, concluded that people make more than 200 food-
related decisions per day.2

   This is astonishing considering the number of decisions
found in this particular study related only to decisions involving
food. Imagine how many day-to-day decisions involve other

                                                                                Stakeholders | 31
issues that are important to us, such as what to wear and how
to get from point A to point B. For this exercise, provide and
discuss some of the food-related decisions that you recently
made.

   Solution
   In consideration of food-related decisions, there are many
options you can consider. For example, what types, in terms of
ethnic groups or styles, do you prefer? Do you want a dining
experience or just something inexpensive and quick? Do you
have allergy-related food issues? These are just a few of the
myriad potential decisions you might make.

It is no different when it comes to financial decisions. Decision
makers rely on unbiased, relevant, and timely financial
information in order to make sound decisions. In this context,
the term stakeholder refers to a person or group who relies
on financial information to make decisions, since they often
have an interest in the economic viability of an organization
or business. Stakeholders may be stockholders, creditors,
governmental and regulatory agencies, customers,
management and other employees, and various other parties
and entities.

Stockholders

A stockholder is an owner of stock in a business. Owners are
called stockholders because in exchange for cash, they are
given an ownership interest in the business, called stock. Stock
is sometimes referred to as "shares." Historically, stockholders
received paper certificates reflecting the number of stocks
owned in the business. Now, many stock transactions are
recorded electronically.

   Recall that organizations can be classified as for-profit,
governmental, or not-for-profit entities. Stockholders are

32 | Stakeholders
associated with for-profit businesses. While governmental and
not-for-profit entities have constituents, there is no direct
ownership associated with these entities.

   For-profit businesses are organized into three categories:
manufacturing, retail (or merchandising), and service. Another
way to categorize for-profit businesses is based on the
availability of the company stock (see the table below). A
publicly traded company is one whose stock is traded (bought
and sold) on an organized stock exchange such as the New
York Stock Exchange (NYSE website) or the National
Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation
(NASDAQ website) system. Most large, recognizable companies
are publicly traded, meaning the stock is available for sale on
these exchanges. A privately held company, in contrast, is one
whose stock is not available to the general public. Privately
held companies, while accounting for the largest number of
businesses and employment in the United States, are often
smaller (based on value) than publicly traded companies.
Whereas financial information and company stock of publicly
traded companies are available to those inside and outside
of the organization, financial information and company stock
of privately held companies are often limited exclusively to
employees at a certain level within the organization as a part
of compensation and incentive packages or selectively to
individuals or groups (such as banks or other lenders) outside
the organization.

Whether the stock is owned by a publicly traded or privately
held company, owners use financial information to make
decisions. Owners use the financial information to assess the
financial performance of the business and make decisions
such as whether or not to purchase additional stock, sell
existing stock, or maintain the current level of stock ownership.

   Other decisions stockholders make may be influenced by the
type of company. For example, stockholders of privately held
companies often are also employees of the company, and the
decisions they make may be related to day-to-day activities
as well as longer-term strategic decisions. Owners of publicly
traded companies, on the other hand, will usually only focus on
strategic issues such as the company leadership, purchases of
other businesses, and executive compensation arrangements.
In essence, stockholders predominantly focus on profitability,
expected increase in stock value, and corporate stability.

Creditors and Lenders

In order to provide goods and services to their customers,
businesses make purchases from other businesses. These
purchases come in the form of materials used to make finished
goods or resell, office equipment such as copiers and
telephones, utility services such as heating and cooling, and
many other products and services that are vital to run the
business efficiently and effectively.

   It is rare that payment is required at the time of the purchase
or when the service is provided. Instead, businesses usually
extend "credit" to other businesses. Selling and purchasing on
credit, means the payment is expected after a certain period of
time following receipt of the goods or provision of the service.
The term creditor refers to a business that grants extended
payment terms to other businesses. The time frame for
extended credit to other businesses for purchases of goods and

34 | Stakeholders
services is usually very short, typically thirty-day to forty-five-
day periods are common.

   When businesses need to borrow larger amounts of money
and/or for longer periods of time, they will often borrow money
from a lender, a bank or other institution that has the primary
purpose of lending money with a specified repayment period
and stated interest rate. If you or your family own a home,
you may already be familiar with lending institutions. The time
frame for borrowing from lenders is typically measured in years
rather than days, as was the case with creditors. While lending
arrangements vary, typically the borrower is required to make
periodic, scheduled payments with the full amount being
repaid by a certain date. In addition, since the borrowing is for
a long period of time, lending institutions require the borrower
to pay a fee (called interest) for the use of borrowing.

Both creditors and lenders use financial information to make
decisions. The ultimate decision that both creditors and
lenders have to make is whether or not the funds will be repaid
by the borrower. The reason this is important is because
lending money involves risk. The type of risk creditors and
lenders assess is repayment risk--the risk the funds will not be
repaid. As a rule, the longer the money is borrowed, the higher
the risk involved.

   Recall that accounting information is historical in nature.
While historical performance is no guarantee of future
performance (repayment of borrowed funds, in this case), an

                                                                               Stakeholders | 35
established pattern of financial performance using historical
accounting information does help creditors and lenders to
assess the likelihood the funds will be repaid, which, in turn,
helps them to determine how much money to lend, how long
to lend the money for, and how much interest (in the case of
lenders) to charge the borrower.

Sources of Funding

Besides borrowing, there are other options for businesses to
obtain or raise additional funding (also often labeled as capital).
It is important for the business student to understand that
businesses generally have three ways to raise capital: profitable
operations is the first option; selling ownership--stock--which
is also called equity financing, is the second option; and
borrowing from lenders (called debt financing) is the final
option.

   You are already aware of the concept of profit. In short, profit
means the inflows of resources are greater than the outflow of
resources, or stated in more business-like terms, the revenues
that the company generates are larger or greater than the
expenses. For example, if a retailer buys a printer for $150 and
sells it for $320, then from the sale it would have revenue of
$320 and expenses of $150, for a profit of $170. (Actually, the
process is a little more complicated because there would
typically be other expenses for the operation of the store.
However, to keep the example simple, those were not included.
You'll learn more about this later in the course.)

   Developing and maintaining profitable operations (selling
goods and services) typically provides businesses with
resources to use for future projects such as hiring additional
workers, maintaining equipment, or expanding a warehouse.
While profitable operations are valuable to businesses,
companies often want to engage in projects that are very

36 | Stakeholders
expensive and/or are time sensitive. Businesses, then, have
other options to raise funds quickly, such as selling stock and
borrowing from lenders, as previously discussed.

   An advantage of selling stock to raise capital is that the
business is not committed to a specific payback schedule. A
disadvantage of issuing new stock is that the administrative
costs (legal and compliance) are high, which makes it an
expensive way to raise capital.

   There are two advantages to raising money by borrowing
from lenders. One advantage is that the process, relative to
profitable operations and selling ownership, is quicker. As
you've learned, lenders (and creditors) review financial
information provided by the business in order to make
assessments on whether or not to lend money to the business,
how much money to lend, and the acceptable length of time
to lend. A second, and related, advantage of raising capital
through borrowing is that it is fairly inexpensive. A
disadvantage of borrowing money from lenders is the
repayment commitments. Because lenders require the funds
to be repaid within a specific time frame, the risk to the
business (and, in turn, to the lender) increases.

   These topics are covered extensively in the area of study
called corporate finance. While finance and accounting are
similar in many aspects, in practicality finance and accounting
are separate disciplines that frequently work in coordination in
a business setting. Students may be interested to learn more
about the educational and career options in the field of
corporate finance. Because there are many similarities in the
study of finance and accounting, many college students
double major in a combination of finance, accounting,
economics, and information systems.

                                                                               Stakeholders | 37
CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

Profit

What is profit? In accounting, there is general consensus on
the definition of profit. A typical definition of profit is, in effect,
when inflows of cash or other resources are greater than
outflows of resources.

   Ken Blanchard provides another way to define profit.
Blanchard is the author of The One Minute Manager, a popular
leadership book published in 1982. He is often quoted as saying,
"profit is the applause you get for taking care of your customers
and creating a motivating environment for your people
[employees]." Blanchard's definition recognizes the
multidimensional aspect of profit, which requires successful
businesses to focus on their customers, employees, and the
community.

   Check out this short video review of Blanchard's "One Minute
Manager".

Governmental and
Regulatory Agencies

Publicly traded companies are required to file financial and
other informational reports with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), a federal regulatory agency that regulates
corporations with shares listed and traded on security
exchanges through required periodic filings SEC website. The
SEC accomplishes this in two primary ways: issuing regulations
and providing oversight of financial markets. The goal of these

38 | Stakeholders
actions is to help ensure that businesses provide investors with
access to transparent and unbiased financial information.

          Securities and Exchange Commission seal Wikimedia
          Public Domain

The SEC is responsible for establishing guidelines for the
accounting profession. These are called accounting standards
or generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Although
the SEC also had the responsibility of issuing standards for the
auditing profession, they relinquished this responsibility to the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).

   The SEC also has responsibility for regulating firms that issue
and trade (buy and sell) securities--stocks, bonds, and other
investment instruments.

   Enforcement by the SEC takes many forms. According to
the SEC website, "Each year the SEC brings hundreds of civil
enforcement actions against individuals and companies for

                                                                               Stakeholders | 39
violation of the securities laws. Typical infractions include
insider trading, accounting fraud, and providing false or
misleading information about securities and the companies
that issue them."3 Financial information is a valuable tool that is
part of the investigatory and enforcement activities of the SEC.

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

Financial Professionals and Fraud

You may have heard the name Bernard "Bernie" Madoff. Madoff
(image below) was the founder of an investment firm, Bernard
L. Madoff Investment Securities. The original mission of the
firm was to provide financial advice and investment services to
clients. This is a valuable service to many people because of the
complexity of financial investments and retirement planning.
Many people rely on financial professionals, like Bernie Madoff,
to help them create wealth and be in a position to retire
comfortably. Unfortunately, Madoff took advantage of the trust
of his investors and was ultimately convicted of stealing
(embezzling) over $50 billion (a low amount by some
estimates). Madoff's embezzlement remains one of the biggest
financial frauds in US history.

40 | Stakeholders

The fraud scheme was initially uncovered by a financial analyst
named Harry Markopolos. Markopolos became suspicious
because Madoff's firm purported to achieve for its investors
abnormally high rates of return for an extended period of time.
After analyzing the investment returns, Markopolos reported
the suspicious activity to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), which has enforcement responsibility for
firms providing investment services. While Madoff was initially

                                                                                Stakeholders | 41
able to stay a few steps ahead of the SEC, he was charged in
2009 and will spend the rest of his life in prison.

   There are many resources to explore the Madoff scandal. You
might be interested in reading the book, No One Would Listen:
A True Financial Thriller, written by Harry Markopolos. A movie
and a TV series have also been made about the Madoff scandal.

In addition to governmental and regulatory agencies at the
federal level, many state and local agencies use financial
information to accomplish the mission of protecting the public
interest. The primary goals are to ensure the financial
information is prepared according to the relevant rules or
practices as well as to ensure funds are being used in an
efficient and transparent manner. For example, local school
district administrators should ensure that financial information
is available to the residents and is presented in an unbiased
manner. The residents want to know their tax dollars are not
being wasted. Likewise, the school district administrators want
to demonstrate they are using the funding in an efficient and
effective manner. This helps ensure a good relationship with
the community that fosters trust and support for the school
system.

Customers

Depending on the perspective, the term customers can have
different meanings. Consider for a moment a retail store that
sells electronics. That business has customers that purchase its
electronics. These customers are considered the end users of
the product. The customers, knowingly or unknowingly, have
a stake in the financial performance of the business. The
customers benefit when the business is financially successful.
Profitable businesses will continue to sell the products the
customers want, maintain and improve the business facilities,

42 | Stakeholders
provide employment for community members, and undertake
many other activities that contribute to a vibrant and thriving
community.

   Businesses are also customers. In the example of the
electronics store, the business purchases its products from
other businesses, including the manufacturers of the
electronics. Just as end-user customers have a vested interest
in the financial success of the business, business customers
also benefit from suppliers that have financial success. A
supplier that is financially successful will help ensure the
electronics will continue to be available to purchase and resell
to the end-use customer, investments in emerging
technologies will be made, and improvements in delivery and
customer service will result. This, in turn, helps the retail
electronics store remain cost competitive while being able to
offer its customers a wide variety of products.

Managers and Other Employees

Employees have a strong interest in the financial performance
of the organizations for which they work. At the most basic
level, employees want to know their jobs will be secure so they
can continue to be paid for their work. In addition, employees
increase their value to the organization through their years
of service, improving knowledge and skills, and accepting
positions of increased responsibility. An organization that is
financially successful is able to reward employees for that
commitment to the organization through bonuses and
increased pay.

   In addition to promotional and compensation
considerations, managers and others in the organization have
the responsibility to make day-to-day and long-term (strategic)
decisions for the organization. Understanding financial
information is vital to making good organizational decisions.

                                                                               Stakeholders | 43
   Not all decisions, however, are based on strictly financial
information. Recall that managers and other decision makers
often use nonfinancial, or managerial, information. These
decisions take into account other relevant factors that may not
have an immediate and direct link to the financial reports. It is
important to understand that sound organizational decisions
are often (and should be) based on both financial and
nonfinancial information.

   In addition to exploring managerial accounting concepts,
you will also learn some of the common techniques that are
used to analyze the financial reports of businesses.

Careers in Accounting

There are often misunderstandings on what exactly
accountants do or what attributes are necessary for a
successful career in accounting. Often, people perceive
accountants as "number-crunchers" or "bean counters" who
sit behind a desk, working with numbers, and having little
interaction with others. The fact is that this perception could
not be further from the truth.

Personal Attributes

While it is true that accountants often work independently,
much of the work that accountants undertake involves
interactions with other people. In fact, accountants frequently
need to gather information from others and explain complex
financial concepts to others, making excellent written and
verbal communication skills a must. In addition, accountants
often deal with strict deadlines such as tax filings, making
prioritizing work commitments and being goal oriented
necessities. In addition to these skills, traditionally, an
accountant can be described as someone who

   is goal oriented,
   is a problem solver,
   is organized and analytical,
   has good interpersonal skills,
   pays attention to detail,
   has good time-management skills, and
   is outgoing.

website), the governing body of the global Chartered Certified
Accountant (CCA) designation, and the Institute of
Management Accountants (IMA website), the governing body
of the Certified Management Accountant (CMA website)
designation, conducted a study to research the skills
accountants will need given a changing economic and
technological context. The findings indicate that, in addition to
the traditional personal attributes, accountants should possess
"traits such as entrepreneurship, curiosity, creativity, and
strategic thinking."4

Education

Entry-level positions in the accounting profession usually
require a minimum of a bachelor's degree. For advanced
positions, firms may consider factors such as years of
experience, professional development, certifications, and
advanced degrees, such as a master's or doctorate. The specific
factors regarding educational requirements depend on the
industry and the specific business.

   After earning a bachelor's degree, many students decide to
continue their education by earning a master's degree. A
common question for students is when to begin a master's
program, either entering a master's program immediately after
earning a bachelor's degree or first entering the profession and
pursuing a master's at a later point. On one hand, there are
benefits of entering into a master's program immediately after
earning a bachelor's degree, mainly that students are already
into the rhythm of being a full-time student so an additional
year or so in a master's program is appealing. On the other
hand, entering the profession directly after earning a bachelor's
degree allows the student to gain valuable professional
experience that may enrich the graduate education
experience. When to enter a graduate program is not an easy

46 | Careers in Accounting
decision. There are pros and cons to either position. In essence,
the final decision depends on the personal perspective and
alternatives available to the individual student. For example,
one student might not have the financial resources to continue
immediately on to graduate school and will first need to work
to fund additional education, while another student might
have outside suppliers of resources or is considering taking
on additional student loan debt. The best recommendation
for these students is to consider all of the factors and realize
that they must make the final decision as to their own best
alternative. It is also important to note that if one makes the
decision to enter public accounting, as all states require 150
hours of education to earn a Certified Public Accountant (CPA)
license, it is customary for regional and national public
accounting firms to require a master's degree or 150 hours
earned by other means as a condition for employment; this
may influence your decision to enter a master's degree
program as soon as the bachelor's degree is complete.

Related Careers

An accounting degree is a valuable tool for other professions
too. A thorough understanding of accounting provides the
student with a comprehensive understanding of business
activity and the importance of financial information to make
informed decisions. While an accounting degree is a necessity
to work in the accounting profession, it also provides a solid
foundation for other careers, such as financial analysts,
personal financial planners, and business executives. The
number of career options may seem overwhelming at this
point, and a career in the accounting profession is no
exception. The purpose of this section is to simply highlight the
vast number of options that an accounting degree offers. In the

                                                                 Careers in Accounting | 47
workforce, accounting professionals can find a career that best
fits their interests.

   Students may also be interested in learning more about
professional certifications in the areas of financial analysis
(Chartered Financial Analyst; CFA website) and personal
financial planning (Certified Financial Planner; CFP website),
which are discussed later in this section.

Major Categories of Accounting Functions

It is a common perception that an accounting career means
preparing tax returns. While numerous accountants do
prepare tax returns, many people are surprised to learn of the
variety of career paths that are available within the accounting
profession. An accounting degree is a valuable tool that gives
accountants a high level of flexibility and many options. Often
individual accountants apply skills in several of the following
career paths simultaneously. The following figure illustrates
some of the many career paths open to accounting students.

Career Paths. There are many career paths open to students of
accounting. By Rice University. Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

Auditing

Auditing, which is performed by accountants with a specialized
skill set, is the process of ensuring activities are carried out
as intended or designed. There are many examples of the
functions that auditors perform. For example, in a
manufacturing company, auditors may sample products and
assess whether or not the products conform to the customer
specifications. As another example, county auditors may test
pumps at gas stations to ensure the pumps are delivering the
correct amount of gasoline and charging customers correctly.

   Companies should develop policies and procedures to help
ensure the company's goals are being met and the assets are
protected. This is called the internal control system. To help
maintain the effectiveness of the internal control system,

                                                                 Careers in Accounting | 49
companies often hire internal auditors, who evaluate internal
controls through reviews and tests. For example, internal
auditors may review the process of how cash is handled within
a business. In this scenario, the goal of the company is to
ensure that all cash payments are properly applied to customer
accounts and that all funds are properly deposited into the
company's bank account. As another example, internal
auditors may review the shipping and receiving process to
ensure that all products shipped or received have the proper
paperwork and the product is handled and stored properly.
While internal auditors also often work to ensure compliance
with external regulations, the primary goal of internal auditors
is to help ensure the company policies are followed, which
helps the company attain its strategic goals and protect its
assets. The professional certification most relevant to a career
in internal audit is the Certified Internal Auditor (CIA). Financial
fraud occurs when an individual or individuals act with intent
to deceive for a financial gain. A Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE)
is trained to prevent fraud from occurring and to detect when
fraud has occurred.

   Companies also want to ensure the financial statements
provided to outside parties such as banks, governmental
agencies, and the investing public are reliable and consistent.
That is, companies have a desire to provide financial
statements that are free of errors or fraud. Since internal
auditors are committed to providing unbiased financial
information, it would be possible for the company to use
internal auditors to attest to the integrity of the company's
financial statements. With that said, doing so presents the
appearance of a possibility of a conflict of interest and could
call into question the validity of the financial statements.
Therefore, companies hire external auditors to review and
attest to the integrity of the financial statements. External
auditors typically work for a public accounting firm. Although
the public accounting firm is hired by the company to attest

50 | Careers in Accounting
to the fairness of the financial statements, the external auditors
are independent of the company and provide an unbiased
opinion.

Taxation

There are many taxes that businesses are required to pay.
Examples include income taxes, payroll and related taxes such
as workers' compensation and unemployment, property and
inventory taxes, and sales and use taxes. In addition to making
the tax payments, many of the taxes require tax returns and
other paperwork to be completed. Making things even more
complicated is the fact that taxes are levied at the federal, state,
and local levels. For larger worldwide companies, the work
needed to meet their international tax compliance
requirements can take literally thousands of hours of
accountants' time. To sum up the process, the goal of tax
accountants is to help ensure the taxes are paid properly and
in a timely manner, from an individual level all the way to
the company level (including at the level of such companies
as Apple and Walmart).

   Since accountants have an understanding of various tax laws
and filing deadlines, they are also well-positioned to offer tax
planning advice. Tax laws are complex and change frequently;
therefore, it is helpful for businesses to include tax
considerations in their short- and long-term planning.
Accountants are a valuable resource in helping businesses
minimize the tax liability.

   Many businesses find it necessary to employ accountants
to work on tax compliance and planning on a full-time basis.
Other businesses need these services on a periodic (quarterly
or annual) basis and hire external accountants accordingly.

                                                                  Careers in Accounting | 51
Financial Accounting

Financial accounting measures, in dollars, the activities of an
organization. Financial accounting is historical in nature and
is prepared using standard conventions, called accounting
standards or GAAP. Because nearly every activity in an
organization has a financial implication, financial accounting
might be thought of as a "monetary scorecard."

   Financial accounting is used internally by managers and
other decision makers to validate activities that were done well
and to highlight areas that need adjusted in the future.
Businesses often use discretion as to how much and with
whom financial accounting information is shared.

   Financial accounting is also provided to those outside the
organization. For a publicly traded company, issuing financial
statements is required by the SEC. Sharing financial
information for a privately held company is usually reserved for
those instances where the information is required, such as for
audits or obtaining loans.

Consulting

Because nearly every activity within an organization has a
financial implication, accountants have a unique opportunity
to gain a comprehensive view of an organization. Accountants
are able to see how one area of a business affects a different
aspect of the business. As accountants gain experience in the
profession, this unique perspective allows them to build a
"knowledge database" that is valuable to businesses. In this
capacity, accountants can provide consulting services, which
means giving advice or guidance to managers and other
decision makers on the impact (both financial and
nonfinancial) of a potential course of action. This role allows the

52 | Careers in Accounting
organization to gain knowledge from the accountants in a way
that minimizes risk and/or financial investment.

   As discussed previously, accountants may advise a business
on tax-related issues. Other examples of consultative services
that accountants perform include selection and installation of
computer software applications and other technology
considerations, review of internal controls, determination of
compliance with relevant laws and regulations, review of
compensation and incentive arrangements, and consideration
of operational efficiencies within the production process.

Accounting Information Services

Computers are an integral part of business. Computers and
related software programs allow companies to efficiently
record, store, and process valuable data and information
relevant to the business. Accountants are often an integral part
of the selection and maintenance of the company's
computerized accounting and information system. The goal
of the accounting information system is to efficiently provide
relevant information to internal decision makers, and it is
important for businesses to stay abreast of advances in
technology and invest in those technologies that help the
business remain efficient and competitive.

   Significant growth is expected in accounting information
systems careers. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics,
in 2010 there were over 130,000 jobs in the accounting
informations systems sector, with over 49% growth expected
through 2024. Median earnings in this field were over $73,000
in 2011.5 For those interested in both accounting and computer
information systems, there are tremendous career
opportunities.

                                                                 Careers in Accounting | 53
CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

Enterprise Resource Planning

As companies grow in size and expand geographically, it is
important to assess whether or not a current computerized
system is the right size and fit for the organization. For
example, a company with a single location can easily manage
its business activities with a small, off-the-shelf software
package such as QuickBooks and software applications such
as Microsoft Excel. A company's computer system becomes
more complex when additional locations are added.

Growth By geralt. Pixabay Public domain

As companies continue to grow, larger integrated computer
systems, called enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems,
may be implemented. Enterprise resource planning systems
are designed to maintain the various aspects of the business
within a single integrated computer system. For example, a
54 | Careers in Accounting
leading  ERP            system  is Microsoft Dynamics

GP. Microsoft Dynamics GP is an integrated sytem with the

capability to handle the human resource management,

production, accounting, manufacturing, and many other

aspects of a business. ERP systems, like Microsoft Dynamics

GP, are also designed to accommodate companies that have

international locations. The benefit of ERP systems is that

information is efficiently stored and utilized across the entire

business in real time.

Cost and Managerial Accounting

Cost accounting and managerial accounting are related, but
different, types of accounting. In essence, a primary distinction
between the two functions is that cost accounting takes a
primarily quantitative approach, whereas managerial
accounting takes both quantitative and qualitative
approaches. The goal of cost accounting is to determine the
costs involved with providing goods and services. In a
manufacturing business, cost accounting is the recording and
tracking of costs such as direct materials, employee wages, and
supplies used in the manufacturing process.

   Managerial accounting uses cost accounting and other
financial accounting information, as well as nonfinancial
information, to make short-term as well as strategic and other
long-term decisions for a business.

   Both cost and managerial accounting are intended to be
used inside a business. Along with financial accounting
information, managers and other decision makers within a
business use the information to facilitate decision-making,
develop long-term plans, and perform other functions
necessary for the success of the business.

                                                                 Careers in Accounting | 55
   There are two major differences between cost and
managerial accounting and financial accounting. Whereas
financial accounting requires the use of standard accounting
conventions (also called accounting standards or GAAP), there
are no such requirements for cost and managerial accounting.
In practice, management has different needs that require cost
and managerial accounting information. In addition, financial
information is prepared in specific intervals of time, usually
monthly. The same is not true with cost and managerial
accounting, which are prepared on an as-needed basis that is
not reported as specific periods of time.

   An example may be helpful in clarifying the difference
between cost and managerial accounting. Manufacturing
companies often face the decision of whether to make certain
components or purchase the components from an outside
supplier. Cost accounting would calculate the cost of each
alternative. Managerial accounting would use that cost and
supplement the cost with nonfinancial information to arrive
at a decision. Let's say the cost accountants determine that a
company would save $0.50 per component if the units were
purchased from an outside supplier rather than being
produced by the company. Managers would use the $0.50 per
piece savings as well as nonfinancial considerations, such as
the impact on the morale of current employees and the
supplier's ability to produce a quality product, to make a
decision whether or not to purchase the component from the
outside supplier.

   In summary, it may be helpful to think of cost accounting
as a subset of managerial accounting. Another way to think
about cost and managerial accounting is that the result of
cost accounting is a number, whereas the result of managerial
accounting is a decision.

Financial Planning

While accountants spend much of their time interacting with
other people, a large component of their work involves
numbers and finances. As mentioned previously, many people
with an interest in data often go into the accounting profession
and have a natural inclination toward solving problems. In
addition, accountants also gain a comprehensive view of
business. They understand how the diverse aspects of the
business are connected and how those activities ultimately
have a financial impact on the organization.

   These attributes allow accountants to offer expertise in
financial planning, which takes many forms. Within a business,
making estimates and establishing a plan for the
future--called a budget--are vital. These actions allow the
business to determine the appropriate level of activity and
make any adjustments accordingly. Training in accounting is
also helpful for those who offer financial planning for
individuals. When it comes to investing and saving for the
future, there are many options available to individuals.
Investing is complicated, and many people want help from
someone who understands the complexities of the investment
options, the tax implications, and ways to invest and build
wealth. Accountants are well trained to offer financial planning
services to the businesses they work with as well as individuals
investing for their future.

Entrepreneurship

Many people have an idea for a product or service and decide
to start their own business--they are often labeled as
entrepreneurs. These individuals have a passion for their
product or service and are experts at what they do. But that

                                                                 Careers in Accounting | 57
is not enough. In order for the business to be successful,
the entrepreneur must understand all aspects of the business,
including and especially the financial aspect. It is important
for the entrepreneur to understand how to obtain the funding
to start the business, measure the financial performance of
the business, and know what adjustments to improve the
performance of the business are necessary and when to make
them. Understanding accounting, or hiring accountants who
can perform these activities, is valuable to the entrepreneur.
An entrepreneur works extremely hard and has often taken a
great risk in starting his or her own business. Understanding
the financial performance of the business helps ensure the
business is successful.

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

Entrepreneurship

Entrepreneurs do not have to develop a brand new product
or service in order to open their own business. Often
entrepreneurs decide to purchase a store from a business that
already exists. This is called a franchise arrangement. In these
arrangements, the business owner (the franchisee) typically
pays the franchisor (the business offering the franchise
opportunity) a lump sum at the beginning of the arrangement.
This lump sum payment allows the franchisee an opportunity
to use the store logos and receive training, consulting, and
other support from the franchisor. A series of scheduled
payments is also common. The ongoing payments are often
based on a percentage of the franchise store's sales.

   The franchise arrangement is beneficial to both parties. For
the franchisee, there is less risk involved because they often

58 | Careers in Accounting
purchase a franchise from a business with an established track
record of success. For the franchisor, it is an opportunity to
build the brand without the responsibility of direct oversight
for individual stores--each franchise is independently owned
and operated (a phrase you might see on franchise stores).

   The downside of the franchising arrangement is the amount
of money that is paid to the franchisor through the initial lump
sum as well as continued payments. These costs, however, are
necessary for the ongoing support from the franchisor. In
addition, franchisees often have restrictions relative to product
pricing and offerings, geographic locations, and approved
suppliers.

   According to Entrepreneur.com, based on factors such as
costs and fees, support, and brand strength, the number
one-ranking franchise in 2017 was 7-Eleven, Inc. According to
the website, 7-Eleven has been franchising since 1964 and has
61,086 franchise stores worldwide (7,025 are located in the
United States). In addition, 7-Eleven has 1,019 company-owned
stores.6

Major Categories of Employers

Now that you've learned about the various career paths that
accountants can take, let's briefly look at the types of
organizations that accountants can work for. This
figure illustrates some common types of employers that
require accountants. While this is not an all-inclusive list, most
accountants in the profession are employed by these types of
organizations.

                                                                 Careers in Accounting | 59

Public Accounting Firms

Public accounting firms offer a wide range of accounting,
auditing, consulting, and tax preparation services to their
clients. A small business might use a public accounting firm
to prepare the monthly or quarterly financial statements and/
or the payroll. A business (of any size) might hire the public
accounting firm to audit the company financial statements or
verify that policies and procedures are being followed properly.
Public accounting firms may also offer consulting services to
their clients to advise them on implementing computerized
systems or strengthening the internal control system. (Note
that you will learn in your advanced study of accounting that
accountants have legal limitations on what consulting services

60 | Careers in Accounting
they can provide to their clients.) Public accounting firms also

offer tax preparation services for their business and individual

clients. Public accounting firms may also offer business

valuation, forensic accounting (financial crimes), and other

services.

Public accounting firms are often categorized based on the

size (revenue). The biggest firms are referred to as the "Big

Four" and include Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu

Limited (DTTL), PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), Ernst          &

Young (EY), and KPMG. Following the Big Four in size are firms

such as RSM US, Grant Thornton, BDO USA, Crowe,
and CliftonLarsonAllen (CLA).7 There are also many other

regional and local public accounting firms.

Public accounting firms often expect the accountants they

employ to have earned (or will earn) the Certified Public

Accountant (CPA) designation. It is not uncommon for public

accounting firms to specialize. For example, some public

accounting firms may specialize in serving clients in the

banking or aerospace industries. In addition to specializing in

specific industries, public accounting firms may also specialize

in areas of accounting such as tax compliance and planning.

Hiring public accounting firms to perform various services is

an attractive option for many businesses. The primary benefit

is that the business has access to experts in the profession

without needing to hire accounting specialists on a full-time

basis.

Corporations

Corporations hire accountants to perform various functions
within the business. The primary responsibility of corporate
accountants (which include cost and managerial accountants)
is to provide information for internal users and decision makers,
as well as implement and monitor internal controls. The

                                                                  Careers in Accounting | 61
information provided by corporate accountants takes many
forms. For example, some of the common responsibilities of
corporate accountants include calculating and tracking the
costs of providing goods and services, analyzing the financial
performance of the business in comparison to expectations,
and developing budgets, which help the company plan for
future operations and make any necessary adjustments. In
addition, many corporate accountants have the responsibility
for or help with the company's payroll and computer network.

   In smaller corporations, an accountant may be responsible
for or assist with several of these activities. In larger firms,
however, accountants may specialize in one of the areas of
responsibilities and may rotate responsibilities throughout
their career. Many larger firms also use accountants as part of
the internal audit function. In addition, many large companies
are able to dedicate resources to making the organization
more efficient. Programs such as Lean Manufacturing and Six
Sigma focus on reducing waste and eliminating cost within the
organization. Accountants trained in these techniques receive
specialized training that focuses on the cost impact of the
activities of the business.

   As with many organizations, professional certifications are
highly valued in corporations. The primary certification for
corporate accounting is the Certified Management
Accountant (CMA). Because corporations also undertake
financial reporting and related activities, such as tax
compliance, corporations often hire CPAs.

Governmental Entities

Accountants in governmental entities perform many of the
same functions as accountants in public accounting firms and
corporations. The primary goal of governmental accounting is
to ensure proper tracking of the inflows and outflows of

62 | Careers in Accounting
taxpayer funds using the proscribed standards. Some
governmental accountants also prepare and may also audit
the work of other governmental agencies to ensure the funds
are properly accounted for. The major difference between
accountants in governmental entities and accountants
working in public accounting firms and corporations relates
to the specific rules by which the financial reporting must be
prepared. Whereas as accountants in public accounting firms
and corporations use GAAP, governmental accounting is
prepared under a different set of rules that are specific to
governmental agencies, as previously referred to as the
Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). Students
continuing their study of accounting may take specific courses
related to governmental accounting.

   Accountants in the governmental sector may also work in
specialized areas. For example, many accountants work for tax
agencies at the federal, state, and local levels to ensure the tax
returns prepared by businesses and individuals comply with
the tax code appropriate for the particular jurisdiction. As
another example, accountants employed by the SEC may
investigate instances where financial crimes occur, as in the
case of Bernie Madoff, previously discussed.

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

Bringing Down Capone

Al Capone was one of the most notorious criminals in American
history. Born in 1899 in Brooklyn, New York, Al Capone rose to
fame as a gangster in Chicago during the era of Prohibition.
By the late 1920s-1930s, Capone controlled a syndicate with a
reported annual income of $100 million.

   Al Capone was credited for many murders, including

                                                                 Careers in Accounting | 63
masterminding the famous 1929 St. Valentine's Day murder,
which killed seven rival gang members. But law enforcement
was unable to convict Capone for the murders he committed
or orchestrated. Through bribes and extortion, Capone was
able to evade severe punishment, being charged at one point
with gun possession and serving a year in jail.

   Capone's luck ran out in 1931 when he was convicted of
federal tax evasion. In 1927, the United States Supreme Court
ruled that earnings from illegal activities were taxable. Capone,
however, did not claim the illegal earnings on his 1928 and
1929 income tax returns and was subsequently sentenced to
eleven years in prison. Up to that point, it was the longest-ever
sentence for tax evasion.

   Al Capone was paroled from prison in November 1939 and
died on January 25, 1947. His life has been the subject of many
articles, books, movies including Scarface (1932), and the TV
series The Untouchables (1993).

   Those interested in stories like this might consider working
for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). According to the
FBI, as of 2012, approximately 15% of FBI agents are special
agent accountants.

many charges against him, most of which were dismissed. By FBI/

Not-for-Profit Entities

Not-for-profit entities include charitable organizations,
foundations, and universities. Unlike for-profit entities, not-for-
profit organizations have a primary focus of a particular
mission. Therefore, not-for-profit (NFP) accounting helps
ensure that donor funds are used for the intended mission.

                                                                 Careers in Accounting | 65
Much like accountants in governmental entities, accountants
in not-for-profit entities use a slightly different type of
accounting than other types of businesses, with the primary
difference being that not-for-profit entities typically do not pay
income taxes.

   However, even if a not-for-profit organization is not subjected
to income taxes in a particular year, it generally must file
informational returns, such as a Form 990, with the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS). Information, such as sources and
amounts of funding and major types and amounts of
expenditures, is documented by the not-for-profit entities to
provide information for potential and current donors. Once
filed with the IRS, Form 990 is available for public view so that
the public can monitor how the specific charity uses proceeds
as well as its operational efficiency.

Potential Certifications for Accountants

As previously discussed, the study of accounting serves as a
foundation for other careers that are similar to accounting, and
the certifications described here reflect that relationship.

   There are many benefits to attaining a professional
certification (or multiple certifications) in addition to a college
degree. Certifications often cover material at a deeper and
more complex level than might typically be covered in a
college program. Those earning a professional certification
demonstrate their willingness to invest the additional time and
energy into becoming experts in the particular field. Because
of this, employees with professional certifications are often in
higher demand and earn higher salaries than those without
professional certifications. Companies also benefit by having
employees with professional certifications. A well-trained staff
with demonstrated expertise conveys a level of professionalism
that gives the organization a competitive advantage. In

66 | Careers in Accounting
addition, professional certifications often require a certain
number of hours of ongoing training. This helps ensure that
the certificate holder remains informed as to the current
advances within the profession and benefits both the
employee and the employer.

   Certifications are developed and governed by the respective
governing body. Each issuing body establishes areas of content
and requirements for the specific certification. Links to the
particular websites are provided so you can easily gain
additional information.

   It is also important to note that many of the certifications
have review courses available. The review courses help
students prepare for the exam by offering test-taking
strategies, practice questions and exams, and other materials
that help students efficiently and effectively prepare for the
exams.

Accounting Codes of Ethics

In the United States, accountants can obtain a number of
different certifications and can be licensed by each state to
practice as a Certified Public Accountant (CPA). Accountants
can also belong to professional organizations that have their
own codes of conduct. As the online Stanford Encyclopedia
of Philosophy explains, "many people engaged in business
activity, including accountants and lawyers, are professionals.
As such, they are bound by codes of conduct promulgated
by professional societies. Many firms also have detailed codes
of conduct, developed and enforced by teams of ethics and
compliance personnel."8 CPAs can find a code of ethics in each
state of practice and with the AICPA.9 Certifications such as the
CMA, CIA, CFE, CFA, and CFP each have their own codes of
ethics.

   To facilitate cross-border business activities and accounting,

                                                                 Careers in Accounting | 67
an attempt has been made to set international standards. To
this end, accounting standards organizations in more than 100
countries use the International Federation of Accountants'
(IFAC) Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants."10 When
auditing a public company, CPAs may also have to follow a
special code of ethics created by the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), or when performing
federal tax work, the US Treasury Department's Circular No. 230
code of ethics. These are just some examples of ethical codes
that are covered in more detail in this course. Each area of
accounting work has its own set of ethical rules, but they all
require that a professional accountant perform his or her work
with integrity.

Certified Public Accountant (CPA)

The Certified Public Accountant (CPA) designation is earned
after passing a uniform exam issued by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). While the exam is a
uniform, nationally administered exam, each state issues and
governs CPA licenses.

   The CPA exam has four parts: Auditing and Attestation (AUD),
Business Environment and Concepts (BEC), Financial
Accounting and Reporting (FAR), and Regulation (REG). A
score of at least 75% must be earned in order to earn the CPA
designation.

   Since each state determines the requirements for CPA
licenses, students are encouraged to check the state board of
accountancy for specific requirements. In Ohio, for example,
candidates for the CPA exam must have 150 hours of college
credit. Of those, thirty semester hours (or equivalent quarter
hours) must be in accounting. Once the CPA designation is
earned in Ohio, 120 hours of continuing education must be
taken over a three-year period in order to maintain the

68 | Careers in Accounting
certification. The requirements for the Ohio CPA exam are
similar to the requirements for other states. Even though states
issue CPA licenses, a CPA will not lose the designation should
he or she move to another state. Each state has mobility or
reciprocity requirements that allow CPAs to transfer licensure
from one state to another. Reciprocity requirements can be
obtained by contacting the respective state board of
accountancy.

   The majority of states require 150 hours of college credit.
Students often graduate with a bachelor's degree with
approximately 120-130 credit hours. In order to reach the
150-hour requirement that specific states have, students have
a couple of options. The extra hours can be earned either by
taking additional classes in their undergraduate program or
by entering a graduate program, earning a master's degree.
Master's degrees that would be most beneficial in an
accounting or related field would be a master of accountancy,
master in taxation, or a master in analytics, which is rapidly
increasing in demand.

Certified Management Accountant (CMA)

The Certified Management Accountant (CMA) exam is
developed and administered by the Institute of Management
Accountants (IMA). There are many benefits in earning the
CMA designation, including career advancement and earnings
potential. Management accountants, among other activities,
prepare budgets, perform analysis of financial and operational
variances, and determine the cost of providing goods and
services. Earning a certification enables the management
accountant to advance to management and executive
positions within the organization.

   The CMA exam has two parts: Financial Reporting, Planning,
Performance, and Control (part 1) and Financial Decision-

                                                                 Careers in Accounting | 69
Making (part 2). A score of at least 72% must be earned in
order to earn the CMA designation. A minimum of a bachelor's
degree is required to take the CMA exam. An accounting
degree or a specific number of credit hours in accounting is
not required in order to take the CMA exam. Once the CMA
designation is earned, thirty hours of continuing education
with two of the hours focusing on ethics must be taken
annually in order to maintain the certification.

Certified Internal Auditor (CIA)

The Certified Internal Auditor (CIA) exam is developed and
administered by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA).
According to the IIA website, the four-part CIA exam tests
"candidates' grasp of internal auditing's role in governance,
risk, and control; conducting an audit engagement; business
analysis and information technology; and business
management skills."11

   If a candidate does not have a bachelor's degree, eligibility
to take the CIA is based on a combination of work experience
and education experience. In order to earn the CIA designation,
a passing score of 80% is required. After successful passage of
the CIA exam, certificate holders are required to earn eighty
hours of continuing education credit every two years.12

Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE)

The Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE) exam is developed and
administered by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners
(ACFE). Eligibility to take the CFE is based on a points system
based on education and work experience. Candidates with
forty points may take the CFE exam, and official certification

70 | Careers in Accounting
is earned with fifty points or more. A bachelor's degree, for
example, is worth forty points toward eligibility of the fifty-
point requirement for the CFE certification. The CFE offers an
attractive supplement for students interested in pursuing a
career in accounting fraud detection. Students might also
consider studying forensic accounting in college. These
courses are often offered at the graduate level.

   The CFE exam has four parts: Fraud Prevention and
Deterrence, Financial Transactions and Fraud Schemes,
Investigation, and Law. Candidates must earn a minimum
score of 75%. Once the CFE is earned, certificate holders must
annually complete at least twenty hours of continuing
education. The CFE certification is valued in many
organizations, including governmental agencies at the local,
state, and federal levels.

Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA)

The Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) certification is
developed and administered by the CFA Institute. The CFA
exam contains three levels (level I, level II, and level III), testing
expertise in Investment Tools, Asset Classes, and Portfolio
Management. Those with a bachelor's degree are eligible to
take the CFA exam. In lieu of a bachelor's degree, work
experience or a combination of work experience and education
is considered satisfactory for eligibility to take the CFA exam.
After taking the exam, candidates receive a "Pass" or "Did Not
Pass" result. A passing score is determined by the CFA Institute
once the examination has been administered. The passing
score threshold is established after considering factors such
as exam content and current best practices. After successful
passage of all three levels of the CFA examination, chartered
members must earn at least twenty hours annually of

                                                                  Careers in Accounting | 71
continuing education, of which two hours must be in
Standards, Ethics, and Regulations (SER).

Certified Financial Planner (CFP)

The Certified Financial Planner (CFP) certification is developed
and administered by the Certified Financial Planner (CFP)
Board of Standards. The CFP exam consists of 170 multiple-
choice questions that are taken over two, three-hour sessions.
There are several ways in which the eligibility requirements
can be met in order to take the CFP exam, which students
can explore using the CFP Board of Standards website. As with
the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) exam, the CFP Board
of Standards does not predetermine a passing score but
establishes the pass/fail threshold through a deliberative
evaluation process. Upon successful completion of the exam,
CFPs must obtain thirty hours of continuing education every
two years, with two of the hours focused on ethics.

Users of Reports

The information generated from the reports of financial
accountants tends to be used primarily by external users,
including the creditors, tax authorities and regulators,
investors, customers, competitors, and others outside the

76 | Comparing Financial & Managerial Accounting
company, who rely on the financial statements and annual
reports to access information about a company in order to
make more informed decisions. Since these external people
do not have access to the documents and records used to
produce the financial statements, they depend on Generally
Applied Accounting Principles (GAAP). These outside users also
depend greatly on the preparation of audits that are done by
public accounting firms, under the guidelines and standards of
either the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
(AICPA), the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), or
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB).

   Managerial accounting information is gathered and reported
for a more specific purpose for internal users, those inside the
company or organization who are responsible for managing
the company's business interests and executing decisions.
These internal users may include management at all levels in
all departments, owners, and other employees. For example,
in the budget development process, a company such
as Tesla may want to project the costs of producing a new line
of automobiles. The managerial accountants could create a
budget to estimate the costs, such as parts and labor, and
after the manufacturing process has begun, they can measure
the actual costs, thus determining if they are over or under
their budgeted amounts. Although outside parties might be
interested in this information, companies like Tesla, Microsoft,
and Boeing spend significant amounts of time and money to
keep their proprietary information secret. Therefore, these
internal budget reports are only available to the appropriate
users. While you can find a cost of goods sold schedule in the
financial statements of publicly traded companies, it is difficult
for outside parties to break it down in order to identify the
individual costs of products and services.

Types of Reports

Financial accounting information is communicated
through reporting, such as the financial statements. The
financial statements typically include a balance sheet, income
statement, cash flow statement, retained earnings statement,
and footnotes. Managerial accounting information is
communicated through reporting as well. However, the reports
are more detailed and more specific and can be customized.
One example of a managerial accounting report is a budget
analysis (variance report) as shown in the table below. Other
reports can include cost of goods manufactured, job order cost
sheets, and production reports. Since managerial accounting
is not governed by GAAP or other constraints, it is important
for the creator of the reports to disclose all assumptions used
to make the report. Since the reports are used internally, and
not typically released to the general public, the presentation
of any assumptions does not have to follow any industry-wide
guidelines. Each organization is free to structure its reports in
the format that organizes its information in the best way for it.

Expenses

Net Income                105,000 110,000         (5,000)

This type of analysis helps management to evaluate how
effective they were at carrying out the plans and meeting the

78 | Comparing Financial & Managerial Accounting
goals of the corporation. You will see many examples of reports
and analyses that can be used as tools to help management
make decisions.

Frequency of Reports

The financial statements are typically generated quarterly and
annually, although some entities also require monthly
statements. Much work is involved in creating the financial
statements, and any adjustments to accounts must be made
before the statements can be produced. A physical count
inventory must be done to adjust the inventory and cost of
goods sold accounts, depreciation must be calculated and
entered, all prepaid asset accounts must be reviewed for
adjustments, and so forth. The annual reports are not finalized
for several weeks after the year-end, because they are based
on historical data; for a company that is traded on one of the
major or regional stock exchanges, it must have an audit of the
financial statements conducted by an independent certified
public accountant. This audit cannot be completed until after
the end of the company's fiscal year, because the auditors need
access to all of the information for the company for that year.
For companies that are privately held, an audit is not normally
required. However, potential lenders might require an
independent audit.

   Conversely, managers can quickly attain managerial
accounting information. No external, independent auditors are
needed, and it is not necessary to wait until the year-end.
Projections and estimates are adequate. Managers should
understand that in order to obtain information quickly, they
must accept less precision in the reporting. While there are
several reports that are created on a regular basis (e.g., budgets
and variance reports), many management reports are
produced on an as-needed basis.

                            Comparing Financial & Managerial Accounting | 79
Purpose of Reports

The general purpose of financial statement reporting is to
provide information about the results of operations, financial
position, and cash flows of an organization. This data is useful to
a wide range of users in order to make economic decisions. The
purpose of the reporting done by management accountants
is more specific to internal users. Management accountants
make available the information that could assist companies in
increasing their performance and profitability. Unlike financial
reports, management reporting centers on components of the
business. By dividing the business into smaller sections, a
company is able to get into the details and analyze the smallest
segments of the business.

   An understanding of managerial accounting will assist
anyone in the business world in determining and
understanding product costs, analyzing break-even points, and
budgeting for expenses and future growth (which will be
covered in other parts of this course). As a manager, chief
executive officer, or owner, you need to have information
available at hand to answer these types of questions:

   Are my profits higher this quarter over last quarter?
   Do I have enough cash flow to pay my employees?
   Are my jobs priced correctly?
   Are my products priced correctly in order for me to make

      the profit I need to make?
   Who are my most productive and least productive

      employees?

In the world of business, information is power; stated simply,
the more you know, typically, the better your decisions can be.
Managerial accounting delivers data-driven feedback for these
decisions that can assist in improving decision-making over
the long term. Business managers can leverage this powerful

80 | Comparing Financial & Managerial Accounting
tool in order to make their businesses more successful,
because management accounting adds value to common
business decision-making. All of this readily available
information can lead to great improvements for any business.

Focus of Reports

Because financial accounting typically focuses on the
company as a whole, external users of this information choose
to invest or loan money to the entire company, not to a
department or division within the company. Therefore, the
global focus of financial accounting is understandable.

   However, the focus of management accounting is typically
different. Managerial reporting is more focused on divisions,
departments, or any component of a business, down to
individuals. The mid-level and lower-level managers are
typically responsible for smaller subsets within the company.

   Managers need accounting reports that deal specifically with
their division and their specific activities. For instance,
production managers are responsible for their specific area
and the results within their division. Accordingly, these
production managers need information about results achieved
in their division, as well as individual results of departments
within the division. The company can be broken into segments
based on what managers need--for example, geographic
location, product line, customer demographics (e.g., gender,
age, race), or any of a variety of other divisions.

Nature of Reports

Both financial reports and managerial reports use monetary
accounting information, or information relating to money or

                             Comparing Financial & Managerial Accounting | 81
currency. Financial reports use data from the accounting
system that is gathered from the reporting of transactions in
the form of journal entries and then aggregated into financial
statements. This information is monetary in nature. Managerial
accounting uses some of the same financial information as
financial accounting, but much of that information will be
broken down to a more detailed level. For example, in financial
reporting, net sales are needed for the income statement. In
managerial accounting, the quantity and dollar value of the
sales of each product are likely more useful. In addition,
managerial accounting uses a significant amount
of nonmonetary accounting information, such as quantity of
material, number of employees, number of hours worked, and
so forth, which does not relate to money or currency.

Verification of Reports

Financial reports rely on structure. They are generated using
accepted principles that are enforced through a vast set of
rules and guidelines, also known as GAAP. As mentioned
previously, companies that are publicly traded are required to
have their financial statements audited on an annual basis, and
companies that are not publicly traded also may be required
to have their financial statements audited by their creditors.
The information generated by the management accountants
is intended for internal use by the company's divisions,
departments, or both. There are no rules, guidelines, or
principles to follow. Managerial accounting is much more
flexible, so the design of the managerial accounting system is
difficult to standardize, and standardization is unnecessary. It
depends on the nature of the industry. Different companies
(even different managers within the same company) require
different information. The most important issue is whether the

82 | Comparing Financial & Managerial Accounting
reporting is useful for the planning, controlling, and evaluation
purposes.

YOUR TURN

Daryn's Dairy

Assorted Ice Cream Flavors By jeshoots. Pexels CCO

Suppose you have been hired by Daryn's Dairy as a market
analyst. Your first assignment is to evaluate the sales of various
standard and specialty ice creams within the Midwest region
where Daryn's Dairy operates. You also need to determine the
best-selling flavors of ice cream in other regions of the United
States as well as the selling patterns of the flavors. For example,
do some flavors sell better than others at different times of
the year, or are some top sellers sold as limited-edition flavors?

                            Comparing Financial & Managerial Accounting | 83
Remember that one of the strategic goals of the company is
to increase market share, and the first step in meeting this
goal is to sell their product in 10 percent more stores within
their current market, so your research will help upper-level
management carry out the company's goals. Where would you
gather the information? What type of information would you
need? Where would you find this information? How would the
company determine the impact of this type of change on the
business? If implemented, what information would you need
to assess the success of the plan?

   Solution
   Answers will vary. Sample answer:
   Where would you gather the information? Where would you
find this information?

   Current company sales information would be obtained
      from internal company reports and records that detail the
      sale of each type of ice cream including volume, cost,
      price, and profit per flavor.

   Sales of ice cream from other companies may be more
      difficult to obtain, but the footnotes and supplemental
      information to the annual reports of those companies
      being analyzed, as well as industry trade journals, would
      likely be good sources of information.

What types of information would you need?

   Some of the types of information that would be needed
      would be the volume of sales of each flavor (number of
      gallons), how long each flavor has been sold, whether
      seasonal or limited-edition flavors are produced and sold
      only once or are on a rotating basis, the size of the market
      being examined (number of households), whether the
      other companies sell similar products (organic, all natural,
      etc.), the median income of consumers or other

84 | Comparing Financial & Managerial Accounting
      information to assess the consumers' willingness to pay
      for organic products, and so forth.

How would Daryn's Dairy determine the impact of this type of
change on the business?

   Management would evaluate the cost to expand into new
      stores in their current market compared to the potential
      revenues from selling their products in those stores in
      order to assess the ability of the potential expansion to
      generate a profit for the company.

If implemented, what information would Daryn's Dairy need to
assess the success of the plan?

   Management would measure the profitability of selling
      any new products, expanding into new stores in their
      current market, or both to determine if the
      implementation of the plan was a success. If the plan is a
      success and the company is generating profits, the
      company will continue to figure out ways to improve
      efficiency and profitability. If the plan is not a success, the
      company will determine the reasons (cost to produce too
      high, sales price too high, volume too low, etc.) and make a
      new plan.

Ethical Standards

Public Accounting / CPAs and Ethics

Accounting Codes of Ethics

In the United States, accountants can obtain a number of
different certifications and can be licensed by each state to
practice as a Certified Public Accountant (CPA). Accountants
can also belong to professional organizations that have their
own codes of conduct. As the online Stanford Encyclopedia
of Philosophy explains, "many people engaged in business
activity, including accountants and lawyers, are professionals.
As such, they are bound by codes of conduct promulgated
by professional societies. Many firms also have detailed codes
of conduct, developed and enforced by teams of ethics and
compliance personnel."8 CPAs can find a code of ethics in each
state of practice and with the AICPA.9 Certifications such as
the CMA, CIA, CFE, CFA, and CFP each have their own codes
of ethics.

   To facilitate cross-border business activities and accounting,
an attempt has been made to set international standards. To
this end, accounting standards organizations in more than 100
countries use the International Federation of Accountants'
(IFAC website) Code of Ethics for Professional
Accountants."10 When auditing a public company, CPAs may
also have to follow a special code of ethics created by the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), or
when performing federal tax work, the US Treasury
Department's Circular No. 230 code of ethics. These are just
some examples of ethical codes that are covered in more detail

86 | Ethical Standards
in this course. Each area of accounting work has its own set of
ethical rules, but they all require that a professional accountant
perform his or her work with integrity.

Ethics & Managerial Accounting

By Tumisu. Pixabay Pixabay license

Unlike the specific rules set forth by GAAP and the SEC that
govern financial accounting, managerial accounting does not
have specific rules and is considered flexible, as the reporting
stays internal and does not need to follow external rules.
Managers of a business need detailed information in a timely
manner. This means that a managerial accountant needs to
understand many detailed aspects of how the company
operates in addition to financial accounting methods, because
the framework of typical management reports often comes

                                                                        Ethical Standards | 87
from the financial statements. However, the reports can be
individualized and customized to the information the manager
is seeking. Each company has different strategies, timing, and
needs for information.

   The Institute of Management Accountants (IMA), the
professional organization for management accountants,
provides research, education, a means of knowledge sharing,
and practice development to its members. The IMA also issues
the Certified Management Accountant (CMA) certification to
those accountants who meet the educational requirements,
pass the rigorous two-part exam, and maintain continuing
professional education requirements. The CMA exam covers
essential managerial accounting topics as well as topics on
economics and finance. Many accountants hold both CMA and
CPA certifications.

The IMA also develops standards and principles to help
management accountants deal with ethical challenges. Trust
is an important cornerstone of business interactions, both
internal and external. When there is a lack of trust, it changes
how decisions are made. Trust develops when there are
good ethics: when people know right from wrong. Consider
these three questions as put forth by the Institute of Business
Ethics: (1) Do I mind others knowing what I have done? (2)
Who does my decision affect or hurt? (3) Would my decision
be considered fair to those affected? These questions can help
evaluate the ethics of a decision.

   Ethics is more than simply obeying laws; it involves doing
the right thing as well as the legal thing. Many companies
have a code of conduct to help guide their employees. For
example, Google has a code of ethics that they expect all of
their employees and board members to follow. Failing to do so
can cause termination of employment. The preface of the code
includes "Don't be evil." They use that to show all employees
and other shareholders within Google that they are serious

88 | Ethical Standards
about ethics--that trust and respect are essential in providing
a great service to their customers.

   The IMA has its own Statement of Ethical Professional
Practice for its members. Managerial accountants should never
commit acts that violate the standards of ethics, and they
should never ignore such deeds by others within their
companies. Many other professional organizations, across
many different professions, have codes of ethics. For example,
there are codes of ethics for the AICPA, ACFE, Financial
Executives International, American Marketing Association,
National Society of Professional Engineers, and the American
Nurses Association.

   Often, when we think of unethical behavior, we imagine
large-scale scenarios involving tens of thousands of dollars or
more, but ethical issues are more likely faced on a small scale.
For example, suppose you work for an organization that makes
and sells virtual reality headsets. Because of competition, your
company has decreased their forecasted sales for next year
by 20 percent over the current year. In a meeting, the CEO
expressed concern over the effect of the decreased sales on the
bonuses of upper-level executives, since their bonus is tied to
meeting income projections. The vice president of marketing
suggested in the meeting that if the company simply
continued to produce the same number of headsets as they
had in the previous year, income levels may still be achieved
in order for the bonuses to be awarded. This would involve
the company producing excess inventory with hopes of selling
them, in order to achieve income levels sufficiently adequate
to be able to pay bonuses to executives. While a conflict of
interest might not be intuitively obvious, the company (and
thus its managerial accountants) has an obligation to many
stakeholders such as investors, creditors, employees and the
community. The obligation of a corporation to these
stakeholders depends somewhat on the stakeholder. For
example, the primary obligation to a creditor may be to make

                                                                        Ethical Standards | 89
timely payments, the obligation to the community may be to
minimize negative environmental impact. Most stakeholders
to not have access to internal information or decisions and thus
rely on management to be ethical in their decision-making.
The company may indeed be able to sell all that it produces,
but given the forecasted drop in sales, producing the same
number of units as during the current year will likely lead to
unsellable inventory, the need to sell the units at a significant
discount in order to dispose of them, or both. Following the
recommendation to produce more than forecasted sales
might hurt the value of the company's stock, which could hurt
many categories of stakeholders who depend on the
accountants and financial analysts to protect their financial
interests.

   In addition to managing production and inventory, a budget
and the entire budget process have an impact on managerial
decision-making. Suppose you are the manager of the
research department of a pharmaceutical company. Your
budget includes the costs for various types of training for your
staff. Because of the amount of time spent in development
of a highly promising medication to treat diabetes, your staff
has not had time to complete as much training during the
current year as you had allowed for in the budget. You are
concerned that if you do not use the training money, your
training budget will be decreased in the next budget cycle. To
prevent this from happening, you arrange for several online
training sessions for your staff. These training sessions are on
the basics of laboratory safety. All of your staff is very
experienced and current on this topic and can likely go straight
to the course completion quiz and complete it in a matter of
minutes without actually watching any of the ten modules.
What would encourage a manager to schedule and spend
money on training that is not useful for the employees? While
it is expected to stay within the budget, many managers will
spend any "excess" amounts remaining in the budget at the

90 | Ethical Standards
end of the fiscal year. This practice is known as "use it or lose it."
Managers do this to avoid having their budgets cut in the next
fiscal year. Stated simply, management spends everything in
their budget regardless of the value added or the necessity.
This is not ethical behavior and is usually the result of a
budgetary process that needs to be modified so that the
possibility of being able to pad the budget is removed or at
least minimized.

   All employees within a company are expected to act ethically
within their business actions. This can sometimes be difficult
when the company itself almost promotes the idea of
unethical actions. For example, Wells Fargo started offering
incentives to their employees who succeeded in selling to
current customers other services and products that the bank
had to offer. This incentive created an unethical culture.
Employees manufactured fake accounts, credit cards, and
other services in order to qualify for the bonuses. In the end,
5,300 employees lost their jobs, and everyone learned a lesson
on creating proper incentives. Executives who aspire to run
an ethical company can do so, if they change reward systems
from "pay for performance" to more holistic values. Examples of
proper incentives include attendance rewards, merit rewards,
team bonuses, overall profit sharing, and stock options.

Internal Auditors and Their Code of Ethics

Internal auditors are employees of an organization who
evaluate internal controls and other operational metrics, and
then ethically report their findings to management. An
internal auditor may be a Certified Internal Auditor (IIA
website), an accreditation granted by the Institute of Internal
Auditors (IIA). The IIA defines internal auditing as "an
independent, objective assurance and consulting activity
designed to add value and improve an organization's

                                                                         Ethical Standards | 91
operations. It helps an organization accomplish its objectives
by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and
improve the effectiveness of risk management, control, and
governance processes."2

   Internal auditors have their own organizational code
of ethics. According to the IIA, "the purpose of The Institute's
Code of Ethics is to promote an ethical culture in the profession
of internal auditing."3 Company management relies on a
disciplined and truthful approach to reporting. The internal
auditor is expected to keep confidential any received
information, while reporting results in an objective fashion.
Management trusts internal auditors to perform their work in
a competent manner and with integrity, so that the company
can make the best decisions moving forward.

Ethics Legislation

In response to several corporate scandals, the United States
Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX), also
known as the "public company accounting reform." It is a
federal law (http://www.soxlaw.com/) that was a far-reaching
reform of business practices. Its focus is primarily on public
accounting firms that act as auditors of publicly traded
corporations. The act intended to protect investors by
enhancing the accuracy and reliability of corporate financial
statements and disclosures. Thousands of corporations now
must confirm that their accounting processes comply with
SOX. The act itself is fairly detailed, but the most significant
issues for compliance are as follows:

   Section 302. The CEO and CFO must review all financial
      reports and sign the report.

   Section 404. All financial reports must be audited on an
      annual basis and must be accompanied by an internal

92 | Ethical Standards
      control audit.
   Section 806. Whistleblowers, or those who provide

      evidence of fraud, are afforded special protections.
   Section 906. The criminal penalties for a fraudulent

      financial report are increased from pre-SOX. Penalties can
      be up to $5 million in fines and up to 25 years in prison.

Individuals who work throughout the accounting profession
have a significant responsibility to the general public. Financial
accountants deliver information about companies that the
public uses to make major financial decisions. There must be
a level of trust and confidence in the ethical behavior of these
accountants. Just like others in the business world,
accountants are confronted endlessly with ethical dilemmas.
A high standard of ethical behavior is expected of those
employed in a profession. While ethical codes are helpful
guidelines, the rationale to act ethically must originate from
within oneself, from personal morals and values. There are
steps that can provide an outline for examining ethical issues:

 1. Recognize the ethical issue at hand and those involved
      (employees, creditors, vendors, and community).

2. Establish the facts of the situation (who, what, where,
      when, and how).

 3. Recognize the competing values related to the issue
      (confidentiality and conflict of interest).

4. Determine alternative courses of action (do not limit
      yourself).

 5. Evaluate each course of action and how each relates to the
      values in step 3.

6. Recognize the possible consequences of each course of
      action and how each affects those involved in step 1.

 7. Make a decision, and take a course of action.
8. Evaluate the decision. (Is the issue solved? Did it create

      other issues?)

                                                                        Ethical Standards | 93
One of the issues with ethics is that what one person,
community, or even country considers unethical or wrong may
not be problematic for another person, community, or country,
who see it as a way of doing business. For example, bribery in
the world of business happens when an organization or
representative of an organization gives money or other
financial benefits to another individual, business, or official in
order to gain favor or to manipulate a business decision.
Bribery in the United States is illegal. However, in Russia or
China, a bribe is sometimes one cost of doing business, so it is
part of their culture and completely ordinary.

   The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) was implemented
in 1977 in the aftermath of disclosures of bribery of foreign
bureaucrats by more than 400 US corporations. The law is
broken down into two parts: the antibribery section and the
accounting section. The antibribery section specifically
prohibits payments to foreign government officials to aid in
attaining or retaining business. This provision applies to all US
persons and foreign firms acting within the United States. It
also requires corporations that are listed in the United States
to converge their accounting records with certain accounting
provisions. These include making and keeping records that
fairly represent the transactions of the company and
maintaining an acceptable system of internal controls.
Companies doing business outside the United States are
obligated to follow this law and dedicate resources to its
compliance.

94 | Ethical Standards
Pixabay Pixabay license

The accounting section of the FCPA requires a company to
have good internal controls so a slush fund to pay bribes
cannot be created and maintained. A slush fund is a cash
account that is often created for illegal activities or payments
that are not typically recorded on the books.

   More details on the SOX and the FCPA are covered in such
courses as auditing, intermediate accounting, cost accounting,
and business law.

YOUR TURN

Logistics Analyst

As a corporate accountant, it is very important to understand
both financial and managerial aspects of the company and
industry in which you are working. In order to assist
management in their roles of planning, controlling, and

                                                                        Ethical Standards | 95
evaluating, an accountant needs to be aware not only of GAAP
but also of the products or services offered by the company, the
processes by which those products or services are produced,
and pertinent facts about suppliers, customers, and
competitors. Not having this knowledge not only makes it
more difficult for the corporate or managerial accountant to
perform any assigned duties, but there is also an ethical
responsibility to be knowledgeable in order to offer assistance,
analysis, or recommendations to management or customers.

   Assume you have been hired by Triumph Motorcycles as a
new logistics analyst. In this position, you will carry out such
tasks as obtaining and analyzing information about your
company's goods or services; monitoring the production,
service, and information processes and flow; and looking for
ways to improve efficiency of operations.

   How would you go about obtaining the knowledge and
understanding you will need to work for this company? How
would financial and managerial accounting concepts help you
in understanding the company and the industry as a whole?

   Solution
   Answers will vary. Sample answer:
   Ways to learn about the company and industry include the
company website, press or news releases, industry trade
journals, company internal documents such as procedure
manuals and job descriptions, and conversations or interviews
with fellow employees at various levels of the organization. The
more knowledge you have regarding financial and managerial
accounting, the better you can link the operations of the
organizations to financial results and the more easily you can
ascertain both efficiencies and inefficiencies in the
organization.

1.1 Defining the
Accounting Equation
Components

The Basic Accounting Equation

The basic accounting equation represents the idea that a
company needs assets to operate, and there are two major
sources that contribute to operations: liabilities and equity. The
company borrows the funds, creating liabilities, or the
company can take the funds provided by the profits generated
in the current or past periods, creating retained earnings or
some other form of stockholder's equity. The accounting
equation can also be thought of from a "sources and claims"
perspective; that is, the assets (items owned by the
organization) were obtained by incurring liabilities or were
provided by owners. Stated differently, everything a company
owns must equal everything the company owes to creditors
(lenders) and owners (individuals for sole proprietors or
stockholders for companies or corporations).

   Assume a family purchases a home valued at $200,000. They
make a down payment of $25,000 while financing the
remaining balance with a $175,000 bank loan. This example
demonstrates one of the most important concepts in the study
of accounting: the accounting equation, which is:

102 | 1.1 Defining the Accounting Equation Components
In our example, the accounting equation would look like this:

As you continue your accounting studies and you consider the
different major types of business entities available (sole
proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations), there is
another important concept for you to remember. This concept
is that no matter which of the entity options that you choose,
the accounting process for all of them will be predicated on the
accounting equation.

YOUR TURN

The Accounting Equation

On a sheet of paper, use three columns to create your own
accounting equation. In the first column, list all of the things
you own (assets). In the second column, list any amounts owed
(liabilities). In the third column, using the accounting equation,
calculate, you guessed it, the net amount of the asset (equity).
When finished, total the columns to determine your net worth.

                     1.1 Defining the Accounting Equation Components | 103
Hint: do not forget to subtract the liability from the value of the
asset.

   Here is something else to consider: is it possible to have
negative equity? It sure is . . . ask any college student who
has taken out loans. At first glance there is no asset directly
associated with the amount of the loan. But is that, in fact,
the case? You might ask yourself why make an investment in
a college education--what is the benefit (asset) to going to
college? The answer lies in the difference in lifetime earnings
with a college degree versus without a college degree. This is
influenced by many things, including the supply and demand
of jobs and employees. It is also influenced by the earnings
for the type of college degree pursued. (Where do you think
accounting ranks?)

   Solution
   Answers will vary but may include vehicles, clothing,
electronics (include cell phones and computer/gaming
systems, and sports equipment). They may also include money
owed on these assets, most likely vehicles and perhaps cell
phones. In the case of a student loan, there may be a liability
with no corresponding asset (yet). Responses should be able
to evaluate the benefit of investing in college is the wage
differential between earnings with and without a college
degree.

Expanding the Accounting Equation

Let's continue our exploration of the accounting equation,
focusing on the equity component, in particular. Recall that we
defined equity as the net worth of an organization. It is helpful
to also think of net worth as the value of the organization.
Recall, too, that revenues (inflows as a result of providing goods
and services) increase the value of the organization. So, every

104 | 1.1 Defining the Accounting Equation Components
dollar of revenue an organization generates increases the
overall value of the organization.

   Likewise, expenses (outflows as a result of generating
revenue) decrease the value of the organization. So, each dollar
of expenses an organization incurs decreases the overall value
of the organization. The same approach can be taken with the
other elements of the financial statements:

   Gains increase the value (equity) of the organization.
   Losses decrease the value (equity) of the organization.
   Investments by owners increase the value (equity) of the

      organization.
   Distributions to owners decrease the value (equity) of the

      organization.
   Changes in assets and liabilities can either increase or

      decrease the value (equity) of the organization depending
      on the net result of the transaction.

A graphical representation of this concept is shown in Figure
2.1.

Long Description

The expanded accounting equation breaks down Equity into
four categories: common stock, dividends, revenues, and
expenses. This considers each element of contributed capital

                     1.1 Defining the Accounting Equation Components | 105
and retained earnings individually to better illustrate each
one's impact on changes in equity.

   This expansion of the equity section allows a company to see
the impact to equity from changes to revenues and expenses,
and to owner investments and payouts. It is important to have
more detail in this equity category to understand the effect
on financial statements from period to period. For example, an
increase to revenue can increase net income on the income
statement, increase retained earnings on the statement of
retained earnings, and change the distribution of stockholder's
equity on the balance sheet. This may be difficult to
understand where these changes have occurred without
revenue recognized individually in this expanded equation.

   A business can now use this equation to analyze transactions
in more detail. But first, it may help to examine the many
accounts that can fall under each of the main categories of
Assets, Liabilities, and Equity, in terms of their relationship to
the expanded accounting equation. We begin with the left side
of the equation, the assets, and work toward the right side of
the equation to liabilities and equity.

Long Description

106 | 1.1 Defining the Accounting Equation Components
Assets

On the left side of the equation are assets. Assets are resources
a company owns that have an economic value. Assets are
represented on the balance sheet financial statement. Some
common examples of assets are cash, accounts receivable,
inventory, supplies, prepaid expenses, notes receivable,
equipment, buildings, machinery, and land.

   Cash includes paper currency as well as coins, checks, bank
accounts, and money orders. Anything that can be quickly
liquidated into cash is considered cash. Cash activities are a
large part of any business, and the flow of cash in and out of the
company is reported on the statement of cash flows.

   Accounts receivable is money that is owed to the company,
usually from a customer. The customer has not yet paid with
cash for the provided good or service but will do so in the
future. Common phrasing to describe this situation is that a
customer purchased something "on account," meaning that
the customer has asked to be billed and will pay at a later date:
"Account" because a customer has not paid us yet but instead
has asked to be billed; "Receivable" because we will receive the
money in the future.

   Inventory refers to the goods available for sale. Service
companies do not have goods for sale and would thus not
have inventory. Merchandising and manufacturing businesses
do have inventory. Examples of supplies (office supplies)
include pens, paper, and pencils. Supplies are considered
assets until an employee uses them. At the point they are used,
they no longer have an economic value to the organization,
and their cost is now an expense to the business.

   Prepaid expenses are items paid for in advance of their use.
They are considered assets until used. Some examples can
include insurance and rent. Insurance, for example, is usually
purchased for more than one month at a time (six months
typically). The company does not use all six months of the

                     1.1 Defining the Accounting Equation Components | 107
insurance at once, it uses it one month at a time. However, the
company prepays for all of it up front. As each month passes,
the company will adjust its records to reflect the cost of one
month of insurance usage.

   Notes receivable is similar to accounts receivable in that it is
money owed to the company by a customer or other entity.
The difference here is that a note typically includes interest and
specific contract terms, and the amount may be due in more
than one accounting period.

   Equipment examples include desks, chairs, and computers;
anything that has a long-term value to the company that is
used in the office. Equipment is considered a long-term asset,
meaning you can use it for more than one accounting period
(a year for example). Buildings, machinery, and land are all
considered long-term assets. Machinery is usually specific to a
manufacturing company that has a factory producing goods.
Machinery and buildings also depreciate. Unlike other long-
term assets such as machinery, buildings, and equipment, land
is not depreciated. The process to calculate the loss on land
value could be very cumbersome, speculative, and unreliable;
therefore, the treatment in accounting is for land to not be
depreciated over time.

Liabilities

The accounting equation emphasizes a basic idea in business;
that is, businesses need assets in order to operate. There are
two ways a business can finance the purchase of assets. First,
it can sell shares of its stock to the public to raise money to
purchase the assets, or it can use profits earned by the business
to finance its activities. Second, it can borrow the money from a
lender such as a financial institution. You will learn about other
assets as you progress through the book. Let's now take a look
at the right side of the accounting equation.

108 | 1.1 Defining the Accounting Equation Components
   Liabilities are obligations to pay an amount owed to a lender
(creditor) based on a past transaction. Liabilities are reported
on the balance sheet. It is important to understand that when
we talk about liabilities, we are not just talking about loans.
Money collected for gift cards, subscriptions, or as advance
deposits from customers could also be liabilities. Essentially,
anything a company owes and has yet to pay within a period is
considered a liability, such as salaries, utilities, and taxes.

   For example, a company uses $400 worth of utilities in May
but is not billed for the usage, or asked to pay for the usage,
until June. Even though the company does not have to pay
the bill until June, the company owed money for the usage
that occurred in May. Therefore, the company must record the
usage of electricity, as well as the liability to pay the utility bill,
in May.

   Eventually that debt must be repaid by performing the
service, fulfilling the subscription, or providing an asset such
as merchandise or cash. Some common examples of liabilities
include accounts payable, notes payable, and unearned
revenue.

   Accounts payable recognizes that the company owes money
and has not paid. Remember, when a customer purchases
something "on account" it means the customer has asked to
be billed and will pay at a later date. In this case the purchasing
company is the "customer." The company will have to pay the
money due in the future, so we use the word "payable." The
debt owed is usually paid off in less than one accounting period
(less than a year typically) if it is classified as an account
payable.

   A notes payable is similar to accounts payable in that the
company owes money and has not yet paid. Some key
differences are that the contract terms are usually longer than
one accounting period, interest is included, and there is
typically a more formalized contract that dictates the terms of
the transaction.

                     1.1 Defining the Accounting Equation Components | 109
   Unearned revenue represents a customer's advanced
payment for a product or service that has yet to be provided
by the company. Since the company has not yet provided the
product or service, it cannot recognize the customer's payment
as revenue, according to the revenue recognition principle.
Thus, the account is called unearned revenue. The company
owing the product or service creates the liability to the
customer.

Equity

Stockholder's equity refers to the owner's (stockholders')
investments in the business and earnings. These two
components are contributed capital and retained earnings.

   The owner's investments in the business typically come in
the form of common stock and are called contributed capital.
There is a hybrid owner's investment labeled as preferred stock
that is a combination of debt and equity (a concept covered
in more advanced accounting courses). The company will issue
shares of common stock to represent stockholder ownership.

   Another component of stockholder's equity is company
earnings. These retained earnings are what the company holds
onto at the end of a period to reinvest in the business, after
any distributions to ownership occur. Stated more technically,
retained earnings are a company's cumulative earnings since
the creation of the company minus any dividends that it has
declared or paid since its creation. One tricky point to
remember is that retained earnings are not classified as assets.
Instead, they are a component of the stockholder's equity
account, placing it on the right side of the accounting
equation.

   Distribution of earnings to ownership is called a dividend. The
dividend could be paid with cash or be a distribution of more

110 | 1.1 Defining the Accounting Equation Components
company stock to current shareholders. Either way, dividends
will decrease retained earnings.

   Also affecting retained earnings are revenues and expenses,
by way of net income or net loss. Revenues are earnings from
the sale of goods and services. An increase in revenues will also
contribute toward an increase in retained earnings. Expenses
are the cost of resources associated with earning revenues.
An increase to expenses will contribute toward a decrease in
retained earnings. Recall that this concept of recognizing
expenses associated with revenues is the expense recognition
principle. Some examples of expenses include bill payments
for utilities, employee salaries, and loan interest expense. A
business does not have an expense until it is "incurred."
Incurred means the resource is used or consumed. For
example, you will not recognize utilities as an expense until
you have used the utilities. The difference between revenues
earned and expenses incurred is called net income (loss) and
can be found on the income statement.

   Net income reported on the income statement flows into the
statement of retained earnings. If a business has net income
(earnings) for the period, then this will increase its retained
earnings for the period. This means that revenues exceeded
expenses for the period, thus increasing retained earnings. If
a business has net loss for the period, this decreases retained
earnings for the period. This means that the expenses
exceeded the revenues for the period, thus decreasing retained
earnings.

   You will notice that stockholder's equity increases with
common stock issuance and revenues, and decreases from
dividend payouts and expenses. Stockholder's equity is
reported on the balance sheet in the form of contributed
capital (common stock) and retained earnings. The statement
of retained earnings computes the retained earnings balance
at the beginning of the period, adds net income or subtracts
net loss from the income statement, and subtracts dividends

                      1.1 Defining the Accounting Equation Components | 111
declared, to result in an ending retained earnings balance
reported on the balance sheet.

Not All Transactions Affect Equity

As you continue to develop your understanding of accounting,
you will encounter many types of transactions involving
different elements of the financial statements. The previous
examples highlighted elements that change the equity of an
organization. Not all transactions, however, ultimately impact
equity. For example, the following do not impact the equity or
net worth of the organization:

   Exchanges of assets for assets
   Exchanges of liabilities for liabilities
   Acquisitions of assets by incurring liabilities
   Settlements of liabilities by transferring assets

                    An interactive H5P element has been excluded
                    from this version of the text. You can view it online
        here:
        https://psu.pb.unizin.org/acctg211/?p=57#h5p-2

Equity and Legal Structure

Recall that equity can also be referred to as net worth--the
value of the organization. The concept of equity does not
change depending on the legal structure of the business (sole
proprietorship, partnership, and corporation). The terminology

112 | 1.1 Defining the Accounting Equation Components
does, however, change slightly based on the type of entity.
For example, investments by owners are considered "capital"
transactions for sole proprietorships and partnerships but are
considered "common stock" transactions for corporations.
Likewise, distributions to owners are considered "drawing"
transactions for sole proprietorships and partnerships but are
considered "dividend" transactions for corporations.

   As another example, in sole proprietorships and partnerships,
the final amount of net income or net loss for the business
becomes "Owner(s), Capital." In a corporation, net income or
net loss for the business becomes retained earnings, which is
the cumulative, undistributed net income or net loss, less
dividends paid for the business since its inception.

   The essence of these transactions remains the same:
organizations become more valuable when owners make
investments in the business and the businesses earn a profit
(net income), and organizations become less valuable when
owners receive distributions (dividends) from the organization
and the businesses incur a loss (net loss). Because accountants
are providing information to stakeholders, it is important for
accountants to fully understand the specific terminology
associated with the various legal structures of organizations.

   The following screencast provides an overview of the
expanded accounting equation in a slightly rearranged format:

                    One or more interactive elements has been

equity, you will be able to analyze the many transactions a
business may encounter and determine how each transaction

statements.

1.2 Transaction
Analysis- accounting
equation format

Now that you've gained a basic understanding of both the
basic and expanded accounting equations, let's consider some
of the transactions a business may encounter. We'll review how
each transaction affects the basic accounting equation.

Reviewing and Analyzing
Transactions

Let us assume our business is a service-based company. We
use Lynn Sanders' small printing company, Printing Plus, as our
example. Please notice that since Printing Plus is a corporation,
we are using the Common Stock account, instead of Owner's
Equity. The following are several transactions from this
business's current month:

 1. Issues $20,000 shares of common stock for cash.
2. Purchases equipment on account for $3,500, payment due

      within the month.
 3. Receives $4,000 cash in advance from a customer for

      services not yet rendered.
4. Provides $5,500 in services to a customer who asks to be

      billed for the services.
 5. Pays a $300 utility bill with cash.
6. Distributed $100 cash in dividends to stockholders.

116 | 1.2 Transaction Analysis- accounting equation format
We now analyze each of these transactions, paying attention to
how they impact the accounting equation and corresponding
financial statements.

   Transaction 1: Issues $20,000 shares of common stock for
cash.

   Analysis: Looking at the accounting equation, we know cash
is an asset and common stock is stockholder's equity. When a
company collects cash, this will increase assets because cash
is coming into the business. When a company issues common
stock, this will increase a stockholder's equity because he or
she is receiving investments from owners.

   Remember that the accounting equation must remain
balanced, and assets need to equal liabilities plus equity. On
the asset side of the equation, we show an increase of $20,000.
On the liabilities and equity side of the equation, there is also
an increase of $20,000, keeping the equation balanced.
Changes to assets, specifically cash, will increase assets on the
balance sheet and increase cash on the statement of cash
flows. Changes to stockholder's equity, specifically common
stock, will increase stockholder's equity on the balance sheet.

   Transaction 2: Purchases equipment on account for $3,500,
payment due within the month.

   Analysis: We know that the company purchased equipment,
which is an asset. We also know that the company purchased
the equipment on account, meaning it did not pay for the
equipment immediately and asked for payment to be billed
instead and paid later. Since the company owes money and has
not yet paid, this is a liability, specifically labeled as accounts

                   1.2 Transaction Analysis- accounting equation format | 117
payable. There is an increase to assets because the company
has equipment it did not have before. There is also an increase
to liabilities because the company now owes money. The more
money the company owes, the more that liability will increase.

   The accounting equation remains balanced because there is
a $3,500 increase on the asset side, and a $3,500 increase on
the liability and equity side. This change to assets will increase
assets on the balance sheet. The change to liabilities will
increase liabilities on the balance sheet.

   Transaction 3: Receives $4,000 cash in advance from a
customer for services not yet rendered.

   Analysis: We know that the company collected cash, which
is an asset. This collection of $4,000 increases assets because
money is coming into the business.

   The company has yet to provide the service. According to the
revenue recognition principle, the company cannot recognize
that revenue until it provides the service. Therefore, the
company has a liability to the customer to provide the service
and must record the liability as unearned revenue. The liability
of $4,000 worth of services increases because the company has
more unearned revenue than previously.

   The equation remains balanced, as assets and liabilities
increase. The balance sheet would experience an increase in
assets and an increase in liabilities.

   Transaction 4: Provides $5,500 in services to a customer who
asks to be billed for the services.

   Analysis: The customer asked to be billed for the service,
meaning the customer did not pay with cash immediately.

118 | 1.2 Transaction Analysis- accounting equation format
The customer owes money and has not yet paid, signaling
an accounts receivable. Accounts receivable is an asset that is
increasing in this case. This customer obligation of $5,500 adds
to the balance in accounts receivable.

   The company did provide the services. As a result, the
revenue recognition principle requires recognition as revenue,
which increases equity for $5,500. The increase to assets would
be reflected on the balance sheet. The increase to equity would
affect three statements. The income statement would see an
increase to revenues, changing net income (loss). Net income
(loss) is computed into retained earnings on the statement of
retained earnings. This change to retained earnings is shown
on the balance sheet under stockholder's equity.

   Transaction 5: Pays a $300 utility bill with cash.

   Analysis: The company paid with cash, an asset. Assets are
decreasing by $300 since cash was used to pay for this utility
bill. The company no longer has that money.

   Utility payments are generated from bills for services that
were used and paid for within the accounting period, thus
recognized as an expense. The expense decreases equity by
$300. The decrease to assets, specifically cash, affects the
balance sheet and statement of cash flows. The decrease to
equity as a result of the expense affects three statements. The
income statement would see a change to expenses, changing
net income (loss). Net income (loss) is computed into retained
earnings on the statement of retained earnings. This change
to retained earnings is shown on the balance sheet under
stockholder's equity.

1.3 Current &
Noncurrent Assets &
Liabilities

In accounting, we classify assets based on whether or not the
asset will be used or consumed within a certain period of time,
generally one year. If the asset will be used or consumed in one
year or less, we classify the asset as a current asset. If the asset
will be used or consumed over more than one year, we classify
the asset as a noncurrent asset.

   Another thing you might have recognized when reviewing
assets is that not all of the items were something you could
touch or move. Those you can touch are known as tangible
assets. Not all assets are tangible. An asset could be an
intangible asset, meaning the item lacks physical
substance--it cannot be touched or moved. Take a moment
to think about your favorite type of shoe or a popular type of
farm tractor. Would you be able to recognize the maker of that
shoe or the tractor by simply seeing the logo? Chances are
you would. These are examples of intangible assets, trademarks
to be precise. A trademark has value to the organization that
created (or purchased) the trademark, and the trademark is
something the organization controls--others cannot use the
trademark without permission.

   Similar to the accounting for assets, liabilities are classified
based on the time frame in which the liabilities are expected
to be settled. A liability that will be settled in one year or less
(generally) is classified as a current liability, while a liability that
is expected to be settled in more than one year is classified as
a noncurrent liability.

   Examples of current assets include accounts receivable,

                                1.3 Current & Noncurrent Assets & Liabilities | 123
which is the outstanding customer debt on a credit
sale; inventory, which is the value of products to be sold or
items to be converted into sellable products; and sometimes
a notes receivable, which is the value of amounts loaned that
will be received in the future with interest, assuming that it will
be paid within a year.

   Examples of current liabilities include accounts payable,
which is the value of goods or services purchased that will be
paid for at a later date, and notes payable, which is the value of
amounts borrowed (usually not inventory purchases) that will
be paid in the future with interest.

   Examples of noncurrent assets include notes receivable
(notice notes receivable can be either current or noncurrent),
land, buildings, equipment, and vehicles. An example of a
noncurrent liability is notes payable (notice notes payable can
be either current or noncurrent).

Why Does Current versus Noncurrent
Matter?

At this point, let's take a break and explore why the distinction
between current and noncurrent assets and liabilities matters.
It is a good question because, on the surface, it does not seem
to be important to make such a distinction. After all, assets are
things owned or controlled by the organization, and liabilities
are amounts owed by the organization; listing those amounts
in the financial statements provides valuable information to
stakeholders. But we have to dig a little deeper and remind
ourselves that stakeholders are using this information to make
decisions. Providing the amounts of the assets and liabilities
answers the "what" question for stakeholders (that is, it tells
stakeholders the value of assets), but it does not answer the
"when" question for stakeholders. For example, knowing that

124 | 1.3 Current & Noncurrent Assets & Liabilities
an organization has $1,000,000 worth of assets is valuable
information, but knowing that $250,000 of those assets are
current and will be used or consumed within one year is more
valuable to stakeholders. Likewise, it is helpful to know the
company owes $750,000 worth of liabilities, but knowing that
$125,000 of those liabilities will be paid within one year is even
more valuable. In short, the timing of events is of particular
interest to stakeholders.

and Credit (CR)

Each account can be represented visually by splitting the
account into left and right sides as shown. This graphic
representation of a general ledger account is known as a T-
account. A T-account is called a "T-account" because it looks
like a "T," as you can see with the T-account shown here.

Openstax CC BY NC-SA Long Description

A debit records financial information on the left side of each
account. A credit records financial information on the right
side of an account. One side of each account will increase and
the other side will decrease. The ending account balance is
found by calculating the difference between debits and credits
for each account. You will often see the
terms debit and credit represented in shorthand, written
as DR or dr and CR or cr, respectively. Depending on the
account type, the sides that increase and decrease may vary.

As we can see from this expanded accounting equation, Assets
accounts increase on the debit side and decrease on the credit
side. This is also true of Dividends and Expenses accounts.
Liabilities increase on the credit side and decrease on the debit
side. This is also true of Common Stock and Revenues accounts.
This becomes easier to understand as you become familiar
with the normal balance of an account.

                                         1.4 Rules of Debit (DR) and Credit (CR) | 127
Normal Balance of an Account

The normal balance is the expected balance each account type
maintains, which is the side that increases. As assets and
expenses increase on the debit side, their normal balance is
a debit. Dividends paid to shareholders also have a normal
balance that is a debit entry. Since liabilities, equity (such as
common stock), and revenues increase with a credit, their
"normal" balance is a credit. Table 1.1 shows the normal
balances and increases for each account type.

Table 1.1 Account Normal Balances and Increases

Asset      Debit     Debit

Liability  Credit    Credit

Common Stock Credit  Credit

Dividends  Debit     Debit

Revenue    Credit    Credit

Expense    Debit     Debit

When an account produces a balance that is contrary to what
the expected normal balance of that account is, this account
has an abnormal balance. Let's consider the following example
to better understand abnormal balances.

   Let's say there were a credit of $4,000 and a debit of $6,000
in the Accounts Payable account. Since Accounts Payable
increases on the credit side, one would expect a normal
balance on the credit side. However, the difference between
the two figures in this case would be a debit balance of $2,000,
which is an abnormal balance. This situation could possibly
occur with an overpayment to a supplier or an error in
recording.

1.5 Transaction
Analysis- from
accounting equation
to journal entries

Analyzing and recording transactions represent the first steps
in one continuous process known as the accounting cycle.
The accounting cycle is a step-by-step process to record
business activities and events to keep financial records up to
date. The process occurs over one accounting period and will
begin the cycle again in the following period. A period is one
operating cycle of a business, which could be a month, quarter,
or year. Review the accounting cycle in Figure 2.4.

As you can see, the cycle begins with identifying and analyzing
transactions. The entire cycle is meant to keep financial data
organized and easily accessible to both internal and external
users of information.

These first four steps set the foundation for the recording
process.

   Step 1. Identifying and analyzing transactions is the first step
in the process. This takes information from original sources or
activities and translates that information into usable financial
data. An original source is a traceable record of information
that contributes to the creation of a business transaction. For
example, a sales invoice is considered an original source.
Activities would include paying an employee, selling products,
providing a service, collecting cash, borrowing money, and
issuing stock to company owners. Once the original source has
been identified, the company will analyze the information to
see how it influences financial records.

   Let's say that Mark Summers of Supreme Cleaners provides
cleaning services to a customer. He generates an invoice for
$200, the amount the customer owes, so he can be paid for
the service. This sales receipt contains information such as how
much the customer owes, payment terms, and dates. This sales
receipt is an original source containing financial information
that creates a business transaction for the company.

Double-Entry Bookkeeping

The basic components of even the simplest accounting system
are accounts and a general ledger. An account is a record
showing increases and decreases to assets, liabilities, and
equity--the basic components found in the accounting
equation. Each of these categories, in turn, includes many
individual accounts, all of which a company maintains in its
general ledger. A general ledger is a comprehensive listing of
all of a company's accounts with their individual balances.

   Accounting is based on what we call a double-entry
accounting system, which requires the following:

   Each time we record a transaction, we must record a
      change in at least two different accounts. Having two or
      more accounts change will allow us to keep the
      accounting equation in balance.

   Not only will at least two accounts change, but there must
      also be at least one debit and one credit side impacted.

   The sum of the debits must equal the sum of the credits
      for each transaction.

Journals

Accountants use special forms called journals to keep track of
their business transactions. A journal is the first place
information is entered into the accounting system. A journal
is often referred to as the book of original entry because it is
the place the information originally enters into the system. A
journal keeps a historical account of all recordable transactions
with which the company has engaged. In other words, a
journal is similar to a diary for a business. When you enter
information into a journal, we say you are journalizing the entry.

132 | 1.5 Transaction Analysis- from accounting equation to journal
entries
Journaling the entry is the second step in the accounting cycle.
Here is a picture of a journal.

   You can see that a journal has columns labeled debit and
credit. The debit is on the left side, and the credit is on the right.
Let's look at how we use a journal.

   When filling in a journal, there are some rules you need to
follow to improve journal entry organization.

Formatting When Recording Journal
Entries

   Include a date of when the transaction occurred.
   The debit account title(s) always come first and on the left.
   The credit account title(s) always come after all debit titles

      are entered, and on the right.
   The titles of the credit accounts will be indented below the

      debit accounts.
   You will have at least one debit (possibly more).
   You will always have at least one credit (possibly more).
   The dollar value of the debits must equal the dollar value

      of the credits or else the equation will go out of balance.
   You will write a short description after each journal entry.
   Skip a space after the description before starting the next

      journal entry.

An example journal entry format is as follows. It is not taken
from previous examples but is intended to stand alone.

   Note that this example has only one debit account and one
credit account, which is considered a simple entry.
A compound entry is when there is more than one account
listed under the debit and/or credit column of a journal entry
(as seen in the following).

   Notice that for this entry, the rules for recording journal
entries have been followed. There is a date of April 1, 2018, the
debit account titles are listed first with Cash and Supplies, the
credit account title of Common Stock is indented after the
debit account titles, there are at least one debit and one credit,
the debit amounts equal the credit amount, and there is a
short description of the transaction.

1.6 Unadjusted Trial
Balance

Once all the monthly transactions have been analyzed,
journalized, and posted on a continuous day-to-day basis over
the accounting period (a month in our example), we are ready
to start working on preparing a trial balance (unadjusted).
Preparing an unadjusted trial balance is the fourth step in the
accounting cycle. A trial balance is a list of all accounts in the
general ledger that have nonzero balances. A trial balance is
an important step in the accounting process, because it helps
identify any computational errors throughout the first three
steps in the cycle.

   When constructing a trial balance, we must consider a few
formatting rules, akin to those requirements for financial
statements:

   The header must contain the name of the company, the
      label of a Trial Balance (Unadjusted), and the date.

   Accounts are listed in the accounting equation order with
      assets listed first followed by liabilities and finally equity.

   Amounts at the top of each debit and credit column
      should have a dollar sign.

   When amounts are added, the final figure in each column
      should be underscored.

   The totals at the end of the trial balance need to have
      dollar signs and be double-underscored.

Transferring information from T-accounts to the trial balance
requires consideration of the final balance in each account. If
the final balance in the ledger account (T-account) is a debit
balance, you will record the total in the left column of the trial

                                                        1.6 Unadjusted Trial Balance | 137
balance. If the final balance in the ledger account (T-account) is
a credit balance, you will record the total in the right column.

   Once all ledger accounts and their balances are recorded, the
debit and credit columns on the trial balance are totaled to
see if the figures in each column match each other. The final
total in the debit column must be the same dollar amount that
is determined in the final credit column. For example, if you
determine that the final debit balance is $24,000 then the final
credit balance in the trial balance must also be $24,000. If the
two balances are not equal, there is a mistake in at least one of
the columns.

Let's now take a look at the T-accounts and unadjusted trial
balance for Printing Plus to see how the information is
transferred from the T-accounts to the unadjusted trial
balance.

   For example, Cash has a final balance of $24,800 on the debit
side. This balance is transferred to the Cash account in the
debit column on the unadjusted trial balance. Accounts

                                                        1.6 Unadjusted Trial Balance | 139
Receivable ($1,200), Supplies ($500), Equipment ($3,500),
Dividends ($100), Salaries Expense ($3,600), and Utility Expense
($300) also have debit final balances in their T-accounts, so
this information will be transferred to the debit column on the
unadjusted trial balance. Accounts Payable ($500), Unearned
Revenue ($4,000), Common Stock ($20,000) and Service
Revenue ($9,500) all have credit final balances in their T-
accounts. These credit balances would transfer to the credit
column on the unadjusted trial balance.

   Once all balances are transferred to the unadjusted trial
balance, we will sum each of the debit and credit columns. The
debit and credit columns both total $34,000, which means they
are equal and in balance. However, just because the column
totals are equal and in balance, we are still not guaranteed that
a mistake is not present.

1.7 Accounting
Principles, Concepts
and Assumptions

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (F.A.S.B.) is an
independent, nonprofit organization that sets the standards
for financial accounting and reporting, including generally
accepted accounting principles (G.A.A.P.), for both public- and
private-sector businesses in the United States.

   GAAP are the concepts, standards, and rules that guide the
preparation and presentation of financial statements. If US
accounting rules are followed, the accounting rules are called
US GAAP. International accounting rules are
called International Financial Reporting Standards (I.F.R.S.).
Publicly traded companies (those that offer their shares for sale
on exchanges in the United States) have the reporting of their
financial operations regulated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (S.E.C.).

   The SEC is an independent federal agency that is charged
with protecting the interests of investors, regulating stock
markets, and ensuring companies adhere to GAAP
requirements. By having proper accounting standards such as
US GAAP or IFRS, information presented publicly is considered
comparable and reliable. As a result, financial statement users
are more informed when making decisions. The SEC not only
enforces the accounting rules but also delegates the process of
setting standards for US GAAP to the FASB.

   Some companies that operate on a global scale may be able
to report their financial statements using IFRS. The SEC
regulates the financial reporting of companies selling their
shares in the United States, whether US GAAP or IFRS are used.

                 1.7 Accounting Principles, Concepts and Assumptions | 143
The basics of accounting discussed in this chapter are the
same under either set of guidelines.

The Conceptual Framework

The FASB uses a conceptual framework, which is a set of
concepts that guide financial reporting. These concepts can
help ensure information is comparable and reliable to
stakeholders. Guidance may be given on how to report
transactions, measurement requirements, and application on
financial statements, among other things.1

   The conceptual framework sets the basis for accounting
standards set by rule-making bodies that govern how the
financial statements are prepared. Here are a few of the
principles, assumptions, and concepts that provide guidance in
developing GAAP.

Revenue Recognition Principle

The revenue recognition principle directs a company to
recognize revenue in the period in which it is earned; revenue
is not considered earned until a product or service has been
provided. This means the period of time in which you
performed the service or gave the customer the product is the
period in which revenue is recognized.

   There also does not have to be a correlation between when
cash is collected and when revenue is recognized. A customer
may not pay for the service on the day it was provided. Even
though the customer has not yet paid cash, there is a
reasonable expectation that the customer will pay in the
future. Since the company has provided the service, it would

144 | 1.7 Accounting Principles, Concepts and Assumptions
recognize the revenue as earned, even though cash has yet to
be collected.

   For example, Lynn Sanders owns a small printing company,
Printing Plus. She completed a print job for a customer on
August 10. The customer did not pay cash for the service at
that time and was billed for the service, paying at a later date.
When should Lynn recognize the revenue, on August 10 or at
the later payment date? Lynn should record revenue as earned
on August 10. She provided the service to the customer, and
there is a reasonable expectation that the customer will pay at
the later date.

Expense Recognition (Matching) Principle

The expense recognition principle (also referred to as
the matching principle) states that we must match expenses
with associated revenues in the period in which the revenues
were earned. A mismatch in expenses and revenues could be
an understated net income in one period with an overstated
net income in another period. There would be no reliability
in statements if expenses were recorded separately from the
revenues generated.

   For example, if Lynn earned printing revenue in April, then
any associated expenses to the revenue generation (such as
paying an employee) should be recorded on the same income
statement. The employee worked for Lynn in April, helping her
earn revenue in April, so Lynn must match the expense with
the revenue by showing both on the April income statement.

Cost Principle

The cost principle, also known as the historical cost principle,

                 1.7 Accounting Principles, Concepts and Assumptions | 145
states that virtually everything the company owns or controls
(assets) must be recorded at its value at the date of acquisition.
For most assets, this value is easy to determine as it is the price
agreed to when buying the asset from the vendor. There are
some exceptions to this rule, but always apply the cost principle
unless FASB has specifically stated that a different valuation
method should be used in a given circumstance.

   The primary exceptions to this historical cost treatment, at
this time, are financial instruments, such as stocks and bonds,
which might be recorded at their fair market value. This is
called mark-to-market accounting or fair value accounting and
is more advanced than the general basic concepts underlying
the introduction to basic accounting concepts; therefore, it is
addressed in more advanced accounting courses.

   Once an asset is recorded on the books, the value of that
asset must remain at its historical cost, even if its value in the
market changes. For example, Lynn Sanders purchases a piece
of equipment for $40,000. She believes this is a bargain and
perceives the value to be more at $60,000 in the current
market. Even though Lynn feels the equipment is worth
$60,000, she may only record the cost she paid for the
equipment of $40,000.

Full Disclosure Principle

The full disclosure principle states that a business must report
any business activities that could affect what is reported on the
financial statements. These activities could be nonfinancial in
nature or be supplemental details not readily available on the
main financial statement. Some examples of this include any
pending litigation, acquisition information, methods used to
calculate certain figures, or stock options. These disclosures are
usually recorded in footnotes on the statements, or in addenda
to the statements.

146 | 1.7 Accounting Principles, Concepts and Assumptions
Separate Entity Concept

The separate entity concept prescribes that a business may
only report activities on financial statements that are
specifically related to company operations, not those activities
that affect the owner personally. This concept is called the
separate entity concept because the business is considered an
entity separate and apart from its owner(s).

   For example, Lynn Sanders purchases two cars; one is used
for personal use only, and the other is used for business use
only. According to the separate entity concept, Lynn may
record the purchase of the car used by the company in the
company's accounting records, but not the car for personal
use.

Conservatism

This concept is important when valuing a transaction for which
the dollar value cannot be as clearly determined, as when using
the cost principle. Conservatism states that if there is
uncertainty in a potential financial estimate, a company should
err on the side of caution and report the most conservative
amount. This would mean that any uncertain or estimated
expenses/losses should be recorded, but uncertain or
estimated revenues/gains should not. This understates net
income, therefore reducing profit. This gives stakeholders a
more reliable view of the company's financial position and does
not overstate income.

Monetary Measurement Concept

In order to record a transaction, we need a system of monetary

                 1.7 Accounting Principles, Concepts and Assumptions | 147
measurement, or a monetary unit by which to value the
transaction. In the United States, this monetary unit is the US
dollar. Without a dollar amount, it would be impossible to
record information in the financial records. It also would leave
stakeholders unable to make financial decisions, because there
is no comparability measurement between companies. This
concept ignores any change in the purchasing power of the
dollar due to inflation.

Going Concern Assumption

The going concern assumption assumes a business will
continue to operate in the foreseeable future. A common time
frame might be twelve months. However, one should presume
the business is doing well enough to continue operations
unless there is evidence to the contrary. For example, a
business might have certain expenses that are paid off (or
reduced) over several time periods. If the business will stay
operational in the foreseeable future, the company can
continue to recognize these long-term expenses over several
time periods. Some red flags that a business may no longer be
a going concern are defaults on loans or a sequence of losses.

Time Period Assumption

The time period assumption states that a company can
present useful information in shorter time periods, such as
years, quarters, or months. The information is broken into time
frames to make comparisons and evaluations easier. The
information will be timely and current and will give a
meaningful picture of how the company is operating.

   For example, a school year is broken down into semesters

148 | 1.7 Accounting Principles, Concepts and Assumptions
or quarters. After each semester or quarter, your grade point
average (GPA) is updated with new information on your
performance in classes you completed. This gives you timely
grading information with which to make decisions about your
schooling.

   A potential or existing investor wants timely information by
which to measure the performance of the company, and to
help decide whether to invest. Because of the time period
assumption, we need to be sure to recognize revenues and
expenses in the proper period. This might mean allocating
costs over more than one accounting or reporting period.

   The use of the principles, assumptions, and concepts in
relation to the preparation of financial statements is better
understood when looking at the full accounting cycle and its
relation to the detailed process required to record business
activities (Figure 1.10).

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

In 2017, the US government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs

                 1.7 Accounting Principles, Concepts and Assumptions | 149
Act. As a result, financial stakeholders needed to resolve several
issues surrounding the standards from GAAP principles and
the FASB. The issues were as follows: "Current Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires that deferred
tax liabilities and assets be adjusted for the effect of a change
in tax laws or rates," and "implementation issues related to the
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and income tax reporting."2

   In response, the FASB issued updated guidance on both
issues. You can explore these revised guidelines at the FASB
website.

Accounting Principles and Assumptions
Regulating Revenue Recognition

Revenue and expense recognition timing is critical to
transparent financial presentation. GAAP governs recognition
for publicly traded companies. Even though GAAP is required
only for public companies, to display their financial position
most accurately, private companies should manage their
financial accounting using its rules. Two principles governed by
GAAP are the revenue recognition principle and the matching
principle. Both the revenue recognition principle and the
matching principle give specific direction on revenue and
expense reporting.

   The revenue recognition principle, which states that
companies must recognize revenue in the period in which it is
earned, instructs companies to recognize revenue when a four-
step process is completed. This may not necessarily be when
cash is collected. Revenue can be recognized when all of the
following criteria have been met:

   There is credible evidence that an arrangement exists.

150 | 1.7 Accounting Principles, Concepts and Assumptions
   Goods have been delivered or services have been
      performed.

   The selling price or fee to the buyer is fixed or can be
      reasonably determined.

   There is reasonable assurance that the amount owed to
      the seller is collectible.

The accrual accounting method aligns with this principle, and
it records transactions related to revenue earnings as they
occur, not when cash is collected. The revenue recognition
principle may be updated periodically to reflect more current
rules for reporting.

   For example, a landscaping company signs a $600 contract
with a customer to provide landscaping services for the next
six months (assume the landscaping workload is distributed
evenly throughout the six months). The customer sets up an in-
house credit line with the company, to be paid in full at the end
of the six months. The landscaping company records revenue
earnings each month and provides service as planned. To align
with the revenue recognition principle, the landscaping
company will record one month of revenue ($100) each month
as earned; they provided service for that month, even though
the customer has not yet paid cash for the service.

   Let's say that the landscaping company also sells gardening
equipment. It sells a package of gardening equipment to a
customer who pays on credit. The landscaping company will
recognize revenue immediately, given that they provided the
customer with the gardening equipment (product), even
though the customer has not yet paid cash for the product.

   Accrual accounting also incorporates the matching
principle (otherwise known as the expense recognition
principle), which instructs companies to record expenses
related to revenue generation in the period in which they are
incurred. The principle also requires that any expense not
directly related to revenues be reported in an appropriate

                  1.7 Accounting Principles, Concepts and Assumptions | 151
manner. For example, assume that a company paid $6,000
in annual real estate taxes. The principle has determined that
costs cannot effectively be allocated based on an individual
month's sales; instead, it treats the expense as a period cost.
In this case, it is going to record 1/12 of the annual expense as
a monthly period cost. Overall, the "matching" of expenses to
revenues projects a more accurate representation of company
financials. When this matching is not possible, then the
expenses will be treated as period costs.

   For example, when the landscaping company sells the
gardening equipment, there are costs associated with that
sale, such as the costs of materials purchased or shipping
charges. The cost is reported in the same period as revenue
associated with the sale. There cannot be a mismatch in
reporting expenses and revenues; otherwise, financial
statements are presented unfairly to stakeholders.
Misreporting has a significant impact on company
stakeholders. If the company delayed reporting revenues until
a future period, net income would be understated in the
current period. If expenses were delayed until a future period,
net income would be overstated.

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

Gift Card Revenue Recognition

Gift cards have become an essential part of revenue generation
and growth for many businesses. Although they are practical
for consumers and low cost to businesses, navigating revenue
recognition guidelines can be difficult. Gift cards with
expiration dates require that revenue recognition be delayed

152 | 1.7 Accounting Principles, Concepts and Assumptions
until customer use or expiration. However, most gift cards now
have no expiration date. So, when do you recognize revenue?

   Companies may need to provide an estimation of projected
gift card revenue and usage during a period based on past
experience or industry standards. There are a few rules
governing reporting. If the company determines that a portion
of all of the issued gift cards will never be used, they may write
this off to income. In some states, if a gift card remains unused,
in part or in full, the unused portion of the card is transferred to
the state government. It is considered unclaimed property for
the customer, meaning that the company cannot keep these
funds as revenue because, in this case, they have reverted to
the state government.

Cycle

Analyzing and recording transactions represent the first steps
in one continuous process known as the accounting cycle.
The accounting cycle is a step-by-step process to record
business activities and events to keep financial records up to
date. The process occurs over one accounting period and will
begin the cycle again in the following period. A period is one
operating cycle of a business, which could be a month, quarter,
or year. Review the accounting cycle in Figure 1.11.

do not cover in this textbook). The entire cycle is meant to
keep financial data organized and easily accessible to both
internal and external users of information. In this chapter, we
focus on the first four steps in the accounting cycle: identify
and analyze transactions, record transactions to a journal, post
journal information to a ledger, and prepare an unadjusted trial
balance.

   In The Adjustment Process we review steps 5, 6, and 7 in the
accounting cycle: record adjusting entries, prepare an adjusted
trial balance, and prepare financial statements. In Completing
the Accounting Cycle, we review steps 8 and 9: closing entries
and prepare a post-closing trial balance. As stated previously,
we do not cover reversing entries.

First Four Steps in the Accounting Cycle

The first four steps in the accounting cycle are (1) identify and
analyze transactions, (2) record transactions to a journal, (3)
post journal information to a ledger, and (4) prepare an
unadjusted trial balance. We begin by introducing the steps
and their related documentation.

These first four steps set the foundation for the recording
process.

   Step 1. Identifying and analyzing transactions is the first step
in the process. This takes information from original sources or

156 | 1.8 The Accounting Cycle
activities and translates that information into usable financial
data. An original source is a traceable record of information
that contributes to the creation of a business transaction. For
example, a sales invoice is considered an original source.
Activities would include paying an employee, selling products,
providing a service, collecting cash, borrowing money, and
issuing stock to company owners. Once the original source has
been identified, the company will analyze the information to
see how it influences financial records.

   Let's say that Mark Summers of Supreme Cleaners provides
cleaning services to a customer. He generates an invoice for
$200, the amount the customer owes, so he can be paid for
the service. This sales receipt contains information such as how
much the customer owes, payment terms, and dates. This sales
receipt is an original source containing financial information
that creates a business transaction for the company.

   Step 2. The second step in the process is recording
transactions to a journal. This takes analyzed data from step 1
and organizes it into a comprehensive record of every company
transaction. A transaction is a business activity or event that
has an effect on financial information presented on financial
statements. The information to record a transaction comes
from an original source. A journal (also known as the book of
original entry or general journal) is a record of all transactions.

   For example, in the previous transaction, Supreme Cleaners
had the invoice for $200. Mark Summers needs to record this
$200 in his financial records. He needs to choose what
accounts represent this transaction, whether or not this
transaction will increase or decreases the accounts, and how
that impacts the accounting equation before he can record the
transaction in his journal. He needs to do this process for every
transaction occurring during the period.

   Figure 1.13 includes information such as the date of the
transaction, the accounts required in the journal entry, and
columns for debits and credits.

                                                            1.8 The Accounting Cycle | 157

Step 3. The third step in the process is posting journal
information to a ledger. Posting takes all transactions from the
journal during a period and moves the information to a general
ledger, or ledger. As you've learned, account balances can be
represented visually in the form of T-accounts.

   Returning to Supreme Cleaners, Mark identified the
accounts needed to represent the $200 sale and recorded
them in his journal. He will then take the account information
and move it to his general ledger. All of the accounts he used
during the period will be shown on the general ledger, not only
those accounts impacted by the $200 sale.

Step 4. The fourth step in the process is to prepare an
unadjusted trial balance. This step takes information from the
general ledger and transfers it onto a document showing all
account balances, and ensuring that debits and credits for the
period balance (debit and credit totals are equal).

   Mark Summers from Supreme Cleaners needs to organize

158 | 1.8 The Accounting Cycle
all of his accounts and their balances, including the $200 sale,
onto a trial balance. He also needs to ensure his debits and
credits are balanced at the culmination of this step.

It is important to note that recording the entire process
requires a strong attention to detail. Any mistakes early on
in the process can lead to incorrect reporting information on
financial statements. If this occurs, accountants may have to
go all the way back to the beginning of the process to find
their error. Make sure that as you complete each step, you are
careful and really take the time to understand how to record
information and why you are recording it. In the next section,

                                                            1.8 The Accounting Cycle | 159
you will learn how the accounting equation is used to analyze
transactions.

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

Forensic Accounting

Ever dream about working for the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI)? As a forensic accountant, that dream might
just be possible. A forensic accountant investigates financial
crimes, such as tax evasion, insider trading, and embezzlement,
among other things. Forensic accountants review financial
records looking for clues to bring about charges against
potential criminals. They consider every part of the accounting
cycle, including original source documents, looking through
journal entries, general ledgers, and financial statements. They
may even be asked to testify to their findings in a court of law.

   To be a successful forensic accountant, one must be detailed,
organized, and naturally inquisitive. This position will need to
retrace the steps a suspect may have taken to cover up
fraudulent financial activities. Understanding how a company
operates can help identify fraudulent activities that veer from
the company's position. Some of the best forensic accountants
have put away major criminals such as Al Capone, Bernie
Madoff, Ken Lay, and Ivan Boesky.

accounting cycle continues with steps 5-7 of the accounting
cycle.

In this segment, we review steps 5, 6, and 7 in the accounting
cycle: record adjusting entries, prepare an adjusted trial
balance, and prepare financial statements.

As we progress through these steps, you learn why the trial
balance in this phase of the accounting cycle is referred to
as an "adjusted" trial balance. We also discuss the purpose
of adjusting entries and the accounting concepts supporting
their need. One of the first concepts we discuss is accrual
accounting.

Accrual Accounting

Public companies reporting their financial positions use either
US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) or
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as allowed
under the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
regulations. Also, companies, public or private, using US GAAP
or IFRS prepare their financial statements using the rules of
accrual accounting. Recall that accrual basis accounting
prescribes that revenues and expenses must be recorded in
the accounting period in which they were earned or incurred,
no matter when cash receipts or payments occur. It is because
of accrual accounting that we have the revenue recognition
principle and the expense recognition principle (also known as
the matching principle).

   The accrual method is considered to better match revenues
and expenses and standardizes reporting information for
comparability purposes. Having comparable information is
important to external users of information trying to make
investment or lending decisions, and to internal users trying to
make decisions about company performance, budgeting, and
growth strategies.

   Some nonpublic companies may choose to use cash basis

164 | 1.9 The Adjustment Process
accounting rather than accrual basis accounting to report
financial information. Recall that cash basis accounting is a
method of accounting in which transactions are not recorded
in the financial statements until there is an exchange of cash.
Cash basis accounting sometimes delays or accelerates
revenue and expense reporting until cash receipts or outlays
occur. With this method, cash flows are used to measure
business performance in a given period and can be simpler to
track than accrual basis accounting.

   There are several other accounting methods or concepts that
accountants will sometimes apply. The first is modified accrual
accounting, which is commonly used in governmental
accounting and merges accrual basis and cash basis
accounting. The second is tax basis accounting that is used in
establishing the tax effects of transactions in determining the
tax liability of an organization.

   One fundamental concept to consider related to the
accounting cycle--and to accrual accounting in particular--is
the idea of the accounting period.

The Accounting Period

As we discussed, accrual accounting requires companies to
report revenues and expenses in the accounting period in
which they were earned or incurred. An accounting
period breaks down company financial information into
specific time spans, and can cover a month, a quarter, a half-
year, or a full year. Public companies governed by GAAP are
required to present quarterly (three-month) accounting period
financial statements called 10-Qs. However, most public and
private companies keep monthly, quarterly, and yearly (annual)
period information. This is useful to users needing up-to-date
financial data to make decisions about company investment
and growth. When the company keeps yearly information, the

                                                        1.9 The Adjustment Process | 165
year could be based on a fiscal or calendar year. This is
explained shortly.

The Fiscal Year and the Calendar Year

A company may choose its yearly reporting period to be based
on a calendar or fiscal year. If a company uses a calendar year,
it is reporting financial data from January 1 to December 31
of a specific year. This may be useful for businesses needing
to coincide with a traditional yearly tax schedule. It can also
be easier to track for some businesses without formal
reconciliation practices, and for small businesses.

   A fiscal year is a twelve-month reporting cycle that can begin
in any month and records financial data for that consecutive
twelve-month period. For example, a business may choose its
fiscal year to begin on April 1, 2019, and end on March 31, 2020.
This can be common practice for corporations and may best
reflect the operational flow of revenues and expenses for a
particular business. In addition to annual reporting, companies
often need or choose to report financial statement information
in interim periods.

Interim Periods

An interim period is any reporting period shorter than a full
year (fiscal or calendar). This can encompass monthly,
quarterly, or half-year statements. The information contained
on these statements is timelier than waiting for a yearly
accounting period to end. The most common interim period
is three months, or a quarter. For companies whose common
stock is traded on a major stock exchange, meaning these
are publicly traded companies, quarterly statements must be

166 | 1.9 The Adjustment Process
filed with the SEC on a Form 10-Q. The companies must file
a Form 10-K for their annual statements. As you've learned,
the SEC is an independent agency of the federal government
that provides oversight of public companies to maintain fair
representation of company financial activities for investors to
make informed decisions.

   In order for information to be useful to the user, it must
be timely--that is, the user has to get it quickly enough so
it is relevant to decision-making. You may recall that this is
the basis of the time period assumption in accounting. For
example, a potential or existing investor wants timely
information by which to measure the performance of the
company, and to help decide whether to invest, to stay
invested, or to sell their stockholdings and invest elsewhere.
This requires companies to organize their information and
break it down into shorter periods. Internal and external users
can then rely on the information that is both timely and
relevant to decision-making.

   The accounting period a company chooses to use for
financial reporting will impact the types of adjustments they
may have to make to certain accounts.

Why Some Accounts Have Incorrect
Balances on the Trial Balance

The unadjusted trial balance may have incorrect balances in
some accounts. Recall the trial balance from Analyzing and
Recording Transactions for the example company, Printing
Plus.

                                                        1.9 The Adjustment Process | 167
Figure 1.17 Unadjusted Trial Balance for Printing Plus. Rice
University. Source: Openstax CC BY NC-SA. Long Description

The trial balance for Printing Plus shows Supplies of $500,
which were purchased on January 30. Since this is a new
company, Printing Plus would more than likely use some of
their supplies right away, before the end of the month on
January 31. Supplies are only an asset when they are unused. If
Printing Plus used some of its supplies immediately on January
30, then why is the full $500 still in the supply account on
January 31? How do we fix this incorrect balance?

   Similarly, what about Unearned Revenue? On January 9, the
company received $4,000 from a customer for printing
services to be performed. The company recorded this as a
liability because it received payment without providing the
service. To clear this liability, the company must perform the

168 | 1.9 The Adjustment Process
service. Assume that as of January 31 some of the printing
services have been provided. Is the full $4,000 still a liability?
Since a portion of the service was provided, a change to
unearned revenue should occur. The company needs to correct
this balance in the Unearned Revenue account.

   Having incorrect balances in Supplies and in Unearned
Revenue on the company's January 31 trial balance is not due
to any error on the company's part. The company followed all
of the correct steps of the accounting cycle up to this point. So
why are the balances still incorrect?

   Journal entries are recorded when an activity or event occurs
that triggers the entry. Usually the trigger is from an original
source. Recall that an original source can be a formal
document substantiating a transaction, such as an invoice,
purchase order, cancelled check, or employee time sheet. Not
every transaction produces an original source document that
will alert the bookkeeper that it is time to make an entry.

   When a company purchases supplies, the original order,
receipt of the supplies, and receipt of the invoice from the
vendor will all trigger journal entries. This trigger does not
occur when using supplies from the supply closet. Similarly,
for unearned revenue, when the company receives an advance
payment from the customer for services yet provided, the cash
received will trigger a journal entry. When the company
provides the printing services for the customer, the customer
will not send the company a reminder that revenue has now
been earned. Situations such as these are why businesses need
to make adjusting entries.

170 | 1.9 The Adjustment Process
1.10 Adjusting Entry -
Examples

Before beginning adjusting entry examples, let's consider
some rules governing adjusting entries:

   Every adjusting entry will have at least one income
      statement account and one balance sheet account.

   Cash will never be in an adjusting entry.
   The adjusting entry records the change in amount that

      occurred during the period.

What are "income statement" and "balance sheet" accounts?
Income statement accounts include revenues and expenses.
Balance sheet accounts are assets, liabilities, and stockholders'
equity accounts, since they appear on a balance sheet. The
second rule tells us that cash can never be in an adjusting
entry. This is true because paying or receiving cash triggers
a journal entry. This means that every transaction with cash
will be recorded at the time of the exchange. We will not get
to the adjusting entries and have cash paid or received which
has not already been recorded. If accountants find themselves
in a situation where the cash account must be adjusted, the
necessary adjustment to cash will be a correcting entry and
not an adjusting entry.

   With an adjusting entry, the amount of change occurring
during the period is recorded. For example, if the supplies
account had a $300 balance at the beginning of the month
and $100 is still available in the supplies account at the end
of the month, the company would record an adjusting entry
for the $200 used during the month (300 - 100). Similarly for

                                                    1.10 Adjusting Entry - Examples | 171
unearned revenues, the company would record how much of
the revenue was earned during the period.

Recording Common Types of Adjusting
Entries

Recall the transactions for Printing Plus discussed in Analyzing
and Recording Transactions.

On January 31, 2019, Printing Plus makes adjusting entries for
the following transactions.

172 | 1.10 Adjusting Entry - Examples
 1. On January 31, Printing Plus took an inventory of its
      supplies and discovered that $100 of supplies had been
      used during the month.

2. The equipment purchased on January 5 depreciated $75
      during the month of January.

 3. Printing Plus performed $600 of services during January
      for the customer from the January 9 transaction.

4. Reviewing the company bank statement, Printing Plus
      discovers $140 of interest earned during the month of
      January that was previously uncollected and unrecorded.

 5. Employees earned $1,500 in salaries for the period of
      January 21-January 31 that had been previously unpaid
      and unrecorded.

We now record the adjusting entries from January 31, 2019, for
Printing Plus.

   Transaction 13: On January 31, Printing Plus took an inventory
of its supplies and discovered that $100 of supplies had been
used during the month.

   Analysis:

   $100 of supplies were used during January. Supplies is an
      asset that is decreasing (credit).

   Supplies is a type of prepaid expense that, when used,
      becomes an expense. Supplies Expense would increase
      (debit) for the $100 of supplies used during January.

   Impact on the financial statements: Supplies is a balance
sheet account, and Supplies Expense is an income statement
account. This satisfies the rule that each adjusting entry will
contain an income statement and balance sheet account. We

                                                   1.10 Adjusting Entry - Examples | 173
see total assets decrease by $100 on the balance sheet.
Supplies Expense increases overall expenses on the income
statement, which reduces net income.

   Transaction 14: The equipment purchased on January 5
depreciated $75 during the month of January.

   Analysis:

   Equipment lost value in the amount of $75 during
      January. This depreciation will impact the Accumulated
      Depreciation-Equipment account and the Depreciation
      Expense-Equipment account. While we are not doing
      depreciation calculations here, you will come across more
      complex calculations in the future.

   Accumulated Depreciation-Equipment is a contra asset
      account (contrary to Equipment) and increases (credit) for
      $75.

   Depreciation Expense-Equipment is an expense account
      that is increasing (debit) for $75.

   Impact on the financial statements: Accumulated
Depreciation-Equipment is a contra account to Equipment.
When calculating the book value of Equipment, Accumulated
Depreciation-Equipment will be deducted from the original
cost of the equipment. Therefore, total assets will decrease by
$75 on the balance sheet. Depreciation Expense will increase

174 | 1.10 Adjusting Entry - Examples
overall expenses on the income statement, which reduces net
income.

   Transaction 15: Printing  Plus performed $600  of services
during January for the       customer from the    January 9
transaction.

   Analysis:

 The customer from the January 9 transaction gave the
   company $4,000 in advanced payment for services. By the
   end of January the company had earned $600 of the
   advanced payment. This means that the company still has
   yet to provide $3,400 in services to that customer.

 Since some of the unearned revenue is now earned,
   Unearned Revenue would decrease. Unearned Revenue is
   a liability account and decreases on the debit side.

 The company can now recognize the $600 as earned
   revenue. Service Revenue increases (credit) for $600.

   Impact on the financial statements: Unearned revenue is
a liability account and will decrease total liabilities and equity
by $600 on the balance sheet. Service Revenue will increase
overall revenue on the income statement, which increases net
income.

                                                   1.10 Adjusting Entry - Examples | 175
   Transaction 16: Reviewing the company bank statement,
Printing Plus discovers $140 of interest earned during the
month of January that was previously uncollected and
unrecorded.

   Analysis:

   Interest is revenue for the company on money kept in a
      savings account at the bank. The company only sees the
      bank statement at the end of the month and needs to
      record interest revenue that has not yet been collected or
      recorded.

   Interest Revenue is a revenue account that increases
      (credit) for $140.

   Since Printing Plus has yet to collect this interest revenue,
      it is considered a receivable. Interest Receivable increases
      (debit) for $140.

   Impact on the financial statements: Interest Receivable is
an asset account and will increase total assets by $140 on the
balance sheet. Interest Revenue will increase overall revenue
on the income statement, which increases net income.

   Transaction 17: Employees earned $1,500 in salaries for the

176 | 1.10 Adjusting Entry - Examples
period of January 21-January 31 that had been previously
unpaid and unrecorded.

   Analysis:
   Salaries have accumulated since January 21 and will not be

      paid in the current period. Since the salaries expense
      occurred in January, the expense recognition principle
      requires recognition in January.
   Salaries Expense is an expense account that is increasing
      (debit) for $1,500.
   Since the company has not yet paid salaries for this time
      period, Printing Plus owes the employees this money. This
      creates a liability for Printing Plus. Salaries Payable
      increases (credit) for $1,500.

   Impact on the financial statements: Salaries Payable is a
liability account and will increase total liabilities and equity by
$1,500 on the balance sheet. Salaries expense will increase
overall expenses on the income statement, which decreases
net income.

Posting Adjusting Entries

Once you have journalized all of your adjusting entries, the next
step is posting the entries to your ledger. Posting adjusting
entries is no different than posting the regular daily journal
entries. T-accounts will be the visual representation for the
Printing Plus general ledger.

   Transaction 13: On January 31, Printing Plus took an inventory
of its supplies and discovered that $100 of supplies had been
used during the month.

   Journal entry and T-accounts:

   In the journal entry, Supplies Expense has a debit of $100. This
is posted to the Supplies Expense T-account on the debit side
(left side). Supplies has a credit balance of $100. This is posted
to the Supplies T-account on the credit side (right side). You will
notice there is already a debit balance in this account from the
purchase of supplies on January 30. The $100 is deducted from
$500 to get a final debit balance of $400.

   Transaction 14: The equipment purchased on January 5
depreciated $75 during the month of January.

The sum on the assets side of the accounting equation equals
$29,965, found by adding together the final balances in each
asset account (24,800 + 1,200 + 140 + 400 + 3,500 - 75). To
find the total on the liabilities and equity side of the equation,
we need to find the difference between debits and credits.
Credits on the liabilities and equity side of the equation total
$35,640 (500 + 1,500 + 3,400 + 20,000 + 10,100 + 140). Debits
on the liabilities and equity side of the equation total $5,675
(100 + 100 + 5,100 + 300 + 75). The difference between $35,640
- $5,675 = $29,965. Thus, the equation remains balanced with
$29,965 on the asset side and $29,965 on the liabilities and
equity side. Now that we have the T-account information, and
have confirmed the accounting equation remains balanced,
we can create the adjusted trial balance in our sixth step in the
accounting cycle.

1.12 The Adjusted Trial
Balance

Once all of the adjusting entries have been posted to the
general ledger, we are ready to start working on preparing the
adjusted trial balance. Preparing an adjusted trial balance is the
sixth step in the accounting cycle. An adjusted trial balance is
a list of all accounts in the general ledger, including adjusting
entries, which have nonzero balances. This trial balance is an
important step in the accounting process because it helps
identify any computational errors throughout the first five
steps in the cycle.

   As with the unadjusted trial balance, transferring information
from T-accounts to the adjusted trial balance requires
consideration of the final balance in each account. If the final
balance in the ledger account (T-account) is a debit balance,
you will record the total in the left column of the trial balance.
If the final balance in the ledger account (T-account) is a credit
balance, you will record the total in the right column.

   Once all ledger accounts and their balances are recorded,
the debit and credit columns on the adjusted trial balance are
totaled to see if the figures in each column match. The final
total in the debit column must be the same dollar amount that
is determined in the final credit column.

   Let's now take a look at the adjusted T-accounts and adjusted
trial balance for Printing Plus to see how the information is
transferred from these T-accounts to the adjusted trial balance.
We only focus on those general ledger accounts that had
balance adjustments.

For example, Interest Receivable is an adjusted account that
192 | 1.13 The Worksheet
has a final balance of $140 on the debit side. This balance is
transferred to the Interest Receivable account in the debit
column on the adjusted trial balance. Supplies ($400), Supplies
Expense ($100), Salaries Expense ($5,100), and Depreciation
Expense-Equipment ($75) also have debit final balances in
their adjusted T-accounts, so this information will be
transferred to the debit column on the adjusted trial balance.
Accumulated Depreciation-Equipment ($75), Salaries Payable
($1,500), Unearned Revenue ($3,400), Service Revenue ($10,100),
and Interest Revenue ($140) all have credit final balances in
their T-accounts. These credit balances would transfer to the
credit column on the adjusted trial balance.

   Once all balances are transferred to the adjusted trial
balance, we sum each of the debit and credit columns. The
debit and credit columns both total $35,715, which means they
are equal and in balance.

1.14 Financial
Statements

One of the key factors for success for those beginning the
study of accounting is to understand how the elements of the
financial statements relate to each of the financial statements.
That is, once the transactions are categorized into the
elements, knowing what to do next is vital. This is the
beginning of the process to create the financial statements. It
is important to note that financial statements are discussed in
the order in which the statements are presented.

   Please watch the video.

                    One or more interactive elements has been
                    excluded from this version of the text. You can

Elements of the Financial Statements

When thinking of the relationship between the elements and

196 | 1.14 Financial Statements
the financial statements, we might think of a baking analogy:
the elements represent the ingredients, and the financial
statements represent the finished product. As with baking a
cake, knowing the ingredients (elements) and how each
ingredient relates to the final product (financial statements) is
vital to the study of accounting.

To help accountants prepare and users better understand
financial statements, the profession has outlined what is
referred to as elements of the financial statements, which are
those categories or accounts that accountants use to record
transactions and prepare financial statements. There are ten
elements of the financial statements, and we have already
discussed most of them.

   Revenue--value of goods and services the organization
      sold or provided.

   Expenses--costs of providing the goods or services for
      which the organization earns revenue.

   Gains--gains are similar to revenue but relate to

      discussion of comprehensive income is reserved for

      worth noting that comprehensive income has four
      components, focusing on activities related to foreign
      currency, derivatives, investments, and pensions.

Financial Statements for a Sample
Company

In this example using a fictitious company, Cheesy Chuck's, we
began with the account balances and demonstrated how to
prepare the financial statements for the month of June, the
first month of operations for the business. It will be helpful to
revisit the process by summarizing the information we started
with and how that information was used to create the four
financial statements: income statement, statement of owner's
equity, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows.

   We started with the account balances shown in Figure 1.21.

Income Statement

Let's prepare the income statement so we can inform how a
service business, Cheesy Chuck's, performed for the month of
June (note, an income statement is for a period of time). Our
first step is to determine the value of goods and services that
the organization sold or provided for a given period of time.
These are the inflows to the business, and because the inflows
relate to the primary purpose of the business (making and
selling popcorn), we classify those items as Revenues, Sales, or

                                                            1.14 Financial Statements | 199
Fees Earned. For this example, we use Revenue. The revenue
for Cheesy Chuck's for the month of June is $85,000.

   Next, we need to show the total expenses for Cheesy Chuck's.
Because Cheesy Chuck's tracks different types of expenses, we
need to add these amounts to calculate total expenses. The
final step to create the income statement is to determine the
amount of net income or net loss for Cheesy Chuck's. Since
revenues ($85,000) are greater than expenses ($79,200), Cheesy
Chuck's has a net income of $5,800 for the month of June.

   Figure 1.22 displays the June income statement for Cheesy
Chuck's Classic Corn.

Income of $5,800 for the month ended June 30. This amount will be

Description

Financial statements are created using numerous standard
conventions or practices. The standard conventions provide
consistency and help assure financial statement users the
information is presented in a similar manner, regardless of the

200 | 1.14 Financial Statements
organization issuing the financial statement. Let's look at the
standard conventions shown in the Cheesy Chuck's income
statement:

   The heading of the income statement includes three lines.
         The first line lists the business name.
         The middle line indicates the financial statement that
            is being presented.
         The last line indicates the time frame of the financial
            statement. Do not forget the income statement is for
            a period of time (the month of June in our example).

   There are three columns.
         Going from left to right, the first column is the
            category heading or account.
         The second column is used when there are numerous
            accounts in a particular category (Expenses, in our
            example).
         The third column is a total column. In this illustration,
            it is the column where subtotals are listed and net
            income is determined (subtracting Expenses from
            Revenues).

   Subtotals are indicated by a single underline, while totals
      are indicated by a double underline. Notice the amount of
      Miscellaneous Expense ($300) is formatted with a single
      underline to indicate that a subtotal will follow. Similarly,
      the amount of "Net Income" ($5,800) is formatted with a
      double underline to indicate that it is the final value/total
      of the financial statement.

   There are no gains or losses for Cheesy Chuck's. Gains and
      losses are not unusual transactions for businesses, but
      gains and losses may be infrequent for some, especially
      small, businesses.

                                                            1.14 Financial Statements | 201
Statement of Owner's Equity (Retained
Earnings)

Let's create the statement of owner's equity for Cheesy Chuck's
for the month of June. Since Cheesy Chuck's is a brand-new
business, there is no beginning balance of Owner's Equity. The
first items to account for are the increases in value/equity,
which are investments by owners and net income. As you look
at the accounting information you were provided, you
recognize the amount invested by the owner, Chuck, was
$12,500. Next, we account for the increase in value as a result of
net income, which was determined in the income statement to
be $5,800. Next, we determine if there were any activities that
decreased the value of the business. More specifically, we are
accounting for the value of distributions to the owners and net
loss, if any.

   It is important to note that an organization will have either
net income or net loss for the period, but not both. Also, small
businesses in particular may have periods where there are no
investments by, or distributions to, the owner(s). For the month
of June, Chuck withdrew $1,450 from the business. This is a
good time to recall the terminology used by accountants based
on the legal structure of the particular business. Since the
account was titled "Drawings by Owner" and because Chuck
is the only owner, we can assume this is a sole proprietorship.
If the business was structured as a corporation, this activity
would be called something like "Dividends Paid to Owners."

   At this stage, remember that since we are working with a
sole proprietorship to help simplify the examples, we have
addressed the owner's value in the firm as capital or owner's
equity. However, later we switch the structure of the business
to a corporation, and instead of owner's equity, we begin using
such account titles as common stock and retained earnings to
represent the owner's interests. The corporate treatment is

202 | 1.14 Financial Statements
more complicated, because corporations may have a few
owners up to potentially thousands of owners (stockholders).
The details of accounting for the interests of corporations are
covered in a subsequent chapter.

   So how much did the value of Cheesy Chuck's change during
the month of June? You are correct if you answered $16,850.
Since this is a brand-new store, the beginning value of the
business is zero. During the month, the owner invested $12,500
and the business had profitable operations (net income) of
$5,800. Also, during the month the owner withdrew $1,450,
resulting in a net change (and ending balance) to owner's
equity of $16,850. Shown in a formula:

   Beginning Balance + Investments by Owners  Net Income
(Net Loss) - Distributions, or

Figure 1.23 shows what the statement of owner's equity for
Cheesy Chuck's Classic Corn would look like.

time (the month of June in this case). Notice the amount of net
income (or net loss) is brought from the income statement. In a
similar manner, the ending equity balance (Capital for Cheesy
Chuck's because it is a sole proprietorship) is carried forward to the
balance sheet. Rice University. Source: Openstax CC BY NC-SA Long
Description

Notice the following about the statement of owner's equity for
Cheesy Chuck's:

   The format is similar to the format of the income
      statement (three lines for the heading, three columns).

   The statement follows a chronological order, starting with
      the first day of the month, accounting for the changes
      that occurred throughout the month, and ending with the
      final day of the month.

The statement uses the final number from the financial
statement previously completed. In this case, the statement of
owner's equity uses the net income (or net loss) amount from
the income statement (Net Income, $5,800).

204 | 1.14 Financial Statements
Balance Sheet

Let's create a balance sheet for Cheesy Chuck's for June 30. To
begin, we look at the accounting records and determine what
assets the business owns and the value of each. Cheesy Chuck's
has two assets: Cash ($6,200) and Equipment ($12,500). Adding
the amount of assets gives a total asset value of $18,700. As
discussed previously, the equipment that was recently
purchased will be depreciated in the future, beginning with the
next accounting period.

   Next, we determine the amount of money that Cheesy
Chuck's owes (liabilities). There are also two liabilities for Cheesy
Chuck's. The first account listed in the records is Accounts
Payable for $650. Accounts Payable is the amount that Cheesy
Chuck's must pay in the future to vendors (also called
suppliers) for the ingredients to make the gourmet popcorn.
The other liability is Wages Payable for $1,200. This is the
amount that Cheesy Chuck's must pay in the future to
employees for work that has been performed. Adding the two
amounts gives us total liabilities of $1,850. (Here's a hint as
you develop your understanding of accounting: Liabilities often
include the word "payable." So, when you see "payable" in the
account title, know these are amounts owed in the
future--liabilities.)

   Finally, we determine the amount of equity the owner,
Cheesy Chuck, has in the business. The amount of owner's
equity was determined on the statement of owner's equity in
the previous step ($16,850). Can you think of another way to
confirm the amount of owner's equity? Recall that equity is
also called net assets (assets minus liabilities). If you take the
total assets of Cheesy Chuck's of $18,700 and subtract the total
liabilities of $1,850, you get owner's equity of $16,850. Using
the basic accounting equation, the balance sheet for Cheesy
Chuck's as of June 30 is shown in Figure 1.24.

                                                           1.14 Financial Statements | 205

Connecting the Income Statement and the
Balance Sheet

Another way to think of the connection between the income
statement and balance sheet (which is aided by the statement
of owner's equity) is by using a sports analogy. The income
statement summarizes the financial performance of the
business for a given period of time. The income statement
reports how the business performed financially each
month--the firm earned either net income or net loss. This is
similar to the outcome of a particular game--the team either
won or lost.

   The balance sheet summarizes the financial position of the
business on a given date. Meaning, because of the
financial performance over the past twelve months, for
example, this is the financial position of the business as of
December 31. Think of the balance sheet as being similar to
a team's overall win/loss record--to a certain extent a team's
strength can be perceived by its win/loss record.

206 | 1.14 Financial Statements
   However, because different companies have different sizes,
you do not necessarily want to compare the balance sheets
of two different companies. For example, you would not want
to compare a local retail store with Walmart. In most cases
you want to compare a company with its past balance sheet
information.

Statement of Cash Flows

This fourth and final financial statement lists the cash inflows
and cash outflows for the business for a period of time. It was
created to fill in some informational gaps that existed in the
other three statements (income statement, owner's equity/
retained earnings statement, and the balance sheet).

In this segment, we complete the final steps (steps 8 and 9) of
the accounting cycle, the closing process. You will notice that
we do not cover step 10, reversing entries. This is an optional
step in the accounting cycle that you will learn about in future
courses.

Our discussion here begins with journalizing and posting the
closing entries (Figure 1.26). These posted entries will then
translate into a post-closing trial balance, which is a trial
balance that is prepared after all of the closing entries have
been recorded.

Introduction to the Closing Entries

Companies are required to close their books at the end of each
fiscal year so that they can prepare their annual financial
statements and tax returns. However, most companies prepare
monthly financial statements and close their books annually,
so they have a clear picture of company performance during
the year, and give users timely information to make decisions.

   Closing entries prepare a company for the next accounting
period by clearing any outstanding balances in certain
accounts that should not transfer over to the next
period. Closing, or clearing the balances, means returning the
account to a zero balance. Having a zero balance in these
accounts is important so a company can compare
performance across periods, particularly with income. It also
helps the company keep thorough records of account balances
affecting retained earnings. Revenue, expense, and dividend
accounts affect retained earnings and are closed so they can

210 | 1.15 Closing Entries
accumulate new balances in the next period, which is an
application of the time period assumption.

   To further clarify this concept, balances are closed to assure
all revenues and expenses are recorded in the proper period
and then start over the following period. The revenue and
expense accounts should start at zero each period, because
we are measuring how much revenue is earned and expenses
incurred during the period. However, the cash balances, as well
as the other balance sheet accounts, are carried over from the
end of a current period to the beginning of the next period.

   For example, a store has an inventory account balance of
$100,000. If the store closed at 11:59 p.m. on January 31, 2019,
then the inventory balance when it reopened at 12:01 a.m. on
February 1, 2019, would still be $100,000. The balance sheet
accounts, such as inventory, would carry over into the next
period, in this case February 2019.

   The accounts that need to start with a clean or $0 balance
going into the next accounting period are revenue, income,
and any dividends from January 2019. To determine the income
(profit or loss) from the month of January, the store needs to
close the income statement information from January 2019.
Zeroing January 2019 would then enable the store to calculate
the income (profit or loss) for the next month (February 2019),
instead of merging it into January's income and thus providing
invalid information solely for the month of February.

   However, if the company also wanted to keep year-to-date
information from month to month, a separate set of records
could be kept as the company progresses through the
remaining months in the year. For our purposes, assume that
we are closing the books at the end of each month unless
otherwise noted.

   Let's look at another example to illustrate the point. Assume
you own a small landscaping business. It is the end of the year,
December 31, 2018, and you are reviewing your financials for
the entire year. You see that you earned $120,000 this year in

                                                                       1.15 Closing Entries | 211
revenue and had expenses for rent, electricity, cable, internet,
gas, and food that totaled $70,000.

   You also review the following information:

   The next day, January 1, 2019, you get ready for work, but
before you go to the office, you decide to review your financials
for 2019. What are your year-to-date earnings? So far, you have
not worked at all in the current year. What are your total
expenses for rent, electricity, cable and internet, gas, and food
for the current year? You have also not incurred any expenses
yet for rent, electricity, cable, internet, gas or food. This means
that the current balance of these accounts is zero, because
they were closed on December 31, 2018, to complete the annual
accounting period.

   Next, you review your assets and liabilities. What is your
current bank account balance? What is the current book value
of your electronics, car, and furniture? What about your credit
card balances and bank loans? Are the value of your assets and
liabilities now zero because of the start of a new year? Your car,
electronics, and furniture did not suddenly lose all their value,
and unfortunately, you still have outstanding debt. Therefore,
these accounts still have a balance in the new year, because
they are not closed, and the balances are carried forward from
December 31 to January 1 to start the new annual accounting
period.

   This is no different from what will happen to a company
at the end of an accounting period. A company will see its
revenue and expense accounts set back to zero, but its assets

212 | 1.15 Closing Entries
and liabilities will maintain a balance. Stockholders' equity
accounts will also maintain their balances. In summary, the
accountant resets the temporary accounts to zero by
transferring the balances to permanent accounts.

Temporary and Permanent Accounts

All accounts can be classified as either permanent (real) or
temporary (nominal) the following Figure 1.27.

   Permanent (real) accounts are accounts that transfer
balances to the next period and include balance sheet
accounts, such as assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity.
These accounts will not be set back to zero at the beginning
of the next period; they will keep their balances. Permanent
accounts are not part of the closing process.

   Temporary (nominal) accounts are accounts that are closed
at the end of each accounting period, and include income
statement, dividends, and income summary accounts. The
new account, Income Summary, will be discussed shortly.
These accounts are temporary because they keep their
balances during the current accounting period and are set
back to zero when the period ends. Revenue and expense
accounts are closed to Income Summary, and Income
Summary and Dividends are closed to the permanent account,
Retained Earnings.

                                                                      1.15 Closing Entries | 213
Figure 1.27 Location Chart for Financial Statement Accounts.  Rice
University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA (Attribution NonCommercial
ShareAlike) Long Description

The income summary account is an intermediary between
revenues and expenses, and the Retained Earnings account. It
stores all of the closing information for revenues and expenses,
resulting in a "summary" of income or loss for the period. The
balance in the Income Summary account equals the net
income or loss for the period. This balance is then transferred
to the Retained Earnings account.

   Income summary is a nondefined account category. This
means that it is not an asset, liability, stockholders' equity,
revenue, or expense account. The account has a zero balance
throughout the entire accounting period until the closing
entries are prepared. Therefore, it will not appear on any trial
balances, including the adjusted trial balance, and will not
appear on any of the financial statements.

   You might be asking yourself, "is the Income Summary
account even necessary?" Could we just close out revenues
and expenses directly into retained earnings and not have this
extra temporary account? We could do this, but by having the
Income Summary account, you get a balance for net income
a second time. This gives you the balance to compare to the
income statement, and allows you to double check that all
income statement accounts are closed and have correct

214 | 1.15 Closing Entries
amounts. If you put the revenues and expenses directly into
retained earnings, you will not see that check figure. No matter
which way you choose to close, the same final balance is in
retained earnings.

Journalizing and Posting Closing Entries

The eighth step in the accounting cycle is preparing closing

entries, which includes journalizing and posting the entries to

the ledger.

Four entries occur during the closing process. The first entry

closes revenue accounts to the Income Summary account. The

second entry closes expense accounts to the Income Summary

account. The third entry closes the Income Summary account

to Retained Earnings. The fourth entry closes the Dividends

account to Retained Earnings. The information needed to

prepare closing entries comes from the adjusted trial balance.

Let's explore each entry in more detail using Printing Plus's

information  from Analyzing              and  Recording

Transactions and The Adjustment Process as our example. The

Printing Plus adjusted trial balance for January 31, 2019, is

presented in the following Figure 1.28.

Long Description

The first entry requires revenue accounts close to the Income
Summary account. To get a zero balance in a revenue account,
the entry will show a debit to revenues and a credit to Income
Summary. Printing Plus has $140 of interest revenue and
$10,100 of service revenue, each with a credit balance on the
adjusted trial balance. The closing entry will debit both interest
revenue and service revenue, and credit Income Summary.

   Notice that the balances in interest revenue and service
revenue are now zero and are ready to accumulate revenues
in the next period. The Income Summary account has a credit
balance of $10,240 (the revenue sum).
   The second entry requires expense accounts close to the
Income Summary account. To get a zero balance in an expense
account, the entry will show a credit to expenses and a debit to
Income Summary. Printing Plus has $100 of supplies expense,
$75 of depreciation expense-equipment, $5,100 of salaries
expense, and $300 of utility expense, each with a debit balance
on the adjusted trial balance. The closing entry will credit
Supplies Expense, Depreciation Expense-Equipment, Salaries
Expense, and Utility Expense, and debit Income Summary.

The Income Summary account has a new credit balance of
$4,665, which is the difference between revenues and expenses
in Figure 1.29. The balance in Income Summary is the same
figure as what is reported on Printing Plus's Income Statement.

Why are these two figures the same? The income statement
summarizes your income, as does income summary. If both
summarize your income in the same period, then they must be
equal. If they do not match, then you have an error.

   The third entry requires Income Summary to close to the
Retained Earnings account. To get a zero balance in the
Income Summary account, there are guidelines to consider.

   If the balance in Income Summary before closing is a
      credit balance, you will debit Income Summary and credit
      Retained Earnings in the closing entry. This situation
      occurs when a company has a net income.

   If the balance in Income Summary before closing is a
      debit balance, you will credit Income Summary and debit

218 | 1.15 Closing Entries
      Retained Earnings in the closing entry. This situation
      occurs when a company has a net loss.

Remember that net income will increase retained earnings,
and a net loss will decrease retained earnings. The Retained
Earnings account increases on the credit side and decreases on
the debit side.

   Printing Plus has a $4,665 credit balance in its Income
Summary account before closing, so it will debit Income
Summary and credit Retained Earnings.

   The T-accounts after this closing entry would look like the
following.

   Long Description
   Notice that the Income Summary account is now zero and is
ready for use in the next period. The Retained Earnings account
balance is currently a credit of $4,665.
   The fourth entry requires Dividends to close to the Retained
Earnings account. Remember from your past studies that
dividends are not expenses, such as salaries paid to your
employees or staff. Instead, declaring and paying dividends is
a method utilized by corporations to return part of the profits
generated by the company to the owners of the company--in
this case, its shareholders.
   If dividends were not declared, closing entries would cease at
this point. If dividends are declared, to get a zero balance in the
Dividends account, the entry will show a credit to Dividends
and a debit to Retained Earnings. As you will learn
in Corporation Accounting, there are three components to the
declaration and payment of dividends. The first part is the date

                                                                      1.15 Closing Entries | 219
of declaration, which creates the obligation or liability to pay
the dividend. The second part is the date of record that
determines who receives the dividends, and the third part is
the date of payment, which is the date that payments are
made. Printing Plus has $100 of dividends with a debit balance
on the adjusted trial balance. The closing entry will credit
Dividends and debit Retained Earnings.

   The T-accounts after this closing entry would look like the
following.

   Why was income summary not used in the dividends closing
entry? Dividends are not an income statement account. Only
income statement accounts help us summarize income, so
only income statement accounts should go into income
summary.

   Remember, dividends are a contra stockholders' equity
account. It is contra to retained earnings. If we pay out
dividends, it means retained earnings decreases. Retained
earnings decreases on the debit side. The remaining balance in
Retained Earnings is $4,565 the following Figure 5.6. This is the
same figure found on the statement of retained earnings.

The statement of retained earnings shows the period-ending
retained earnings after the closing entries have been posted.
When you compare the retained earnings ledger (T-account) to
the statement of retained earnings, the figures must match. It
is important to understand retained earnings is not closed out,
it is only updated. Retained Earnings is the only account that
appears in the closing entries that does not close. You should
recall from your previous material that retained earnings are
the earnings retained by the company over time--not cash
flow but earnings. Now that we have closed the temporary
accounts, let's review what the post-closing ledger (T-accounts)
looks like for Printing Plus.

T-Account Summary

The T-account summary for Printing Plus after closing entries
are journalized is presented in Figure 1.31.

                                                                      1.15 Closing Entries | 221
Figure 1.31 T-Account Summary.  Rice University OpenStax CC

Notice that revenues, expenses, dividends, and income
summary all have zero balances. Retained earnings maintains
a $4,565 credit balance. The post-closing T-accounts will be
transferred to the post-closing trial balance, which is step 9 in
the accounting cycle.

   Here's a short video summarizing the four closing entries.

1.16 Post-Closing Trial
Balance

The ninth, and typically final, step of the process is to prepare
a post-closing trial balance. The word "post" in this instance
means "after." You are preparing a trial balance after the
closing entries are complete.

   Like all trial balances, the post-closing trial balance has the
job of verifying that the debit and credit totals are equal. The
post-closing trial balance has one additional job that the other
trial balances do not have. The post-closing trial balance is also
used to double-check that the only accounts with balances
after the closing entries are permanent accounts. If there are
any temporary accounts on this trial balance, you would know
that there was an error in the closing process. This error must
be fixed before starting the new period.

   The process of preparing the post-closing trial balance is the
same as you have done when preparing the unadjusted trial
balance and adjusted trial balance. Only permanent account
balances should appear on the post-closing trial balance. These
balances in post-closing T-accounts are transferred over to
either the debit or credit column on the post-closing trial
balance. When all accounts have been recorded, total each
column and verify the columns equal each other.

   The post-closing trial balance for Printing Plus is shown
in Figure 1.32.

                                                    1.16 Post-Closing Trial Balance | 227

Notice that only permanent accounts are included. All
temporary accounts with zero balances were left out of this
statement. Unlike previous trial balances, the retained earnings
figure is included, which was obtained through the closing
process.

   At this point, the accounting cycle is complete, and the
company can begin a new cycle in the next period. In essence,
the company's business is always in operation, while the
accounting cycle utilizes the cutoff of month-end to provide
financial information to assist and review the operations.

   It is worth mentioning that there is one step in the process
that a company may or may not include, step 10, reversing
entries. Reversing entries reverse an adjusting entry made in
a prior period at the start of a new period. We do not cover
reversing entries in this chapter, but you might approach the
subject in future accounting courses.

   Now that we have completed the accounting cycle, let's take

228 | 1.16 Post-Closing Trial Balance
a look at another way the adjusted trial balance assists users of
information with financial decision-making.

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

The Importance of Understanding How to
Complete the Accounting Cycle

Many students who enroll in an introductory accounting
course do not plan to become accountants. They will work in a
variety of jobs in the business field, including managers, sales,
and finance. In a real company, most of the mundane work
is done by computers. Accounting software can perform such
tasks as posting the journal entries recorded, preparing trial
balances, and preparing financial statements. Students often
ask why they need to do all of these steps by hand in their
introductory class, particularly if they are never going to be an
accountant. It is very important to understand that no matter
what your position, if you work in business you need to be able
to read financial statements, interpret them, and know how to
use that information to better your business. If you have never
followed the full process from beginning to end, you will never
understand how one of your decisions can impact the final
numbers that appear on your financial statements. You will not
understand how your decisions can affect the outcome of your
company.

   As mentioned previously, once you understand the effect
your decisions will have on the bottom line on your income
statement and the balances in your balance sheet, you can use
accounting software to do all of the mundane, repetitive steps
and use your time to evaluate the company based on what the

                                                    1.16 Post-Closing Trial Balance | 229
financial statements show. Your stockholders, creditors, and
other outside professionals will use your financial statements
to evaluate your performance. If you evaluate your numbers as
often as monthly, you will be able to identify your strengths
and weaknesses before any outsiders see them and make any
necessary changes to your plan in the following month.

We next take a look at a comprehensive example that works
through the entire accounting cycle for Clip'em Cliff. Clifford
Girard retired from the US Marine Corps after 20 years of active
duty. Cliff decides it would be fun to become a barber and
open his own shop called "Clip'em Cliff." He will run the barber
shop out of his home for the first couple of months while he
identifies a new location for his shop.

   Since his Marines career included several years of logistics, he
is also going to operate a consulting practice where he will help

232 | 1.17 Accounting Cycle Comprehensive Example
budding barbers create a barbering practice. He will charge
a flat fee or a per hour charge. His consulting practice will
be recognized as service revenue and will provide additional
revenue while he develops his barbering practice.

   He obtains a barber's license after the required training and
is ready to open his shop on August 1. Table 1.3 shows his
transactions from the first month of business.

                                        BY-NC-SA 4.0

Date Transaction

Aug. 1 Cliff issues $70,000 shares of common stock for cash.

Aug. 3  Cliff purchases barbering equipment for $45,000; $37,500
        was paid immediately with cash, and the remaining
        $7,500 was billed to Cliff with payment due in 30 days. He
        decided to buy used equipment, because he was not sure
        if he truly wanted to run a barber shop. He assumed that
        he will replace the used equipment with new equipment
        within a couple of years.

Aug. 6 Cliff purchases supplies for $300 cash.

Aug. 10 Cliff provides $4,000 in services to a customer who asks to be billed for the services.

Aug. 13 Cliff pays a $75 utility bill with cash.

Aug. 14 Cliff receives $3,200 cash in advance from a customer for services not yet rendered.

Aug. 16 Cliff distributed $150 cash in dividends to stockholders.

Aug. 17 Cliff receives $5,200 cash from a customer for services rendered.

Aug. 19 Cliff paid $2,000 toward the outstanding liability from the August 3 transaction.

Aug. 22 Cliff paid $4,600 cash in salaries expense to employees.

Aug. 28 The customer from the August 10 transaction pays $1,500 cash toward Cliff's account.

Transaction 1: On August 1, 2019, Cliff issues $70,000 shares of
common stock for cash.

   Analysis:

        1.17 Accounting Cycle Comprehensive Example | 233
   Clip'em Cliff now has more cash. Cash is an asset, which is
      increasing on the debit side.

   When the company issues stock, this yields a higher
      common stock figure than before issuance. The common
      stock account is increasing on the credit side.

   Transaction 2: On August 3, 2019, Cliff purchases barbering
equipment for $45,000; $37,500 was paid immediately with
cash, and the remaining $7,500 was billed to Cliff with payment
due in 30 days.

   Analysis:
   Clip'em Cliff now has more equipment than before.

      Equipment is an asset, which is increasing on the debit
      side for $45,000.
   Cash is used to pay for $37,500. Cash is an asset,
      decreasing on the credit side.
   Cliff asked to be billed, which means he did not pay cash
      immediately for $7,500 of the equipment. Accounts
      Payable is used to signal this short-term liability. Accounts
      payable is increasing on the credit side.

234 | 1.17 Accounting Cycle Comprehensive Example
   Transaction 3: On August 6, 2019, Cliff purchases supplies for
$300 cash.

   Analysis:
   Clip'em Cliff now has less cash. Cash is an asset, which is

      decreasing on the credit side.
   Supplies, an asset account, is increasing on the debit side.

   Transaction 4: On August 10, 2019, provides $4,000 in
services to a customer who asks to be billed for the services.

   Analysis:
   Clip'em Cliff provided service, thus earning revenue.

      Revenue impacts equity, and increases on the credit side.
   The customer did not pay immediately for the service and

      owes Cliff payment. This is an Accounts Receivable for Cliff.
      Accounts Receivable is an asset that is increasing on the
      debit side.

                           1.17 Accounting Cycle Comprehensive Example | 235
   Transaction 5: On August 13, 2019, Cliff pays a $75 utility bill
with cash.

   Analysis:
   Clip'em Cliff now has less cash than before. Cash is an

      asset that is decreasing on the credit side.
   Utility payments are billed expenses. Utility Expense

      negatively impacts equity, and increases on the debit side.

   Transaction 6: On August 14, 2019, Cliff receives $3,200 cash
in advance from a customer for services to be rendered.

   Analysis:
   Clip'em Cliff now has more cash. Cash is an asset, which is

      increasing on the debit side.
   The customer has not yet received services but already

      paid the company. This means the company owes the
      customer the service. This creates a liability to the
      customer, and revenue cannot yet be recognized.
      Unearned Revenue is the liability account, which is

236 | 1.17 Accounting Cycle Comprehensive Example
      increasing on the credit side.

   Transaction 7: On August 16, 2019, Cliff distributed $150 cash
in dividends to stockholders.

   Analysis:
   Clip'em Cliff now has less cash. Cash is an asset, which is

      decreasing on the credit side.
   When the company pays out dividends, this decreases

      equity and increases the dividends account. Dividends
      increases on the debit side.

   Transaction 8: On August 17, 2019, Cliff receives $5,200 cash
from a customer for services rendered.

   Analysis:
   Clip'em Cliff now has more cash than before. Cash is an

      asset, which is increasing on the debit side.
   Service was provided, which means revenue can be

      recognized. Service Revenue increases equity. Service

                           1.17 Accounting Cycle Comprehensive Example | 237
      Revenue is increasing on the credit side.

   Transaction 9: On August 19, 2019, Cliff paid $2,000 toward
the outstanding liability from the August 3 transaction.

   Analysis:
   Clip'em Cliff now has less cash. Cash is an asset, which is

      decreasing on the credit side.
   Accounts Payable is a liability account, decreasing on the

      debit side.

   Transaction 10: On August 22, 2019, Cliff paid $4,600 cash in
salaries expense to employees.

   Analysis:
   Clip'em Cliff now has less cash. Cash is an asset, which is

      decreasing on the credit side.
   When the company pays salaries, this is an expense to the

      business. Salaries Expense reduces equity by increasing on
      the debit side.

238 | 1.17 Accounting Cycle Comprehensive Example
   Transaction 11: On August 28, 2019, the customer from the
August 10 transaction pays $1,500 cash toward Cliff's account.

   Analysis:
   The customer made a partial payment on their

      outstanding account. This reduces Accounts Receivable.
      Accounts Receivable is an asset account decreasing on
      the credit side.
   Cash is an asset, increasing on the debit side.

   The complete journal for August is presented in Figure 1.34.

Once all journal entries have been created, the next step in the
accounting cycle is to post journal information to the ledger.
The ledger is visually represented by T-accounts. Cliff will go
through each transaction and transfer the account information
into the debit or credit side of that ledger account. Any account

240 | 1.17 Accounting Cycle Comprehensive Example
that has more than one transaction needs to have a final
balance calculated. This happens by taking the difference
between the debits and credits in an account.

   Clip'em Cliff's ledger represented by T-accounts is presented
in Figure 1.35.

You will notice that the sum of the asset account balances in
Cliff's ledger equals the sum of the liability and equity account
balances at $83,075. The final debit or credit balance in each
account is transferred to the unadjusted trial balance in the
corresponding debit or credit column as illustrated in Figure
1.36.

Once all of the account balances are transferred to the correct
columns, each column is totaled. The total in the debit column
must match the total in the credit column to remain balanced.
The unadjusted trial balance for Clip'em Cliff appears in Figure

The unadjusted trial balance shows a debit and credit balance
of $87,900. Remember, the unadjusted trial balance is
prepared before any period-end adjustments are made.

   On August 31, Cliff has the transactions shown in Table 1.4
requiring adjustment.

Date Transaction

Aug. 31 Cliff took an inventory of supplies and discovered that $250 of supplies remain unused at the end of the month.

Aug. 31 The equipment purchased on August 3 depreciated $2,500 during the month of August.

Aug. 31 Clip'em Cliff performed $1,100 of services during August for the customer from the August 14 transaction.

Aug. 31  Reviewing the company bank statement, Clip'em Cliff
         discovers $350 of interest earned during the month of
         August that was previously uncollected and unrecorded.
         As a new customer for the bank, the interest was paid by a
         bank that offered an above-market-average interest rate.

Aug. 31  Unpaid and previously unrecorded income taxes for the
         month are $3,400. The tax payment was to cover his
         federal quarterly estimated income taxes. He lives in a
         state that does not have an individual income tax

Adjusting Transaction 1: Cliff took an inventory of supplies and
discovered that $250 of supplies remain unused at the end of
the month.

   Analysis:

 $250 of supplies remain at the end of August. The
   company began the month with $300 worth of supplies.
   Therefore, $50 of supplies were used during the month
   and must be recorded (300 - 250). Supplies is an asset that
   is decreasing (credit).

 Supplies is a type of prepaid expense, that when used,
   becomes an expense. Supplies Expense would increase
   (debit) for the $50 of supplies used during August.

244 | 1.17 Accounting Cycle Comprehensive Example
   Adjusting Transaction 2: The equipment purchased on
August 3 depreciated $2,500 during the month of August.

   Analysis:

   Equipment cost of $2,500 was allocated during August.
      This depreciation will affect the Accumulated
      Depreciation-Equipment account and the Depreciation
      Expense-Equipment account. While we are not doing
      depreciation calculations here, you will come across more
      complex calculations, such as depreciation in Long-Term
      Assets.

   Accumulated Depreciation-Equipment is a contra asset
      account (contrary to Equipment) and increases (credit) for
      $2,500.

   Depreciation Expense-Equipment is an expense account
      that is increasing (debit) for $2,500.

   Adjusting Transaction 3: Clip'em Cliff performed $1,100 of
services during August for the customer from the August 14
transaction.

                          1.17 Accounting Cycle Comprehensive Example | 245
   Analysis:

   The customer from the August 14 transaction gave the
      company $3,200 in advanced payment for services. By the
      end of August the company had earned $1,100 of the
      advanced payment. This means that the company still has
      yet to provide $2,100 in services to that customer.

   Since some of the unearned revenue is now earned,
      Unearned Revenue would decrease. Unearned Revenue is
      a liability account and decreases on the debit side.

   The company can now recognize the $1,100 as earned
      revenue. Service Revenue increases (credit) for $1,100.

   Adjusting Transaction 4: Reviewing the company bank
statement, Clip'em Cliff identifies $350 of interest earned
during the month of August that was previously unrecorded.

   Analysis:

   Interest is revenue for the company on money kept in a
      money market account at the bank. The company only
      sees the bank statement at the end of the month and
      needs to record as received interest revenue reflected on
      the bank statement.

   Interest Revenue is a revenue account that increases
      (credit) for $350.

   Since Clip'em Cliff has yet to collect this interest revenue, it
      is considered a receivable. Interest Receivable increases
      (debit) for $350.

246 | 1.17 Accounting Cycle Comprehensive Example
   Adjusting Transaction 5: Unpaid and previously unrecorded
income taxes for the month are $3,400.

   Analysis:
   Income taxes are an expense to the business that

      accumulate during the period but are only paid at
      predetermined times throughout the year. This period did
      not require payment but did accumulate income tax.
   Income Tax Expense is an expense account that negatively
      affects equity. Income Tax Expense increases on the debit
      side.
   The company owes the tax money but has not yet paid,
      signaling a liability. Income Tax Payable is a liability that is
      increasing on the credit side.

   The summary of adjusting journal entries for Clip'em Cliff is
presented in Figure 1.38.

                          1.17 Accounting Cycle Comprehensive Example | 247
Figure1.38 Adjusting Journal Entries for Clip'em Cliff. Rice University.

Now that all of the adjusting entries are journalized, they must
be posted to the ledger. Posting adjusting entries is the same
process as posting the general journal entries. Each journalized
account figure will transfer to the corresponding ledger
account on either the debit or credit side as illustrated in Figure
1.39.

Figure 1.39 Posting Ledger Entries for Clip'em Cliff. Rice University.
Source: Openstax CC BY NC-SA Long Description

We would normally use a general ledger, but for illustrative
purposes, we are using T-accounts to represent the ledgers.
The T-accounts after the adjusting entries are posted are
presented in Figure 1.40.

248 | 1.17 Accounting Cycle Comprehensive Example
Figure 1.40 Ledger Entries (in T-Accounts) for Clip'em Cliff. Rice
University. Source: Openstax CC BY NC-SA Long Description

You will notice that the sum of the asset account balances
equals the sum of the liability and equity account balances
at $80,875. The final debit or credit balance in each account

                          1.17 Accounting Cycle Comprehensive Example | 249
is transferred to the adjusted trial balance, the same way the
general ledger transferred to the unadjusted trial balance.

   The next step in the cycle is to prepare the adjusted trial
balance. Clip'em Cliff's adjusted trial balance is shown in Figure
1.41.

Figure 1.41 Adjusted Trial Balance for Clip'em Cliff. Rice University.
Source: Openstax CC BY NC-SA Long Description

The adjusted trial balance shows a debit and credit balance of
$94,150. Once the adjusted trial balance is prepared, Cliff can
prepare his financial statements (step 7 in the cycle). We only
prepare the income statement, statement of retained earnings,
and the balance sheet. The statement of cash flows is
discussed in detail in Statement of Cash Flows.
250 | 1.17 Accounting Cycle Comprehensive Example
   To prepare your financial statements, you want to work with
your adjusted trial balance.

   Remember, revenues and expenses go on an income
statement. Dividends, net income (loss), and retained earnings
balances go on the statement of retained earnings. On a
balance sheet you find assets, contra assets, liabilities, and
stockholders' equity accounts.

   The income statement for Clip'em Cliff is shown in Figure
1.42.

Figure 1.42 Adjusted Trial Balance for Clip'em Cliff. Rice University.
Source: Openstax CC BY NC-SA Long Description

Note that expenses were only $25 less than revenues. For the
first month of operations, Cliff welcomes any income. Cliff will
want to increase income in the next period to show growth for
investors and lenders.

   Next, Cliff prepares the following statement of retained
earnings (Figure 1.43).

                           1.17 Accounting Cycle Comprehensive Example | 251
Figure 1.43 Statement of Retained Earnings for Clip'em Cliff. Rice
University. Source: Openstax CC BY NC-SA Long Description

The beginning retained earnings balance is zero because Cliff
just began operations and does not have a balance to carry
over to a future period. The ending retained earnings balance
is -$125. You probably never want to have a negative value
on your retained earnings statement, but this situation is not
totally unusual for an organization in its initial operations. Cliff
will want to improve this outcome going forward. It might
make sense for Cliff to not pay dividends until he increases his
net income.

   Cliff then prepares the balance sheet for Clip'em Cliff as
shown in Figure 1.44.

252 | 1.17 Accounting Cycle Comprehensive Example
Figure 1.44 Balance Sheet for Clip'em Cliff. Rice University. Source:
Openstax CC BY NC-SA Long Description

The balance sheet shows total assets of $80,875, which equals
total liabilities and equity. Now that the financial statements
are complete, Cliff will go to the next step in the accounting
cycle, preparing and posting closing entries. To do this, Cliff
needs his adjusted trial balance information.

   Cliff will only close temporary accounts, which include
revenues, expenses, income summary, and dividends. The first
entry closes revenue accounts to income summary. To close
revenues, Cliff will debit revenue accounts and credit income
summary.

                           1.17 Accounting Cycle Comprehensive Example | 253
   The second entry closes expense accounts to income
summary. To close expenses, Cliff will credit expense accounts
and debit income summary.

   The third entry closes income summary to retained earnings.
To find the balance, take the difference between the income
summary amount in the first and second entries (10,650 -
10,625). To close income summary, Cliff would debit Income
Summary and credit Retained Earnings.

   The fourth closing entry closes dividends to retained
earnings. To close dividends, Cliff will credit Dividends, and
debit Retained Earnings.

   Once all of the closing entries are journalized, Cliff will post
this information to the ledger. The closed accounts with their
final balances, as well as Retained Earnings, are presented
in Figure 1.45.

254 | 1.17 Accounting Cycle Comprehensive Example
Figure 1.45 Closed Accounts with Final Balances for Clip'em Cliff.
Rice University. Source: Openstax CC BY NC-SA Long Description

Now that the temporary accounts are closed, they are ready for
accumulation in the next period.

   The last step for the month of August is step 9, preparing the
post-closing trial balance. The post-closing trial balance should
only contain permanent account information. No temporary
accounts should appear on this trial balance. Clip'em Cliff's
post-closing trial balance is presented in Figure 1.46.

                           1.17 Accounting Cycle Comprehensive Example | 255
Figure 1.46 Post-Closing Trial Balance for Clip'em Cliff. Rice

At this point, Cliff has completed the accounting cycle for
August. He is now ready to begin the process again for
September, and future periods.

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

Reversing Entries

One step in the accounting cycle that we did not cover is
reversing entries. Reversing entries can be made at the
beginning of a new period to certain accruals. The company
will reverse adjusting entries made in the prior period to the
revenue and expense accruals.

   It can be difficult to keep track of accruals from prior periods,

256 | 1.17 Accounting Cycle Comprehensive Example
as support documentation may not be readily available in
current or future periods. This requires an accountant to
remember when these accruals came from. By reversing these
accruals, there is a reduced risk for counting revenues and
expenses twice. The support documentation received in the
current or future period for an accrual will be easier to match to
prior revenues and expenses with the reversal.

2.1 Merchandisers v.
Service Providers

Every week, you run errands for your household. These errands
may include buying products and services from local retailers,
such as gas, groceries, and clothing. As a consumer, you are
focused solely on purchasing your items and getting home
to your family. You are probably not thinking about how your
purchases impact the businesses you frequent. Whether the
business is a service or a merchandising company, it tracks
sales from customers, purchases from manufacturers or other
suppliers, and costs that affect their everyday operations. There
are some key differences between these business types in the
manner and detail required for transaction recognition.

Comparison of Merchandising
Transactions versus Service Transactions

Some of the biggest differences between a service company
and a merchandising company are what they sell, their typical
financial transactions, their operating cycles, and how these
translate to financial statements.

   A service company provides intangible services to customers
and does not have inventory. Some examples of service
companies include lawyers, doctors, consultants, and
accountants. Service companies often have simple financial
transactions that involve taking customer deposits, billing
clients after services have been provided, providing the service,
and processing payments. These activities may occur

268 | 2.1 Merchandisers v. Service Providers
frequently within a company's accounting cycle and make up
a portion of the service company's operating cycle.

   An operating cycle is the amount of time it takes a company
to use its cash to provide a product or service and collect
payment from the customer. Completing this cycle faster puts
the company in a more stable financial position. A typical
operating cycle for a service company begins with having cash
available, providing service to a customer, and then receiving
cash from the customer for the service.

Firm. By: Rice University. Source: Openstax CC BY NC-SA

The income statement format is fairly simple as well. Revenues
(sales) are reported first, followed by any period operating
expenses. The outcome of sales less expenses, which is net
income (loss), is calculated from these accounts.

A merchandising company resells finished goods (inventory)

produced by a manufacturer (supplier) to customers. Some

examples  of  merchandising                   companies

include Walmart, Macy's, and Home Depot. Merchandising

companies have financial transactions that include:

purchasing merchandise, paying for merchandise, storing

inventory, selling merchandise, and collecting customer

payments. A typical operating cycle for a merchandising

company starts with having cash available, purchasing

inventory, selling the merchandise to customers, and finally

collecting payment from customers.

Note that unlike a service company, the merchandiser, also
sometimes labeled as a retailer, must first resolve any sale
reductions and merchandise costs, known as Cost of Goods
Sold, before determining other expenses and net income (loss).
A simple retailer income statement is shown in Figure 2.4 for
comparison.

Characteristics of Merchandising
Transactions

Merchandising transactions are separated into two categories:
purchases and sales. In general, a purchase transaction occurs
between a manufacturer and the merchandiser, also called
a retailer. A sales transaction occurs between a customer and
the merchandiser or retailer. We will now discuss the
characteristics that create purchase and sales transactions for
a retailer. A merchandiser will need to purchase merchandise
for its business to continue operations and can use several
purchase situations to accomplish this.

Purchases with Cash or on Credit

A retailer typically conducts business with a manufacturer or
with a supplier who buys from a manufacturer. The retailer will
purchase their finished goods for resale. When the purchase

272 | 2.1 Merchandisers v. Service Providers
occurs, the retailer may pay for the merchandise with cash or
on credit. If the retailer pays for the merchandise with cash,
they would be trading one current asset, Cash, for another
current asset, Merchandise Inventory or just Inventory,
depending upon the company's account titles. In this example,
they would record a debit entry to Merchandise Inventory and
a credit entry to Cash. If they decide to pay on credit, a liability
would be created, and Accounts Payable would be credited
rather than Cash. For example, a clothing store may pay a jeans
manufacturer cash for 50 pairs of jeans, costing $25 each. The
following entry would occur.

                                                                                        Figure 2.5

   If this same company decides to purchase merchandise on
credit, Accounts Payable is credited instead of Cash.

   Merchandise Inventory is a current asset account that houses
all purchase costs associated with the transaction. This
includes the cost of the merchandise, shipping charges,
insurance fees, taxes, and any other costs that gets the

                                         2.1 Merchandisers v. Service Providers | 273
products ready for sale. Gross purchases are defined as the
original amount of the purchase without considering
reductions for purchase discounts, returns, or allowances. Once
the purchase reductions are adjusted at the end of a period,
net purchases are calculated. Net purchases (see Figure 2.7)
equals gross purchases less purchase discounts, purchase
returns, and purchase allowances.

Purchases Deducting purchase discounts, returns, and allowances

Purchase Discounts

If a retailer, pays on credit, they will work out payment terms
with the manufacturer. These payment terms establish the
purchase cost, an invoice date, any discounts, shipping
charges, and the final payment due date.

   Purchase discounts provide an incentive for the retailer to
pay early on their accounts by offering a reduced rate on the
final purchase cost. Receiving payment in a timely manner
allows the manufacturer to free up cash for other business
opportunities and decreases the risk of nonpayment.

274 | 2.1 Merchandisers v. Service Providers
   To describe the discount terms, the manufacturer can write
descriptions such as 2/10, n/30 on the invoice. The "2"
represents a discount rate of 2%, the "10" represents the
discount period in days, and the "n/30" means "net of 30" days,
representing the entire payment period without a discount
application. So, "2/10, n/30" reads as, "The company will receive
a 2% discount on their purchase if they pay in 10 days.
Otherwise, they have 30 days from the date of the sale to pay in
full, no discount received." In some cases, if the retailer exceeds
the full payment period (30 days in this example), the
manufacturer may charge interest as a penalty for late
payment. The number of days allowed for both the discount
period and the full payment period begins counting from the
invoice date.

   If a merchandiser pays an invoice within the discount period,
they receive a discount, which affects the cost of the inventory.
Let's say a retailer pays within the discount window. They would
need to show a credit to the Merchandise Inventory account,
recognizing the decreased final cost of the merchandise. This
aligns with the cost principle, which requires a company to
record an asset's value at the cost of acquisition. In addition,
since cash is used to pay the manufacturer, Cash is credited.
The debit to Accounts Payable does not reflect the discount
taken: it reflects fulfillment of the liability in full, and the credits
to Merchandise Inventory and Cash reflect the discount taken,
as demonstrated in the following example.

   If the retailer does not pay within the discount window, they
do not receive a discount but are still required to pay the full
invoice price at the end of the term. In this case, Accounts
Payable is debited and Cash is credited, but no reductions are
made to Merchandise Inventory.

   For example, suppose a kitchen appliances retailer purchases
merchandise for their store from a manufacturer on
September 1 in the amount of $1,600. Credit terms are 2/10, n/
30 from the invoice date of September 1. The retailer makes

                                         2.1 Merchandisers v. Service Providers | 275
payment on September 5 and receives the discount. The
following entry occurs.

Figure 2.8 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY NC-SA 4.0

   Let's consider the same situation except the retailer did not
make the discount window and paid in full on September 30.
The entry would recognize the following instead.

Figure 2.9 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY NC-SA 4.0

   There are two kinds of purchase discounts, cash discounts
and trade discounts. Cash discount provides a discount on the
final price after purchase if a retailer pays within a discount
window. On the other hand, a trade discount is a reduction
to the advertised manufacturer's price that occurs during
negotiations of a final purchase price before the inventory is
purchased. The trade discount may become larger if the
retailer purchases more in one transaction. While the cash
discount is recognized in journal entries, a trade discount is not,
since it is negotiated before purchase.

   For example, assume that a retailer is considering an order
for $4,000 in inventory on September 1. The manufacturer

276 | 2.1 Merchandisers v. Service Providers
offers the retailer a 15% discount on the price if they place
the order by September 5. Assume that the retailer places the
$4,000 order on September 3. The purchase price would be
$4,000 less the 15% discount of $600, or $3,400. Since the trade
discount is based on when the order was placed and not on any
potential payment discounts, the initial journal entry to record
the purchase would reflect the discounted amount of $3,400.
Even if the retailer receives a trade discount, they may still be
eligible for an additional purchase discount if they pay within
the discount window of the invoice.

Purchase Returns and Allowances

If a retailer is unhappy with their purchase--for example, if
the order is incorrect or if the products are damaged--they
may receive a partial or full refund from the manufacturer in
a purchase returns and allowances transaction. A purchase
return occurs when merchandise is returned and a full refund
is issued. A purchase allowance occurs when merchandise is
kept and a partial refund is issued. In either case, a
manufacturer will issue a debit memo to acknowledge the
change in contract terms and the reduction in the amount
owed.

   To recognize a return or allowance, the retailer will reduce
Accounts Payable (or increase Cash) and reduce Merchandise
Inventory. Accounts Payable decreases if the retailer has yet to
pay on their account, and Cash increases if they had already
paid and received a subsequent refund. Merchandise Inventory

                                         2.1 Merchandisers v. Service Providers | 277
decreases to show the reduction of inventory cost from the
retailer's inventory stock. Note that if a retailer receives a refund
before they make a payment, any discount taken must be from
the new cost of the merchandise less the refund.

   To illustrate, assume that Carter Candle Company received a
shipment from a manufacturer that had 150 candles that cost
$150. Assume that they have not yet paid for these candles and
100 of the candles are badly damaged and must be returned.
The other 50 candles are marketable, but are not the right style.
The candle company returned the 100 defective candles for a
full refund and requested and received an allowance of $20 for
the 50 improper candles they kept. The first entry shows the
return and the second entry shows the allowance.

                                                                                        Figure 2.11

                                                                                        University
                                                                                        Source:
                                                                                        Openstax
                                                                                        CC BY
                                                                                        NC-SA 4.0

   It is possible to show these entries as one, since they affect
the same accounts and were requested at the same time. From
a manager's standpoint, though, it may be better to record
these as separate transactions to better understand the
specific reasons for the reduction to inventory (either return or
allowance) and restocking needs.

Characteristics of Sales Transactions

Business owners may encounter several sales situations that
can help meet customer needs and control inventory

278 | 2.1 Merchandisers v. Service Providers
operations. For example, some customers will expect the
opportunity to buy using short-term credit and often will
assume that they will receive a discount for paying within a
brief period. The mechanics of sales discounts are
demonstrated later in this section.

Sales with Cash or on Credit

As previously mentioned, a sale is usually considered a
transaction between a merchandiser or retailer and a
customer. When a sale occurs, a customer has the option to
pay with cash or credit. For our purposes, let's consider "credit"
as credit extended from the business directly to the customer.

   Whether or not a customer pays with cash or credit, a
business must record two accounting entries. One entry
recognizes the sale and the other recognizes the cost of the
sale. The sales entry consists of a debit to either Cash or
Accounts Receivable (if paying on credit), and a credit to the
revenue account, Sales.

   The amount recorded in the Sales account is the gross
amount. Gross sales is the original amount of the sale without
factoring in any possible reductions for discounts, returns, or
allowances. Once those reductions are recorded at the end
of a period, net sales are calculated. Net sales (see Figure 2.12)
equals gross sales less sales discounts, sales returns, and sales
allowances. Recording the sale as it occurs allows the company
to align with the revenue recognition principle. The revenue
recognition principle requires companies to record revenue
when it is earned, and revenue is earned when a product or
service has been provided.

                                         2.1 Merchandisers v. Service Providers | 279

The second accounting entry that is made during a sale
describes the cost of sales. The cost of sales entry includes
decreasing Merchandise Inventory and increasing Cost of
Goods Sold (COGS). The decrease to Merchandise Inventory
reflects the reduction in the inventory account value due to
the sold merchandise. The increase to COGS represents the
expense associated with the sale. The cost of goods sold
(COGS) is an expense account that houses all costs associated
with getting the product ready for sale. This could include
purchase costs, shipping, taxes, insurance, stocking fees, and
overhead related to preparing the product for sale. By
recording the cost of sale when the sale occurs, the company
aligns with the matching principle. The matching
principle requires companies to match revenues generated
with related expenses in the period in which they are incurred.

   For example, when a shoe store sells 150 pairs of athletic
cleats to a local baseball league for $1,500 (cost of $900), the
league may pay with cash or credit. If the baseball league elects
to pay with cash, the shoe store would debit Cash as part of

280 | 2.1 Merchandisers v. Service Providers
the sales entry. If the baseball league decides to use a line
of credit extended by the shoe store, the shoe store would
debit Accounts Receivable as part of the sales entry instead of
Cash. With the sales entry, the shoe store must also recognize
the $900 cost of the shoes sold and the $900 reduction in
Merchandise Inventory.

                                                                                        Figure 2.13

                                                                                        Source:
                                                                                        Openstax
                                                                                        CC BY
                                                                                        NC-SA 4.0

   You may have noticed that sales tax has not been discussed
as part of the sales entry. Sales taxes are liabilities that require
a portion of every sales dollar be remitted to a government
entity. This would reduce the amount of cash the company
keeps after the sale. Sales tax is relevant to consumer sales and
is discussed later in the course.

   There are a few transactional situations that may occur after
a sale is made that have an effect on reported sales at the end
of a period.

Sales Discounts

Sales discounts are incentives given to customers to entice
them to pay off their accounts early. Why would a retailer offer
this? Wouldn't they rather receive the entire amount owed?
The discount serves several purposes that are similar to the
rationale manufacturers consider when offering discounts to
retailers. It can help solidify a long-term relationship with the
customer, encourage the customer to purchase more, and

                                         2.1 Merchandisers v. Service Providers | 281
decreases the time it takes for the company to see a liquid
asset (cash). Cash can be used for other purposes immediately
such as reinvesting in the business, paying down loans quicker,
and distributing dividends to shareholders. This can help grow
the business at a more rapid rate.

   Similar to credit terms between a retailer and a
manufacturer, a customer could see credit terms offered by the
retailer in the form of 2/10, n/30. This particular example shows
that if a customer pays their account within 10 days, they will
receive a 2% discount. Otherwise, they have 30 days to pay in
full but do not receive a discount. If the customer does not
pay within the discount window, but pays within 30 days, the
retailing company records a credit to Accounts Receivable, and
a debit to Cash for the full amount stated on the invoice. If
the customer is able to pay the account within the discount
window, the company records a credit to Accounts Receivable,
a debit to Cash, and a debit to Sales Discounts.

   The sales discounts account is a contra revenue account that
is deducted from gross sales at the end of a period in the
calculation of net sales. Sales Discounts has a normal debit
balance, which offsets Sales that has a normal credit balance.

   Let's assume that a customer purchased 10 emergency kits
from a retailer at $100 per kit on credit. The retailer offered the
customer 2/10, n/30 terms, and the customer paid within the

   Since the retailer doesn't know at the point of sale whether or
not the customer will qualify for the sales discount, the entire
account receivable of $1,000 is recorded on the retailer's
journal.

example were $560 and we are using the perpetual inventory
method. The journal entry to record the sale of the inventory
follows the entry for the sale to the customer.

   Please note that the entire $1,000 account receivable created
is eliminated under both payment options. When the discount
is missed, the retail received the entire $1,000. However, when
the discount was received by the customer, the retailer
received $980, and the remaining $20 is recorded in the sales
discount account.

Sales Returns and Allowances

If a customer purchases merchandise and is dissatisfied with
their purchase, they may receive a refund or a partial refund,
depending on the situation. When the customer returns
merchandise and receives a full refund, it is considered a sales
return. When the customer keeps the defective merchandise
and is given a partial refund, it is considered a sales allowance.
The biggest difference is that a customer returns merchandise
in a sales return and keeps the merchandise in a sales
allowance.

   When a customer returns the merchandise, a retailer issues
a credit memo to acknowledge the change in contract and
reduction to Accounts Receivable, if applicable. The retailer
records an entry acknowledging the return by reducing either
Cash or Accounts Receivable and increasing Sales Returns and
Allowances. Cash would decrease if the customer had already
paid for the merchandise and cash was thus refunded to the

284 | 2.1 Merchandisers v. Service Providers
customer. Accounts Receivable would decrease if the customer
had not yet paid on their account. Like Sales Discounts,
the sales returns and allowances account is a contra revenue
account with a normal debit balance that reduces the gross
sales figure at the end of the period.

   Beyond recording the return, the retailer must also
determine if the returned merchandise is in "sellable
condition." An item is in sellable condition if the merchandise
is good enough to warrant a sale to another customer in the
future. If so, the company would record a decrease to Cost of
Goods Sold (COGS) and an increase to Merchandise Inventory
to return the merchandise back to the inventory for resale. This
is recorded at the merchandise's costs of goods sold value. If
the merchandise is in sellable condition but will not realize the
original cost of the good, the company must estimate the loss
at this time.

   On the other hand, when the merchandise is returned and is
not in sellable condition, the retailer must estimate the value of
the merchandise in its current condition and record a loss. This
would increase Merchandise Inventory for the assessed value
of the merchandise in its current state, decrease COGS for the
original expense amount associated with the sale, and increase
Loss on Defective Merchandise for the unsellable merchandise
lost value.

   For both the return and the allowance, if the customer had
already paid their account in full, Cash would be affected rather
than Accounts Receivable.

   There are differing opinions as to whether sales returns and
allowances should be in separate accounts. Separating the
accounts would help a retailer distinguish between items that
are returned and those that the customer kept. This can better
identify quality control issues, track whether a customer was
satisfied with their purchase, and report how many resources
are spent on processing returns. Most companies choose to
combine returns and allowances into one account, but from a
manager's perspective, it may be easier to have the accounts
separated to make current determinations about inventory.

customer pays with a credit or debit card from a third-party,

2.2 Perpetual v.
Periodic Inventory
Systems

   There are two ways in which a company may account for
their inventory. They can use a perpetual or periodic inventory
system. Let's look at the characteristics of these two systems.

Characteristics of the Perpetual and
Periodic Inventory Systems

A perpetual inventory system automatically updates and
records the inventory account every time a sale, or purchase of
inventory, occurs. You can consider this "recording as you go."
The recognition of each sale or purchase happens immediately
upon sale or purchase.

   A periodic inventory system updates and records the
inventory account at certain, scheduled times at the end of an
operating cycle. The update and recognition could occur at the
end of the month, quarter, and year. There is a gap between the
sale or purchase of inventory and when the inventory activity is
recognized.

   Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) do not
state a required inventory system, but the periodic inventory
system uses a Purchases account to meet the requirements
for recognition under GAAP. IFRS requirements are very similar.
The main difference is that assets are valued at net realizable
value and can be increased or decreased as values change.

                                2.2 Perpetual v. Periodic Inventory Systems | 289
Under GAAP, once values are reduced they cannot be
increased again.

Inventory Systems Comparison

There are some key differences between perpetual and
periodic inventory systems. When a company uses the
perpetual inventory system and makes a purchase, they will
automatically update the Merchandise Inventory account.
Under a periodic inventory system, Purchases will be updated,
while Merchandise Inventory will remain unchanged until the
company counts and verifies its inventory balance. This count
and verification typically occur at the end of the annual
accounting period, which is often on December 31 of the year.
The Merchandise Inventory account balance is reported on the
balance sheet while the Purchases account is reported on the
Income Statement when using the periodic inventory method.

   A purchase return or allowance under perpetual inventory
systems updates Merchandise Inventory for any decreased
cost. Under periodic inventory systems, a temporary account,
Purchase Returns and Allowances, is updated. Purchase
Returns and Allowances is a contra account and is used to
reduce Purchases.

   When a purchase discount is applied under a perpetual
inventory system, Merchandise Inventory decreases for the
discount amount. Under a periodic inventory system, Purchase
Discounts (a temporary, contra account), increases for the
discount amount and Merchandise Inventory remains
unchanged.

   When a sale occurs under perpetual inventory systems, two
entries are required: one to recognize the sale, and the other
to recognize the cost of sale. For the cost of sale, Merchandise
Inventory and Cost of Goods Sold are updated. Under periodic
inventory systems, this cost of sale entry does not exist. The

period when adjustments are made and temporary accounts

   When a sales return occurs, perpetual inventory systems
require recognition of the inventory's condition. This means a
decrease to COGS and an increase to Merchandise Inventory.
Under periodic inventory systems, only the sales return is
recognized, but not the inventory condition entry.

Adjusting and Closing Entries for a
Perpetual Inventory System

You have already explored adjusting entries and the closing
process in prior discussions, but merchandising activities
require additional adjusting and closing entries to inventory,
sales discounts, returns, and allowances. Here, we'll briefly
discuss these additional closing entries and adjustments as
they relate to the perpetual inventory system.

   At the end of the period, a perpetual inventory system will
have the Merchandise Inventory account up-to-date; the only

                                 2.2 Perpetual v. Periodic Inventory Systems | 295
thing left to do is to compare a physical count of inventory
to what is on the books. A physical inventory count requires
companies to do a manual "stock-check" of inventory to make
sure what they have recorded on the books matches what
they physically have in stock. Differences could occur due to
mismanagement, shrinkage, damage, or outdated
merchandise. Shrinkage is a term used when inventory or
other assets disappear without an identifiable reason, such as
theft. For a perpetual inventory system, the adjusting entry to
show this difference follows. This example assumes that the
merchandise inventory is overstated in the accounting records
and needs to be adjusted downward to reflect the actual value
on hand.

If a physical count determines that merchandise inventory is
understated in the accounting records, Merchandise Inventory
would need to be increased with a debit entry and the COGS
would be reduced with a credit entry. The adjusting entry is:

To sum up the potential adjustment process, after the
merchandise inventory has been verified with a physical count,
its book value is adjusted upward or downward to reflect the
actual inventory on hand, with an accompanying adjustment
to the COGS.

   Not only must an adjustment to Merchandise Inventory
occur at the end of a period, but closure of temporary
merchandising accounts to prepare them for the next period
is required. Temporary accounts requiring closure are Sales,
Sales Discounts, Sales Returns and Allowances, and Cost of
Goods Sold. Sales will close with the temporary credit balance
accounts to Income Summary.

Note that for a periodic inventory system, the end of the period
adjustments require an update to COGS. To determine the
value of Cost of Goods Sold, the business will have to look at the

298 | 2.2 Perpetual v. Periodic Inventory Systems
beginning inventory balance, purchases, purchase returns and
allowances, discounts, and the ending inventory balance.

   The formula to compute COGS is:

where:

Once the COGS balance has been established, an adjustment is
made to Merchandise Inventory and COGS, and COGS is closed
to prepare for the next period.

   Table 2.1 summarizes the differences between the perpetual
and periodic inventory systems.

There are advantages and disadvantages to both the perpetual
and periodic inventory systems.

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

Point-of-Sale Systems

Advancements in point-of-sale (POS) systems have simplified
the once tedious task of inventory management. POS systems
connect with inventory management programs to make real-
time data available to help streamline business operations. The
cost of inventory management decreases with this connection

300 | 2.2 Perpetual v. Periodic Inventory Systems
tool, allowing all businesses to stay current with technology
without "breaking the bank."

   One such POS system is Square. Square accepts many
payment types and updates accounting records every time a
sale occurs through a cloud-based application. Square, Inc. has
expanded their product offerings to include Square for Retail
POS. This enhanced product allows businesses to connect sales
and inventory costs immediately. A business can easily create
purchase orders, develop reports for cost of goods sold,
manage inventory stock, and update discounts, returns, and
allowances. With this application, customers have payment
flexibility, and businesses can make present decisions to
positively affect growth.

Advantages and Disadvantages of the
Perpetual Inventory System

The perpetual inventory system gives real-time updates and
keeps a constant flow of inventory information available for
decision-makers. With advancements in point-of-sale
technologies, inventory is updated automatically and
transferred into the company's accounting system. This allows
managers to make decisions as it relates to inventory
purchases, stocking, and sales. The information can be more
robust, with exact purchase costs, sales prices, and dates
known. Although a periodic physical count of inventory is still
required, a perpetual inventory system may reduce the
number of times physical counts are needed.

   The biggest disadvantages of using the perpetual inventory
systems arise from the resource constraints for cost and time.
It is costly to keep an automatic inventory system up-to-date.
This may prohibit smaller or less established companies from
investing in the required technologies. The time commitment

                                 2.2 Perpetual v. Periodic Inventory Systems | 301
to train and retrain staff to update inventory is considerable.
In addition, since there are fewer physical counts of inventory,
the figures recorded in the system may be drastically different
from inventory levels in the actual warehouse. A company may
not have correct inventory stock and could make financial
decisions based on incorrect data.

Advantages and Disadvantages of the
Periodic Inventory System

The periodic inventory system is often less expensive and time
consuming than perpetual inventory systems. This is because
there is no constant maintenance of inventory records or
training and retraining of employees to upkeep the system. The
complexity of the system makes it difficult to identify the cost
justification associated with the inventory function.

   While both the periodic and perpetual inventory systems
require a physical count of inventory, periodic inventorying
requires more physical counts to be conducted. This updates
the inventory account more frequently to record exact costs.
Knowing the exact costs earlier in an accounting cycle can help
a company stay on budget and control costs.

   However, the need for frequent physical counts of inventory
can suspend business operations each time this is done. There
are more chances for shrinkage, damaged, or obsolete
merchandise because inventory is not constantly monitored.
Since there is no constant monitoring, it may be more difficult
to make in-the-moment business decisions about inventory
needs.

   While each inventory system has its own advantages and
disadvantages, the more popular system is the perpetual
inventory system. The ability to have real-time data to make
decisions, the constant update to inventory, and the

302 | 2.2 Perpetual v. Periodic Inventory Systems
integration to point-of-sale systems, outweigh the cost and
time investments needed to maintain the system.

2.3 Purchases of
Merchandise-
Perpetual System

The following example transactions and subsequent journal
entries for merchandise purchases are recognized using
a perpetual inventory system. The periodic inventory system
recognition of these example transactions and corresponding
journal entries will be studied in more advanced accounting
courses.

Basic Analysis of Purchase Transaction
Journal Entries

To better illustrate merchandising activities, let's follow
California Business Solutions (CBS), a retailer providing
electronic hardware packages to meet small business needs.
Each electronics hardware package (see Figure 2.33) contains
a desktop computer, tablet computer, landline telephone, and
a 4-in-1 desktop printer with a printer, copier, scanner, and fax
machine.

The following are the per-item purchase prices from the
manufacturer.

Cash and Credit Purchase Transaction
Journal Entries

On April 1, CBS purchases 10 electronic hardware packages at
a cost of $620 each. CBS has enough cash-on-hand to pay
immediately with cash. The following entry occurs.

Figure 2.35 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY 2.0

Merchandise Inventory-Packages increases (debit) for 6,200
($620  10), and Cash decreases (credit) because the company
paid with cash. It is important to distinguish each inventory
item type to better track inventory needs.

   On April 7, CBS purchases 30 desktop computers on credit at
a cost of $400 each. The credit terms are n/15 with an invoice
date of April 7. The following entry occurs.

Figure 2.36 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY 2.0

Merchandise Inventory is specific to desktop computers and is
increased (debited) for the value of the computers by $12,000
($400  30). Since the computers were purchased on credit by
CBS, Accounts Payable increases (credit).

   On April 17, CBS makes full payment on the amount due from
the April 7 purchase. The following entry occurs.

306 | 2.3 Purchases of Merchandise- Perpetual System
Figure 2.37 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY 2.0

Accounts Payable decreases (debit), and Cash decreases
(credit) for the full amount owed. The credit terms were n/15,
which is net due in 15 days. No discount was offered with this
transaction. Thus the full payment of $12,000 occurs.

Purchase Discount Transaction Journal
Entries

On May 1, CBS purchases 67 tablet computers at a cost of
$60 each on credit. The payment terms are 5/10, n/30, and the
invoice is dated May 1. The following entry occurs.

Figure 2.38 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY 2.0

                       2.3 Purchases of Merchandise- Perpetual System | 307
Merchandise Inventory-Tablet Computers increases (debit) in
the amount of $4,020 (67  $60). Accounts Payable also
increases (credit) but the credit terms are a little different than
the previous example. These credit terms include a discount
opportunity (5/10), meaning, CBS has 10 days from the invoice
date to pay on their account to receive a 5% discount on their
purchase.

   On May 10, CBS pays their account in full. The following entry
occurs.

Figure 2.39 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY 2.0

Accounts Payable decreases (debit) for the original amount
owed of $4,020 before any discounts are taken. Since CBS paid
on May 10, they made the 10-day window and thus received a
discount of 5%. Cash decreases (credit) for the amount owed,
less the discount. Merchandise Inventory-Tablet Computers
decreases (credit) for the amount of the discount ($4,020 
5%). Merchandise Inventory decreases to align with the Cost
Principle, reporting the value of the merchandise at the
reduced cost.

   Let's take the same example purchase with the same credit
terms, but now CBS paid their account on May 25. The
following entry would occur instead.

Figure 2.40 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY 2.0

308 | 2.3 Purchases of Merchandise- Perpetual System
Accounts Payable decreases (debit) and Cash decreases
(credit) for $4,020. The company paid on their account outside
of the discount window but within the total allotted timeframe
for payment. CBS does not receive a discount in this case but
does pay in full and on time.

Purchase Returns and Allowances
Transaction Journal Entries

On June 1, CBS purchased 300 landline telephones with cash
at a cost of $60 each. On June 3, CBS discovers that 25 of the
phones are the wrong color and returns the phones to the
manufacturer for a full refund. The following entries occur with
the purchase and subsequent return.

Figure 2.41 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY 2.0

Both Merchandise Inventory-Phones increases (debit) and
Cash decreases (credit) by $18,000 ($60  300).

Figure 2.42 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY 2.0

Since CBS already paid in full for their purchase, a full cash
refund is issued. This increases Cash (debit) and decreases

                       2.3 Purchases of Merchandise- Perpetual System | 309
(credit) Merchandise Inventory-Phones because the
merchandise has been returned to the manufacturer or
supplier.

   On June 8, CBS discovers that 60 more phones from the
June 1 purchase are slightly damaged. CBS decides to keep
the phones but receives a purchase allowance from the
manufacturer of $8 per phone. The following entry occurs for
the allowance.

Figure 2.43 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY 2.0

Since CBS already paid in full for their purchase, a cash refund
of the allowance is issued in the amount of $480 (60  $8).
This increases Cash (debit) and decreases (credit) Merchandise
Inventory-Phones because the merchandise is less valuable
than before the damage discovery.

   CBS purchases 80 units of the 4-in-1 desktop printers at a
cost of $100 each on July 1 on credit. Terms of the purchase
are 5/15, n/40, with an invoice date of July 1. On July 6, CBS
discovers 15 of the printers are damaged and returns them to
the manufacturer for a full refund. The following entries show
the purchase and subsequent return.

Figure 2.44 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY 2.0

310 | 2.3 Purchases of Merchandise- Perpetual System
Both Merchandise Inventory-Printers increases (debit) and
Accounts Payable increases (credit) by $8,000 ($100  80).

Figure 2.45 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY 2.0

Both Accounts Payable decreases (debit) and Merchandise
Inventory-Printers decreases (credit) by $1,500 (15  $100). The
purchase was on credit and the return occurred before
payment, thus decreasing Accounts Payable. Merchandise
Inventory decreases due to the return of the merchandise back
to the manufacturer.

   On July 10, CBS discovers that 4 more printers from the July 1
purchase are slightly damaged but decides to keep them, with
the manufacturer issuing an allowance of $30 per printer. The
following entry recognizes the allowance.

Figure 2.46 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY 2.0

Both Accounts Payable decreases (debit) and Merchandise
Inventory-Printers decreases (credit) by $120 (4  $30). The
purchase was on credit and the allowance occurred before
payment, thus decreasing Accounts Payable. Merchandise
Inventory decreases due to the loss in value of the
merchandise.

   On July 15, CBS pays their account in full, less purchase
returns and allowances. The following payment entry occurs.

                         2.3 Purchases of Merchandise- Perpetual System | 311
Figure 2.47 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY 2.0

Accounts Payable decreases (debit) for the amount owed, less
the return of $1,500 and the allowance of $120 ($8,000 - $1,500 -
$120). Since CBS paid on July 15, they made the 15-day window,
thus receiving a discount of 5%. Cash decreases (credit) for
the amount owed, less the discount. Merchandise Inventory-
Printers decreases (credit) for the amount of the discount
($6,380  5%). Merchandise Inventory decreases to align with
the Cost Principle, reporting the value of the merchandise at
the reduced cost.

Note that Figure 2.48 considers an environment in which
inventory physical counts and matching books records align.
This is not always the case given concerns with shrinkage
(theft), damages, or obsolete merchandise. In this
circumstance, an adjustment is recorded to inventory to
account for the differences between the physical count and the
amount represented on the books.

discovers that 40 of the phones are the wrong color and
returns the phones to CBS in exchange for a full refund. CBS
determines that the returned merchandise can be resold and
returns the merchandise to inventory at its original cost. The
following entries occur for the sale and subsequent return.

(250  $60), the cost of the sale.

Figure 2.59 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY NC-SA 4.0

Since the customer already paid in full for their purchase, a
full cash refund is issued on September 3. This increases Sales
Returns and Allowances (debit) and decreases Cash (credit) by
$6,000 (40  $150). The second entry on September 3 returns

                                2.4 Sales of Merchandise- Perpetual System | 321
the phones back to inventory for CBS because they have
determined the merchandise is in sellable condition at its
original cost. Merchandise Inventory-Phones increases (debit)
and COGS decreases (credit) by $2,400 (40  $60).

   On September 8, the customer discovers that 20 more
phones from the September 1 purchase are slightly damaged.
The customer decides to keep the phones but receives a sales
allowance from CBS of $10 per phone. The following entry
occurs for the allowance.

Figure 2.60 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY NC-SA 4.0

Since the customer already paid in full for their purchase, a
cash refund of the allowance is issued in the amount of $200
(20  $10). This increases (debit) Sales Returns and Allowances
and decreases (credit) Cash. CBS does not have to consider
the condition of the merchandise or return it to their inventory
because the customer keeps the merchandise.

   A customer purchases 55 units of the 4-in-1 desktop printers
on October 1 on credit. Terms of the sale are 10  15, n  40,
with an invoice date of October 1. On October 6, the customer
returned 10 of the printers to CBS for a full refund. CBS returns
the printers to their inventory at the original cost. The following
entries show the sale and subsequent return.

sales price of the printers. Accounts Receivable is used instead
of Cash because the customer purchased on credit. In the
second entry, COGS increases (debit) and Merchandise
Inventory-Printers decreases (credit) by $5,500 (55  $100), the
cost of the sale.

(10  $350). The second entry on October 6 returns the printers
back to inventory for CBS because they have determined the
merchandise is in sellable condition at its original cost.
Merchandise Inventory-Printers increases (debit) and COGS
decreases (credit) by $1,000 (10  $100).

   On October 10, the customer discovers that 5 printers from
the October 1 purchase are slightly damaged, but decides to
keep them, and CBS issues an allowance of $60 per printer. The
following entry recognizes the allowance.

Sales Returns and Allowances increases (debit) and Accounts
Receivable decreases (credit) by $300 (5  $60). A reduction to
Accounts Receivable occurs because the customer has yet to
pay their account on October 10. CBS does not have to consider
the condition of the merchandise or return it to their inventory
because the customer keeps the merchandise.

   On October 15, the customer pays their account in full, less
sales returns and allowances. The following payment entry
occurs.

Figure 2.64 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY NC-SA 4.0

Accounts Receivable decreases (credit) for the original amount
owed, less the return of $3,500 and the allowance of $300
($19,250 - $3,500 - $300). Since the customer paid on October
15, they made the 15-day window, thus receiving a discount of
10%. Sales Discounts increases (debit) for the discount amount
($15,450  10%). Cash increases (debit) for the amount owed to
CBS, less the discount.

2.5 Shipping Terms

When you buy merchandise online, shipping charges are
usually one of the negotiated terms of the sale. As a consumer,
anytime the business pays for shipping, it is welcomed. For
businesses, shipping charges bring both benefits and
challenges, and the terms negotiated can have a significant
impact on inventory operations.

costs. Guida Siebert Dairy Milk Delivery Truck tractor trailer! By: Mike

Shipping is determined by contract terms between a buyer
and seller. There are several key factors to consider when
determining who pays for shipping, and how it is recognized
in merchandising transactions. The establishment of a transfer
point and ownership indicates who pays the shipping charges,
who is responsible for the merchandise, on whose balance
sheet the assets would be recorded, and how to record the
transaction for the buyer and seller.

   Ownership of inventory refers to which party owns the
inventory at a particular point in time--the buyer or the seller.

328 | 2.5 Shipping Terms
One particularly important point in time is the point of transfer,
when the responsibility for the inventory transfers from the
seller to the buyer. Establishing ownership of inventory is
important to determine who pays the shipping charges when
the goods are in transit as well as the responsibility of each
party when the goods are in their possession. Goods in
transit refers to the time in which the merchandise is
transported from the seller to the buyer (by way of delivery
truck, for example). One party is responsible for the goods in
transit and the costs associated with transportation.
Determining whether this responsibility lies with the buyer or
seller is critical to determining the reporting requirements of
the retailer or merchandiser.

   Freight-in refers to the shipping costs for which the buyer
is responsible when receiving shipment from a seller, such as
delivery and insurance expenses. When the buyer is
responsible for shipping costs, they recognize this as part of
the purchase cost. This means that the shipping costs stay with
the inventory until it is sold. The cost principle requires this
expense to stay with the merchandise as it is part of getting the
item ready for sale from the buyer's perspective. The shipping
expenses are held in inventory until sold, which means these
costs are reported on the balance sheet in Merchandise
Inventory. When the merchandise is sold, the shipping charges
are transferred with all other inventory costs to Cost of Goods
Sold on the income statement.

   For example, California Business Solutions (CBS) may
purchase 30 computers from a manufacturer for $80 and part
of the agreement is that CBS (the buyer) pays the shipping
costs of $1,000. CBS would record the following entry to
recognize the purchase of the goods and the freight-in.

                                                                    2.5 Shipping Terms | 329
Figure 2.68 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Merchandise Inventory increases (debit), and Cash decreases
(credit), for the entire cost of the purchase, including shipping,
insurance, and taxes. On the balance sheet, the shipping
charges would remain a part of inventory.

   Freight-out refers to the costs for which the seller is
responsible when shipping to a buyer, such as delivery and
insurance expenses. When the seller is responsible for shipping
costs, they recognize this as a delivery expense. The delivery
expense is specifically associated with selling and not daily
operations; thus, delivery expenses are typically recorded as a
selling and administrative expense on the income statement in
the current period.

   For example, CBS may sell electronics packages to a
customer and agree to cover the $100 cost associated with
shipping and insurance. CBS would record the following entry
to recognize freight-out.

Figure 2.69 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Delivery Expense increases (debit) and Cash decreases (credit)
for the shipping cost amount of $100. On the income

330 | 2.5 Shipping Terms
statement, this $100 delivery expense will be grouped with
Selling and Administrative expenses.

Free on Board (FOB) Shipping and
Destination

Transportation costs are commonly assigned to either the
buyer or the seller based on the free on board (FOB) terms, as
the terms relate to the seller. Transportation costs are part of
the responsibilities of the owner of the product, so determining
the owner at the shipping point identifies who should pay for
the shipping costs. The seller's responsibility and ownership
of the goods ends at the point that is listed after the FOB
designation. Thus, FOB shipping point means that the seller
transfers title and responsibility to the buyer at the shipping
point, so the buyer would owe the shipping costs. The
purchased goods would be recorded on the buyer's balance
sheet at this point.

   Similarly, FOB destination means the seller transfers title and
responsibility to the buyer at the destination, so the seller
would owe the shipping costs. Ownership of the product is
the trigger that mandates that the asset be included on the
company's balance sheet. In summary, the goods belong to the
seller until they transition to the location following the term
FOB, making the seller responsible for everything about the
goods to that point, including recording purchased goods on
the balance sheet . If something happens to damage or destroy
the goods before they reach the FOB location, the seller would
be required to replace the product or reverse the sales
transaction.

                                                                     2.5 Shipping Terms | 331

Discussion and Application of FOB
Destination

As you've learned, the seller and buyer will establish terms of
purchase that include the purchase price, taxes, insurance, and
shipping charges. So, who pays for shipping? On the purchase
contract, shipping terms establish who owns inventory in
transit, the point of transfer, and who pays for shipping. The
shipping terms are known as "free on board," or simply FOB.
Some refer to FOB as the point of transfer, but really, it
incorporates more than simply the point at which
responsibility transfers. There are two FOB considerations: FOB
Destination and FOB Shipping Point.

   If FOB destination point is listed on the purchase contract,
this means the seller pays the shipping charges (freight-out).
This also means goods in transit belong to, and are the
responsibility of, the seller. The point of transfer is when the
goods reach the buyer's place of business.

   To illustrate, suppose CBS sells 30 landline telephones at $150
each on credit at a cost of $60 per phone. On the sales contract,
FOB Destination is listed as the shipping terms, and shipping
charges amount to $120, paid as cash directly to the delivery
service. The following entries occur.

332 | 2.5 Shipping Terms
Figure 2.70 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Accounts Receivable (debit) and Sales (credit) increases for the
amount of the sale (30  $150). Cost of Goods Sold increases
(debit) and Merchandise Inventory decreases (credit) for the
cost of sale (30  $60). Delivery Expense increases (debit) and
Cash decreases (credit) for the delivery charge of $120.

Discussion and Application of FOB
Shipping Point

If FOB shipping point is listed on the purchase contract, this
means the buyer pays the shipping charges (freight-in). This
also means goods in transit belong to, and are the
responsibility of, the buyer. The point of transfer is when the
goods leave the seller's place of business.

   Suppose CBS buys 40 tablet computers at $60 each on
credit. The purchase contract shipping terms list FOB Shipping
Point. The shipping charges amount to an extra $5 per tablet
computer. All other taxes, fees, and insurance are included in
the purchase price of $60. The following entry occurs to
recognize the purchase.

                                                                     2.5 Shipping Terms | 333

2.6 Accounting for
Inventory

Accounting for inventory is a critical function of management.
Inventory accounting is significantly complicated by the fact
that it is an ongoing process of constant change, in part
because (1) most companies offer a large variety of products for
sale, (2) product purchases occur at irregular times, (3) products
are acquired for differing prices, and (4) inventory acquisitions
are based on sales projections, which are always uncertain and
often sporadic. Merchandising companies must meticulously
account for every individual product that they sell, equipping
them with essential information, for decisions such as these:

   What is the quantity of each product that is available to
      customers?

   When should inventory of each product item be
      replenished and at what quantity?

   How much should the company charge customers for
      each product to cover all costs plus profit margin?

   How much of the inventory cost should be allocated
      toward the units sold (cost of goods sold) during the
      period?

   How much of the inventory cost should be allocated
      toward the remaining units (ending inventory) at the end
      of the period?

   Is each product moving robustly or have some individual
      inventory items' activity decreased?

   Are some inventory items obsolete?

                                                       2.6 Accounting for Inventory | 335

        acctg211/?p=195#oembed-1

The company's financial statements report the combined cost
of all items sold as an offset to the proceeds from those sales,
producing the net number referred to as gross margin (or
gross profit). This is presented in the first part of the results of
operations for the period on the multi-step income statement.
The unsold inventory at period end is an asset to the company
and is therefore included in the company's financial
statements, on the balance sheet, as shown in Figure 2.73. The
total cost of all the inventory that remains at period end,
reported as merchandise inventory on the balance sheet, plus
the total cost of the inventory that was sold or otherwise
removed (through shrinkage, theft, or other loss), reported as
cost of goods sold on the income statement (see Figure 2.73),
represent the entirety of the inventory that the company had
to work with during the period, or goods available for sale.

336 | 2.6 Accounting for Inventory
Fundamentals of Inventory

Although our discussion will consider inventory issues from
the perspective of a retail company, using a resale or
merchandising operation, inventory accounting also
encompasses recording and reporting of manufacturing
operations. In the manufacturing environment, there would be
separate inventory calculations for the various process levels of
inventory, such as raw materials, work in process, and finished
goods. The manufacturer's finished goods inventory is
equivalent to the merchandiser's inventory account in that it
includes finished goods that are available for sale.

   In merchandising companies, inventory is a company asset
that includes beginning inventory plus purchases, which
include all additions to inventory during the period. Every time
the company sells products to customers, they dispose of a
portion of the company's inventory asset. Goods available for
sale refers to the total cost of all inventory that the company
had on hand at any time during the period, including
beginning inventory and all inventory purchases. These goods
were normally either sold to customers during the period
(occasionally lost due to spoilage, theft, damage, or other types
of shrinkages) and thus reported as cost of goods sold, an
expense account on the income statement, or these goods
are still in inventory at the end of the period and reported
as ending merchandise inventory, an asset account on the
balance sheet. As an example, assume that Harry's Auto Parts
Store sells oil filters. Suppose that at the end of January 31, 2018,
they had 50 oil filters on hand at a cost of $7 per unit. This
means that at the beginning of February, they had 50 units in
inventory at a total cost of $350 (50  $7). During the month,
they purchased 20 filters at a cost of $7, for a total cost of
$140 (20  $7). At the end of the month, there were 18 units
left in inventory. Therefore, during the month of February, they

                                                       2.6 Accounting for Inventory | 337
sold 52 units. Figure 2.74 illustrates how to calculate the goods
available for sale and the cost of goods sold.

Figure 2.74 Fundamentals of Inventory Accounting By: Rice

Inventory costing is accomplished by one of four specific
costing methods: (1) specific identification, (2) first-in, first-out,
(3) last-in, first-out, and (4) weighted-average cost methods.
All four methods are techniques that allow management to
distribute the costs of inventory in a logical and consistent
manner, to facilitate matching of costs to offset the related
revenue item that is recognized during the period, in
accordance with GAAP expense recognition and matching
concepts. Note that a company's cost allocation process
represents management's chosen method for expensing
product costs, based strictly on estimates of the flow of
inventory costs, which is unrelated to the actual flow of the
physical inventory. Use of a cost allocation strategy eliminates
the need for often cost-prohibitive individual tracking of costs
of each specific inventory item, for which purchase prices may
vary greatly. In this chapter, you will be provided with some
background concepts and explanations of terms associated
with inventory as well as a basic demonstration of each of the
four allocation methods, and then further delineation of the
application and nuances of the costing methods.

Data for Demonstration of the Four Basic
Inventory Valuation Methods

The following dataset will be used to demonstrate the
application and analysis of the four methods of inventory
accounting.

by being apprised of the child's location, and the student
benefits by not having to constantly check in with parents.
Demand for the product has spiked during the current fiscal
period, while supply is limited, causing the selling price to
escalate rapidly.

Specific Identification Method

The specific identification method refers to tracking the actual
cost of the item being sold and is generally used only on
expensive items that are highly customized (such as tracking
detailed costs for each individual car in automobiles sales) or
inherently distinctive (such as tracking origin and cost for each

                                                      2.6 Accounting for Inventory | 339
unique stone in diamond sales). This method is too
cumbersome for goods of large quantity, especially if there
are not significant feature differences in the various inventory
items of each product type. However, for purposes of this
demonstration, assume that the company sold one specific
identifiable unit, which was purchased in the second lot of
products, at a cost of $27.

   Three separate lots of goods are purchased:

Figure 2.76 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

First-in, First-out (FIFO) Method

The first-in, first-out method (FIFO) records costs relating to
a sale as if the earliest purchased item would be sold first.
However, the physical flow of the units sold under both the
periodic and perpetual methods would be the same. Due to
the mechanics of the determination of costs of goods sold
under the perpetual method, based on the timing of additional
purchases of inventory during the accounting period, it is
possible that the costs of goods sold might be slightly different
for an accounting period. Since FIFO assumes that the first
items purchased are sold first, the latest acquisitions would be
the items that remain in inventory at the end of the period and
would constitute ending inventory.

   Three separate lots of goods are purchased:

340 | 2.6 Accounting for Inventory
Figure 2.77 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Last-in, First-out (LIFO) Method

The last-in, first out method (LIFO) records costs relating to a
sale as if the latest purchased item would be sold first. As a
result, the earliest acquisitions would be the items that remain
in inventory at the end of the period.

   Three separate lots of goods are purchased:

Figure 2.78 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Weighted-Average Cost Method

The weighted-average cost method (sometimes referred to as
the average cost method) requires a calculation of the average
cost of all units of each particular inventory items. The average
is obtained by multiplying the number of units by the cost paid
per unit for each lot of goods, then adding the calculated total
value of all lots together, and finally dividing the total cost by
the total number of units for that product. As a caveat relating
to the average cost method, note that a new average cost must
be calculated after every change in inventory to reassess the
per-unit weighted-average value of the goods. This laborious

                                                       2.6 Accounting for Inventory | 341
requirement might make use of the average method cost-
prohibitive.

   Three separate lots of goods are purchased:

Figure 2.79 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Comparing the various costing methods for the sale of one unit
in this simple example reveals a significant difference that the
choice of cost allocation method can make. Note that the sales
price is not affected by the cost assumptions; only the cost
amount varies, depending on which method is chosen. Figure
2.80 depicts the different outcomes that the four methods
produced.

Figure 2.80 Comparison of the Four Costing Methods One unit sold
for $36 Comparison of the Four Costing Methods. By: Rice
University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Once the methods of costing are determined for the company,
that methodology would typically be applied repeatedly over
the remainder of the company's history to accomplish the
generally accepted accounting principle of consistency from
one period to another. It is possible to change methods if the
company finds that a different method more accurately
reflects results of operations, but the change requires

342 | 2.6 Accounting for Inventory
disclosure in the company's notes to the financial statements,
which alerts financial statement users of the impact of the
change in methodology. Also, it is important to realize that
although the Internal Revenue Service generally allows
differing methods of accounting treatment for tax purposes
than for financial statement purposes, an exception exists that
prohibits the use of LIFO inventory costing on the company
tax return unless LIFO is also used for the financial statement
costing calculations.

Additional Inventory Issues

Various other issues that affect inventory accounting include
consignment sales, transportation and ownership issues,
inventory estimation tools, and the effects of inflationary versus
deflationary cycles on various methods.

Consignment

Consigned goods refer to merchandise inventory that belongs
to a third party but which is displayed for sale by the company.
These goods are not owned by the company and thus must
not be included on the company's balance sheet nor be used
in the company's inventory calculations. The company's profit
relating to consigned goods is normally limited to a percentage
of the sales proceeds at the time of sale.

   For example, assume that you sell your office and your
current furniture doesn't match your new building. One way to
dispose of the furniture would be to have a consignment shop
sell it. The shop would keep a percentage of the sales revenue
and pay you the remaining balance. Assume in this example
that the shop will keep one-third of the sales proceeds and pay

                                                      2.6 Accounting for Inventory | 343
you the remaining two-thirds balance. If the furniture sells for
$15,000, you would receive $10,000 and the shop would keep
the remaining $5,000 as its sales commission. A key point to
remember is that until the inventory, in this case your office
furniture, is sold, you still own it, and it is reported as an asset on
your balance sheet and not an asset for the consignment shop.
After the sale, the buyer is the owner, so the consignment shop
is never the property's owner.

Lower-of-Cost-or-Market (LCM)

Reporting inventory values on the balance sheet using the
accounting concept of conservatism (which discourages
overstatement of net assets and net income) requires
inventory to be calculated and adjusted to a value that is the
lower of the cost calculated using the company's chosen
valuation method or the market value based on the market or
replacement value of the inventory items. Thus, if traditional
cost calculations produce inventory values that are overstated,
the lower-of-cost-or-market (LCM) concept requires that the
balance in the inventory account should be decreased to the
more conservative replacement value rather than be
overstated on the balance sheet.

Estimating Inventory Costs: Gross Profit
Method and Retail Inventory Method

Sometimes companies have a need to estimate inventory
values. These estimates could be needed for interim reports,
when physical counts are not taken. The need could be result
from a natural disaster that destroys part or all of the inventory
or from an error that causes inventory counts to be

344 | 2.6 Accounting for Inventory
compromised or omitted. Some specific industries (such as
select retail businesses) also regularly use these estimation
tools to determine cost of goods sold. Although the method is
predictable and simple, it is also less accurate since it is based
on estimates rather than actual cost figures.

   The gross profit method is used to estimate inventory values
by applying a standard gross profit percentage to the
company's sales totals when a physical count is not possible.
The resulting gross profit can then be subtracted from sales,
leaving an estimated cost of goods sold. Then the ending
inventory can be calculated by subtracting cost of goods sold
from the total goods available for sale. Likewise, the retail
inventory method estimates the cost of goods sold, much like
the gross profit method does, but uses the retail value of the
portions of inventory rather than the cost figures used in the
gross profit method.

Inflationary Versus Deflationary Cycles

As prices rise (inflationary times), FIFO ending inventory
account balances grow larger even when inventory unit counts
are constant, while the income statement reflects lower cost
of goods sold than the current prices for those goods, which
produces higher profits than if the goods were costed with
current inventory prices. Conversely, when prices fall
(deflationary times), FIFO ending inventory account balances
decrease and the income statement reflects higher cost of
goods sold and lower profits than if goods were costed at
current inventory prices. The effect of inflationary and
deflationary cycles on LIFO inventory valuation are the exact
opposite of their effects on FIFO inventory valuation.

2.7 Inventory Cost Flow
Methods- Periodic
System

As you've learned, the periodic inventory system is updated at
the end of the period to adjust inventory numbers to match the
physical count and provide accurate merchandise inventory
values for the balance sheet. The adjustment ensures that only
the inventory costs that remain on hand are recorded, and
the remainder of the goods available for sale are expensed
on the income statement as cost of goods sold. Here we will
demonstrate the mechanics used to calculate the ending
inventory values using the four cost allocation methods and
the periodic inventory system.

Information Relating to All Cost Allocation
Methods, but Specific to Periodic
Inventory Updating

Let's return to the example of The Spy Who Loves You
Corporation to demonstrate the four cost allocation methods,
assuming inventory is updated at the end of the period using
the periodic system.

beginning inventory cost is assumed to be $21 per unit for all
cost assumption methods.

Figure 2.81 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Specific Identification

The specific units assumed to be sold in this period are
designated as follows, with the specific inventory distinction
being associated with the lot numbers:

   Sold 120 units, all from Lot 1 (beginning inventory), costing
      $21 per unit

   Sold 180 units, 20 from Lot 1 (beginning inventory), costing
      $21 per unit; 160 from the Lot 2 (July 10 purchase), costing
      $27 per unit

348 | 2.7 Inventory Cost Flow Methods- Periodic System
The specific identification method of cost allocation directly
tracks each of the units purchased and costs them out as they
are actually sold. In this demonstration, assume that some
sales were made by specifically tracked goods that are part of
a lot, as previously stated for this method. So for The Spy Who
Loves You, considering the entire period together, note that

   140 of the 150 units that were purchased for $21 were sold,
      leaving 10 of $21 units remaining

   160 of the 225 units that were purchased for $27 were sold,
      leaving 65 of the $27 units remaining

   none of the 210 units that were purchased for $33 were
      sold, leaving all 210 of the $33 units remaining

Ending inventory was made up of 10 units at $21 each, 65 units
at $27 each, and 210 units at $33 each, for a total specific
identification ending inventory value of $8,895. Subtracting
this ending inventory from the $16,155 total of goods available
for sale leaves $7,260 in cost of goods sold this period.

Calculations of Costs of Goods Sold, Ending
Inventory, and Gross Margin, Specific
Identification

The specific identification costing assumption tracks inventory
items individually, so that when they are sold, the exact cost
of the item is used to offset the revenue from the sale. The
cost of goods sold, inventory, and gross margin shown in Figure
2.82 were determined from the previously-stated data,
particular to specific identification costing.

Calculation for the Ending Inventory Adjustment
under Periodic/Specific Identification Methods

Merchandise inventory, before adjustment, had a balance of
$3,150, which was the beginning inventory. Journal entries are
not shown, but the following calculations provide the
information that would be used in recording the necessary
journal entries. The inventory at the end of the period should be
$8,895, requiring an entry to increase merchandise inventory

350 | 2.7 Inventory Cost Flow Methods- Periodic System
by $5,745. Cost of goods sold was calculated to be $7,260, which
should be recorded as an expense. The credit entry to balance
the adjustment is $13,005, which is the total amount that was
recorded as purchases for the period. This entry distributes the
balance in the purchases account between the inventory that
was sold (cost of goods sold) and the amount of inventory that
remains at period end (merchandise inventory).

First-in, First-out (FIFO)

The first-in, first-out method (FIFO) of cost allocation assumes
that the earliest units purchased are also the first units sold.
For The Spy Who Loves You, considering the entire period, 300
of the 585 units available for the period were sold, and if the
earliest acquisitions are considered sold first, then the units
that remain under FIFO are those that were purchased last.
Following that logic, ending inventory included 210 units
purchased at $33 and 75 units purchased at $27 each, for a total
FIFO periodic ending inventory value of $8,955. Subtracting this
ending inventory from the $16,155 total of goods available for
sale leaves $7,200 in cost of goods sold this period.

The FIFO costing assumption tracks inventory items based on
segments or lots of goods that are tracked, in the order that
they were acquired, so that when they are sold, the earliest
acquired items are used to offset the revenue from the sale.
The cost of goods sold, inventory, and gross margin shown
in Figure 2.85 were determined from the previously-stated
data, particular to FIFO costing.

Calculations for Inventory Adjustment, Periodic/
First-in, First-out (FIFO)

Beginning merchandise inventory had a balance of $3,150
before adjustment. The inventory at period end should be
$8,955, requiring an entry to increase merchandise inventory
by $5,895. Journal entries are not shown, but the following
calculations provide the information that would be used in
recording the necessary journal entries. Cost of goods sold was
calculated to be $7,200, which should be recorded as an
expense. The credit entry to balance the adjustment is for
$13,005, which is the total amount that was recorded as
purchases for the period. This entry distributes the balance in
the purchases account between the inventory that was sold
(cost of goods sold) and the amount of inventory that remains
at period end (merchandise inventory).

Last-in, First-out (LIFO)

The last-in, first-out method (LIFO) of cost allocation assumes

                      2.7 Inventory Cost Flow Methods- Periodic System | 353
that the last units purchased are the first units sold. For The
Spy Who Loves You, considering the entire period together,
300 of the 585 units available for the period were sold, and if
the latest acquisitions are considered sold first, then the units
that remain under LIFO are those that were purchased first.
Following that logic, ending inventory included 150 units
purchased at $21 and 135 units purchased at $27 each, for a total
LIFO periodic ending inventory value of $6,795. Subtracting this
ending inventory from the $16,155 total of goods available for
sale leaves $9,360 in cost of goods sold this period.

Figure 2.87 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

It is important to note that these answers can differ when
calculated using the perpetual method. When perpetual
methodology is utilized, the cost of goods sold and ending
inventory are calculated at the time of each sale rather than at
the end of the month. For example, in this case, when the first
sale of 150 units is made, inventory will be removed and cost
computed as of that date from the beginning inventory. The

354 | 2.7 Inventory Cost Flow Methods- Periodic System
differences in timing as to when cost of goods sold is calculated
can alter the order that costs are sequenced.

Calculations of Costs of Goods Sold, Ending
Inventory, and Gross Margin, Last-in, First-out
(LIFO)

The LIFO costing assumption tracks inventory items based on
lots of goods that are tracked, in the order that they were
acquired, so that when they are sold, the latest acquired items
are used to offset the revenue from the sale. The following cost
of goods sold, inventory, and gross margin were determined
from the previously-stated data, particular to LIFO costing.

Calculations for Inventory Adjustment, Periodic/
Last-in, First-out (LIFO)

Beginning merchandise inventory had a balance before
adjustment of $3,150. The inventory at period end should be
$6,795, requiring an entry to increase merchandise inventory
by $3,645. Journal entries are not shown, but the following
calculations provide the information that would be used in
recording the necessary journal entries. Cost of goods sold was
calculated to be $9,360, which should be recorded as an
expense. The credit entry to balance the adjustment is for
$13,005, which is the total amount that was recorded as
purchases for the period. This entry distributes the balance in
the purchases account between the inventory that was sold
(cost of goods sold) and the amount of inventory that remains
at period end (merchandise inventory).

Weighted-Average Cost (AVG)

Weighted-average cost allocation requires computation of the
average cost of all units in goods available for sale at the time
the sale is made. For The Spy Who Loves You, considering the
entire period, the weighted-average cost is computed by
dividing total cost of goods available for sale ($16,155) by the
total number of available units (585) to get the average cost of
$27.62. Note that 285 of the 585 units available for sale during
the period remained in inventory at period end. Following that
logic, ending inventory included 285 units at an average cost
of $27.62 for a total AVG periodic ending inventory value of
$7,872. Subtracting this ending inventory from the $16,155 total
of goods available for sale leaves $8,283 in cost of goods sold
this period. It is important to note that final numbers can often
differ by one or two cents due to rounding of the calculations.

356 | 2.7 Inventory Cost Flow Methods- Periodic System
In this case, the cost comes to $27.6154 but rounds up to the
stated cost of $27.62.

Calculations of Costs of Goods Sold, Ending
Inventory, and Gross Margin, Weighted Average
(AVG)

The AVG costing assumption tracks inventory items based on
lots of goods that are tracked but averages the cost of all units
on hand every time an addition is made to inventory so that,
when they are sold, the most recently averaged cost items are
used to offset the revenue from the sale. The cost of goods
sold, inventory, and gross margin shown in Figure 2.90 were
determined from the previously-stated data, particular to AVG
costing.

Journal Entries for Inventory Adjustment,

Beginning merchandise inventory had a balance before
adjustment of $3,150. The inventory at period end should be
$7,872, requiring an entry to increase merchandise inventory
by $4,722. Journal entries are not shown, but the following
calculations provide the information that would be used in
recording the necessary journal entries. Cost of goods sold was
calculated to be $8,283, which should be recorded as an
expense. The credit entry to balance the adjustment is for
$13,005, which is the total amount that was recorded as
purchases for the period. This entry distributes the balance in
the purchases account between the inventory that was sold
(cost of goods sold) and the amount of inventory that remains
at period end (merchandise inventory).

358 | 2.7 Inventory Cost Flow Methods- Periodic System
2.8 Inventory Cost Flow
Methods- Perpetual
System

As you've learned, the perpetual inventory system is updated
continuously to reflect the current status of inventory on an
ongoing basis. Modern sales activity commonly uses electronic
identifiers--such as bar codes and RFID technology--to
account for inventory as it is purchased, monitored, and sold.
Specific identification inventory methods also commonly use a
manual form of the perpetual system. Here we'll demonstrate
the mechanics implemented when using perpetual inventory
systems in inventory accounting, whether those calculations
are orchestrated in a laborious manual system or electronically
(in the latter, the inventory accounting operates effortlessly
behind the scenes but nonetheless utilizes the same perpetual
methodology).

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

Perpetual Inventory's Advancements
through Technology

Perpetual inventory has been seen as the wave of the future
for many years. It has grown since the 1970s alongside the
development of affordable personal computers. Universal
product codes, commonly known as UPC barcodes, have
advanced inventory management for large and small retail

                   2.8 Inventory Cost Flow Methods- Perpetual System | 359
organizations, allowing real-time inventory counts and reorder
capability that increased popularity of the perpetual inventory
system. These UPC codes identify specific products but are not
specific to the particular batch of goods that were produced.
Electronic product codes (EPCs) such as radio frequency
identifiers (RFIDs) are essentially an evolved version of UPCs
in which a chip/identifier is embedded in the EPC code that
matches the goods to the actual batch of product that was
produced. This more specific information allows better control,
greater accountability, increased efficiency, and overall quality
monitoring of goods in inventory. The technology
advancements that are available for perpetual inventory
systems make it nearly impossible for businesses to choose
periodic inventory and forego the competitive advantages that
the technology offers.

Information Relating to All
Cost Allocation Methods, but
Specific to Perpetual
Inventory Updating

Let's return to The Spy Who Loves You Corporation data to
demonstrate the four cost allocation methods, assuming
inventory is updated on an ongoing basis in a perpetual
system.

Calculations for Inventory Purchases and
Sales during the Period, Perpetual
Inventory Updating

Regardless of which cost assumption is chosen, recording
inventory sales using the perpetual method involves recording
both the revenue and the cost from the transaction for each
individual sale. As additional inventory is purchased during the
period, the cost of those goods is added to the merchandise
inventory account. Normally, no significant adjustments are
needed at the end of the period (before financial statements

                    2.8 Inventory Cost Flow Methods- Perpetual System | 361
are prepared) since the inventory balance is maintained to
continually parallel actual counts.

Specific Identification

For demonstration purposes, the specific units assumed to be
sold in this period are designated as follows, with the specific
inventory distinction being associated with the lot numbers:

   Sold 120 units, all from Lot 1 (beginning inventory), costing
      $21 per unit

   Sold 180 units, 20 from Lot 1 (beginning inventory), costing
      $21 per unit; 160 from Lot 2 (July 10 purchase), costing $27
      per unit

The specific identification method of cost allocation directly
tracks each of the units purchased and costs them out as they
are sold. In this demonstration, assume that some sales were
made by specifically tracked goods that are part of a lot, as
previously stated for this method. For The Spy Who Loves You,
the first sale of 120 units is assumed to be the units from the
beginning inventory, which had cost $21 per unit, bringing the
total cost of these units to $2,520. Once those units were sold,
there remained 30 more units of the beginning inventory. The
company bought 225 more units for $27 per unit. The second
sale of 180 units consisted of 20 units at $21 per unit and 160
units at $27 per unit for a total second-sale cost of $4,740. Thus,
after two sales, there remained 10 units of inventory that had
cost the company $21, and 65 units that had cost the company
$27 each. The last transaction was an additional purchase of 210
units for $33 per unit. Ending inventory was made up of 10 units
at $21 each, 65 units at $27 each, and 210 units at $33 each, for a
total specific identification perpetual ending inventory value of
$8,895.

The specific identification costing assumption tracks inventory
items individually so that, when they are sold, the exact cost
of the item is used to offset the revenue from the sale. The
cost of goods sold, inventory, and gross margin shown in Figure

Description of Journal Entries for Inventory Sales,
Perpetual, Specific Identification

Journal entries are not shown, but the following discussion
provides the information that would be used in recording the
necessary journal entries. Each time a product is sold, a
revenue entry would be made to record the sales revenue and
the corresponding accounts receivable or cash from the sale.
Because of the choice to apply perpetual inventory updating, a
second entry made at the same time would record the cost of
the item based on the actual cost of the items, which would be
shifted from merchandise inventory (an asset) to cost of goods
sold (an expense).

First-in, First-out (FIFO)

The first-in, first-out method (FIFO) of cost allocation assumes
that the earliest units purchased are also the first units sold. For
The Spy Who Loves You, using perpetual inventory updating,
the first sale of 120 units is assumed to be the units from the
beginning inventory, which had cost $21 per unit, bringing the

364 | 2.8 Inventory Cost Flow Methods- Perpetual System
total cost of these units to $2,520. Once those units were sold,
there remained 30 more units of beginning inventory. The
company bought 225 more units for $27 per unit. At the time
of the second sale of 180 units, the FIFO assumption directs
the company to cost out the last 30 units of the beginning
inventory, plus 150 of the units that had been purchased for
$27. Thus, after two sales, there remained 75 units of inventory
that had cost the company $27 each. The last transaction was
an additional purchase of 210 units for $33 per unit. Ending
inventory was made up of 75 units at $27 each, and 210 units at
$33 each, for a total FIFO perpetual ending inventory value of
$8,955.

Calculations of Costs of Goods Sold, Ending
Inventory, and Gross Margin, First-in, First-out
(FIFO)

The FIFO costing assumption tracks inventory items based on
lots of goods that are tracked, in the order that they were
acquired, so that when they are sold the earliest acquired items
are used to offset the revenue from the sale. The cost of goods
sold, inventory, and gross margin shown in Figure 2.95 were
determined from the previously-stated data, particular to
perpetual FIFO costing.

Journal entries are not shown, but the following discussion
provides the information that would be used in recording the

necessary journal entries. Each time a product is sold, a
revenue entry would be made to record the sales revenue and
the corresponding accounts receivable or cash from the sale.
When applying perpetual inventory updating, a second entry
made at the same time would record the cost of the item
based on FIFO, which would be shifted from merchandise
inventory (an asset) to cost of goods sold (an expense).

Last-in, First-out (LIFO)

The last-in, first-out method (LIFO) of cost allocation assumes
that the last units purchased are the first units sold. For The Spy
Who Loves You, using perpetual inventory updating, the first
sale of 120 units is assumed to be the units from the beginning
inventory (because this was the only lot of good available, so
it represented the last purchased lot), which had cost $21 per
unit, bringing the total cost of these units in the first sale to
$2,520. Once those units were sold, there remained 30 more
units of beginning inventory. The company bought 225 more
units for $27 per unit. At the time of the second sale of 180 units,
the LIFO assumption directs the company to cost out the 180
units from the latest purchased units, which had cost $27 for
a total cost on the second sale of $4,860. Thus, after two sales,
there remained 30 units of beginning inventory that had cost
the company $21 each, plus 45 units of the goods purchased
for $27 each. The last transaction was an additional purchase of
210 units for $33 per unit. Ending inventory was made up of 30
units at $21 each, 45 units at $27 each, and 210 units at $33 each,
for a total LIFO perpetual ending inventory value of $8,775.

inventory (an asset) to cost of goods sold (an expense).

Weighted-Average Cost (AVG)

Weighted-average cost allocation requires computation of the
average cost of all units in goods available for sale at the time
the sale is made for perpetual inventory calculations. For The
Spy Who Loves You, the first sale of 120 units is assumed to
be the units from the beginning inventory (because this was
the only lot of good available, so the price of these units also
represents the average cost), which had cost $21 per unit,

                   2.8 Inventory Cost Flow Methods- Perpetual System | 369
bringing the total cost of these units in the first sale to $2,520.
Once those units were sold, there remained 30 more units of
the inventory, which still had a $21 average cost. The company
bought 225 more units for $27 per unit. Recalculating the
average cost, after this purchase, is accomplished by dividing
total cost of goods available for sale (which totaled $6,705 at
that point) by the number of units held, which was 255 units,
for an average cost of $26.29 per unit. At the time of the second
sale of 180 units, the AVG assumption directs the company
to cost out the 180 at $26.29 for a total cost on the second
sale of $4,732. Thus, after two sales, there remained 75 units
at an average cost of $26.29 each. The last transaction was an
additional purchase of 210 units for $33 per unit. Recalculating
the average cost again resulted in an average cost of $31.24
per unit. Ending inventory was made up of 285 units at $31.24
each for a total AVG perpetual ending inventory value of $8,902
(rounded).1

Calculations of Costs of Goods Sold, Ending
Inventory, and Gross Margin, Weighted
Average (AVG)

The AVG costing assumption tracks inventory items based on
lots of goods that are combined and re-averaged after each
new acquisition to determine a new average cost per unit so
that, when they are sold, the latest averaged cost items are
used to offset the revenue from the sale. The cost of goods
sold, inventory, and gross margin shown in Figure 2.99 were
determined from the previously-stated data, particular to
perpetual, AVG costing.

3.1 Bank Reconciliation

The bank is a very important partner to all businesses. Not
only does the bank provide basic checking services, but they
process credit card transactions, keep cash safe, and may
finance loans when needed.

   Bank accounts for businesses can involve thousands of
transactions per month. Due to the number of ongoing
transactions, an organization's book balance for its checking
account rarely is the same as the balance that the bank records
reflect for the entity at any given point. These timing
differences are typically caused by the fact that there will be
some transactions that the organization is aware of before the
bank, or transactions the bank is aware of before the company.

   For example, if a company writes a check that has not cleared
yet, the company would be aware of the transaction before the
bank is. Similarly, the bank might have received funds on the
company's behalf and recorded them in the bank's records for
the company before the organization is aware of the deposit.

   With the large volume of transactions that impact a bank
account, it becomes necessary to have an internal control
system in place to assure that all cash transactions are properly
recorded within the bank account, as well as on the ledger of
the business. The bank reconciliation is the internal financial
report that explains and documents any differences that may
exist between the balance of a checking account as reflected
by the bank's records (bank balance) for a company and the
company's accounting records (company balance).

   The bank reconciliation is an internal document prepared
by the company that owns the checking account. The
transactions with timing differences are used to adjust and
reconcile both the bank and company balances; after the bank

380 | 3.1 Bank Reconciliation
reconciliation is prepared accurately, both the bank balance
and the company balance will be the same amount.

   Note that the transactions the company is aware of have
already been recorded (journalized) in its records. However, the
transactions that the bank is aware of but the company is not
must be journalized in the entity's records.

Fundamentals of the Bank Reconciliation
Procedure

The balance on a bank statement can differ from company's
financial records due to one or more of the following
circumstances:

   An outstanding check: a check that was written and
      deducted from the financial records of the company but
      has not been cashed by the recipient, so the amount has
      not been removed from the bank account.

   A deposit in transit: a deposit that was made by the
      business and recorded on its books but has not yet been
      recorded by the bank.

   Deductions for a bank service fee: fees often charged by
      banks each month for management of the bank account.
      These may be fixed maintenance fees, per-check fees, or a
      fee for a check that was written for an amount greater
      than the balance in the checking account, called
      an nonsufficient funds (NSF) check. These fees are
      deducted by the bank from the account but would not
      appear on the financial records.

   Errors initiated by either the client or the bank: for
      example, the client might record a check incorrectly in its
      records, for either a greater or lesser amount than was
      written. Also, the bank might report a check either with an
      incorrect balance or in the wrong client's checking

                                                               3.1 Bank Reconciliation | 381
      account.
   Additions such as interest or funds collected by the bank

      for the client: interest is added to the bank account as
      earned but is not reported on the financial records. These
      additions might also include funds collected by the bank
      for the client.

Demonstration of a Bank Reconciliation

A bank reconciliation is structured to include the information
shown in Figure 3.1.

Assume the following circumstances for Feeter Plumbing
Company, a small business located in Northern Ohio.

 1. After all posting is up to date, at the end of July 31, the
      book balance shows $32,760, and the bank statement
      balance shows $77,040.

2. Check 5523 for $9,620 and 6547 for $10,000 are
      outstanding.

 3. Check 5386 for $2,000 is removed from the bank account
      correctly but is recorded on the accounting records for
      $1,760. This was in payment of dues. The effects of this

382 | 3.1 Bank Reconciliation
      transaction resulted in an error of $240 that must be
      deducted from the company's book balance.
4. The July 31 night deposit of $34,300 was delivered to the
      bank after hours. As a result, the deposit is not on the bank
      statement, but it is on the financial records.
 5. Upon review of the bank statement, an error is uncovered.
      A check is removed from the account from Feeter for $320
      that should have been removed from the account of
      another customer of the bank.
6. In the bank statement is a note stating that the bank
      collected $60,000 in charges (payments) from the credit
      card company as well as $1,800 in interest. This transaction
      is on the bank statement but not in the company's
      financial records.
 7. The bank notified Feeter that a $2,200 check was returned
      unpaid from customer Berson due to insufficient funds in
      Berson's account. This check return is reflected on the
      bank statement but not in the records of Feeter.
8. Bank service charges for the month are $80. They have not
      been recorded on Feeter's records.

Each item would be recorded on the bank reconciliation as
follows:

identifies transactions that have not been recorded by the
company that are supposed to be recorded. Journal entries are
required to adjust the book balance to the correct balance.

   In the case of Feeter, the first entry will record the collection
of the note, as well as the interest collected.

3.2 Petty Cash

As we have discussed, one of the hardest assets to control
within any organization is cash. One way to control cash is for
an organization to require that all payments be made by check.
However, there are situations in which it is not practical to use a
check. For example, imagine that the Galaxy's Best Yogurt runs
out of milk one evening. It is not possible to operate without
milk, and the normal shipment does not come from the
supplier for another 48 hours. To maintain operations, it
becomes necessary to go to the grocery store across the street
and purchase three gallons of milk. It is not efficient for time
and cost to write a check for this small purchase, so companies
set up a petty cash fund, which is a predetermined amount
of cash held on hand to be used to make payments for small
day-to-day purchases. A petty cash fund is a type of imprest
account, which means that it contains a fixed amount of cash
that is replaced as it is spent in order to maintain a set balance.

   To maintain internal controls, managers can use a petty cash
receipt (Figure 3.7), which tracks the use of the cash and
requires a signature from the manager.

                                                                            3.2 Petty Cash | 387
Figure 3.7 Petty Cash Voucher A petty cash voucher is an important
internal control document to trace the use of cash within a petty cash
fund. This voucher allows management to track the use of cash, the
balance that should be within the account, and the person
responsible for the approval of a payment from the account. Petty

As cash is spent from a petty cash fund, it is replaced with a
receipt of the purchase. At all times, the balance in the petty
cash box should be equal to the cash in the box plus the
receipts showing purchases.

   For example, the Galaxy's Best Yogurt maintains a petty cash
box with a stated balance of $75 at all times. Upon review of the
box, the balance is counted in the following way.

Figure 3.8 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Because there may not always be a manager with check
signing privileges available to sign a check for unexpected
expenses, a petty cash account allows employees to make

388 | 3.2 Petty Cash
small and necessary purchases to support the function of a
business when it is not practical to go through the formal
expense process. In all cases, the amount of the purchase using
petty cash would be considered to not be material in nature.
Recall that materiality means that the dollar amount in
question would have a significant impact in financial results or
influence investor decisions.

Demonstration of Typical Petty Cash
Journal Entries

Petty cash accounts are managed through a series of journal
entries. Entries are needed to (1) establish the fund, (2) increase
or decrease the balance of the fund (replenish the fund as
cash is used), and (3) adjust for overages and shortages of cash.
Consider the following example.

   The Galaxy's Best Yogurt establishes a petty cash fund on
July 1 by cashing a check for $75 from its checking account
and placing cash in the petty cash box. At this point, the petty
cash box has $75 to be used for small expenses with the
authorization of the responsible manager. The journal entry to
establish the petty cash fund would be as follows.

Figure 3.9 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

As this petty cash fund is established, the account titled "Petty
Cash" is created; this is an asset on the balance sheet of many
small businesses. In this case, the cash account, which includes
checking accounts, is decreased, while the funds are moved to

                                                                            3.2 Petty Cash | 389
the petty cash account. One asset is increasing, while another
asset is decreasing by the same account. Since the petty cash
account is an imprest account, this balance will never change
and will remain on the balance sheet at $75, unless
management elects to change the petty cash balance.

   Throughout the month, several payments are made from the
petty cash account of the Galaxy's Best Yogurt. Assume the
following activities.

Figure 3.10 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

At the end of July, in the petty cash box there should be a
receipt for the postage stamp purchase, a receipt for the milk,
a receipt for the window cleaner, and the remaining cash. The
employee in charge of the petty cash box should sign each
receipt when the purchase is made. The total amount of
purchases from the receipts ($45), plus the remaining cash in
the box should total $75. As the receipts are reviewed, the box
must be replenished for what was spent during the month.
The journal entry to replenish the petty cash account will be as
follows.

Figure 3.11 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

390 | 3.2 Petty Cash
Typically, petty cash accounts are reimbursed at a fixed time
period. Many small businesses will do this monthly, which
ensures that the expenses are recognized within the proper
accounting period. In the event that all of the cash in the
account is used before the end of the established time period,
it can be replenished in the same way at any time more cash
is needed. If the petty cash account often needs to be
replenished before the end of the accounting period,
management may decide to increase the cash balance in the
account. If, for example, management of the Galaxy's Best
Yogurt decides to increase the petty cash balance to $100 from
the current balance of $75, the journal entry to do this on
August 1 would be as follows.

Figure 3.12 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

If the management at a later date decides to decrease the
balance in the petty cash account, the previous entry would
be reversed, with cash being debited and petty cash being
credited.

   Occasionally, errors may occur that affect the balance of the
petty cash account. This may be the result of an employee not
getting a receipt or getting back incorrect change from the
store where the purchase was made. In this case, an expense is
created that creates a cash overage or shortage.

   Consider Galaxy's expenses for July. During the month, $45
was spent on expenses. If the balance in the petty cash account
is supposed to be $75, then the petty cash box should contain
$45 in signed receipts and $30 in cash. Assume that when the
box is counted, there are $45 in receipts and $25 in cash. In

                                                                             3.2 Petty Cash | 391
this case, the petty cash balance is $70, when it should be $75.
This creates a $5 shortage that needs to be replaced from the
checking account. The entry to record a cash shortage is as
follows.

Figure 3.13 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

When there is a shortage of cash, we record the shortage as a
"debit" and this has the same effect as an expense. If we have
an overage of cash, we record the overage as a credit, and this
has the same impact as if we are recording revenue. If there
were cash overage, the petty cash account would be debited
and the cash over and short account would be credited. In this
case, the expense balance decreases, and the year-end balance
is the net balance from all overages and shortages during the
year.

   If a petty cash account is consistently short, this may be a
warning sign that there is not a proper control of the account,
and management may want to consider additional controls to
better monitor petty cash.

3.3 Bad Debt Expense
and the Allowance for
Doubtful Accounts

You lend a friend $500 with the agreement that you will be
repaid in two months. At the end of two months, your friend
has not repaid the money. You continue to request the money
each month, but the friend has yet to repay the debt. How does
this affect your finances?

   Think of this on a larger scale. A bank lends money to a
couple purchasing a home (mortgage). The understanding is
that the couple will make payments each month toward the
principal borrowed, plus interest. As time passes, the loan goes
unpaid. What happens when a loan that was supposed to be
paid is not paid? How does this affect the financial statements
for the bank? The bank may need to consider ways to
recognize this bad debt.

Fundamentals of Bad Debt Expenses and
Allowances for Doubtful Accounts

Bad debts are uncollectible amounts from customer accounts.
Bad debt negatively affects accounts receivable (see Figure
3.22). When future collection of receivables cannot be
reasonably assumed, recognizing this potential nonpayment
is required. There are two methods a company may use to
recognize bad debt: the direct write-off method and the
allowance method.

        acctg211/?p=226#oembed-1

The direct write-off method delays recognition of bad debt

394 | 3.3 Bad Debt Expense and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
until the specific customer accounts receivable is identified.
Once this account is identified as uncollectible, the company
will record a reduction to the customer's accounts receivable
and an increase to bad debt expense for the exact amount
uncollectible.

   Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the
direct write-off method is not an acceptable method of
recording bad debts, because it violates the matching
principle. For example, assume that a credit transaction occurs
in September 2018 and is determined to be uncollectible in
February 2019. The direct write-off method would record the
bad debt expense in 2019, while the matching principle
requires that it be associated with a 2018 transaction, which
will better reflect the relationship between revenues and the
accompanying expenses. This matching issue is the reason
accountants will typically use one of the two accrual-based
accounting methods introduced to account for bad debt
expenses.

   It is important to consider other issues in the treatment of
bad debts. For example, when companies account for bad debt
expenses in their financial statements, they will use an accrual-
based method; however, they are required to use the direct
write-off method on their income tax returns. This variance in
treatment addresses taxpayers' potential to manipulate when
a bad debt is recognized. Because of this potential
manipulation, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires that
the direct write-off method must be used when the debt is
determined to be uncollectible, while GAAP still requires that
an accrual-based method be used for financial accounting
statements.

   For the taxpayer, this means that if a company sells an item
on credit in October 2018 and determines that it is uncollectible
in June 2019, it must show the effects of the bad debt when it
files its 2019 tax return. This application probably violates the
matching principle, but if the IRS did not have this policy, there

 3.3 Bad Debt Expense and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts | 395
would typically be a significant amount of manipulation on
company tax returns. For example, if the company wanted the
deduction for the write-off in 2018, it might claim that it was
actually uncollectible in 2018, instead of in 2019.

   The final point relates to companies with very little exposure
to the possibility of bad debts, typically, entities that rarely offer
credit to its customers. Assuming that credit is not a significant
component of its sales, these sellers can also use the direct
write-off method. The companies that qualify for this
exemption, however, are typically small and not major
participants in the credit market. Thus, virtually all of the
remaining bad debt expense material discussed here will be
based on an allowance method that uses accrual accounting,
the matching principle, and the revenue recognition rules
under GAAP.

   For example, a customer takes out a $15,000 car loan on
August 1, 2018 and is expected to pay the amount in full before
December 1, 2018. For the sake of this example, assume that
there was no interest charged to the buyer because of the
short-term nature or life of the loan. When the account defaults
for nonpayment on December 1, the company would record
the following journal entry to recognize bad debt.

Figure 3.23 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

Bad Debt Expense increases (debit), and Accounts Receivable
decreases (credit) for $15,000. If, in the future, any part of the
debt is recovered, a reversal of the previously written-off bad
debt, and the collection recognition is required. Let's say this
customer unexpectedly pays in full on May 1, 2019, the company

396 | 3.3 Bad Debt Expense and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
would record the following journal entries (note that the
company's fiscal year ends on June 30)

Figure 3.24 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

The first entry reverses the bad debt write-off by increasing
Accounts Receivable (debit) and decreasing Bad Debt Expense
(credit) for the amount recovered. The second entry records
the payment in full with Cash increasing (debit) and Accounts
Receivable decreasing (credit) for the amount received of
$15,000.

   As you've learned, the delayed recognition of bad debt
violates GAAP, specifically the matching principle. Therefore,
the direct write-off method is not used for publicly traded
company reporting; the allowance method is used instead.

        view them online here: https://psu.pb.unizin.org/
        acctg211/?p=226#oembed-2

The allowance method is the more widely used method
because it satisfies the matching principle. The allowance
method estimates bad debt during a period, based on certain
computational approaches. The calculation matches bad debt
with related sales during the period. The estimation is made

 3.3 Bad Debt Expense and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts | 397
from past experience and industry standards. When the
estimation is recorded at the end of a period, the following
entry occurs.

$. Explanation: "To record estimated bad debt."" width="1299
height="216 data-media-type="image/jpeg" /> Figure 3.25 By:
Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

   The journal entry for the Bad Debt Expense increases (debit)
the expense's balance, and the Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts increases (credit) the balance in the Allowance.
The allowance for doubtful accounts is a contra asset account
and is subtracted from Accounts Receivable to determine
the Net Realizable Value of the Accounts Receivable account
on the balance sheet. A contra account has an opposite normal
balance to its paired account, thereby reducing or increasing
the balance in the paired account at the end of a period; the
adjustment can be an addition or a subtraction from a
controlling account. In the case of the allowance for doubtful
accounts, it is a contra account that is used to reduce the
Controlling account, Accounts Receivable.

   At the end of an accounting period, the Allowance for
Doubtful Accounts reduces the Accounts Receivable to
produce Net Accounts Receivable. Note that allowance for
doubtful accounts reduces the overall accounts receivable
account, not a specific accounts receivable assigned to a
customer. Because it is an estimation, it means the exact
account that is (or will become) uncollectible is not yet known.

   To demonstrate the treatment of the allowance for doubtful

398 | 3.3 Bad Debt Expense and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
accounts on the balance sheet, assume that a company has
reported an Accounts Receivable balance of $90,000 and a
Balance in the Allowance of Doubtful Accounts of $4,800. The
following table reflects how the relationship would be reflected
in the current (short-term) section of the company's Balance
Sheet.

Figure 3.26 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

There is one more point about the use of the contra account,
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. In this example, the $85,200
total is the net realizable value, or the amount of accounts
anticipated to be collected. However, the company is owed
$90,000 and will still try to collect the entire $90,000 and not
just the $85,200.

   Under the balance sheet method of calculating bad debt
expenses, if there is already a balance in Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts from a previous period and accounts written off in
the current year, this must be considered before the adjusting
entry is made. For example, if a company already had a credit
balance from the prior period of $1,000, plus any accounts that
have been written off this year, and a current period estimated
balance of $2,500, the company would need to subtract the
prior period's credit balance from the current period's
estimated credit balance in order to calculate the amount to be
added to the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.

 3.3 Bad Debt Expense and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts | 399
Figure 3.27 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA
Therefore, the adjusting journal entry would be as follows.

Figure 3.28 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA
If a company already had a debit balance from the prior period
of $1,000, and a current period estimated balance of $2,500, the
company would need to add the prior period's debit balance to
the current period's estimated credit balance.

Figure 3.29 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA
Therefore, the adjusting journal entry would be as follows.

3.31 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts decreases (debit) and
Accounts Receivable for the specific customer also decreases
(credit). Allowance for doubtful accounts decreases because
the bad debt amount is no longer unclear. Accounts receivable
decreases because there is an assumption that no debt will be
collected on the identified customer's account.

   Let's say that the customer unexpectedly pays on the
account in the future. The following journal entries would
occur.

The first entry reverses the previous entry where bad debt was
written off. This reinstatement requires Accounts Receivable:
Customer to increase (debit), and Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts to increase (credit). The second entry records the
payment on the account. Cash increases (debit) and Accounts
Receivable: Customer decreases (credit) for the amount
received.

   To compute the most accurate estimation possible, a
company may use one of three methods for bad debt expense
recognition: the income statement method, balance sheet
method, or balance sheet aging of receivables method.

Income Statement Method for Calculating
Bad Debt Expenses

The income statement method (also known as the percentage
of sales method) estimates bad debt expenses based on the
assumption that at the end of the period, a certain percentage
of sales during the period will not be collected. The estimation

402 | 3.3 Bad Debt Expense and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
is typically based on credit sales only, not total sales (which
include cash sales). In this example, assume that any credit
card sales that are uncollectible are the responsibility of the
credit card company. It may be obvious intuitively, but, by
definition, a cash sale cannot become a bad debt, assuming
that the cash payment did not entail counterfeit currency. The
income statement method is a simple method for calculating
bad debt, but it may be more imprecise than other measures
because it does not consider how long a debt has been
outstanding and the role that plays in debt recovery.

   To illustrate, let's continue to use Billie's Watercraft
Warehouse (BWW) as the example. Billie's end-of-year credit
sales totaled $458,230. BWW estimates that 5% of its overall
credit sales will result in bad debt. The following adjusting
journal entry for bad debt occurs.

Figure 3.33 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

Bad Debt Expense increases (debit), and Allowance for
Doubtful Accounts increases (credit) for $22,911.50 ($458,230
 5%). This means that BWW believes $22,911.50 will be
uncollectible debt. Let's say that on April 8, it was determined
that Customer Robert Craft's account was uncollectible in the
amount of $5,000. The following entry occurs.

Figure 3.34 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

3.3 Bad Debt Expense and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts | 403
In this case, Allowance for Doubtful Accounts decreases (debit)
and Accounts Receivable: Craft decreases (credit) for the
known uncollectible amount of $5,000. On June 5, Craft
unexpectedly makes a partial payment on his account in the
amount of $3,000. The following journal entries show the
reinstatement of bad debt and the subsequent payment.

Figure 3.35 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

The outstanding balance of $2,000 that Craft did not repay will
remain as bad debt.

Balance Sheet Method for Calculating Bad
Debt Expenses

The balance sheet method (also known as the percentage of
accounts receivable method) estimates bad debt expenses
based on the balance in accounts receivable. The method looks
at the balance of accounts receivable at the end of the period
and assumes that a certain amount will not be collected.
Accounts receivable is reported on the balance sheet; thus, it
is called the balance sheet method. The balance sheet method
is another simple method for calculating bad debt, but it too
does not consider how long a debt has been outstanding and
the role that plays in debt recovery. There is a variation on the
balance sheet method, however, called the aging method that
does consider how long accounts receivable have been owed,
and it assigns a greater potential for default to those debts that
have been owed for the longest period of time.

   Continuing our examination of the balance sheet method,
assume that BWW's end-of-year accounts receivable balance
totaled $324,850. This entry assumes a zero balance in
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts from the prior period. BWW
estimates 15% of its overall accounts receivable will result in bad
debt. The following adjusting journal entry for bad debt occurs.

406 | 3.3 Bad Debt Expense and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Figure 3.39 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

Bad Debt Expense increases (debit), and Allowance for
Doubtful Accounts increases (credit) for $48,727.50 ($324,850
 15%). This means that BWW believes $48,727.50 will be
uncollectible debt. Let's consider that BWW had a $23,000
credit balance from the previous period. The adjusting journal
entry would recognize the following.

Figure 3.40 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

This is different from the last journal entry, where bad debt
was estimated at $48,727.50. That journal entry assumed a zero
balance in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts from the prior
period. This journal entry takes into account a credit balance
of $23,000 and subtracts the prior period's balance from the
estimated balance in the current period of $48,727.50.

Balance Sheet Aging of Receivables
Method for Calculating Bad Debt Expenses

The balance sheet aging of receivables method estimates bad
debt expenses based on the balance in accounts receivable,
but it also considers the uncollectible time period for each
account. The longer the time passes with a receivable unpaid,
the lower the probability that it will get collected. An account
that is 90 days overdue is more likely to be unpaid than an
account that is 30 days past due.

   With this method, accounts receivable is organized into
categories by length of time outstanding, and an uncollectible
percentage is assigned to each category. The length of
uncollectible time increases the percentage assigned. For
example, a category might consist of accounts receivable that
is 0-30 days past due and is assigned an uncollectible
percentage of 6%. Another category might be 31-60 days past
due and is assigned an uncollectible percentage of 15%. All
categories of estimated uncollectible amounts are summed
to get a total estimated uncollectible balance. That total is
reported in Bad Debt Expense and Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts, if there is no carryover balance from a prior period.
If there is a carryover balance, that must be considered before
recording Bad Debt Expense. The balance sheet aging of
receivables method is more complicated than the other two

408 | 3.3 Bad Debt Expense and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
methods, but it tends to produce more accurate results. This
is because it considers the amount of time that accounts
receivable has been owed, and it assumes that the longer the
time owed, the greater the possibility that individual accounts
receivable will prove to be uncollectible.

   Looking at BWW, it has an accounts receivable balance of
$324,850 at the end of the year. The company splits its past-
due accounts into three categories: 0-30 days past due, 31-90
days past due, and over 90 days past due. The uncollectible
percentages and the accounts receivable breakdown are
shown here.

Figure 3.42 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

For each of the individual categories, the accountant multiplies
the uncollectible percentage by the accounts receivable total
for that category to get the total balance of estimated accounts
that will prove to be uncollectible for that category. Then all
of the category estimates are added together to get one total
estimated uncollectible balance for the period. The entry for
bad debt would be as follows, if there was no carryover balance
from the prior period.

3.3 Bad Debt Expense and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts | 409
Bad Debt Expense increases (debit) as does Allowance for
Doubtful Accounts (credit) for $58,097. BWW believes that
$58,097 will be uncollectible debt.

   Let's consider a situation where BWW had a $20,000 debit
balance from the previous period. The adjusting journal entry
would recognize the following.

Figure 3.44 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

This is different from the last journal entry, where bad debt
was estimated at $58,097. That journal entry assumed a zero
balance in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts from the prior
period. This journal entry takes into account a debit balance of
$20,000 and adds the prior period's balance to the estimated
balance of $58,097 in the current period.

Figure 3.45 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

You may notice that all three methods use the same accounts
for the adjusting entry; only the method changes the financial
outcome. Also note that it is a requirement that the estimation
method be disclosed in the notes of financial statements so
stakeholders can make informed decisions.

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles

As of January 1, 2018, GAAP requires a change in how health-
care entities record bad debt expense. Before this change,
these entities would record revenues for billed services, even if
they did not expect to collect any payment from the patient.
This uncollectible amount would then be reported in Bad Debt
Expense. Under the new guidance, the bad debt amount may
only be recorded if there is an unexpected circumstance that
prevented the patient from paying the bill, and it may only
be calculated from the amount that the providing entity
anticipated collecting.

   For example, a patient receives medical services at a local
hospital that cost $1,000. The hospital knows in advance that
the patient will pay only $100 of the amount owed. The previous
GAAP rules would allow the company to write off $900 to bad
debt. Under the current rule, the company may only consider
revenue to be the expected amount of $100. For example, if
the patient ran into an unexpected job loss and is able to pay
only $20 of the $100 expected, the hospital would record the
$20 to revenue and the $80 ($100 - $20) as a write-off to bad
debt. This is a significant change in revenue reporting and bad

debt expense. Health-care entities will more than likely see a
decrease in bad debt expense and revenues as a result of this
change.1

3.4 Bad Debts & the
Allowance-
Comprehensive
Example

The following comprehensive example will illustrate the bad
debt estimation process from the sales transaction to
adjusting entry reporting for all three bad debt estimation
methods: income statement, balance sheet, and balance sheet
aging of receivables.

   Furniture Direct sells office furniture to large scale
businesses. Because the purchases are typically large,
Furniture Direct allows customers to pay on credit using an in-
house account. At the end of the year, Furniture Direct must
estimate bad debt using one of the three estimation methods.
It is currently using the income statement method and
estimates bad debt at 5% of credit sales. If it were to switch
to the balance sheet method, it would estimate bad debt at
8% of accounts receivable. If it were to use the balance sheet
aging of receivables method, it would split its receivables into
three categories: 0-30 days past due at 5%, 31-90 days past due
at 10%, and over 90 days past due at 20%. There is currently
a zero balance, transferred from the prior year's Allowance for
Doubtful Accounts. The following information is available from
the year-end income statement and balance sheet.

There is also additional information regarding the distribution
of accounts receivable by age.

Figure 3.47 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

If the company were to maintain the income statement
method, the total bad debt estimation would be $67,500
($1,350,000  5%), and the following adjusting entry would
occur.

Figure 3.48 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

If the company were to use the balance sheet method, the total
bad debt estimation would be $59,600 ($745,000  8%), and the
following adjusting entry would occur.

3.5 Notes Receivable

So far, our discussion of receivables has focused solely on
accounts receivable. Companies, however, can expand their
business models to include more than one type of receivable.
This receivable expansion allows a company to attract a more
diverse clientele and increase asset potential to further grow
the business.

   As you've learned, accounts receivable is typically a more
informal arrangement between a company and customer that
is resolved within a year and does not include interest
payments. In contrast, notes receivable (an asset) is a more
formal legal contract between the buyer and the company,
which requires a specific payment amount at a predetermined
future date. The length of contract is typically over a year, or
beyond one operating cycle. There is also generally an interest
requirement because the financial loan amount may be larger
than accounts receivable, and the length of contract is possibly
longer. A note can be requested or extended in exchange for
products and services or in exchange for cash (usually in the
case of a financial lender). Several characteristics of notes
receivable further define the contract elements and scope of
use.

Characteristics of Notes Receivable

Notes receivable have several defining characteristics that
include principal, length of contract terms, and interest.
The principal of a note is the initial loan amount, not including
interest, requested by the customer. If a customer approaches
a lender, requesting $2,000, this amount is the principal. The
date on which the security agreement is initially established is
the issue date. A note's maturity date is the date at which the
principal and interest become due and payable. The maturity
date is established in the initial note contract. For example,
when the previously mentioned customer requested the
$2,000 loan on January 1, 2018, terms of repayment included
a maturity date of 24 months. This means that the loan will
mature in two years, and the principal and interest are due
at that time. The following journal entries occur at the note's
established start date. The first entry shows a note receivable
in exchange for a product or service, and the second entry
illustrates the note from the point of view that a $2,000 loan
was issued by a financial institution to a customer (borrower).

Figure 3.58 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

Before realization of the maturity date, the note is
accumulating interest revenue for the lender. Interest is a

418 | 3.5 Notes Receivable
monetary incentive to the lender that justifies loan risk. An
annual interest rate is established with the loan terms.
The interest rate is the part of a loan charged to the borrower,
expressed as an annual percentage of the outstanding loan
amount. Interest is accrued daily, and this accumulation must
be recorded periodically (each month for example). The
Revenue Recognition Principle requires that the interest
revenue accrued is recorded in the period when earned.
Periodic interest accrued is recorded in Interest Revenue and
Interest Receivable. To calculate interest, the company can use
the following formulas. The following example uses months
but the calculation could also be based on a 365-day year.

Figure 3.59 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

Another common way to state the interest formula is Interest
= Principal  Rate  Time. From the previous example, the
company offered a $2,000 note with a maturity date of 24
months. The annual interest rate on the loan is 10%. Each
period the company needs to record an entry for accumulated
interest during the period. In this example, the first year's
interest revenue accumulation is computed as 10%  $2,000 
(12  12) = $200. The $200 is recognized in Interest Revenue and
Interest Receivable.

Figure 3.60 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

                                                                   3.5 Notes Receivable | 419
When interest is due at the end of the note (24 months), the
company may record the collection of the loan principal and
the accumulated interest. These transactions can be recorded
as one entry or two. The first set of entries show collection of
principal, followed by collection of the interest.

Figure 3.61 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

Interest revenue from year one had already been recorded in
2018, but the interest revenue from 2019 is not recorded until
the end of the note term. Thus, Interest Revenue is increasing
(credit) by $200, the remaining revenue earned but not yet
recognized. Interest Receivable decreasing (credit) reflects the
2018 interest owed from the customer that is paid to the
company at the end of 2019. The second possibility is one entry
recognizing principal and interest collection.

Figure 3.62 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

If the note term does not exceed one accounting period, the
entry showing note collection may not reflect interest
receivable. For example, let's say the company's note maturity
date was 12 months instead of 24 (payment in full occurs
420 | 3.5 Notes Receivable
December 31, 2018). The entry to record collection of the
principal and interest follows.

Figure 3.63 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

                    One or more interactive elements has been

        acctg211/?p=230#oembed-1

The examples provided account for collection of the note in
full on the maturity date, which is considered an honored note.
But what if the customer does not pay within the specified
contract length? This situation is considered a dishonored note.
A lender will still pursue collection of the note but will not
maintain a long-term receivable on its books. Instead, the
lender will convert the notes receivable and interest due into
an account receivable. Sometimes a company will classify and
label the uncollected account as a Dishonored Note
Receivable. Using our example, if the company was unable to
collect the $2,000 from the customer at the 12-month maturity
date, the following entry would occur.

                                                                   3.5 Notes Receivable | 421
Figure 3.64 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

If it is still unable to collect, the company may consider selling
the receivable to a collection agency. When this occurs, the
collection agency pays the company a fraction of the note's
value, and the company would write off any difference as a
factoring (third-party debt collection) expense. Let's say that
our example company turned over the $2,200 accounts
receivable to a collection agency on March 5, 2019 and received
only $500 for its value. The difference between $2,200 and $500
of $1,700 is the factoring expense.

Figure 3.65 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

Notes receivable can convert to accounts receivable, as
illustrated, but accounts receivable can also convert to notes
receivable. The transition from accounts receivable to notes
receivable can occur when a customer misses a payment on
a short-term credit line for products or services. In this case,
the company could extend the payment period and require
interest.

   For example, a company may have an outstanding account
receivable in the amount of $1,000. The customer negotiates
with the company on June 1 for a six-month note maturity date,

422 | 3.5 Notes Receivable
12% annual interest rate, and $250 cash up front. The company
records the following entry at contract establishment.

Illustrated Examples of Notes Receivable

To illustrate notes receivable scenarios, let's return to Billie's
Watercraft Warehouse (BWW) as the example. BWW has a
customer, Waterways Corporation, that tends to have larger
purchases that require an extended payment period. On
January 1, 2018, Waterways purchased merchandise in the
amount of $250,000. BWW agreed to lend the $250,000
purchase cost (sales price) to Waterways under the following
conditions. First, BWW agrees to accept a note payable issued
by Waterways. The conditions of the note are that the principal
amount is $250,000, the maturity date on the note is 24
months, and the annual interest rate is 12%. On January 1, 2018,
BWW records the following entry.

                                                                  3.5 Notes Receivable | 423
Figure 3.67 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

Notes Receivable: Waterways increases (debit), and Sales
Revenue increases (credit) for the principal amount of
$250,000. On December 31, 2018, BWW records interest
accumulated on the note for 12 months.

Interest Receivable: Waterways increases (debit) as does
Interest Revenue (credit) for 12 months of interest computed
as $250,000  12%  (12  12). On December 31, 2019, Waterways
Corporation honors the note; BWW records this collection as a
single entry.

Waterways decreases (credit) for the 2018 accumulated interest
amount of $30,000, and Interest Revenue increases (credit) for
the 2019 interest collection amount of $30,000.

   BWW does business with Sea Ferries Inc. BWW issued Sea
Ferries a note in the amount of $100,000 on January 1, 2018,
with a maturity date of six months, at a 10% annual interest
rate. On July 2, BWW determined that Sea Ferries dishonored
its note and recorded the following entry to convert this debt
into accounts receivable.

Figure 3.70 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

Accounts Receivable: Sea Ferries increases (debit) for the
principal note amount plus interest, Notes Receivable: Sea
Ferries decreases (credit) for the principal amount due, and
Interest Revenue increases (credit) for interest earned at
maturity. Interest is computed as $100,000  10%  (6  12). On
September 1, 2018, BWW determines that Sea Ferries's account
will be uncollectible and sells the balance to a collection
agency for a total of $35,000.

of $35,000, Factoring Expense increases (debit) for the
outstanding amount and the discounted sales price, and
Accounts Receivable: Sea Ferries decreases (credit) for the
original amount owed.

   Alliance Cruises is a customer of BWW with an outstanding
accounts receivable balance of $50,000. Alliance is unable to
pay in full on schedule, so it negotiates with BWW on March 1
to convert its accounts receivable into a notes receivable. BWW
agrees to the following terms: six-month note maturity date,
18% annual interest rate, and $10,000 cash up front. BWW
records the following entry at contract establishment.

3.6 Tangible v
Intangible Assets

Assets are items a business owns.3 For accounting purposes,
assets are categorized as current versus long term, and
tangible versus intangible. Assets that are expected to be used
by the business for more than one year are considered long-
term assets. They are not intended for resale and are
anticipated to help generate revenue for the business in the
future. Some common long-term assets are computers and
other office machines, buildings, vehicles, software, computer
code, and copyrights. Although these are all considered long-
term assets, some are tangible and some are intangible.

Tangible Assets

An asset is considered a tangible asset when it is an economic
resource that has physical substance--it can be seen and
touched. Tangible assets can be either short term, such as
inventory and supplies, or long term, such as land, buildings,
and equipment. To be considered a long-term tangible asset,
the item needs to be used in the normal operation of the
business for more than one year, not be near the end of its
useful life, and the company must have no plan to sell the item
in the near future. The useful life is the time period over which
an asset cost is allocated. Long-term tangible assets are known
as fixed assets.

   Businesses typically need many different types of these
assets to meet their objectives. These assets differ from the
company's products. For example, the computers that Apple
Inc. intends to sell are considered inventory (a short-term

                                                  3.6 Tangible v Intangible Assets | 427
asset), whereas the computers Apple's employees use for day-
to-day operations are long-term assets. In Liam's case, the new
silk-screening machine would be considered a long-term
tangible asset as he plans to use it over many years to help him
generate revenue for his business. Long-term tangible assets
are listed as noncurrent assets on a company's balance sheet.
Typically, these assets are listed under the category of Property,
Plant, and Equipment (PP&E), but they may be referred to as
fixed assets or plant assets.

   Apple Inc. lists a total of $33,783,000,000 in total Property,
Plant and Equipment (net) on its 2017 consolidated balance
sheet (see Figure 3.73).4 As shown in the figure, this net total
includes land and buildings, machinery, equipment and
internal-use software, and leasehold improvements, resulting
in a gross PP&E of $75,076,000,000--less accumulated
depreciation and amortization of $41,293,000,000--to arrive at
the net amount of $33,783,000,000.

Intangible Assets

Companies may have other long-term assets used in the

428 | 3.6 Tangible v Intangible Assets
operations of the business that they do not intend to sell, but
that do not have physical substance; these assets still provide
specific rights to the owner and are called intangible assets.
These assets typically appear on the balance sheet following
long-term tangible assets (see Figure 3.74.)5 Examples of
intangible assets are patents, copyrights, franchises, licenses,
goodwill, sometimes software, and trademarks (Table 3.2).
Because the value of intangible assets is very subjective, it is
usually not shown on the balance sheet until there is an event
that indicates value objectively, such as the purchase of an
intangible asset.

   A company often records the costs of developing an
intangible asset internally as expenses, not assets, especially if
there is ambiguity in the expense amounts or economic life of
the asset. However, there are also conditions under which the
costs can be allocated over the anticipated life of the asset. (The
treatment of intangible asset costs can be quite complex and
is taught in advanced accounting courses.)

         University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Asset    Useful Life

Patents  Twenty years

Trademarks Renewable every ten years

Copyrights Seventy years beyond death of creator

Goodwill Indefinite

Patents

A patent is a contract that provides a company exclusive rights
to produce and sell a unique product. The rights are granted to
the inventor by the federal government and provide exclusivity
from competition for twenty years. Patents are common within
the pharmaceutical industry as they provide an opportunity for
drug companies to recoup the significant financial investment
on research and development of a new drug. Once the new
drug is produced, the company can sell it for twenty years with
no direct competition.

Trademarks and Copyrights

A company's trademark is the exclusive right to the name,
term, or symbol it uses to identify itself or its products. Federal
law allows companies to register their trademarks to protect
them from use by others. Trademark registration lasts for ten
years with optional 10-year renewable periods. This protection
helps prevent impersonators from selling a product similar to
another or using its name. For example, a burger joint could
not start selling the "Big Mac." Although it has no physical
substance, the exclusive right to a term or logo has value to a
company and is therefore recorded as an asset.

430 | 3.6 Tangible v Intangible Assets
   A copyright provides the exclusive right to reproduce and sell
artistic, literary, or musical compositions. Anyone who owns the
copyright to a specific piece of work has exclusive rights to
that work. Copyrights in the United States last seventy years
beyond the death of the original author. While you might not
be overly interested in what seems to be an obscure law, it
actually directly affects you and your fellow students. It is one
of the primary reasons that your copy of the Collected Works
of William Shakespeare costs about $40 in your bookstore or
online, while a textbook, such as Principles of
Biology or Principles of Accounting, can run in the hundreds of
dollars.

Goodwill

Goodwill is a unique intangible asset. Goodwill refers to the
value of certain favorable factors that a business possesses that
allows it to generate a greater rate of return or profit. Such
factors include superior management, a skilled workforce,
quality products or service, great geographic location, and
overall reputation. Companies typically record goodwill when
they acquire another business in which the purchase price is
in excess of the fair value of the identifiable net assets. The
difference is recorded as goodwill on the purchaser's balance
sheet. For example, the goodwill of $5,717,000,000 that we see
on Apple's consolidated balance sheets for 2017 (see Figure
3.74) was created when Apple purchased another business for
a purchase price exceeding the book value of its net assets.

3.7 Recording the
Initial Purchase of an
Asset

Assets are recorded on the balance sheet at cost, meaning that
all costs to purchase the asset and to prepare the asset for
operation should be included. Costs outside of the purchase
price may include shipping, taxes, installation, and
modifications to the asset.

   The journal entry to record the purchase of a fixed asset
(assuming that a note payable is used for financing and not a
short-term account payable) is shown here.

3.9 Depreciation:
Allocation of
Long-term Asset Cost

Fundamentals of Depreciation

As you have learned, when accounting for a long-term fixed
asset, we cannot simply record an expense for the cost of the
asset and record the entire outflow of cash in one accounting
period. Like all other assets, when purchasing or acquiring a
long-term asset, it must be recorded at the historical (initial)
cost, which includes all costs to acquire the asset and put it into
use. The initial recording of an asset has two steps:

 1. Record the initial purchase on the date of purchase, which
      places the asset on the balance sheet (as property, plant,
      and equipment) at cost, and record the amount as notes
      payable, accounts payable, or an outflow of cash.

2. At the end of the period, make an adjusting entry to
      recognize the depreciation expense. Companies may
      record depreciation expense incurred annually, quarterly,
      or monthly.

Following GAAP and the expense recognition principle, the
depreciation expense is recognized over the asset's estimated
useful life.

436 | 3.9 Depreciation: Allocation of Long-term Asset Cost
CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

Estimating Useful Life and Salvage Value

Useful life and salvage value are estimates made at the time
an asset is placed in service. It is common and expected that
the estimates are inaccurate with the uncertainty involved in
estimating the future. Sometimes, however, a company may
attempt to take advantage of estimating salvage value and
useful life to improve earnings. A larger salvage value and
longer useful life decrease annual depreciation expense and
increase annual net income. An example of this behavior
is Waste Management, which was disciplined by the Securities
and Exchange Commission for fraudulently altering its
estimates to reduce depreciation expense and overstate net
income by $1.7 billion.6

Components Used in Calculating
Depreciation

The expense recognition principle that requires that the cost of
the asset be allocated over the asset's useful life is the process
of depreciation. For example, if we buy a delivery truck to use
for the next five years, we would allocate the cost and record
depreciation expense across the entire five-year period. The
calculation of the depreciation expense for a period is not
based on anticipated changes in the fair market value of the
asset; instead, the depreciation is based on the allocation of the
cost of owning the asset over the period of its useful life.

                  3.9 Depreciation: Allocation of Long-term Asset Cost | 437
   The following items are important in determining and
recording depreciation:

   Book value: the asset's original cost less accumulated
      depreciation.

   Useful life: the length of time the asset will be
      productively used within operations.

   Salvage (residual) value: the price the asset will sell for or
      be worth as a trade-in when its useful life expires. The
      determination of salvage value can be an inexact science,
      since it requires anticipating what will occur in the future.
      Often, the salvage value is estimated based on past
      experiences with similar assets.

   Depreciable base (cost): the depreciation expense over
      the asset's useful life. For example, if we paid $50,000 for
      an asset and anticipate a salvage value of $10,000, the
      depreciable base is $40,000. We expect $40,000 in
      depreciation over the time period in which the asset was
      used, and then it would be sold for $10,000.

Depreciation records an expense for the value of an asset
consumed and removes that portion of the asset from the
balance sheet. The journal entry to record depreciation is
shown here.

Figure 3.78 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

Depreciation expense is a common operating expense that
appears on an income statement. Accumulated depreciation is
a contra account, meaning it is attached to another account
and is used to offset the main account balance that records

438 | 3.9 Depreciation: Allocation of Long-term Asset Cost
the total depreciation expense for a fixed asset over its life.
In this case, the asset account stays recorded at the historical
value but is offset on the balance sheet by accumulated
depreciation. Accumulated depreciation is subtracted from
the historical cost of the asset on the balance sheet to show the
asset at book value. Book value is the amount of the asset that
has not been allocated to expense through depreciation.

Figure 3.79 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

In this case, the asset's book value is $20,000: the historical cost

of $25,000 less the accumulated depreciation of $5,000.

It is important to note, however, that not all long-term assets

are depreciated. For example, land is not depreciated because

depreciation is the allocating of the expense of an asset over

its useful life. How can one determine a useful life for land? It

is assumed that land has an unlimited useful life; therefore, it is

not depreciated, and it remains on the books at historical cost.

Once it is determined that depreciation should be accounted

for, there are three methods that are most commonly used to

calculate the allocation of depreciation expense: the straight-

line method, the units-of-production method, and the double-

declining-balance method. A fourth method,

the sum-of-the-years-digits method,                           is

another accelerated option that has been losing popularity

3.9 Depreciation: Allocation of Long-term Asset Cost | 439
and can be learned in intermediate accounting courses. Let's
use the following scenario involving Kenzie Company to work
through these three methods.

   Assume that on January 1, 2019, Kenzie Company bought a
printing press for $54,000. Kenzie pays shipping costs of $1,500
and setup costs of $2,500, assumes a useful life of five years
or 960,000 pages. Based on experience, Kenzie Company
anticipates a salvage value of $10,000.

   Recall that determination of the costs to be depreciated
requires including all costs that prepare the asset for use by
the company. The Kenzie example would include shipping and
setup costs. Any costs for maintaining or repairing the
equipment would be treated as regular expenses, so the total
cost would be $58,000, and, after allowing for an anticipated
salvage value of $10,000 in five years, the business could take
$48,000 in depreciation over the machine's economic life.

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

Fixed Assets

You work for Georgia-Pacific as an accountant in charge of the
fixed assets subsidiary ledger at a production and warehouse
facility in Pennsylvania. The facility is in the process of updating
and replacing several asset categories, including warehouse
storage units, fork trucks, and equipment on the production
line. It is your job to keep the information in the fixed assets
subsidiary ledger up to date and accurate. You need
information on original historical cost, estimated useful life,
salvage value, depreciation methods, and additional capital
expenditures. You are excited about the new purchases and
upgrades to the facility and how they will help the company
serve its customers better. However, you have been in your
current position for only a few years and have never overseen
extensive updates, and you realize that you will have to gather
a lot of information at once to keep the accounting records
accurate. You feel overwhelmed and take a minute to catch
your breath and think through what you need. After a few
minutes, you realize that you have many people and many
resources to work with to tackle this project. Whom will you
work with and how will you go about gathering what you
need?

Straight-Line Depreciation

Straight-line depreciation is a method of depreciation that
evenly splits the depreciable amount across the useful life of

                   3.9 Depreciation: Allocation of Long-term Asset Cost | 441
the asset. Therefore, we must determine the yearly
depreciation expense by dividing the depreciable base of
$48,000 by the economic life of five years, giving an annual
depreciation expense of $9,600. The journal entries to record
the first two years of expenses are shown, along with the
balance sheet information. Here are the journal entry and
information for year one:

Figure 3.81 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

Figure 3.82 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

After the journal entry in year one, the press would have a book
value of $48,400. This is the original cost of $58,000 less the
accumulated depreciation of $9,600. Here are the journal entry
and information for year two:

Figure 3.83 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

442 | 3.9 Depreciation: Allocation of Long-term Asset Cost
Figure 3.84 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

Kenzie records an annual depreciation expense of $9,600. Each
year, the accumulated depreciation balance increases by
$9,600, and the press's book value decreases by the same
$9,600. At the end of five years, the asset will have a book value
of $10,000, which is calculated by subtracting the accumulated
depreciation of $48,000 (5  $9,600) from the cost of $58,000.

Units-of-Production Depreciation

Straight-line depreciation is efficient, accounting for assets
used consistently over their lifetime, but what about assets
that are used with less regularity? The units-of-production
depreciation method bases depreciation on the actual usage
of the asset, which is more appropriate when an asset's life is
a function of usage instead of time. For example, this method
could account for depreciation of a printing press for which the
depreciable base is $48,000 (as in the straight-line method),
but now the number of pages the press prints is important.

   In our example, the press will have total depreciation of
$48,000 over its useful life of 960,000 pages. Therefore, we
would divide $48,000 by 960,000 pages to get a cost per page
of $0.05. If Kenzie printed 180,000 pages in the first year, the
depreciation expense would be 180,000 pages  $0.05 per
page, or $9,000. The journal entry to record this expense would
be the same as with straight-line depreciation: only the dollar
amount would have changed. The presentation of

                  3.9 Depreciation: Allocation of Long-term Asset Cost | 443
accumulated depreciation and the calculation of the book
value would also be the same. Kenzie would continue to
depreciate the asset until a total of $48,000 in depreciation was
taken after printing 960,000 total pages.

Double-Declining-Balance Depreciation

The double-declining-balance depreciation method is the
most complex of the three methods because it accounts for
both time and usage and takes more expense in the first few
years of the asset's life. Double-declining considers time by
determining the percentage of depreciation expense that
would exist under straight-line depreciation. To calculate this,
divide 100% by the estimated life in years. For example, a five-
year asset would be 100  5, or 20% a year. A four-year asset
would be 100  4, or 25% a year. Next, because assets are
typically more efficient and "used" more heavily early in their
life span, the double-declining method takes usage into
account by doubling the straight-line percentage. For a four-
year asset, multiply 25% (100%  4-year life)  2, or 50%. For a
five-year asset, multiply 20% (100%  5-year life)  2, or 40%.

   One unique feature of the double-declining-balance method
is that in the first year, the estimated salvage value is not
subtracted from the total asset cost before calculating the first
year's depreciation expense. Instead the total cost is multiplied
by the calculated percentage. However, depreciation expense
is not permitted to take the book value below the estimated
salvage value, as demonstrated in the following text.

444 | 3.9 Depreciation: Allocation of Long-term Asset Cost
Figure 3.85 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA Long
Description

Notice that in year four, the remaining book value of $12,528
was not multiplied by 40%. This is because the expense would
have been $5,011.20, and since we cannot depreciate the asset
below the estimated salvage value of $10,000, the expense
cannot exceed $2,528, which is the amount left to depreciate
(difference between the book value of $12,528 and the salvage
value of $10,000). Since the asset has been depreciated to its
salvage value at the end of year four, no depreciation can be
taken in year five.

   In our example, the first year's double-declining-balance
depreciation expense would be $58,000  40%, or $23,200. For
the remaining years, the double-declining percentage is
multiplied by the remaining book value of the asset. Kenzie
would continue to depreciate the asset until the book value
and the estimated salvage value are the same (in this case
$10,000).

   The net effect of the differences in straight-line depreciation
versus double-declining-balance depreciation is that under the
double-declining-balance method, the allowable depreciation
expenses are greater in the earlier years than those allowed
for straight-line depreciation. However, over the depreciable
life of the asset, the total depreciation expense taken will be
the same, no matter which method the entity chooses. For
example, in the current example both straight-line and double-

                  3.9 Depreciation: Allocation of Long-term Asset Cost | 445
declining-balance depreciation will provide a total depreciation
expense of $48,000 over its five-year depreciable life.

Summary of Depreciation

Table 3.3 compares the three methods discussed. Note that
although each time-based (straight-line and double-declining
balance) annual depreciation expense is different, after five
years the total amount depreciated (accumulated
depreciation) is the same. This occurs because at the end of
the asset's useful life, it was expected to be worth $10,000: thus,
both methods depreciated the asset's value by $48,000 over
that time period.

   The units of production method is different from the two
above methods in that while those methods are based on time
factors, the units of production is based on usage. However, the
total amount of depreciation taken over an asset's economic
life will still be the same. In our example, the total depreciation
will be $48,000, even though the sum-of-the-years-digits
method could take only two or three years or possibly six or
seven years to be allocated.

Partial-Year Depreciation

A company will usually only own depreciable assets for a
portion of a year in the year of purchase or disposal. Companies
must be consistent in how they record depreciation for assets
owned for a partial year. A common method is to allocate
depreciation expense based on the number of months the
asset is owned in a year. For example, a company purchases
an asset with a total cost of $58,000, a five-year useful life, and
a salvage value of $10,000. The annual depreciation is $9,600
([$58,000 - 10,000]  5). However, the asset is purchased at the
beginning of the fourth month of the fiscal year. The company
will own the asset for nine months of the first year. The
depreciation expense of the first year is $7,200 ($9,600  9/

                  3.9 Depreciation: Allocation of Long-term Asset Cost | 447
12). The company will depreciate the asset $9,600 for the next
four years, but only $2,400 in the sixth year so that the total
depreciation of the asset over its useful life is the depreciable
amount of $48,000 ($7,200 + 9,600 + 9,600 + 9,600 + 9,600 +
2,400).

Special Issues in Depreciation

While you've now learned thebasic foundationof the major
available depreciation methods, there are a few special issues.
Until now, we have assumed a definite physical or
economically functional useful life for the depreciable assets.
However, in some situations, depreciable assets can be used
beyond their useful life. If so desired, the company could
continue to use the asset beyond the original estimated
economic life. In this case, a new remaining depreciation
expense would be calculated based on the remaining
depreciable base and estimated remaining economic life.

   Assume in the earlier Kenzie example that after five years and
$48,000 in accumulated depreciation, the company estimated
that it could use the asset for two more years, at which point
the salvage value would be $0. The company would be able to
take an additional $10,000 in depreciation over the extended
two-year period, or $5,000 a year, using the straight-line
method.

   As with the straight-line example, the asset could be used
for more than five years, with depreciation recalculated at the
end of year five using the double-declining balance method.
While the process of calculating the additional depreciation for
the double-declining-balance method would differ from that
of the straight-line method, it would also allow the company
to take an additional $10,000 after year five, as with the other
methods, so long as the cost of $58,000 is not exceeded.

   As a side note, there often is a difference in useful lives for
assets when following GAAP versus the guidelines for
depreciation under federal tax law, as enforced by the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS). This difference is not unexpected when
you consider that tax law is typically determined by the United
States Congress, and there often is an economic reason for tax
policy.

   For example, if we want to increase investment in real estate,

450 | 3.9 Depreciation: Allocation of Long-term Asset Cost
shortening the economic lives of real estate for taxation
calculations can have a positive increasing effect on new
construction. If we want to slow down new production,
extending the economic life can have the desired slowing
effect. In this course, we concentrate on financial accounting
depreciation principles rather than tax depreciation.

Fundamentals of Depletion of Natural
Resources

Another type of fixed asset is natural resources, assets a
company owns that are consumed when used. Examples
include lumber, mineral deposits, and oil/gas fields. These
assets are considered natural resources while they are still part
of the land; as they are extracted from the land and converted
into products, they are then accounted for as inventory (raw
materials). Natural resources are recorded on the company's
books like a fixed asset, at cost, with total costs including all
expenses to acquire and prepare the resource for its intended
use.

   As the resource is consumed (converted to a product), the
cost of the asset must be expensed: this process is
called depletion. As with depreciation of nonnatural resource
assets, a contra account called accumulated depletion, which
records the total depletion expense for a natural resource over
its life, offsets the natural resource asset account. Depletion
expense is typically calculated based on the number of units
extracted from cutting, mining, or pumping the resource from
the land, similar to the units-of-production method. For
example, assume a company has an oil well with an estimated
10,000 gallons of crude oil. The company purchased this well
for $1,000,000, and the well is expected to have no salvage
value once it is pumped dry. The depletion cost per gallon will

                   3.9 Depreciation: Allocation of Long-term Asset Cost | 451
be $1,000,000  10,000 = $100. If the company extracts 4,000
gallons of oil in a given year, the depletion expense will be
$400,000.

Fundamentals of Amortization of an
Intangible

Recall that intangible assets are recorded as long-term assets
at their cost. As with tangible assets, many intangible assets
have a finite (limited) life span so their costs must be allocated
over their useful lives: this process is amortization. Depreciation
and amortization are similar in nature but have some
important differences. First, amortization is typically only done
using the straight-line method. Second, there is usually no
salvage value for intangible assets because they are completely
used up over their life span. Finally, an accumulated
amortization account is not required to record yearly expenses
(as is needed with depreciation); instead, the intangible asset
account is written down each period.

   For example, a company called Patents-R-Us purchased a
product patent for $10,000, granting the company exclusive
use of that product for the next twenty years. Therefore, unless
the company does not think the product will be useful for
all twenty years (at that point the company would use the
shorter useful life of the product), the company will record
amortization expense of $500 a year or ($10,000  20 years).
Assuming that it was placed into service on October 1, 2019, the
journal entry would be as follows:

                  3.9 Depreciation: Allocation of Long-term Asset Cost | 453
3.8 Capitalized Costs v.
Expenses

When a business purchases a long-term asset (used for more
than one year), it classifies the asset based on whether the
asset is used in the business's operations. If a long-term asset
is used in the business operations, it will belong in property,
plant, and equipment or intangible assets. In this situation the
asset is typically capitalized. Capitalization is the process by
which a long-term asset is recorded on the balance sheet and
its allocated costs are expensed on the income statement over
the asset's economic life.

        In short- CAPITALIZE means to record the item as an
                       ASSET on the BALANCE SHEET.

   EXPENSE items that do not have long-term, future value or
                        are immaterial (small dollars).

     Long-term assets that are not used in daily operations are
typically classified as an investment. For example, if a business
 owns land on which it operates a store, warehouse, factory, or

   offices, the cost of that land would be included in property,
  plant, and equipment. However, if a business owns a vacant
  piece of land on which the business conducts no operations

    (and assuming no current or intermediate-term plans for
 development), the land would be considered an investment.

Property, Plant, and Equipment (Fixed
Assets)

Why are the costs of putting a long-term asset into service
capitalized and written off as expenses (depreciated) over the
economic life of the asset? Let's return to Liam's start-up
business as an example. Liam plans to buy a silk-screening
machine to help create clothing that he will sell. The machine is
a long-term asset, because it will be used in the business's daily
operation for many years. If the machine costs Liam $5,000
and it is expected to be used in his business for several years,
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) require the
allocation of the machine's costs over its useful life, which is
the period over which it will produce revenues. Overall, in
determining a company's financial performance, we would not
expect that Liam should have an expense of $5,000 this year
and $0 in expenses for this machine for future years in which
it is being used. GAAP addressed this through the expense
recognition (matching) principle, which states that expenses
should be recorded in the same period with the revenues that
the expense helped create. In Liam's case, the $5,000 for this
machine should be allocated over the years in which it helps
to generate revenue for the business. Capitalizing the machine
allows this to occur. As stated previously, to capitalize is to
record a long-term asset on the balance sheet and expense

                                                3.8 Capitalized Costs v. Expenses | 455
its allocated costs on the income statement over the asset's
economic life. Therefore, when Liam purchases the machine,
he will record it as an asset on the financial statements.

Figure 3.75 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

When capitalizing an asset, the total cost of acquiring the asset
is included in the cost of the asset. This includes additional
costs beyond the purchase price, such as shipping costs, taxes,
assembly, and legal fees. For example, if a real estate broker
is paid $8,000 as part of a transaction to purchase land for
$100,000, the land would be recorded at a cost of $108,000.

   Over time as the asset is used to generate revenue, Liam will
need to depreciate the asset.

   Depreciation is the process of allocating the cost of a
tangible asset over its useful life, or the period of time that the
business believes it will use the asset to help generate revenue.

Investments

A short-term or long-term asset that is not used in the day-
to-day operations of the business is considered an investment
and is not expensed, since the company does not expect to use
up the asset over time. On the contrary, the company hopes
that the assets (investment) would grow in value over time.
Short-term investments are investments that are expected to
be sold within a year and are recorded as current assets.

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

Vehicle Repairs and Enhancements

Automobiles are a useful way of looking at the difference
between repair and maintenance expenses and capitalized
modifications. Routine repairs such as brake pad replacements
are recorded as repair and maintenance expense. They are an
expected part of owning a vehicle. However, a car may be
modified to change its appearance or performance. For
example, if a supercharger is added to a car to increase its
horsepower, the car's performance is increased, and the cost
should be included as a part of the vehicle asset. Likewise, if
replacing the engine of an older car extends its useful life, that
cost would also be capitalized.

Repair and Maintenance Costs of Property,
Plant, and Equipment

Long-term assets may have additional costs associated with
them over time. These additional costs may be capitalized or
expensed based on the nature of the cost. For
example, Walmart's financial statements explain that major
improvements are capitalized, while costs of normal repairs
and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.

   An amount spent is considered a current expense, or an
amount charged in the current period, if the amount incurred
did not help to extend the life of or improve the asset. For
example, if a service company cleans and maintains Liam's
silk-screening machine every six months, that service does not

                                                3.8 Capitalized Costs v. Expenses | 457
extend the useful life of the machine beyond the original
estimate, increase the capacity of the machine, or improve the
quality of the silk-screening performed by the machine.
Therefore, this maintenance would be expensed within the
current period. In contrast, if Liam had the company upgrade
the circuit board of the silk-screening machine, thereby
increasing the machine's future capabilities, this would be
capitalized and depreciated over its useful life.

3.10 Intangible Assets

Intangible assets can be difficult to understand and
incorporate into the decision-making process. In this section
we explain them in more detail and provide examples of how
to amortize each type of intangible asset.

Fundamentals of Intangible Assets

Intangibles are recorded at their acquisition cost, as are
tangible assets. The costs of internally generated intangible
assets, such as a patent developed through research and
development, are recorded as expenses when incurred. An
exception is legal costs to register or defend an intangible
asset. For example, if a company incurs legal costs to defend
a patent it has developed internally, the costs associated with
developing the patent are recorded as an expense, but the
legal costs associated with defending the patent would be
capitalized as a patent intangible asset.

   Amortization of intangible assets is handled differently than
depreciation of tangible assets. Intangible assets are typically
amortized using the straight-line method; there is typically no
salvage value, as the usefulness of the asset is used up over its
lifetime, and no accumulated amortization account is needed.
Additionally, based on regulations, certain intangible assets are
restricted and given limited life spans, while others are infinite
in their economic life and not amortized.

                                                                 3.10 Intangible Assets | 459
Copyrights

While copyrights have a finite life span of 70 years beyond the
author's death, they are amortized over their estimated useful
life. Therefore, if a company acquired a copyright on a new
graphic novel for $10,000 and estimated it would be able to
sell that graphic novel for the next ten years, it would amortize
$1,000 a year ($10,000  ten years), and the journal entry would
be as shown. Assume that the novel began sales on January 1,
2019.

Figure 3.93 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

Patents

Patents are issued to the inventor of the product by the federal
government and last twenty years. All costs associated with
creating the product being patented (such as research and
development costs) are expensed; however, direct costs to
obtain the patent could be capitalized. Otherwise, patents are
capitalized only when purchased. Like copyrights, patents are
amortized over their useful life, which can be shorter than
twenty years due to changing technology. Assume Mech Tech
purchased the patent for a new pump system. The patent cost
$20,000, and the company expects the pump to be a useful
product for the next twenty years. Mech Tech will then
amortize the $20,000 over the next twenty years, which is
$1,000 a year.

Figure 3.94 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

Trademarks

Companies can register their trademarks with the federal
government for ten years with the opportunity to renew the
trademark every ten years. Trademarks are recorded as assets
only when they are purchased from another company and are
valued based on market price at the time of purchase. In this
case, these trademarks are amortized over the expected useful
life. In some cases, the trademark may be seen as having an
indefinite life, in which case there would be no amortization.

Goodwill

From an accounting standpoint, goodwill is internally
generated and is not recorded as an asset unless it is
purchased during the acquisition of another company. The
purchase of goodwill occurs when one company buys another
company for an amount greater than the total value of the
company's net assets. The value difference between net assets
and the purchase price is then recorded as goodwill on the
purchaser's financial statements. For example, say the London
Hoops professional basketball team was sold for $10 million.
The new owner received net assets of $7 million, so the
goodwill (value of the London Hoops above its net assets) is $3
million. The following journal entry shows how the new owner
would record this purchase.

                                                                 3.10 Intangible Assets | 461
Figure 3.95 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

Goodwill does not have an expected life span and therefore is
not amortized. However, a company is required to compare the
book value of goodwill to its market value at least annually to
determine if it needs to be adjusted. This comparison process
is called testing for impairment. If the market value of goodwill
is found to be lower than the book value, then goodwill needs
to be reduced to its market value. If goodwill is impaired, it
is reduced with a credit, and an impairment loss is debited.
Goodwill is never increased beyond its original cost. For
example, if the new owner of London Hoops assesses that
London Hoops now has a fair value of $9,000,000 rather than
the $10,000,000 of the original purchase, the owner would
need to record the impairment as shown in the following
journal entry.

Microsoft's Goodwill

In         2016, Microsoft bought LinkedIn for  $25

billion. Microsoft wanted the brand, website platform, and

software, which are intangible assets of LinkedIn, and

therefore Microsoft only received $4 billion in net assets. The

overpayment by Microsoft is not necessarily a bad business

decision, but rather the premium or value of those intangible

assets that LinkedIn owned and Microsoft wanted. The $21

billion difference will be listed on Microsoft's balance sheet as

goodwill.

3.11 Sale of an Asset

When an asset is sold, the company must account for its
depreciation up to the date of sale. This means companies may
be required to record a depreciation entry before the sale of the
asset to ensure it is current. After ensuring that the net book
value of an asset is current, the company must determine if
the asset has sold at a gain, at a loss, or at book value. We look
at examples of each accounting alternative using the Kenzie
Company data.

   Recall that Kenzie's press has a depreciable base of $48,000
and an economic life of five years. If Kenzie sells the press
at the end of the third year, the company would have taken
three years of depreciation amounting to $28,800 ($9,600  3
years). With an original cost of $58,000, and after subtracting
the accumulated depreciation of $28,800, the press would
have a book value of $29,200. If the company sells the press for
$31,000, it would realize a gain of $1,800, as shown.

Figure 3.97 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

The journal entry to record the sale is shown here.

464 | 3.11 Sale of an Asset
Figure 3.98 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

If Kenzie sells the printing press for $27,100, what would the
journal entries be? The book value of the press is $29,200, so
Kenzie would be selling the press at a loss. The journal entry to
record the sale is shown here.

Figure 3.99 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

What if Kenzie sells the press at exactly book value? In this case,
the company will realize neither a gain nor a loss. Here is the
journal entry to record the sale.

Figure 3.100 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA

While it would be ideal to estimate a salvage value that
provides neither a gain nor a loss upon the retirement and sale
of a long-term asset, this type of accuracy is virtually impossible
to reach, unless you negotiate a fixed future sales price. For

                                                                    3.11 Sale of an Asset | 465
example, you might buy a truck for $80,000 and lock in a five-
year life with 100,000 or fewer miles driven. Under these
conditions, the dealer might agree to pay you $20,000 for the
truck in five years.

   Under these conditions, you could justify calculating your
depreciation over a five-year period, using a depreciable base
of $60,000. Under the straight-line method, this would provide
an annual depreciation amount of $12,000. Also, when you sell
the truck to the dealer after five years, the sales price will be
$20,000, and the book value will be $20,000, so there would be
neither a gain nor a loss on the sale.

   In the Kenzie example where the asset was sold for $31,000
after three years, Kenzie should have recorded a total of $27,000
in depreciation (cost of $58,000 less the sales value of $31,000).
However, the company recorded $28,800 in depreciation over
the three-year period. Subtracting the gain of $1,800 from the
total depreciation expense of $28,800 shows the true cost of
using the asset as $27,000, and not the depreciation amount of
$28,800.

   When the asset was sold for $27,100, the accounting records
would show $30,900 in depreciation (cost of $58,000 less the
sales price of $27,100). However, depreciation is listed as
$28,800 over the three-year period. Adding the loss of $2,100
to the total depreciation expense of $28,800 results in a cost
of $30,900 for use of the asset rather than the $28,800
depreciation.

   If the asset sells for exactly the book value, its depreciation
expense was estimated perfectly, and there is no gain or loss.
If it sells for $29,200 and had a book value of $29,200, its
depreciation expense of $28,800 matches the original
estimate.

4.1 Analyzing Fraud in
the Accounting
Workplace

In this chapter, one of the major issues examined is the concept
of fraud. Fraud can be defined in many ways, but for the
purposes of this course we define it as the act of intentionally
deceiving a person or organization or misrepresenting a
relationship in order to secure some type of benefit, either
financial or nonfinancial. We initially discuss it in a broader
sense and then concentrate on the issue of fraud as it relates to
the accounting environment and profession.

   Workplace fraud is typically detected by anonymous tips or
by accident, so many companies use the fraud triangle to help
in the analysis of workplace fraud. Donald Cressey, an
American criminologist and sociologist, developed the fraud
triangle to help explain why law-abiding citizens sometimes
commit serious workplace-related crimes. He determined that
people who embezzled money from banks were typically
otherwise law-abiding citizens who came into a "non-sharable
financial problem." A non-sharable financial problem is when
a trusted individual has a financial issue or problem that he or
she feels can't be shared. However, it is felt that the problem
can be alleviated by surreptitiously violating the position of
trust through some type of illegal response, such as
embezzlement or other forms of misappropriation. The guilty
party is typically able to rationalize the illegal action. Although
they committed serious financial crimes, for many of them, it
was their first offense.

   The fraud triangle consists of three elements: incentive,
opportunity, and rationalization (Figure 4.1). When an

472 | 4.1 Analyzing Fraud in the Accounting Workplace
employee commits fraud, the elements of the fraud triangle
provide assistance in understanding the employee's methods
and rationale. Each of the elements needs to be present for
workplace fraud to occur.

Figure 4.1 Fraud Triangle The three components identified in the
fraud triangle are perceived opportunity, incentive, and
rationalization. Fraud Triangle. By: Rice University Source: Openstax
CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Perceived opportunity is when a potential fraudster thinks that
the internal controls are weak or sees a way to override them.
This is the area in which an accountant has the greatest ability
to mitigate fraud, as the accountant can review and test
internal controls to locate weaknesses. After identifying a weak,
circumvented, or nonexistent internal control, management,

                       4.1 Analyzing Fraud in the Accounting Workplace | 473
along with the accountant, can implement stronger internal
controls.

   Rationalization is a way for the potential fraudster to
internalize the concept that the fraudulent actions are
acceptable. A typical fraudster finds ways to personally justify
his or her illegal and unethical behavior. Using rationalization
as a tool to locate or combat fraud is difficult, because the
outward signs may be difficult to recognize.

   Incentive (or pressure) is another element necessary for a
person to commit fraud. The different types of pressure are
typically found in (1) vices, such as gambling or drug use; (2)
financial pressures, such as greed or living beyond their means;
(3) work pressure, such as being unhappy with a job; and (4)
other pressures, such as the desire to appear successful.
Pressure may be more recognizable than rationalization, for
instance, when coworkers seem to be living beyond their
means or complain that they want to get even with their
employer because of low pay or other perceived slights.

   Typically, all three elements of the triangle must be in place
for an employee to commit fraud, but companies usually focus
on the opportunity aspect of mitigating fraud because, they
can develop internal controls to manage the risk. The
rationalization and pressure to commit fraud are harder to
understand and identify. Many organizations may recognize
that an employee may be under pressure, but many times the
signs of pressure are missed.

   Virtually all types of businesses can fall victim to fraudulent
behavior. For example, there have been scams involving grain
silos in Texas inflating their inventory, the sale of mixed oils
labeled as olive oil across the globe, and the tens of billions of
dollars that Bernie Madoff swindled out of investors and not-
for-profits.

   To demonstrate how a fraud can occur, let's examine a
sample case in a little more detail. In 2015, a long-term
employee of the SCICAP Federal Credit Union in Iowa was

474 | 4.1 Analyzing Fraud in the Accounting Workplace
convicted of stealing over $2.7 million in cash over a 37-year
period. The employee maintained two sets of financial records:
one that provided customers with correct information as to
how much money they had on deposit within their account,
and a second set of books that, through a complex set of
transactions, moved money out of customer accounts and into
the employee's account as well as those of members of her
family. To ensure that no other employee within the small
credit union would have access to the duplicate set of books,
the employee never took a vacation over the 37-year period,
and she was the only employee with password-protected
access to the system where the electronic records were stored.

   There were, at least, two obvious violations of solid internal
control principles in this case. The first was the failure to require
more than one person to have access to the records, which
the employee was able to maintain by not taking a vacation.
Allowing the employee to not share the password-protected
access was a second violation. If more than one employee had
access to the system, the felonious employee probably would
have been caught much earlier. What other potential failures
in the internal control system might have been present? How
does this example of fraud exhibit the three components of the
fraud triangle?

   Unfortunately, this is one of many examples that occur on
a daily basis. In almost any city on almost any day, there are
articles in local newspapers about a theft from a company by
its employees. Although these thefts can involve assets such
as inventory, most often, employee theft involves cash that the
employee has access to as part of his or her day-to-day job.

4.2 Internal Controls -
Overview

Internal controls are the systems used by an organization to
manage risk and diminish the occurrence of fraud. The internal
control structure is made up of the control environment, the
accounting system, and procedures called control activities.
Several years ago, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
(COSO), which is an independent, private-sector group whose
five sponsoring organizations periodically identify and address
specific accounting issues or projects, convened to address the
issue of internal control deficiencies in the operations and
accounting systems of organizations. They subsequently
published a report that is known as COSO's Internal Control-
Integrated Framework. The five components that they
determined were necessary in an effective internal control
system make up the components in the internal controls
triangle shown in Figure 4.2.

476 | 4.2 Internal Controls - Overview
Figure 4.2 The Internal Control Environment By: Rice University
Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Here we address some of the practical aspects of internal
control systems. The internal control system consists of the
formal policies and procedures that do the following:

   ensure assets are properly used
   ensure that the accounting system is functioning properly
   monitor operations of the organization to ensure

      maximum efficiency
   ensure that assets are kept secure
   ensure that employees are in compliance with corporate

      policies

A properly designed and functioning internal control system
will not eliminate the risk of loss, but it will reduce the risk.

   Different organizations face different types of risk, but when
internal control systems are lacking, the opportunity arises for
fraud, misuse of the organization's assets, and employee or

                                                  4.2 Internal Controls - Overview | 477
workplace corruption. Part of an accountant's function is to
understand and assist in maintaining the internal control in the
organization.

   Internal control keeps the assets of a company safe and
keeps the company from violating any laws, while fairly
recording the financial activity of the company in the
accounting records. Proper accounting records are used to
create the financial statements that the owners use to evaluate
the operations of a company, including all company and
employee activities. Internal controls are more than just
reviews of how items are recorded in the company's
accounting records; they also include comparing the
accounting records to the actual operations of the company.

   For example, a movie theater earns most of its profits from
the sale of popcorn and soda at the concession stand. The
prices of the items sold at the concession stand are typically
high, even though the costs of popcorn and soda are low.
Internal controls allow the owners to ensure that their
employees do not give away the profits by giving away sodas
and popcorn.

   If you were to go to the concession stand and ask for a cup
of water, typically, the employee would give you a clear, small
plastic cup called a courtesy cup. This internal control, the small
plastic cup for nonpaying customers, helps align the
accounting system and the theater's operations. A movie
theater does not use a system to directly account for the sale
of popcorn, soda, or ice used. Instead, it accounts for the
containers. A point-of-sale system compares the number of
soda cups used in a shift to the number of sales recorded in the
system to ensure that those numbers match. The same process
accounts for popcorn buckets and other containers. Providing
a courtesy cup ensures that customers drinking free water do
not use the soda cups that would require a corresponding sale
to appear in the point-of-sale system. The cost of the popcorn,
soda, and ice will be recorded in the accounting system as an

478 | 4.2 Internal Controls - Overview
inventory item, but the internal control is the comparison of the
recorded sales to the number of containers used. This is just
one type of internal control. As we discuss the internal controls,
we see that the internal controls are used both in accounting,
to provide information for management to properly evaluate
the operations of the company, and in business operations, to
reduce fraud.

   It should be clear how important internal control is to all
businesses, regardless of size. An effective internal control
system allows a business to monitor its employees, but it also
helps a company protect sensitive customer data. Consider the
2017 massive data breach at Equifax that compromised data
of over 143 million people. With proper internal controls
functioning as intended, there would have been protective
measures to ensure that no unauthorized parties had access
to the data. Not only would internal controls prevent outside
access to the data, but proper internal controls would protect
the data from corruption, damage, or misuse.

YOUR TURN

Bank Fraud in Enid, Oklahoma

The retired mayor of Enid, Oklahoma, Ernst Currier, had a job
as a loan officer and then as a senior vice president at Security
National Bank. In his bank job, he allegedly opened 61
fraudulent loans. He used the identities of at least nine real
people as well as eight fictitious people and stole about $6.2
million.1 He was sentenced to 13 years in prison on 33 felony
counts.

   Currier was able to circumvent one of the most important
internal controls: segregation of duties. The American Institute

                                                  4.2 Internal Controls - Overview | 479
of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) states that segregation
of duties "is based on shared responsibilities of a key process
that disperses the critical functions of that process to more
than one person or department. Without this separation in
key processes, fraud and error risks are far less
manageable."2 Currier used local residents' identities and
created false documents to open loans for millions of dollars
and then collect the funds himself, without any oversight by
any other employee. Creating these loans allowed him to walk
up to the bank vault and take cash out of the bank without
anyone questioning him. There was no segregation of duties
for opening loans, or if there was, he was able to easily override
those internal controls.

   How could internal controls have helped prevent Currier's
bank fraud in Enid, Oklahoma?

   Solution
   Simply having someone else confirm the existence of the
borrower and make the payment for the loan directly to the
borrower would have saved this small bank millions of dollars.

   Consider a bank that has to track deposits for thousands of
customers. If a fire destroys the building housing the bank's
servers, how can the bank find the balances of each customer?
Typically, organizations such as banks mirror their servers at
several locations around the world as an internal control. The
bank might have a main server in Tennessee but also mirror
all data in real time to identical servers in Arizona, Montana,
and even offshore in Iceland. With multiple copies of a server
at multiple locations across the country, or even the world, in
the event of disaster to one server, a backup server can take
control of operations, protecting customer data and avoiding
any service interruptions.

   Internal controls are the basic components of an internal
control system, the sum of all internal controls and policies

480 | 4.2 Internal Controls - Overview
within an organization that protect assets and data. A properly
designed system of internal controls aims to ensure the
integrity of assets, allows for reliable accounting information
and financial reporting, enhances efficiency within an
organization, and provides guidelines and possible
consequences for dealing with breaches. Internal controls drive
many decisions and overall operational procedures within an
organization. A properly designed internal control system will
not prevent all loss from occurring, but it will significantly
reduce the risk of loss and increase the chance of identifying
the responsible party.

The Role of Internal Controls

The accounting system is the backbone of any business entity,
whether it is profit based or not. It is the responsibility of
management to link the accounting system with other
functional areas of the business and ensure that there is
communication among employees, managers, customers,
suppliers, and all other internal and external users of financial
information. With a proper understanding of internal controls,
management can design an internal control system that
promotes a positive business environment that can most
effectively serve its customers.

   For example, a customer enters a retail store to purchase a
pair of jeans. As the cashier enters the jeans into the point-of-
sale system, the following events occur internally:

 1. A sale is recorded in the company's journal, which
      increases revenue on the income statement. If the
      transaction occurred by credit card, the bank typically
      transfers the funds into the store's bank account in a
      timely manner.

2. The pair of jeans is removed from the inventory of the

                                                  4.2 Internal Controls - Overview | 481
      store where the purchase was made.
 3. A new pair of jeans is ordered from the distribution center

      to replace what was purchased from the store's inventory.
4. The distribution center orders a new pair of jeans from the

      factory to replace its inventory.
 5. Marketing professionals can monitor over time the trend

      and volume of jeans sold in a specific size. If an increase or
      decrease in sales volume of a specific size is noted, store
      inventory levels can be adjusted.
6. The company can see in real time the exact inventory
      levels of all products in all stores at all times, and this can
      ensure the best customer access to products.

Because many systems are linked through technology that
drives decisions made by many stakeholders inside and
outside of the organization, internal controls are needed to
protect the integrity and ensure the flow of information. An
internal control system also assists all stakeholders of an
organization to develop an understanding of the organization
and provide assurance that all assets are being used efficiently
and accurately.

Environment Leading to the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act

Internal controls have grown in their importance as a
component of most business decisions. This importance has
grown as many company structures have grown in complexity.
Despite their importance, not all companies have given
maintenance of controls top priority. Additionally, many small
businesses do not have adequate understanding of internal
controls and therefore use inferior internal control systems.
Many large companies have nonformalized processes, which
can lead to systems that are not as efficient as they could

482 | 4.2 Internal Controls - Overview
be. The failure of the SCICAP Credit Union discussed earlier
is a direct result of a small financial institution having a
substandard internal control system leading to employee theft.
One of the largest corporate failures of all time was Enron, and
the failure can be directly attributed to poor internal controls.

   Enron was one of the largest energy companies in the world
in the late twentieth century. However, a corrupt management
attempted to hide weak financial performance by
manipulating revenue recognition, valuation of assets on the
balance sheet, and other financial reporting disclosures so that
the company appeared to have significant growth. When this
practice was uncovered, the owners of Enron stock lost $40
billion as the stock price dropped from $91 per share to less
than $1 per share, as shown in Figure 4.3.3 This failure could
have been prevented had proper internal controls been in
place.

   For example, Enron and its accounting firm, Arthur
Andersen, did not maintain an adequate degree of
independence. Arthur Andersen provided a significant
amount of services in both auditing and consulting, which
prevented them from approaching the audit of Enron with a
proper degree of independence. Also, among many other
violations, Enron avoided the proper use of several acceptable
reporting requirements.

As a result of the Enron failure and others that occurred during
the same time frame, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
(SOX) to regulate practice to manage conflicts of analysts,
maintain governance, and impose guidelines for criminal
conduct as well as sanctions for violations of conduct. It
ensures that internal controls are properly documented, tested,
and used consistently. The intent of the act was to ensure that
corporate financial statements and disclosures are accurate
and reliable. It is important to note that SOX only applies to
public companies. A publicly traded company is one whose
stock is traded (bought and sold) on an organized stock
exchange. Smaller companies still struggle with internal
control development and compliance due to a variety of
reasons, such as cost and lack of resources.

484 | 4.2 Internal Controls - Overview
Major Accounting Components of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act

As it pertains to internal controls, the SOX requires the
certification and documentation of internal controls.
Specifically, the act requires that the auditor do the following:

 1. Issue an internal control report following the evaluation of
      internal controls.

2. Limit nonaudit services, such as consulting, that are
      provided to a client.

 3. Rotate who can lead the audit. The person in charge of the
      audit can serve for a period of no longer than seven years
      without a break of two years.

Additionally, the work conducted by the auditor is to be
overseen by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(PCAOB). The PCAOB is a congressionally established,
nonprofit corporation. Its creation was included in the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to regulate conflict, control
disclosures, and set sanction guidelines for any violation of
regulations. The PCAOB was assigned the responsibilities of
ensuring independent, accurate, and informative audit reports,
monitoring the audits of securities brokers and dealers, and
maintaining oversight of the accountants and accounting
firms that audit publicly traded companies.

   Any employee found to violate SOX standards can be subject
to very harsh penalties, including $5 million in fines and up to
20 to 25 years in prison. The penalty is more severe for securities
fraud (25 years) than for mail or wire fraud (20 years).

   The SOX is relatively long and detailed, with Section 404
having the most application to internal controls. Under Section
404, management of a company must perform annual audits
to assess and document the effectiveness of all internal
controls that have an impact on the financial reporting of the

                                                 4.2 Internal Controls - Overview | 485
organization. Also, selected executives of the firm under audit
must sign the audit report and state that they attest that the
audit fairly represents the financial records and conditions of
the company.

   The financial reports and internal control system must be
audited annually. The cost to comply with this act is very high,
and there is debate as to how effective this regulation is. Two
primary arguments that have been made against the SOX
requirements is that complying with their requirements is
expensive, both in terms of cost and workforce, and the results
tend not to be conclusive. Proponents of the SOX requirements
do not accept these arguments.

   One available potential response to mandatory SOX
compliance is for a company to decertify (remove) its stock
for trade on the available stock exchanges. Since SOX affects
publicly traded companies, decertifying its stock would
eliminate the SOX compliance requirement. However, this has
not proven to be a viable option, primarily because investors
enjoy the protection SOX provides, especially the requirement
that the companies in which they invest undergo a certified
audit prepared by CPAs employed by national or regional
accounting firms. Also, if a company takes its stock off of an
organized stock exchange, many investors assume that a
company is in trouble financially and that it wants to avoid an
audit that might detect its problems.

The Growing Importance of the Report on
Internal Controls

Internal controls have become an important aspect of financial
reporting. As part of the financial statements, the auditor has
to issue a report with an opinion on the financial statements, as
well as internal controls. Use the internet and locate the annual
report of a company, specifically the report on internal controls.
What does this report tell the user of financial information?

   Solution
   The annual report informs the user about the financial
results of the company, both in discussion by management
as well as the financial statements. Part of the financial
statements involves an independent auditor's report on the
integrity of the financial statements as well as the internal
controls.

488 | 4.2 Internal Controls - Overview
4.3 Elements of
Internal Control

The use of internal controls differs significantly across
organizations of different sizes. In the case of small businesses,
implementation of internal controls can be a challenge, due to
cost constraints, or because a small staff may mean that one
manager or owner will have full control over the organization
and its operations. An owner in charge of all functions has
enough knowledge to keep a close eye on all aspects of the
organization and can track all assets appropriately. In smaller
organizations in which responsibilities are delegated,
procedures need to be developed in order to ensure that assets
are tracked and used properly.

   When an owner cannot have full oversight and control over
an organization, internal control systems need to be developed.
When an appropriate internal control system is in place, it is
interlinked to all aspects of the entity's operations. An
appropriate internal control system links the accounting,
finance, operations, human resources, marketing, and sales
departments within an organization. It is important that the
management team, as well as employees, recognize the
importance of internal controls and their role in preventing
losses, monitoring performance, and planning for the future.

Elements of Internal Control

A strong internal control system is based on the same
consistent elements:

   establishment of clear responsibilities

                                                 4.3 Elements of Internal Control | 489
   proper documentation
   adequate insurance
   separation of assets from custody
   separation of duties
   use of technology

Establishment of Clear Responsibilities

A properly designed system of internal control clearly dictates
responsibility for certain roles within an organization. When
there is a clear statement of responsibility, issues that are
uncovered can be easily traced and responsibility placed where
it belongs.

   As an example, imagine that you are the manager of the
Galaxy's Best Yogurt. On any shift, you have three employees
working in the store. One employee is designated as the shift
supervisor who oversees the operations of the other two
employees on the shift and ensures that the store is presented
and functioning properly. Of the other two employees, one
may be solely responsible for management of the cash register,
while the others serve the customers. When only one
employee has access to an individual cash register, if there is
an overage or shortage of cash, it can be traced to the one
employee who is in charge of the cash register.

Proper Documentation

An effective internal control system maintains proper
documentation, including backups, to trace all transactions.
The documentation can be paper copies, or documents that
are computer generated and stored, on flash drives or in the
cloud, for example. Given the possibility of some type of natural

490 | 4.3 Elements of Internal Control
(tornado or flood) or man-made (arson) disasters, even the
most basic of businesses should create backup copies of
documentation that are stored off-site.

   In addition, any documentation generated by daily
operations should be managed according to internal controls.
For example, when the Galaxy's Best Yogurt closes each day,
one employee should close out and reconcile the cash drawer
using prenumbered forms in pen to ensure that no forms can
be altered or changed by another employee who may have
access to the cash. In case of an error, the employee
responsible for making the change should initial any changes
on the form. If there are special orders for cakes or other
products, the order forms should be prenumbered. The use
of prenumbered documents provides assurance that all sales
are recorded. If a form is not prenumbered, an order can be
prepared, and the employee can then take the money without
ringing the order into the cash register, leaving no record of the
sale.

Adequate Insurance

Insurance may be a significant cost to an organization
(especially liability coverage), but it is necessary. With adequate
insurance on an asset, if it is lost or destroyed, an outside party
will recoup the company for the loss. If assets are lost to fraud
or theft, an insurance company will investigate the loss and
will press criminal charges against any employee found to be
involved. Very often, the employer will be hesitant to pursue
criminal charges against an employee due to the risk of lawsuit
or bad publicity. For example, an employee might assume that
the termination was age related and is going to sue the
company. Also, there might be a situation where the company
experienced a loss, such as theft, and it does not want to let the

                                                  4.3 Elements of Internal Control | 491
general public know that there are potential deficiencies in its
security system.

   If the insurance company presses charges on behalf of the
company, this protects the organization and also acts as a
deterrent if employees know that the insurance company will
always prosecute theft. For example, suppose the manager of
the Galaxy's Best Yogurt stole $10,000 cash over a period of
two years. The owner of the yogurt store will most likely file an
insurance claim to recover the $10,000 that was stolen. With
proper insurance, the insurance company will reimburse the
yogurt store for the money but then has the right to press
charges and recover its losses from the employee who was
caught stealing. The store owner will have no control over the
insurance company's efforts to recover the $10,000 and will
likely be forced to fire the employee in order to keep the
insurance policy.

Separation of Assets from Custody

Separation of assets from custody ensures that the person who
controls an asset cannot also keep the accounting records. This
action prevents one employee from taking income from the
business and entering a transaction on the accounting records
to cover it up. For example, one person within an organization
may open an envelope that contains a check, but a different
person would enter the check into the organization's
accounting system. In the case of the Galaxy's Best Yogurt, one
employee may count the money in the cash register drawer
at the end of the night and reconcile it with the sales, but
a different employee would recount the money, prepare the
bank deposit, and ensure that the deposit is made at the bank.

492 | 4.3 Elements of Internal Control
Separation of Duties

A properly designed internal control system assures that at
least two (if not more) people are involved with most
transactions. The purpose of separating duties is to ensure that
there is a check and balance in place. One common internal
control is to have one employee place an inventory order and
a different employee receive the order as it is delivered. For
example, assume that an employee at the Galaxy's Best Yogurt
places an inventory order. In addition to the needed inventory,
the employee orders an extra box of piecrusts. If that employee
also receives the order, he or she can take the piecrusts home,
and the store will still pay for them. Check signing is another
important aspect of separation of duties. Typically, the person
who writes a check should not also sign the check. Additionally,
the person who places supply orders should not write checks
to pay the bills for these supplies.

Use of Technology

Technology has made the process of internal control simpler
and more approachable to all businesses. There are two
reasons that the use of technology has become more
prevalent. The first is the development of more user-friendly
equipment, and the second is the reduction in costs of security
resources. In the past, if a company wanted a security system,
it often had to go to an outside security firm, and the costs
of providing and monitoring the system were prohibitive for
many small businesses. Currently, security systems have
become relatively inexpensive, and not only do many small
businesses now have them, they are now commonly used by
residential homeowners.

   In terms of the application of security resources, some

                                                 4.3 Elements of Internal Control | 493
businesses use surveillance cameras focused on key areas of
the organization, such as the cash register and areas where
a majority of work is performed. Technology also allows
businesses to use password protection on their data or systems
so that employees cannot access systems and change data
without authorization. Businesses may also track all employee
activities within an information technology system.

   Even if a business uses all of the elements of a strong internal
control system, the system is only as good as the oversight. As
responsibilities, staffing, and even technology change, internal
control systems need to be constantly reviewed and refined.
Internal control reviews are typically not conducted by inside
management but by internal auditors who provide an
impartial perspective of where controls are working and where
they can be improved.

Purposes of Internal Controls within a
Governmental Entity

Internal controls apply not only to public and private
corporations but also to governmental entities. Often, a
government controls one of the most important assets of
modern times: data. Unprotected financial information,
including tax data, social security, and governmental
identifications, could lead to identity theft and could even
provide rogue nations access to data that could compromise
the security of our country. Governmental entities require their
contractors to have proper internal controls and to maintain
proper codes of ethics.

494 | 4.3 Elements of Internal Control
Purposes of Internal Controls within a
Not-for-Profit

Not-for-profit (NFP) organizations have the same needs for
internal control as many traditional for-profit entities. At the
same time, there are unique challenges that these entities face.
Based on the objectives and charters of NFP organizations, in
many cases, those who run the organizations are volunteers.
As volunteers, leaders of NFPs may not have the same training
background and qualifications as those in a similar for-profit
position. Additionally, a volunteer leader often splits time
between the organization and a full-time career. For these
reasons, internal controls in an NFP often are not properly
implemented, and there may be a greater risk of control lapse.
A control lapse occurs when there is a deviation from standard
control protocol that leads to a failure in the internal control
and/or fraud prevention processes or systems. A failure occurs
in a situation when results did not achieve predetermined
goals or meet expectations.

   Not-for-profit organizations have an extra category of
finances that need protection, in addition to their assets. They
need to ensure that incoming donations are used as intended.
For example, many colleges and universities are classified as
NFP organizations, and donations are a significant source of
revenue. However, donations are often directed to a specific
source. For example, suppose an alumnus of Alpha University
wants to make a $1,000,000 donation to the business school for
undergraduate student scholarships. Internal controls would
track that donation to ensure it paid for scholarships for
undergraduate students in the business school and was not
used for any other purpose at the school, in order to avoid
potential legal issues.

                                                 4.3 Elements of Internal Control | 495
Identify and Apply Principles of Internal
Controls to the Receipt and Disbursement
of Cash

Cash can be a major part of many business operations. Imagine
a Las Vegas casino, or a large grocery store, such as Publix
Super Markets, Wegmans Food Markets, or ShopRite; in any
of these settings, millions of dollars in cash can change hands
within a matter of minutes, and it can pass through the hands
of thousands of employees. Internal controls ensure that all of
this cash reaches the bank account of the business entity. The
first control is monitoring. Not only are cameras strategically
placed throughout the store to prevent shoplifting and crime
by customers, but cameras are also located over all areas where
cash changes hands, such as over every cash register, or in a
casino over every gaming table. These cameras are constantly
monitored, often offsite at a central location by personnel who
have no relationship with the employees who handle the cash,
and all footage is recorded. This close monitoring makes it
more difficult for misuse of cash to occur.

   Additionally, access to cash is tightly controlled. Within a
grocery store, each employee has his or her own cash drawer
with a set amount of cash. At any time, any employee can
reconcile the sales recorded within the system to the cash
balance that should be in the drawer. If access to the drawer is
restricted to one employee, that employee is responsible when
cash is missing. If one specific employee is consistently short
on cash, the company can investigate and monitor the
employee closely to determine if the shortages are due to theft
or if they are accidental, such as if they resulted from errors
in counting change. Within a casino, each time a transaction
occurs and when there is a shift change for the dealers, cash
is counted in real time. Casino employees dispersed on the

496 | 4.3 Elements of Internal Control
gaming floor are constantly monitoring play, in addition to
those monitoring cameras behind the scenes.

   Technology plays a major role in the maintenance of internal
controls, but other principles are also important. If an employee
makes a mistake involving cash, such as making an error in
a transaction on a cash register, the employee who made the
mistake typically cannot correct the mistake. In most cases,
a manager must review the mistake and clear it before any
adjustments are made. These changes are logged to ensure
that managers are not clearing mistakes for specific employees
in a pattern that could signify collusion, which is considered to
be a private cooperation or agreement primarily for a deceitful,
illegal, or immoral cause or purpose. Duties are also separated
to count cash on hand and ensure records are accurate. Often,
at the end of the shift, a manager or employee other than
the person responsible for the cash is responsible for counting
cash on hand within the cash drawer. For example, at a grocery
store, it is common for an employee who has been checking
out customers for a shift to then count the money in the
register and prepare a document providing the counts for the
shift. This employee then submits the counted tray to a
supervisor, such as a head cashier, who then repeats the
counting and documentation process. The two counts should
be equal. If there is a discrepancy, it should immediately be
investigated. If the store accepts checks and credit/debit card
payments, these methods of payments are also incorporated
into the verification process.

   In many cases, the sales have also been documented either
by a paper tape or by a computerized system. The ultimate
goal is to determine if the cash, checks, and credit/debit card
transactions equal the amount of sales for the shift. For
example, if the shift's register had sales of $800, then the
documentation of counted cash and checks, plus the credit/
debit card documentation should also add up to $800.

   Despite increased use of credit cards by consumers, our

                                                 4.3 Elements of Internal Control | 497
economy is still driven by cash. As cash plays a very important
role in society, efforts must be taken to control it and ensure
that it makes it to the proper areas within an organization.
The cost of developing, maintaining, and monitoring internal
controls is significant but important. Considering the millions
of dollars of cash that can pass through the hands of
employees on any given day, the high cost can be well worth it
to protect the flow of cash within an organization.

498 | 4.3 Elements of Internal Control
4.4 SOX &
Management's
Responsibility for
Maintaining Control

Because internal controls do protect the integrity of financial
statements, large companies have become highly regulated in
their implementation. In addition to Section 404 of the SOX,
which addresses reporting and testing requirements for
internal controls, there are other sections of the act that govern
management responsibility for internal controls. Although the
auditor reviews internal controls and advises on the
improvement of controls, ultimate responsibility for the
controls is on the management of the company. Under SOX
Section 302, in order to provide additional assurance to the
financial markets, the chief executive officer (CEO), who is the
executive within a company with the highest-ranking title and
the overall responsibility for management of the company, and
the chief financial officer (CFO), who is the corporation officer
who reports to the CEO and oversees all of the accounting
and finance concerns of a company, must personally certify
that (1) they have reviewed the internal control report provided
by the auditor; (2) the report does not contain any inaccurate
information; and (3) they believe that all financial information
fairly states the financial conditions, income, and cash flows of
the entity. The sign-off under Section 302 makes the CEO and
CFO personally responsible for financial reporting as well as
internal control structure.

   While the executive sign-offs seem like they would be just
a formality, they actually have a great deal of power in court

 4.4 SOX & Management's Responsibility for Maintaining Control | 499
cases. Prior to SOX, when an executive swore in court that
he or she was not aware of the occurrence of some type of
malfeasance, either committed by his or her firm or against
his or her firm, the executive would claim a lack of knowledge
of specific circumstances. The typical response was, "I can't be
expected to know everything." In fact, in virtually all of the trials
involving potential malfeasance, this claim was made and often
was successful in a not-guilty verdict.

   The initial response to the new SOX requirements by many
people was that there was already sufficient affirmation by the
CEO and CFO and other executives to the accuracy and fairness
of the financial statements and that the SOX requirements
were unnecessary. However, it was determined that the SOX
requirements provided a degree of legal responsibility that
previously might have been assumed but not actually stated.

   Even if a company is not public and not governed by the SOX,
it is important to note that the tone is set at the managerial
level, called the tone at the top. If management respects the
internal control system and emphasizes the importance of
maintaining proper internal controls, the rest of the staff will
follow and create a cohesive environment. A proper tone at
the top demonstrates management's commitment toward
openness, honesty, integrity, and ethical behavior.

YOUR TURN

Defending the Sarbanes-Oxley Act

You are having a conversation with the CFO of a public
company. Imagine that the CFO complains that there is no
benefit to Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
relative to the cost, as "our company has always valued internal

500 | 4.4 SOX & Management's Responsibility for Maintaining Control
controls before this regulation and never had an issue." He
believes that this regulation is an unnecessary overstep. How
would you respond and defend the need for Sections 302 and
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act?

   Solution
   I would tell the CFO the following:

 1. Everyone says that they have always valued internal
      controls, even those who did not.

2. Better security for the public is worth the cost.
 3. The cost of compliance is more than recovered in the

      company's market price for its stock.

Financial statements are the end result of an accountant's
work and are the responsibility of management. Proper
internal controls help the accountant determine that the
financial statements fairly present the financial position and
performance of a company. Financial statement fraud occurs
when the financial statements are used to conceal the actual
financial condition of a company or to hide specific
transactions that may be illegal. Financial statement fraud may
take on many different methods, but it is generally
called cooking the books. This issue may occur for many
purposes.

   A common reason to cook the books is to create a false set
of a company's books used to convince investors or lenders to
provide money to the company. Investors and lenders rely on
a properly prepared set of financial statements in making their
decision to provide the company with money. Another reason
to misstate a set of financial statements is to hide corporate
looting such as excessive retirement perks of top executives,
unpaid loans to top executives, improper stock options, and
any other wrongful financial action. Yet another reason to
misreport a company's financial data is to drive the stock price
higher. Internal controls assist the accountant in locating and

 4.4 SOX & Management's Responsibility for Maintaining Control | 501
identifying when management of a company wants to mislead
the inventors or lenders.

   The financial accountant or members of management who
set out to cook the books are intentionally attempting to
deceive the user of the financial statements. The actions of
upper management are being concealed, and in most cases,
the entire financial position of the company is being purposely
misreported. Regardless of the reason for misstating the true
condition of a company's financial position, doing so misleads
any person using the financial statements of a company to
evaluate the company and its operations.

How Companies Cook the Books to
Misrepresent Their Financial Condition

One of the most common ways companies cook the books
is by manipulating revenue accounts or accounts receivables.
Proper revenue recognition involves accounting for revenue
when the company has met its obligation on a contract.
Financial statement fraud involves early revenue recognition,
or recognizing revue that does not exist, and receivable
accountings, used in tandem with false revenue
reporting. HealthSouth used a combination of false revenue
accounts and misstated accounts receivable in a direct
manipulation of the revenue accounts to commit a
multibillion-dollar fraud between 1996 and 2002. Several chief
financial officers and other company officials went to prison as
a result.4

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

Internal Controls at HealthSouth

The fraud at HealthSouth was possible because some of the

internal controls were ignored. The company failed to maintain

standard segregation of duties and allowed management

override of internal controls. The fraud required the collusion

of the entire accounting department, concealing hundreds of

thousands of fraudulent transactions through the use of

falsified documents and fraudulent accounting schemes that

included revenue recognition irregularities (such as

recognizing accounts receivables to be recorded as revenue

before collection), misclassification of expenses and asset

acquisitions, and fraudulent merger and acquisition

accounting. The result was billions of dollars of fraud. Simply

implementing and following proper internal          control
procedures would have stopped this massive fraud.5

Many companies may go to great lengths to perpetuate
financial statement fraud. Besides the direct manipulation of
revenue accounts, there are many other ways fraudulent
companies manipulate their financial statements. Companies
with large inventory balances can misrepresent their inventory
account balances and use this misrepresentation to overstate
the amount of their assets to get larger loans or use the
increased balance to entice investors through claims of
exaggerated revenues. The inventory accounts can also be
used to overstate income. Such inventory manipulations can
include the following:

 Channel stuffing: encouraging customers to buy products
   under favorable terms. These terms include allowing the
   customer to return or even not pick up goods sold,

4.4 SOX & Management's Responsibility for Maintaining Control | 503
      without a corresponding reserve to account for the
      returns.
   Sham sales: sales that have not occurred and for which
      there are no customers.
   Bill-and-hold sales: recognition of income before the title
      transfers to the buyer, and holding the inventory in the
      seller's warehouse.
   Improper cutoff: recording sales of inventory in the wrong
      period and before the inventory is sold; this is a type of
      early revenue recognition.
   Round-tripping: selling items with the promise to buy the
      items back, usually on credit, so there is no economic
      benefit.

These are just a few examples of the way an organization might
manipulate inventory or sales to create false revenue.

   One of the most famous financial statement frauds
involved Enron, as discussed previously. Enron started as an
interstate pipeline company, but then branched out into many
different ventures. In addition to the internal control
deficiencies discussed earlier, the financial statement fraud
started when the company began to attempt to hide its losses.

   The fraudulent financial reporting schemes included
building assets and immediately taking as income any
projected profits on construction and hiding the losses from
operating assets in an off-the-balance sheet transaction
called special purpose entities, which are separate, often
complicated legal entities that are often used to absorb risk
for a corporation. Enron moved assets that were losing money
off of its books and onto the books of the Special Purpose
Entity. This way, Enron could hide its bad business decisions
and continue to report a profit, even though its assets were
losing money. Enron's financial statement fraud created false
revenues with the misstatement of assets and liability
balances. This was further supported by inadequate balance

504 | 4.4 SOX & Management's Responsibility for Maintaining Control
sheet footnotes and the related disclosures. For example,
required disclosures were ramped up as a result of these
special purpose entities.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act Compliance Today

The Enron scandal and related financial statement frauds led
to investors requiring that public companies maintain better
internal controls and develop stronger governance systems,
while auditors perform a better job at auditing public
companies. These requirements, in turn, led to the regulations
developed under SOX that were intended to protect the
investing public.

   Since SOX was first passed, it has adapted to changing
technology and now requires public companies to protect their
accounting and financial data from hackers and other outside
or internal forces through stronger internal controls designed
to protect the data. The Journal of Accountancy supported
these new requirements and reported that the results of SOX
have been positive for both companies and investors.

   As discussed in the Journal of Accountancy article,6 there are
three conditions that are increasingly affecting compliance
with SOX requirements:

   PCAOB requirements. The PCAOB has increased the
      requirements for inspection reports, with a greater
      emphasis on deficiency evaluation.

   Revenue recognition. The Financial Accounting Standards
      Board has introduced a new standard for revenue
      recognition. This requirement has led to the need for
      companies to update control documentation.

   Cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting
      software, hardware, and data from digital attacks. As
      would be expected in today's environment, the number of

 4.4 SOX & Management's Responsibility for Maintaining Control | 505
      recent cybersecurity disclosures has significantly grown.

Under current guidelines, instead of the SOX requiring
compliance with just the financial component of reporting and
internal control, the guidelines now allow application to
information technology (IT) activities as well. A major change
under the SOX guidelines involves the method of storage of a
company's electronic records. While the act did not specifically
require a particular storage method, it did provide guidance on
which records were to be stored and for how long they should
be stored.

   The SOX now requires that all business records, electronic
records, and electronic messages must be stored for at least
five years. The penalties for noncompliance include either
imprisonment or fines, or a combination of the two options.

5.1 Current Liabilities

To assist in understanding current liabilities, assume that you
own a landscaping company that provides landscaping
maintenance services to clients. As is common for landscaping
companies in your area, you require clients to pay an initial
deposit of 25% for services before you begin working on their
property. Asking a customer to pay for services before you have
provided them creates a current liability transaction for your
business. As you've learned, liabilities require a future
disbursement of assets or services resulting from a prior
business activity or transaction. For companies to make more
informed decisions, liabilities need to be classified into two
specific categories: current liabilities and noncurrent (or long-
term) liabilities. The differentiating factor between current and
long-term is when the liability is due.

Fundamentals of Current Liabilities

A current liability is a debt or obligation due within a
company's standard operating period, typically a year,
although there are exceptions that are longer or shorter than
a year. A company's typical operating period (sometimes called
an operating cycle) is a year, which is used to delineate current
and noncurrent liabilities, and current liabilities are considered
short term and are typically due within a year or less.

   Noncurrent liabilities are long-term obligations with
payment typically due in a subsequent operating period.
Current liabilities are reported on the classified balance sheet,
listed before noncurrent liabilities. Changes in current liabilities
from the beginning of an accounting period to the end are
reported on the statement of cash flows as part of the cash

510 | 5.1 Current Liabilities
flows from operations section. An increase in current liabilities
over a period increases cash flow, while a decrease in current
liabilities decreases cash flow.

Table 5.1 A delineator between current and noncurrent liabilities is
one year or the company's operating period, whichever is longer.

   Notes Payable within one

      operating period
   Current portion of a

      longer-term account such
      as Notes Payable or Bonds
      Payable

Examples of Current Liabilities

Common current liabilities include accounts payable,
unearned revenues, the current portion of a note payable, and
taxes payable. Each of these liabilities is current because it
results from a past business activity, with a disbursement or
payment due within a period of less than a year.

Accounts Payable

Accounts payable accounts for financial obligations owed to
suppliers after purchasing products or services on credit. This

                                                                    5.1 Current Liabilities | 511
account may be an open credit line between the supplier and
the company. An open credit line is a borrowing agreement
for an amount of money, supplies, or inventory. The option to
borrow from the lender can be exercised at any time within the
agreed time period.

   An account payable is usually a less formal arrangement than
a promissory note for a current note payable. Long-term debt
is covered in depth in An invoice from the supplier (such as the
one shown in Figure 5.1) detailing the purchase, credit terms,
invoice date, and shipping arrangements will suffice for this
contractual relationship. In many cases, accounts payable
agreements do not include interest payments, unlike notes
payable. Long-Term Liabilities. For now, know that for some
debt, including short-term or current, a formal contract might
be created. This contract provides additional legal protection
for the lender in the event of failure by the borrower to make
timely payments. Also, the contract often provides an
opportunity for the lender to actually sell the rights in the
contract to another party.

Figure 5.1 Accounts Payable Contract terms for accounts payable
transactions are usually listed on an invoice. Accounts Payable. By:

512 | 5.1 Current Liabilities
For example, assume the owner of a clothing boutique
purchases hangers from a manufacturer on credit. The
organizations may establish an ongoing purchase agreement,
which includes purchase details (such as hanger prices and
quantities), credit terms (2/10, n/60), an invoice date, and
shipping charges (free on board [FOB] shipping) for each order.

   On August 1, Sierra Sports purchases $12,000 of soccer
equipment from a manufacturer (supplier) on credit. Assume
for the following examples that Sierra Sports uses
the perpetual inventory method, which uses the Inventory
account when the company buys, sells, or adjusts the inventory
balance, such as in the following example where they qualified
for a discount. In the current transaction, credit terms are 2/
10, n/30, the invoice date is August 1, and shipping charges are
FOB shipping point (which is included in the purchase cost).

Recall that credit terms of 2/10, n/30 signal the payment terms
and discount, and FOB shipping point establishes the point of
merchandise ownership, the responsibility during transit, and
which entity pays shipping charges. Therefore, 2/10, n/30 means
Sierra Sports has ten days to pay its balance due to receive a
2% discount, otherwise Sierra Sports has net thirty days, in this
case August 31, to pay in full but not receive a discount. FOB
shipping point signals that since Sierra Sports takes ownership
of the merchandise when it leaves the manufacturer, it takes
responsibility for the merchandise in transit and will pay the
shipping charges.

   Sierra Sports would make the following journal entry on
August 1.

Figure 5.2 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

                                                                   5.1 Current Liabilities | 513
The merchandise is purchased from the supplier on credit. In
this case, Accounts Payable would increase (a credit) for the full
amount due. Inventory, the asset account, would increase (a
debit) for the purchase price of the merchandise.

   If Sierra Sports pays the full amount owed on August 10, it
qualifies for the discount, and the following entry would occur.

Figure 5.3 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Assume that the payment to the manufacturer occurs within
the discount period of ten days (2/10, n/30) and is recognized
in the entry. Accounts Payable decreases (debit) for the original
amount due, Inventory decreases (credit) for the discount
amount of $240 ($12,000  2%), and Cash decreases (credit) for
the remaining balance due after discount.

   Note that Inventory is decreased in this entry because the
value of the merchandise (soccer equipment) is reduced.
When applying the perpetual inventory method, this reduction
is required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
(under the cost principle) to reflect the actual cost of the
merchandise.

   A second possibility is that Sierra will return part of the
purchase before the ten-day discount window has expired.
Assume in this example that $1,000 of the $12,000 purchase
was returned to the seller on August 8 and the remaining
account payable due was paid by Sierra to the seller on August
10, which means that Sierra qualified for the remaining eligible
discount. The following two journal entries represent the return
of inventory and the subsequent payment for the remaining
account payable owed. The initial journal entry from August 1

514 | 5.1 Current Liabilities
will still apply, because we assume that Sierra intended to keep
the full $12,000 of inventory when the purchase was made.

   When the $1,000 in inventory was returned on August 8, the
accounts payable account and the inventory accounts should
be reduced by $1,000 as demonstrated in this journal entry.

Figure 5.4 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

After this transaction, Sierra still owed $11,000 and still had
$11,000 in inventory from the purchase, assuming that Sierra
had not sold any of it yet.

   When Sierra paid the remaining balance on August 10, the
company qualified for the discount. However, since Sierra only
owed a remaining balance of $11,000 and not the original
$12,000, the discount received was 2% of $11,000, or $220, as
demonstrated in this journal entry. Since Sierra owed $11,000
and received a discount of $220, the supplier was paid $10,780.
This second journal entry is the same as the one that would
have recognized an original purchase of $11,000 that qualified
for a discount.

Figure 5.5 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Remember that since we are assuming that Sierra was using
the perpetual inventory method, purchases, payments, and

                                                                   5.1 Current Liabilities | 515
adjustments in goods available for sale are reflected in the
company's Inventory account. In our example, one of the
potential adjustments is that discounts received are recorded
as reductions to the Inventory account.

   To demonstrate this concept, after buying $12,000 in
inventory, returning $1,000 in inventory, and then paying for
the remaining balance and qualifying for the discount, Sierra's
Inventory balance increased by $10,780, as shown.

Figure 5.6 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

If Sierra had bought $11,000 of inventory on August 1 and paid
cash and taken the discount, after taking the $220 discount,
the increase of Inventory on their balance sheet would have
been $10,780, as it finally ended up being in our more
complicated set of transactions on three different days. The
important factor is that the company qualified for a 2%
discount on inventory that had a retail price before discounts of
$11,000.

   In a final possible scenario, assume that Sierra Sports
remitted payment outside of the discount window on August
28, but inside of thirty days. In this case, they did not qualify
for the discount, and assuming that they made no returns they
paid the full, undiscounted balance of $12,000.

516 | 5.1 Current Liabilities
Figure 5.7 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

If this occurred, both Accounts Payable and Cash decreased
by $12,000. Inventory is not affected in this instance because
the full cost of the merchandise was paid; so, the increase in
value for the inventory was $12,000, and not the $11,760 value
determined in our beginning transactions where they qualified
for the discount.

Unearned Revenue

Unearned revenue, also known as deferred revenue, is a
customer's advance payment for a product or service that has
yet to be provided by the company. Some common unearned
revenue situations include subscription services, gift cards,
advance ticket sales, lawyer retainer fees, and deposits for
services. As you learned when studying the accounting cycle,
we are applying the principles of accrual accounting when
revenues and expenses are recognized in different months or
years. Under accrual accounting, a company does not record
revenue as earned until it has provided a product or service,
thus adhering to the revenue recognition principle. Until the
customer is provided an obligated product or service, a liability
exists, and the amount paid in advance is recognized in the
Unearned Revenue account. As soon as the company provides
all, or a portion, of the product or service, the value is then
recognized as earned revenue.

   For example, assume that a landscaping company provides

                                                                   5.1 Current Liabilities | 517
services to clients. The company requires advance payment
before rendering service. The customer's advance payment for
landscaping is recognized in the Unearned Service Revenue
account, which is a liability. Once the company has finished
the client's landscaping, it may recognize all of the advance
payment as earned revenue in the Service Revenue account.
If the landscaping company provides part of the landscaping
services within the operating period, it may recognize the value
of the work completed at that time.

   Perhaps at this point a simple example might help clarify
the treatment of unearned revenue. Assume that the previous
landscaping company has a three-part plan to prepare lawns
of new clients for next year. The plan includes a treatment in
November 2019, February 2020, and April 2020. The company
has a special rate of $120 if the client prepays the entire $120
before the November treatment. In real life, the company
would hope to have dozens or more customers. However, to
simplify this example, we analyze the journal entries from one
customer. Assume that the customer prepaid the service on
October 15, 2019, and all three treatments occur on the first day
of the month of service. We also assume that $40 in revenue is
allocated to each of the three treatments.

   Before examining the journal entries, we need some key
information. Because part of the service will be provided in
2019 and the rest in 2020, we need to be careful to keep the
recognition of revenue in its proper period. If all of the
treatments occur, $40 in revenue will be recognized in 2019,
with the remaining $80 recognized in 2020. Also, since the
customer could request a refund before any of the services
have been provided, we need to ensure that we do not
recognize revenue until it has been earned. While it is nice
to receive funding before you have performed the services,
in essence, all you have received when you get the money
is a liability (unearned service revenue), with the hope of it
eventually becoming revenue. The following journal entries are

518 | 5.1 Current Liabilities
built upon the client receiving all three treatments. First, for the
prepayment of future services and for the revenue earned in
2019, the journal entries are shown.

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

Thinking about Unearned Revenue

When thinking about unearned revenue, consider the example
of Amazon.com, Inc. Amazon has a large business portfolio
that includes a widening presence in the online product and
service space. Amazon has two services in particular that
contribute to their unearned revenue account: Amazon Web
Services and Prime membership.

   According to Business Insider, Amazon had $4.8 billion in
unearned revenue recognized in their fourth quarter report
(December 2016), with most of that contribution coming from

520 | 5.1 Current Liabilities
Amazon Web Services.1 This is an increase from prior quarters.
The growth is due to larger and longer contracts for web
services. The advance payment for web services is transferred
to revenue over the term of the contract. The same is true for
Prime membership. Amazon receives $99 in advance pay from
customers, which is amortized over the twelve-month period of
the service agreement. This means that each month, Amazon
only recognizes $8.25 per Prime membership payment as
earned revenue.

Sierra Sports has contracted with a local youth football league
to provide all uniforms for participating teams. The league pays
for the uniforms in advance, and Sierra Sports provides the
customized uniforms shortly after purchase. The following
situation shows the journal entry for the initial purchase with
cash. Assume the league pays Sierra Sports for twenty uniforms
(cost per uniform is $30, for a total of $600) on April 3.

Figure 5.11 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Sierra Sports would see an increase to Cash (debit) for the
payment made from the football league. The revenue from the
sale of the uniforms is $600 (20 uniforms  $30 per uniform).
Unearned Uniform Revenue accounts reflect the prepayment
from the league, which cannot be recognized as earned
revenue until the uniforms are provided. Unearned Uniform
Revenue is a current liability account that increases (credit)
with the increase in outstanding product debt.

   Sierra provides the uniforms on May 6 and records the
following entry.

                                                                   5.1 Current Liabilities | 521
Figure 5.12 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Now that Sierra has provided all of the uniforms, the unearned
revenue can be recognized as earned. This satisfies the revenue
recognition principle. Therefore, Unearned Uniform Revenue
would decrease (debit), and Uniform Revenue would increase
(credit) for the total amount.

   Let's say that Sierra only provides half the uniforms on May
6 and supplies the rest of the order on June 2. The company
may not recognize revenue until a product (or a portion of a
product) has been provided. This means only half the revenue
can be recognized on May 6 ($300) because only half of the
uniforms were provided. The rest of the revenue recognition
will have to wait until June 2. Since only half of the uniforms
were delivered on May 6, only half of the costs of goods sold
would be recognized on May 6. The other half of the costs of
goods sold would be recognized on June 2 when the other half
of the uniforms were delivered. The following entries show the
separate entries for partial revenue recognition.

522 | 5.1 Current Liabilities

Long Description

In another scenario using the same cost information, assume
that on April 3, the league contracted for the production of the
uniforms on credit with terms 5/10, n/30. They signed a contract
for the production of the uniforms, so an account receivable
was created for Sierra, as shown.

Figure 5.14 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Sierra and the league have worked out credit terms and a
discount agreement. As such, the league can delay cash
payment for ten days and receive a discount, or for thirty days
with no discount assessed. Instead of cash increasing for Sierra,
Accounts Receivable increases (debit) for the amount the
football league owes.

   The league pays for the uniforms on April 15, and Sierra
provides all uniforms on May 6. The following entry shows the
payment on credit.

                                                                  5.1 Current Liabilities | 523
Figure 5.15 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

The football league made payment outside of the discount
period, since April 15 is more than ten days from the invoice
date. Thus, they do not receive the 5% discount. Cash increases
(debit) for the $600 paid by the football league, and Accounts
Receivable decreases (credit).

   In the next example, let's assume that the league made
payment within the discount window, on April 13. The following
entry occurs.

Figure 5.16 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

In this case, Accounts Receivable decreases (credit) for the
original amount owed, Sales Discount increases (debit) for the
discount amount of $30 ($600  5%), and Cash increases (debit)
for the $570 paid by the football league less discount.

   When the company provides the uniforms on May 6,
Unearned Uniform Revenue decreases (debit) and Uniform
Revenue increases (credit) for $600.

Current Portion of a Note Payable

A note payable is a debt to a lender with specific repayment
terms, which can include principal and interest. A note payable
has written contractual terms that make it available to sell to
another party. The principal on a note refers to the initial
borrowed amount, not including interest. In addition to
repayment of principal, interest may accrue. Interest is a
monetary incentive to the lender, which justifies loan risk.

   Let's review the concept of interest. Interest is an expense
that you might pay for the use of someone else's money. For
example, if you have a credit card and you owe a balance at
the end of the month it will typically charge you a percentage,
such as 1.5% a month (which is the same as 18% annually) on
the balance that you owe. Assuming that you owe $400, your
interest charge for the month would be $400  1.5%, or $6.00.
To pay your balance due on your monthly statement would
require $406 (the $400 balance due plus the $6 interest
expense).

   We make one more observation about interest: interest rates
are typically quoted in annual terms. For example, if you
borrowed money to buy a car, your interest expense might be
quoted as 9%. Note that this is an annual rate. If you are making
monthly payments, the monthly charge for interest would be

                                                                  5.1 Current Liabilities | 525
9% divided by twelve, or 0.75% a month. For example, if you
borrowed $20,000, and made sixty equal monthly payments,
your monthly payment would be $415.17, and your interest
expense component of the $415.17 payment would be $150.00.
The formula to calculate interest on either an annual or partial-
year basis is:

Figure 5.18 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

In our example this would be
$20,0009%112=$150

The good news is that for a loan such as our car loan or even a
home loan, the loan is typically what is called fully amortizing.
At this point, you just need to know that in our case the amount
that you owe would go from a balance due of $20,000 down
to $0 after the twentieth payment and the part of your $415.17
monthly payment allocated to interest would be less each
month. For example, your last (sixtieth) payment would only
incur $3.09 in interest, with the remaining payment covering
the last of the principle owed. See Figure 5.18 for an exhibit that
demonstrates this concept.

   A note payable is usually classified as a long-term
(noncurrent) liability if the note period is longer than one year
or the standard operating period of the company. However,
during the company's current operating period, any portion of
the long-term note due that will be paid in the current period
is considered a current portion of a note payable. The
outstanding balance note payable during the current period
remains a noncurrent note payable. Note that this does not
include the interest portion of the payments. On the balance
sheet, the current portion of the noncurrent liability is

526 | 5.1 Current Liabilities
separated from the remaining noncurrent liability. No journal
entry is required for this distinction, but some companies
choose to show the transfer from a noncurrent liability to a
current liability.

   For example, a bakery company may need to take out a
$100,000 loan to continue business operations. The bakery's
outstanding note principal is $100,000. Terms of the loan
require equal annual principal repayments of $10,000 for the
next ten years. Payments will be made on July 1 of each of
the ten years. Even though the overall $100,000 note payable is
considered long term, the $10,000 required repayment during
the company's operating cycle is considered current (short
term). This means $10,000 would be classified as the current
portion of a noncurrent note payable, and the remaining
$90,000 would remain a noncurrent note payable.

   The portion of a note payable due in the current period is
recognized as current, while the remaining outstanding
balance is a noncurrent note payable. For example, Figure
5.19 shows that $18,000 of a $100,000 note payable is scheduled
to be paid within the current period (typically within one year).
The remaining $82,000 is considered a long-term liability and
will be paid over its remaining life.

                                                                  5.1 Current Liabilities | 527
Figure 5.19 Current Portion of a Noncurrent Note Payable By: Rice
University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

In addition to the $18,000 portion of the note payable that will
be paid in the current year, any accrued interest on both the
current portion and the long-term portion of the note payable
that is due will also be paid. Assume, for example, that for the
current year $7,000 of interest will be accrued. In the current
year the debtor will pay a total of $25,000--that is, $7,000 in
interest and $18,000 for the current portion of the note payable.
A similar type of payment will be paid each year for as long as
any of the note payable remains; however, the annual interest
expense would be reduced since the remaining note payable
owed will be reduced by the previous payments.

   Interest payable can also be a current liability if accrual of
interest occurs during the operating period but has yet to be
paid. An annual interest rate is established as part of the loan

528 | 5.1 Current Liabilities
terms. Interest accrued is recorded in Interest Payable (a credit)
and Interest Expense (a debit). To calculate interest, the
company can use the following equations. This method
assumes a twelve-month denominator in the calculation,
which means that we are using the calculation method based
on a 360-day year. This method was more commonly used
prior to the ability to do the calculations using calculators or
computers, because the calculation was easier to perform.
However, with today's technology, it is more common to see
the interest calculation performed using a 365-day year. We will
demonstrate both methods.

Figure 5.20 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

For example, we assume the bakery has an annual interest rate
on its loan of 7%. The loan interest began accruing on July 1 and
it is now December 31. The bakery has accrued six months of
interest and would compute the interest liability as
$100,0007%612=$3,500
The $3,500 is recognized in Interest Payable (a credit) and
Interest Expense (a debit).

Taxes Payable

Taxes payable refers to a liability created when a company
collects taxes on behalf of employees and customers or for
tax obligations owed by the company, such as sales taxes or
income taxes. A future payment to a government agency is

                                                                  5.1 Current Liabilities | 529
required for the amount collected. Some examples of taxes
payable include sales tax and income taxes.

   Sales taxes result from sales of products or services to
customers. A percentage of the sale is charged to the customer
to cover the tax obligation (see Figure 5.21). The sales tax rate
varies by state and local municipalities but can range anywhere
from 1.76% to almost 10% of the gross sales price. Some states
do not have sales tax because they want to encourage
consumer spending. Those businesses subject to sales taxation
hold the sales tax in the Sales Tax Payable account until
payment is due to the governing body.

For example, assume that each time a shoe store sells a $50
                                                                   5.1 Current Liabilities | 531
pair of shoes, it will charge the customer a sales tax of 8% of
the sales price. The shoe store collects a total of $54 from the
customer. The $4 sales tax is a current liability until distributed
within the company's operating period to the government
authority collecting sales tax.

   Income taxes are required to be withheld from an
employee's salary for payment to a federal, state, or local
authority (hence they are known as withholding taxes). This
withholding is a percentage of the employee's gross pay.
Let's consider our previous example where Sierra Sports
purchased $12,000 of soccer equipment in August. Sierra now
sells the soccer equipment to a local soccer league for $18,000
cash on August 20. The sales tax rate is 6%. The following
revenue entry would occur.

Figure 5.22 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Cash increases (debit) for the sales amount plus sales tax. Sales
Tax Payable increases (credit) for the 6% tax rate ($18,000 
6%). Sierra's tax liability is owed to the State Tax Board. Sales
increases (credit) for the original amount of the sale, not
including sales tax. If Sierra's customer pays on credit, Accounts
Receivable would increase (debit) for $19,080 rather than Cash.

   When Sierra remits payment to the State Tax Board on
October 1, the following entry occurs.

532 | 5.1 Current Liabilities
Figure 5.23 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Sales Tax Payable and Cash decrease for the payment amount
of $1,080. Sales tax is not an expense to the business because
the company is holding it on account for another entity.

5.2 Types of Long-term
Funding

Businesses have several ways to secure financing and, in
practice, will use a combination of these methods to finance
the business. As you've learned, net income does not
necessarily mean cash. In some cases, in the long-run,
profitable operations will provide businesses with sufficient
cash to finance current operations and to invest in new
opportunities. However, situations might arise where the cash
flow generated is insufficient to cover future anticipated
expenses or expansion, and the company might need to secure
additional funding.

   If the extra amount needed is somewhat temporary or small,
a short-term source, such as a loan, might be appropriate.
When additional long-term funding needs arise, a business
can choose to sell stock in the company (equity-based
financing) or obtain a long-term liability (debt-based
financing), such as a loan that is spread over a period longer
than a year.

Types of Long-Term Funding

If a company needs additional funding for a major expenditure,
such as expansion, the source of funding would typically be
repaid over several years, or in the case of equity-based
financing, over an indefinite period of time. With equity-based
financing, the company sells an interest in the company's
ownership by issuing shares of the company's common stock.
This financing option is equity financing, and it will be
addressed in detail in the next chapter. Here, we will focus on

536 | 5.2 Types of Long-term Funding
two major long-term debt-based options: long-term loans and
bonds.

   Debt as an option for financing is an important source of
funding for businesses. If a company chooses a debt-based
option, the business can borrow money on an intermediate
(typically two to four years) or long-term (longer than four
years) basis from lenders. In the case of bonds, the funds would
be provided by investors. While loans and bonds are similar
in that they borrow money on which the borrower will pay
interest and eventually repay the lenders, they have some
important differences. First, a company can raise funds by
borrowing from an individual, bank, or other lender, while a
bond is typically sold to numerous investors. When a company
chooses a loan, the business signs what is known as a note, and
a legal relationship called a note payable is created between
the borrower and the lender. The document lists the conditions
of the financial arrangement, a fixed predetermined interest
rate (or, if the agreement allows, a variable interest rate), the
amount borrowed, the borrowing costs to be charged, and the
timing of the payments. In some cases, companies will secure
an interest-only loan, which means that for the life of the loan
the organization pays only the interest expense that has
accrued and upon maturity repays the original amount that it
borrowed and still owes. For individuals a student loan, car loan,
or a mortgage can all be types of notes payable.

Description

If debt instruments are created with a variable interest rate that
can fluctuate up or down, depending upon predetermined
factors, an inflation measurement must also be included in
the documentation. The Federal Funds Rate, for example, is a
commonly used tool for potential adjustments in interest rates.
To keep our discussion simple, we will use a fixed interest rate
in our subsequent calculations.

   Another difference between loans and bonds is that the note
payable creates an obligation for the borrower to repay the
lender on a specified date. To demonstrate the mechanics of
a loan, with loans, a note payable is created for the borrower
when the loan is initiated. This example assumes the loan will
be paid in full by the maturity or due date. Typically, over the life
of the loan, payments will be composed of both principal and

538 | 5.2 Types of Long-term Funding
interest components. The principal component paid typically
reduces the amount that the borrower owes the lender.

   Typical long-term loans have other characteristics. For
example, most long-term notes are held by one entity,
meaning one party provides all of the financing. If a company
bought heavy-duty equipment from Caterpillar, it would be
common for the seller of the equipment to also have a division
that would provide the financing for the transaction. An
additional characteristic of a long-term loan is that in many, if
not most, situations, the initial creator of the loan will hold it
and receive and process payments until it matures.

   Returning to the differences between long-term debt and
bonds, another difference is that the process for issuing
(selling) bonds can be very complicated, especially for
companies that are subject to regulation. The bond issue must
be approved by the appropriate regulatory agency, and then
outside parties such as investment banks sell the bonds to,
typically, a large audience of investors. It is not unusual for
several months to pass between the time that the company's
board of directors approves the bond offering, gets regulatory
approval, and then markets and issues the bonds. This
additional time is often the reason that the market rate for
similar bonds in the outside business environment is higher
or lower than the stated interest rate that the company
committed to pay when the bond process was first begun. This
difference can lead to bonds being issued (sold) at a discount
or premium.

   Finally, while loans can normally be paid off before they are
due, in most cases bonds must be held by an owner until they
mature. Because of this last characteristic, a bond, such as a
thirty-year bond, might have several owners over its lifetime,
while most long-term notes payable will only have one owner.

YOUR TURN

Current versus Long-Term Liabilities

Below is a portion of the 2017 Balance Sheet of Emerson,
Inc. (shown in millions of dollars).2 There are several
observations we can make from this information.

Figure 5.36 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

   Notice the company lists separately the Current Liabilities
(listed as "Short-term borrowings and current maturities of
long-term debt") and Long-term Liabilities (listed as "Long-
term debt"). Also, under the "Current liabilities" heading, notice
the "Short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-
term debt" decreased significantly from 2016 to 2017. In 2016,
Emerson held $2.584 billion in short-term borrowings and
current maturities of long-term debt. This amount decreased
by $1.722 billion in 2017, which is a 67% decrease. During the
same timeframe, long-term debt decreased $257 million,
going from $4.051 billion to $3.794 billion, which is a 6.3%
decrease.

   Thinking about the primary purpose of accounting, why do
you think accountants separate liabilities into current liabilities
and long-term liabilities?

   Solution
   The primary purpose of accounting is to provide stakeholders

540 | 5.2 Types of Long-term Funding
with financial information that is useful for decision making. It
is important for stakeholders to understand how much cash
will be required to satisfy liabilities within the next year
(liquidity) as well as how much will be required to satisfy long-
term liabilities (solvency). Stakeholders, especially lenders and
owners, are concerned with both liquidity and solvency of the
business.

Fundamentals of Bonds

Now let us look at bonds in more depth. A bond is a type of
financial instrument that a company issues directly to
investors, bypassing banks or other lending institutions, with
a promise to pay the investor a specified rate of interest over
a specified period of time. When a company borrows money
by selling bonds, it is said the company is "issuing" bonds. This
means the company exchanges cash for a promise to repay the
cash, along with interest, over a set period of time. As you've
learned, bonds are formal legal documents that contain
specific information related to the bond. In short, it is a legal
contract--called a bond certificate (as shown in Figure 5.37) or
an indenture--between the issuer (the business borrowing the
money) and the lender (the investor lending the money).
Bonds are typically issued in relatively small denominations,
such as $1,000 so they can be placed in the market and are
accessible to a greater market of investors compared to notes.
The bond indenture is a contract that lists the features of the
bond, such as the amount of money that will be repaid in the
future, called the principal (also called face value or maturity
value); the maturity date, the day the bond holder will receive
the principal amount; and the stated interest rate, which is the

                                                  5.2 Types of Long-term Funding | 541
rate of interest the issuer agrees to pay the bondholder
throughout the term of the bond.

Figure 5.37 Bond Certificate If you bought this $1,000 bond on July 1,
2018 and received this bond certificate, it had three important pieces
of information: the maturity date (June 30, 2023, 5 years from the
issue date when the company will pay back the $1,000; the principal
amount ($1,000) which is the amount you will receive in 2023; and the
stated annual interest rate (5%) which they will use to determine how
much cash to send you each year (0.05  $1,000 = $50 interest a year
for 5 years). Bond Certificate. By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC
BY-NC-SA 4.0

For a typical bond, the issuer commits to paying a stated
interest rate either once a year (annually) or twice a year
(semiannually). It is important to understand that the stated
rate will not go up or down over the life of the bond. This means
the borrower will pay the same semiannual or annual interest
payment on the same dates for the life of the bond. In other
words, when an investor buys a typical bond, the investor will
receive, in the future, two major cash flows: periodic interest
payments paid either annually or semiannually based on the
stated rate of the bond, and the maturity value, which is the

542 | 5.2 Types of Long-term Funding
total amount paid to the owner of the bond on the maturity
date.
The process of preparing a bond issuance for sale and then
selling on the primary market is lengthy, complex, and is
usually performed by underwriters--finance professionals who
specialize in issuing bonds and other financial instruments.
Here, we will only examine transactions concerning issuance,
interest payments, and the sale of existing bonds.

   There are two other important characteristics of bonds to
discuss. First, for most companies, the total value of bonds
issued can often range from hundreds of thousands to several
million dollars. The primary reason for this is that bonds are
typically used to help finance significant long-term projects or
activities, such as the purchase of equipment, land, buildings,
or another company.

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

Apple Inc. Issues Bonds

On May 11, 2017, Apple Inc. issued bonds to get cash. Apple
Inc. submitted a form to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (www.sec.gov) to announce their intentions.

                                                 5.2 Types of Long-term Funding | 543
Figure 5.38 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
Long Description

   On May 3 of the same year, Apple Inc. had issued their 10-Q
(quarterly report) that showed the following assets.

Figure 5.39 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

   Apple Inc. reported it had $15 billion dollars in cash and a
total of $101 billion in Current Assets. Why did it need to issue
bonds to raise $7 billion more?

   Analysts suggested that Apple would use the cash to pay
shareholder dividends. Even though Apple reported billions of
dollars in cash, most of the cash was in foreign countries
because that was where the products had been sold. Tax laws
vary by country, but if Apple transferred the cash to a US bank
account, they would have to pay US income tax on it, at a tax

544 | 5.2 Types of Long-term Funding
rate as high as 39%. So, Apple was much better off borrowing
and paying 3.2% interest, which is tax deductible, than bringing
the cash to the US and paying a 39% income tax.

   However, it's important to remember that in the United
States, Congress can change tax laws at any time, so what
was then current tax law when this transaction occurred could
change in the future.

   The second characteristic of bonds is that bonds are often
sold to several investors instead of to one individual investor.

   When establishing the stated rate of interest the business
will pay on a bond, bond underwriters consider many factors,
including the interest rates on government treasury bonds
(which are assumed to be risk-free), rates on comparable bond
offerings, and firm-specific factors related to the business's risk
(including its ability to repay the bond). The more likely the
possibility that a company will default on the bond, meaning
they either miss an interest payment or do not return the
maturity amount to the bond's owner when it matures, the
higher the interest rate is on the bond. It is important to
understand that the stated rate will not change over the life
of any one bond once it is issued. However, the stated rate
on future new bonds may change as economic circumstances
and the company's financial position changes.

   Bonds themselves can have different characteristics. For
example, a debenture is an unsecured bond issued based on
the good name and reputation of the company. These
companies are not pledging other assets to cover the amount
in case they fail to pay the debt, or default. The opposite of
a debenture is a secured bond, meaning the company is
pledging a specific asset as collateral for the bond. With a
secured bond, if the company goes under and cannot pay back
the bond, the pledged asset would be sold, and the proceeds
would be distributed to the bondholders.

                                                 5.2 Types of Long-term Funding | 545
   There are term bonds, or single-payment bonds, meaning
the entire bond will be repaid all at once, rather than in a
series of payments. And there are serial bonds, or bonds that
will mature over a period of time and will be repaid in a series
of payments.

   A callable bond (also known as a redeemable bond) is one
that can be repurchased or "called" by the issuer of the bond. If
a company sells callable bonds with an 8% interest rate and the
interest rate the bank is offering subsequently drops to 5%, the
company can borrow at that new rate of 5%, call the 8% bonds,
and pay them off (even if the purchaser does not want to sell
them back). In essence, the institution would be lowering its
rate of interest to borrow money from 8% to 5% by calling the
bond.

   Putable bonds give the bondholder the right to decide
whether to sell it back early or keep it until it matures. It is
essentially the opposite of a callable bond.

   A convertible bond can be converted to common stock in a
one-way, one-time conversion. Under what conditions would it
make sense to convert? Suppose the face-value interest rate
of the bond is 8%. If the company is doing well this year, such
that there is an expectation that shareholders will receive a
significant dividend and the stock price will rise, the stock
might appear to be more valuable than the return on the bond.

Summary of Bond Principles

As we conclude our discussion of bonds, there are two
principles that are worth noting. The first principle is there is
an inverse relationship between the market rate of interest and
the price of the bond. That is, when the market interest rate
increases, the price of the bond decreases. This is due to the
fact that the stated rate of the bond does not change.3 As we
discussed, when the market interest rate is higher than the
stated interest rate of the bond, the bond will sell at a discount
to attract investors and to compensate for the interest rate
earned between similar bonds. When, on the other hand, the
market interest rate is lower than the stated interest rate, the
bond will sell at a premium, which also compensates for the
interest rate earned between similar bonds. It may be helpful
to think of the inverse relationship between the market interest
rate and the bond price in terms of analogies such as a teeter-
totter in a park or a balance scale, as shown in Figure 5.40.

548 | 5.3 Bond Entries
Figure 5.40 Balance Scale Bond Stated Rate. This illustration
demonstrates the relationship between the market interest rate and
the selling price of bonds. When the market interest rate goes down,
the selling price goes up. The opposite is also true. Balance Scale. By:
Mr. and Mrs. Stuart P. Field Source: wikimediacommons CC0 1.0

In reality, the market interest rate will be above or below the
stated interest rate and is rarely equal to the stated rate. The
point of this illustration is to help demonstrate the inverse
relationship between the market interest rate and the bond
selling price.

   A second principle relating to bonds involves the relationship
of the bond carrying value relative to its face value. By
reviewing the amortization tables for bonds sold at a discount
and bonds sold at a premium it is clear that the carrying value
of bonds will always move toward the face value of the bond.
This occurs because interest expense (using the effective-
interest method) is calculated using the bond carrying value,
which changes each period.

                                                                        5.3 Bond Entries | 549
   For example, earlier we explored a 5-year, $100,000 bond that
sold for $104,460. Return to the amortization table in Figure
5.88 and notice the ending value on the bond is equal to the
bond face value of $100,000 (ignoring the rounding difference).
The same is true for bonds sold at a discount. In our example,
the $100,000 bond sold at $91,800 and the carrying value in
year five was $100,000. Understanding that the carrying value
of bonds will always move toward the bond face value is one
trick students can use to ensure the amortization table and
related accounting are correct. If, on the maturity date, the
bond carrying value does not equal the bond face value,
something is incorrect.

   Let's summmarize bond characteristics, When businesses
borrow money from banks or other investors, the terms of the
arrangement, which include the frequency of the periodic
interest payments, the interest rate, and the maturity value, are
specified in the bond indentures or loan documents. Recall,
too, that when the bonds are issued, the bond indenture only
specifies how much the borrower will repay the lender on the
maturity date. The amount of money received by the business
(borrower) during the issue is called the bond proceeds. The
bond proceeds can be impacted by the market interest rate
at the time the bonds are sold. Also, because of the lag time
between preparing a bond issuance and selling the bonds, the
market dynamics may cause the stated interest rate to change.
Rarely, the market rate is equal to the stated rate when the
bonds are sold, and the bond proceeds will equal the face
value of the bonds. More commonly, the market rate is not
equal to the stated rate. If the market rate is higher than the
stated rate when the bonds are sold, the bonds will be sold at a
discount. If the market rate is lower than the stated rate when
the bonds are sold, the bonds will be sold at a premium. Figure
5.40 illustrates this rule: that bond prices are inversely related
to the market interest rate.

market interest rate and bond prices is due to the time value of
money.

5.4 Debt v. Equity

Let's consider Maria, who wants to buy a business. The venture
is for sale for $1 million, but she only has $200,000. What are
her options? In this situation, a business owner can use debt
financing by borrowing money or equity financing by selling
part of the company, or she can use a combination of both.

   Debt financing means borrowing money that will be repaid
on a specific date in the future. Many companies have started
by incurring debt. To decide whether this is a viable option,
the owners need to determine whether they can afford the
monthly payments to repay the debt. One positive to this
scenario is that interest paid on the debt is tax deductible and
can lower the company's tax liability. On the other hand,
businesses can struggle to make these payments every month,
especially as they are starting out.

   With equity financing, a business owner sells part of the
business to obtain money to finance business operations. With
this type of financing, the original owner gives up some portion
of ownership in the company in return for cash. In Maria's case,
partners would supplement her $200,000 and would then own
a share of the business. Each partner's share is based on their
financial or other contributions.

   If a business owner forms a corporation, each owner will
receive shares of stock. Typically, those making the largest
financial investment have the largest say in decisions about
business operations. The issuance of dividends should also be
considered in this set-up. Paying dividends to shareholders is
not tax deductible, but dividend payments are also not
required. Additionally, a company does not have to buy back
any stock it sells.

552 | 5.4 Debt v. Equity
Equity Financing

For a corporation, equity financing involves trading or selling
shares of stock in the business to raise funds to run the
business. For a sole proprietorship, selling part of the business
means it is no longer a sole proprietorship: the subsequent
transaction could create either a corporation or partnership.
The owners would choose which of the two to create. Equity
means ownership. However, business owners can be creative in
selling interest in their venture. For example, Maria might sell
interest in the building housing her candy store and retain all
revenues for herself, or she may decide to share interest in the
operations (sales revenues) and retain sole ownership of the
building.

   The main benefit of financing with equity is that the business
owner is not required to pay back the invested funds, so
revenue can be re-invested in the company's growth.
Companies funded this way are also more likely to succeed
through their initial years. The Small Business Administration
suggests a new business should have access to enough cash
to operate for six months without having to borrow. The
disadvantages of this funding method are that someone else
owns part of the business and, depending on the arrangement,
may have ideas that conflict with the original owner's ideas but
that cannot be disregarded.

   The following characteristics are specific to equity financing:

 1. No required payment to owners or shareholders; dividends
      or other distributions are optional. Stock owners typically
      invest in stocks for two reasons: the dividends that many
      stocks pay or the appreciation in the market value of the
      stocks. For example, a stock holder might buy Walmart
      stock for $100 per share with the expectation of selling it
      for much more than $100 per share at some point in the
      future.

                                                                       5.4 Debt v. Equity | 553
2. Ownership interest held by the original or current owners
      can be diluted by issuing additional new shares of
      common stock.

 3. Unlike bonds that mature, common stocks do not have a
      definite life. To convert the stock to cash, some of the
      shares must be sold.

4. In the past, common stocks were typically sold in even
      100-share lots at a given market price per share. However,
      with Internet brokerages today, investors can buy any
      particular quantity they want.

Debt Financing

As you have learned, debt is an obligation to pay back an
amount of money at some point in the future. Generally, a term
of less than one year is considered short-term, and a term of
one year or longer is considered long-term. Borrowing money
for college or a car with a promise to pay back the amount
to the lender generates debt. Formal debt involves a signed
written document with a due date, an interest rate, and the
amount of the loan. A student loan is an example of a formal
debt.

   The following characteristics are specific to debt financing:

 1. The company is required to make timely interest
      payments to the holders of the bonds or notes payable.

2. The interest in cash that is to be paid by the company is
      generally locked in at the agreed-upon rate, and thus the
      same dollar payments will be made over the life of the
      bond. Virtually all bonds will have a maturity point. When
      the bond matures, the maturity value, which was the
      same as the contract or issuance value, is paid to whoever
      owns the bond.

 3. The interest paid is deductible on the company's income

554 | 5.4 Debt v. Equity
      tax return.
4. Bonds or notes payable do not dilute the company's

      ownership interest. The holders of the long-term liabilities
      do not have an ownership interest.
 5. Bonds are typically sold in $1,000 increments.

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

Short-Term Debt

Businesses sometimes offer lines of credit (short-term debt)
to their customers. For example, Wilson Sporting Goods offers
open credit to tennis clubs around the country. When the club
needs more tennis balls, a club manager calls Wilson and says,
"I'd like to order some tennis balls." The person at Wilson says,
"What's your account number," and takes the
order. Wilson does not ask the manager to sign a note but
does expect to be paid back. If the club does not pay within 120
days, Wilson will not let them order more items until the bill is
paid. Ordering on open credit makes transactions simpler for
the club and for Wilson, since there is not a need to formalize
every order. But collecting on the amount might be difficult
for Wilson if the club delays payment. For this reason, typically
customers must fill out applications, or have a history with the
vendor to go on open credit.

When deciding whether to raise capital by issuing debt or
equity, a corporation needs to consider dilution of ownership,
repayment of debt, cash obligations, budgeting impacts,
administrative costs, and credit risks.

Dilution of Ownership

The most significant consideration of whether a company
should seek funding using debt or equity financing is the effect
on the company's financial position. Issuance of debt does not
dilute the company's ownership as no additional ownership
shares are issued. Issuing debt, or borrowing, creates an
increase in cash, an asset, and an increase in a liability, such
as notes payable or bonds payable. Because borrowing is
independent of an owner's ownership interest in the business,
it has no effect on stockholders' equity, and ownership of the
corporation remains the same as illustrated in the accounting
equation in Figure 5.41.

liabilities but has no effect on stockholders' equity. Debt Financing.

556 | 5.4 Debt v. Equity
On the other hand, when a corporation issues stock, it is
financing with equity. The same increase in cash occurs, but
financing causes an increase in a capital stock account in
stockholders' equity as illustrated in the accounting equation
in Figure 5.42.

Figure 5.42 Equity Financing Equity financing increases assets and
stockholders' equity but has no effect on liabilities. Equity Financing.

This increase in stockholders' equity implies that more
shareholders will be allowed to vote and will participate in the
distribution of profits and assets upon liquidation.

Repayment of Debt

A second concern when choosing between debt and equity
financing relates to the repayment to the lender. A lender is
a debt holder entitled to repayment of the original principal
amount of the loan plus interest. Once the debt is paid, the
corporation has no additional obligation to the lender. This
allows owners of a corporation to claim a larger portion of the
future earnings than would be possible if more stock were sold
to investors. In addition, the interest component of the debt is
an expense, which reduces the amount of income on which a
company's income tax liability is calculated, thereby lowering
the corporation's tax liability and the actual cost of the loan to
the company.

                                                                       5.4 Debt v. Equity | 557
Cash Obligations

The most obvious difference between debt and equity
financing is that with debt, the principal and interest must
be repaid, whereas with equity, there is no repayment
requirement. The decision to declare dividends is solely up to
the board of directors, so if a company has limitations on cash,
it can skip or defer the declaration of dividends. When a
company obtains capital through debt, it must have sufficient
cash available to cover the repayment. This can put pressure on
the company to meet debt obligations when cash is needed for
other uses.

Budgeting

Except in the case of variable interest loans, loan and interest
payments are easy to estimate for the purpose of budgeting
cash payments. Loan payments do not tend to be flexible;
instead the principal payment is required month after month.
Moreover, interest costs incurred with debt are an additional
fixed cost to the company, which raises the company's break-
even point (total revenue equals total costs) as well as its cash
flow demands.

Cost Differences

Issuing debt rather than equity may reduce additional
administration costs associated with having additional
shareholders. These costs may include the costs for
informational mailings, processing and direct-depositing
dividend payments, and holding shareholder meetings. Issuing
debt also saves the time associated with shareholder

558 | 5.4 Debt v. Equity
controversies, which can often defer certain management
actions until a shareholder vote can be conducted.

Risk Assessment by Creditors

Borrowing commits the borrower to comply with debt
covenants that can restrict both the financing options and the
opportunities that extend beyond the main business function.
This can limit a company's vision or opportunities for change.
For example, many debt covenants restrict a
corporation's debt-to-equity ratio, which measures the portion
of debt used by a company relative to the amount of
stockholders' equity, calculated by dividing total debt by total
equity.

Figure 5.43 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

When a company borrows additional funds, its total debt (the
numerator) rises. Because there is no change in total equity,
the denominator remains the same, causing the debt-to-
equity ratio to increase. Because an increase in this ratio usually
means that the company will have more difficulty in repaying
the debt, lenders and investors consider this an added risk.
Accordingly, a business is limited in the amount of debt it can
carry. A debt agreement may also restrict the company from
borrowing additional funds.

   To increase the likelihood of debt repayment, a debt
agreement often requires that a company's assets serve as

                                                                       5.4 Debt v. Equity | 559
collateral, or for the company's owners to guarantee
repayment. Increased risks to the company from high-interest
debt and high amounts of debt, particularly when the
economy is unstable, include obstacles to growth and the
potential for insolvency resulting from the costs of holding
debt. These important considerations should be assessed prior
to determining whether a company should choose debt or
equity financing.

5.5 Corporate Business
Structure

A corporation is a legal business structure involving one or
more individuals (owners) who are legally distinct (separate)
from the business that is created under state laws. The owners
of a corporation are called stockholders (or shareholders) and
may or may not be employees of the corporation. Most
corporations rely on a combination of debt (liabilities) and
equity (stock) to raise capital. Both debt and equity financing
have the goal of obtaining funding, often referred to as capital,
to be used to acquire other assets needed for operations or
expansion. Capital consists of the total cash and other assets
owned by a company found on the left side of the accounting
equation. The method of financing these assets is evidenced
by looking at the right side of the accounting equation, either
recorded as liabilities or shareholders' equity.

The Organization of a Corporation

Incorporation is the process of forming a company into a
corporate legal entity. The advantages of incorporating are
available to a corporation regardless of size, from a corporation
with one shareholder to those with hundreds of thousands
of shareholders. To issue stock, an entity must first be
incorporated in a state.

   The process of incorporating requires filing the appropriate
paperwork and receiving approval from a governmental entity
to operate as a corporation. Each state has separate
requirements for creating a corporation, but ultimately, each
state grants a corporation the right to conduct business in the

562 | 5.5 Corporate Business Structure
respective state in which the corporation is formed. The steps
to incorporate are similar in most states:

 1. The founders (incorporators) choose an available business
      name that complies with the state's corporation rules. A
      state will not allow a corporation to choose a name that is
      already in use or that has been in use in recent years. Also,
      similar names might be disallowed.

2. The founders of a corporation prepare articles of
      incorporation called a "charter," which defines the basic
      structure and purpose of the corporation and the amount
      of capital stock that can be issued or sold.

 3. The founders file the articles of incorporation with the
      Department of State of the state in which the
      incorporation is desired. Once the articles are filed and any
      required fees are paid, the government approves the
      incorporation.

4. The incorporators hold an organizational meeting to elect
      the board of directors. Board meetings must be
      documented with formal board minutes (a written record
      of the items discussed, decisions made, and action plans
      resulting from the meeting). The board of directors
      generally meets at least annually. Microsoft, for example,
      has 14 directors on its board.4 Boards may have more or
      fewer directors than this, but most boards have a
      minimum of at least three directors.

 5. The board of directors prepares and adopts corporate
      bylaws. These bylaws lay out the operating rules for the
      corporation. Templates for drawing up corporate bylaws
      are usually available from the state to ensure that they
      conform with that state's requirements.

6. The board of directors agrees upon a par value price for
      the stock. Par value is a legal concept discussed later in
      this section. The price that the company receives (the
      initial market value) will be determined by what the

                                                5.5 Corporate Business Structure | 563
      purchasing public is willing to pay. For example, the
      company might set the par value at $1 per share, while the
      investing public on the day of issuance might be willing to
      pay $30 per share for the stock.

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

Deciding Where to Incorporate

With 50 states to choose from, how do corporations decide
where to incorporate? Many corporations are formed in either
Delaware or Nevada for several reasons. Delaware is especially
advantageous for large corporations because it has some of the
most flexible business laws in the nation and its court system
has a division specifically for handling business cases that
operates without juries. Additionally, companies formed in
Delaware that do not transact business in the state do not
need to pay state corporate income tax. Delaware imposes no
personal tax for non-residents, and shareholders can be non-
residents. In addition, stock shares owned by non-Delaware
residents are not subject to Delaware state taxation.

   Because of these advantages, Delaware dominated the share
of business incorporation for several decades. In recent years,
though, other states are seeking to compete for these
businesses by offering similarly attractive benefits of
incorporation. Nevada in particular has made headway. It has
no state corporate income tax and does not impose any fees
on shares or shareholders. After the initial set up fees, Nevada
has no personal or franchise tax for corporations or their
shareholders. Nevada, like Delaware, does not require
shareholders to be state residents. If a corporation chooses to

564 | 5.5 Corporate Business Structure
incorporate in Delaware, Nevada, or any state that is not its
home state, it will need to register to do business in its home
state. Corporations that transact in states other than their state
of incorporation are considered foreign and may be subject to
fees, local taxes, and annual reporting requirements that can
be time consuming and expensive.

Advantages of the Corporate Form

Compared to other forms of organization for businesses,
corporations have several advantages. A corporation is a
separate legal entity, it provides limited liability for its owner or
owners, ownership is transferable, it has a continuing existence,
and capital is generally easy to raise.

Separate Legal Entity

A sole proprietorship, a partnership, and a corporation are
different types of business entities. However, only a corporation
is a legal entity. As a separate legal entity, a corporation can
obtain funds by selling shares of stock, it can incur debt, it can
become a party to a contract, it can sue other parties, and it
can be sued. The owners are separate from the corporation.
This separate legal status complies with one of the basic
accounting concepts--the accounting entity concept, which
indicates that the economic activity of an entity (the
corporation) must be kept separate from the personal financial
affairs of the owners.

                                                5.5 Corporate Business Structure | 565
Limited Liability

Many individuals seek to incorporate a business because they
want the protection of limited liability. A corporation usually
limits the liability of an investor to the amount of his or her
investment in the corporation. For example, if a corporation
enters into a loan agreement to borrow a sum of money and
is unable to repay the loan, the lender cannot recover the
amount owed from the shareholders (owners) unless the
owners signed a personal guarantee. This is the opposite of
partnerships and sole proprietorships. In partnerships and sole
proprietorships, the owners can be held responsible for any
unpaid financial obligations of the business and can be sued to
pay obligations.

Transferable Ownership

Shareholders in a corporation can transfer shares to other
parties without affecting the corporation's operations. In effect,
the transfer takes place between the parties outside of the
corporation. In most corporations, the company generally does
not have to give permission for shares to be transferred to
another party. No journal entry is recorded in the corporation's
accounting records when a shareholder sells his or her stock to
another shareholder. However, a memo entry must be made in
the corporate stock ownership records so any dividends can be
issued to the correct shareholder.

Continuing Existence

From a legal perspective, a corporation is granted existence
forever with no termination date. This legal aspect falls in line

566 | 5.5 Corporate Business Structure
with the basic accounting concept of the going concern
assumption, which states that absent any evidence to the
contrary, a business will continue to operate in the indefinite
future. Because ownership of shares in a corporation is
transferrable, re-incorporation is not necessary when
ownership changes hands. This differs from a partnership,
which ends when a partner dies, or from a sole proprietorship,
which ends when the owner terminates the business.

Ease of Raising Capital

Because shares of stock can be easily transferred, corporations
have a sizeable market of investors from whom to obtain
capital. More than 65 million American households5 hold
investments in the securities markets. Compared to sole
proprietorships (whose owners must obtain loans or invest
their own funds) or to partnerships (which must typically
obtain funds from the existing partners or seek other partners
to join; although some partnerships are able borrow from
outside parties), a corporation will find that capital is relatively
easy to raise.

Disadvantages of the Corporate Form

As compared to other organizations for businesses, there are
also disadvantages to operating as a corporation. They include
the costs of organization, regulation, and taxation.

Costs of Organization

Corporations incur costs associated with organizing the

                                                5.5 Corporate Business Structure | 567
corporate entity, which include attorney fees, promotion costs,
and filing fees paid to the state. These costs are debited to
an account called organization costs. Assume that on January
1, Rayco Corporation made a payment for $750 to its attorney
to prepare the incorporation documents and paid $450 to the
state for filing fees. Rayco also incurred and paid $1,200 to
advertise and promote the stock offering. The total
organization costs are $2,400 ($750 + $450 + $1,200). The journal
entry recorded by Rayco is a $2,400 debit to Organization Costs
and a $2,400 credit to Cash.

Figure 5.44 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Organization costs are reported as part of the operating
expenses on the corporation's income statement.

Regulation

Compared to partnerships and sole proprietorships,
corporations are subject to considerably more regulation both
by the states in which they are incorporated and the states in
which they operate. Each state provides limits to the powers
that a corporation may exercise and specifies the rights and
liabilities of shareholders. The Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) is a federal agency that regulates
corporations whose shares are listed and traded on security
exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the
National Association of Securities Dealers Automated
Quotations Exchange (NASDAQ), and others; it accomplishes

568 | 5.5 Corporate Business Structure
this through required periodic filings and other regulations.
States also require the filing of periodic reports and payment of
annual fees.

Taxation

As legal entities, typical corporations (C corporations, named
after the specific subchapter of the Internal Revenue Service
code under which they are taxed), are subject to federal and
state income taxes (in those states with corporate taxes) based
on the income they earn. Stockholders are also subject to
income taxes, both on the dividends they receive from
corporations and any gains they realize when they dispose of
their stock. The income taxation of both the corporate entity's
income and the stockholder's dividend is referred to as double
taxation because the income is taxed to the corporation that
earned the income and then taxed again to stockholders when
they receive a distribution of the corporation's income.

   Corporations that are closely held (with fewer than 100
stockholders) can be classified as S corporations, so named
because they have elected to be taxed under subchapter S
of the Internal Revenue Service code. For the most part, S
corporations pay no income taxes because the income of the
corporation is divided among and passed through to each of
the stockholders, each of whom pays income taxes on his or
her share. Both Subchapter S (Sub S) and similar Limited
Liability Companies (LLCs) are not taxed at the business entity
but instead pass their taxable income to their owners.

5.6 How Stocks Work

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) (www.sec.gov)
is a government agency that regulates large and small public
corporations. Its mission is "to protect investors, maintain fair,
orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital
formation."8 The SEC identifies these as its five primary
responsibilities:

   Inform and protect investors
   Facilitate capital information
   Enforce federal securities laws
   Regulate securities markets
   Provide data

Under the Securities Act of 1933,9 all corporations that make
their shares available for sale publicly in the United States are
expected to register with the SEC. The SEC's registration
requirement covers all securities--not simply shares of
stock--including most tradable financial instruments. The
Securities Act of 1933, also known as the "truth in securities law,"
aims to provide investors with the financial data they need to
make informed decisions. While some companies are exempt
from filing documents with the SEC, those that offer securities
for sale in the U.S. and that are not exempt must file a number
of forms along with financial statements audited by certified
public accountants.

Private versus Public Corporations

Both private and public corporations become incorporated in
the same manner through the state governmental agencies

                                                                  5.6 How Stocks Work | 571
that handles incorporation. The journal entries and financial
reporting are the same whether a company is a public or a
private corporation. A private corporation is usually owned by a
relatively small number of investors. Its shares are not publicly
traded, and the ownership of the stock is restricted to only
those allowed by the board of directors.

   The SEC defines a publicly traded company as a company
that "discloses certain business and financial information
regularly to the public" and whose "securities trade on public
markets."10 A company can initially operate as private and later
decide to "go public," while other companies go public at the
point of incorporation. The process of going public refers to a
company undertaking an initial public offering (IPO) by issuing
shares of its stock to the public for the first time. After its IPO,
the corporation becomes subject to public reporting
requirements and its shares are frequently listed on a stock
exchange.11

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

Spreading the Risk

The East India Company became the world's first publicly
traded company as the result of a single factor--risk. During
the 1600s, single companies felt it was too risky to sail from
the European mainland to the East Indies. These islands held
vast resources and trade opportunities, enticing explorers to
cross the Atlantic Ocean in search of fortunes. In 1600, several
shipping companies joined forces and formed "Governor and
Company of Merchants of London trading with the East Indies,"
which was referred to as the East India Company. This
arrangement allowed the shipping companies--the

572 | 5.6 How Stocks Work
investors--to purchase shares in multiple companies rather
than investing in a single voyage. If a single ship out of a fleet
was lost at sea, investors could still generate a profit from ships
that successfully completely their voyages.12

The Secondary Market

A corporation's shares continue to be bought and sold by the
public after the initial public offering. Investors interested in
purchasing shares of a corporation's stock have several options.
One option is to buy stock on the secondary market, an
organized market where previously issued stocks and bonds
can be traded after they are issued. Many investors purchase
through stock exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange
or NASDAQ using a brokerage firm. A full-service brokerage
firm provides investment advice as well as a variety of financial
planning services, whereas a discount brokerage offers a
reduced commission and often does not provide investment
advice. Most of the stock trading--buying and selling of shares
by investors--takes place through brokers, registered
members of the stock exchange who buy and sell stock on
behalf of others. Online access to trading has broadened the
secondary market significantly over the past few decades.
Alternatively, stocks can be purchased from investment
bankers, who provide advice to companies wishing to issue
new stock, purchase the stock from the company issuing the
stock, and then resell the securities to the public.13

Marketing a Company's Stock

Once a corporation has completed the incorporation process,

                                                                  5.6 How Stocks Work | 573
it can issue stock. Each share of stock sold entitles the
shareholder (the investor) to a percentage of ownership in the
company. Private corporations are usually owned by a small
number of investors and are not traded on a public exchange.
Regardless of whether the corporation is public or private, the
steps to finding investors are similar:

 1. Have a trusted and reliable management team. These
      should be experienced professionals who can guide the
      corporation.

2. Have a financial reporting system in place. Accurate
      financial reporting is key to providing potential investors
      with reliable information.

 3. Choose an investment banker to provide advice and to
      assist in raising capital. Investment bankers are individuals
      who work in a financial institution that is primarily in the
      business of raising capital for corporations.

4. Write the company's story. This adds personality to the
      corporation. What is the mission, why it will be successful,
      and what sets the corporation apart?

 5. Approach potential investors. Selecting the right
      investment bankers will be extremely helpful with this
      step.

Capital Stock

A company's corporate charter specifies the classes of shares
and the number of shares of each class that a company can
issue. There are two classes of capital stock--common stock
and preferred stock. The two classes of stock enable a company
to attract capital from investors with different risk preferences.
Both classes of stock can be sold by either public or non-public
companies; however, if a company issues only one class, it must
be common stock. Companies report both common and

574 | 5.6 How Stocks Work
preferred stock in the stockholders' equity section of the
balance sheet.

Common Stock

A company's primary class of stock issued is common stock,
and each share represents a partial claim to ownership or a
share of the company's business. For many companies, this
is the only class of stock they have authorized. Common
stockholders have four basic rights.

 1. Common stockholders have the right to vote on corporate
      matters, including the selection of corporate directors and
      other issues requiring the approval of owners. Each share
      of stock owned by an investor generally grants the
      investor one vote.

2. Common stockholders have the right to share in corporate
      net income proportionally through dividends.

 3. If the corporation should have to liquidate, common
      stockholders have the right to share in any distribution of
      assets after all creditors and any preferred stockholders
      have been paid.

4. In some jurisdictions, common shareholders have
      a preemptive right, which allows shareholders the option
      to maintain their ownership percentage when new shares
      of stock are issued by the company. For example, suppose
      a company has 1,000 shares of stock issued and plans to
      issue 200 more shares. A shareholder who currently owns
      50 shares will be given the right to buy a percentage of
      the new issue equal to his current percentage of
      ownership. His current percentage of ownership is 5%:

Original ownership percentage=501,000=5%

                                                                  5.6 How Stocks Work | 575
This shareholder will be given the right to buy 5% of the new
issue, or 10 new shares.
Number of new shares to be
purchases=5%200shares=10shares

Should the shareholder choose not to buy the shares, the
company can offer the shares to other investors. The purpose
of the preemptive right is to prevent new issuances of stock
from reducing the ownership percentage of the current
shareholders. If the shareholder in our example is not offered
the opportunity to buy 5% of the additional shares (his current
ownership percentage) and the new shares are sold to other
investors, the shareholder's ownership percentage will drop
because the total shares issued will increase.

New ownership percentage=501,200=4.17%

The shareholder would now own only 4.17% of the corporation,
compared to the previous 5%.

Preferred Stock

A company's charter may authorize more than one class of
stock. Preferred stock has unique rights that are "preferred," or
more advantageous, to shareholders than common stock. The
classification of preferred stock is often a controversial area in
accounting as some researchers believe preferred stock has
characteristics closer to that of a stock/bond hybrid security,
with characteristics of debt rather than a true equity item. For
example, unlike common stockholders, preferred shareholders
typically do not have voting rights; in this way, they are similar
to bondholders. In addition, preferred shares do not share in
the common stock dividend distributions. Instead, the
"preferred" classification entitles shareholders to a dividend

576 | 5.6 How Stocks Work
that is fixed (assuming sufficient dividends are declared),
similar to the fixed interest rate associated with bonds and
other debt items. Preferred stock also mimics debt in that
preferred shareholders have a priority of dividend payments
over common stockholders. While there may be characteristics
of both debt and equity, preferred stock is still reported as part
of stockholders' equity on the balance sheet.

   Not every corporation authorizes and issues preferred stock,
and there are some important characteristics that corporations
should consider when deciding to issue preferred stock. The
price of preferred stock typically has less volatility in the stock
market. This makes it easier for companies to more reliably
budget the amount of the expected capital contribution since
the share price is not expected to fluctuate as freely as for
common stock. For the investor, this means there is less chance
of large gains or losses on the sale of preferred stock.

The Status of Shares of Stock

The corporate charter specifies the number of authorized
shares, which is the maximum number of shares that a
corporation can issue to its investors as approved by the state
in which the company is incorporated. Once shares are sold
to investors, they are considered issued shares. Shares that are
issued and are currently held by investors are
called outstanding shares because they are "out" in the hands
of investors. Occasionally, a company repurchases shares from
investors. While these shares are still issued, they are no longer
considered to be outstanding. These repurchased shares are
called treasury stock.

   Assume that Waystar Corporation has 2,000 shares of capital
stock authorized in its corporate charter. During May, Waystar
issues 1,500 of these shares to investors. These investors are
now called stockholders because they "hold" shares of stock.

                                                                  5.6 How Stocks Work | 577
Because the other 500 authorized shares have not been issued
they are considered unissued shares. Now assume that
Waystar buys back 100 shares of stock from the investors who
own the 1,500 shares. Only 1,400 of the issued shares are
considered outstanding, because 100 shares are now held by
the company as treasury shares.

Stock Values

Two of the most important values associated with stock are
market value and par value. The market value of stock is the
price at which the stock of a public company trades on the
stock market. This amount does not appear in the corporation's
accounting records, nor in the company's financial statements.

   Most corporate charters specify the par value assigned to
each share of stock. This value is printed on the stock
578 | 5.6 How Stocks Work
certificates and is often referred to as a face value because it
is printed on the "face" of the certificate. Incorporators typically
set the par value at a very small arbitrary amount because it is
used internally for accounting purposes and has no economic
significance. Because par value often has some legal
significance, it is considered to be legal capital. In some states,
par value is the minimum price at which the stock can be sold.
If for some reason a share of stock with a par value of one dollar
was issued for less than its par value of one dollar known as
issuing at a stock discount, the shareholder could be held liable
for the difference between the issue price and the par value if
liquidation occurs and any creditors remain unpaid.

   Under some state laws, corporations are sometimes allowed
to issue no-par stock--a stock with no par value assigned.
When this occurs, the company's board of directors typically
assigns a stated value to each share of stock, which serves as
the company's legal capital. Companies generally account for
stated value in the accounting records in the same manner
as par value. If the company's board fails to assign a stated
value to no-par stock, the entire proceeds of the stock sale are
treated as legal capital. A portion of the stockholders' equity
section of Frontier Communications Corporation's balance
sheet as of December 31, 2017 displays the reported preferred
and common stock. The par value of the preferred stock is $0.01
per share and $0.25 per share for common stock. The legal
capital of the preferred stock is $192.50, while the legal capital
of the common stock is $19,883.14

                                                                  5.6 How Stocks Work | 579

5.7 Owners' Equity

Owners' equity represents the business owners' share of the
company. It is often referred to as net worth or net assets in
the financial world and as stockholders' equity or shareholders'
equity when discussing businesses operations of corporations.
From a practical perspective, it represents everything a
company owns (the company's assets) minus all the company
owes (its liabilities). While "owners' equity" is used for all three
types of business organizations (corporations, partnerships,
and sole proprietorships), only sole proprietorships name the
balance sheet account "owner's equity" as the entire equity
of the company belongs to the sole owner. Partnerships often
label this section of their balance sheet as "partners' equity."
All three forms of business utilize different accounting for the
respective equity transactions and use different equity
accounts, but they all rely on the same relationship
represented by the basic accounting equation (Figure 5.45).

Figure 5.45 Accounting Equation The relationship among assets,
liabilities, and equity is represented in the accounting equation.
Accounting Equation. By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC

Three Forms of Business Ownership

Businesses operate in one of three forms--sole proprietorships,

partnerships, or corporations. Sole proprietorships utilize a

single account in owners' equity in which the owner's

investments and net income of the company are accumulated

and  distributions        to  the  owner  are

582 | 5.7 Owners' Equity
withdrawn. Partnerships utilize a separate capital account for
each partner, with each capital account holding the respective
partner's investments and the partner's respective share of net
income, with reductions for the distributions to the respective
partners. Corporations differ from sole proprietorships and
partnerships in that their operations are more complex, often
due to size. Unlike these other entity forms, owners of a
corporation usually change continuously.

   The stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet for
corporations contains two primary categories of accounts. The
first is paid-in capital, or contributed capital--consisting of
amounts paid in by owners. The second category is earned
capital, consisting of amounts earned by the corporation as
part of business operations. On the balance sheet, retained
earnings is a key component of the earned capital section,
while the stock accounts such as common stock, preferred
stock, and additional paid-in capital are the primary
components of the contributed capital section.

Characteristics and Functions
of the Retained Earnings
Account

Retained earnings is the primary component of a company's
earned capital. It generally consists of the cumulative net
income minus any cumulative losses less dividends declared.
A basic statement of retained earnings is referred to as an
analysis of retained earnings because it shows the changes in
the retained earnings account during the period. A company
preparing a full set of financial statements may choose
between preparing a statement of retained earnings, if the
activity in its stock accounts is negligible, or a statement of
stockholders' equity, for corporations with activity in their stock
accounts. A statement of retained earnings for Clay
Corporation for its second year of operations (Figure 5.47)

584 | 5.7 Owners' Equity
shows the company generated more net income than the
amount of dividends it declared.

Figure 5.47 Statement of Retained Earnings for Clay Corporation By:

When the retained earnings balance drops below zero, this
negative or debit balance is referred to as a deficit in retained
earnings.

Statement of Stockholders' Equity

The statement of retained earnings is a subsection of the
statement of stockholders' equity. While the retained earnings
statement shows the changes between the beginning and
ending balances of the retained earnings account during the
period, the statement of stockholders' equity provides the
changes between the beginning and ending balances of each
of the stockholders' equity accounts, including retained
earnings. The format typically displays a separate column for
each stockholders' equity account, as shown for Clay
Corporation in Figure 5.49. The key events that occurred during
the year--including net income, stock issuances, and
dividends--are listed vertically. The stockholders' equity section
of the company's balance sheet displays only the ending

                                                                     5.7 Owners' Equity | 585
balances of the accounts and does not provide the activity or
changes during the period.

Description

Nearly all public companies report a statement of stockholders'
equity rather than a statement of retained earnings because
GAAP requires disclosure of the changes in stockholders'
equity accounts during each accounting period. It is
significantly easier to see the changes in the accounts on a
statement of stockholders' equity rather than as a paragraph
note to the financial statements.

5.8 Typical Stock
Transactions

Chad and Rick have successfully incorporated La Cantina and
are ready to issue common stock to themselves and the newly
recruited investors. The proceeds will be used to open new
locations. The corporate charter of the corporation indicates
that the par value of its common stock is $1.50 per share. When
stock is sold to investors, it is very rarely sold at par value. Most
often, shares are issued at a value in excess of par. This is
referred to as issuing stock at a premium. Stock with no par
value that has been assigned a stated value is treated very
similarly to stock with a par value.

   Stock can be issued in exchange for cash, property, or
services provided to the corporation. For example, an investor
could give a delivery truck in exchange for a company's stock.
Another investor could provide legal fees in exchange for stock.
The general rule is to recognize the assets received in exchange
for stock at the asset's fair market value.

Typical Common Stock Transactions

The company plans to issue most of the shares in exchange
for cash, and other shares in exchange for kitchen equipment
provided to the corporation by one of the new investors. Two
common accounts in the equity section of the balance sheet
are used when issuing stock--Common Stock and Additional
Paid-in Capital from Common Stock. Common Stock consists
of the par value of all shares of common stock
issued. Additional paid-in capital from common stock consists
of the excess of the proceeds received from the issuance of the

588 | 5.8 Typical Stock Transactions
stock over the stock's par value. When a company has more
than one class of stock, it usually keeps a separate additional
paid-in capital account for each class.

Issuing Common Stock with a Par Value in
Exchange for Cash

When a company issues new stock for cash, assets increase
with a debit, and equity accounts increase with a credit. To
illustrate, assume that La Cantina issues 8,000 shares of
common stock to investors on January 1 for cash, with the
investors paying cash of $21.50 per share. The total cash to be
received is $172,000.

The transaction causes Cash to increase (debit) for the total
cash received. The Common Stock account increases (credit)
with a credit for the par value of the 8,000 shares issued: 8,000
 $1.50, or $12,000. The excess received over the par value is
reported in the Additional Paid-in Capital from Common Stock
account. Since the shares were issued for $21.50 per share, the
excess over par value per share of $20 ($21.50 - $1.50) is
multiplied by the number of shares issued to arrive at the
Additional Paid-in Capital from Common Stock credit.

Issuing Common Stock with a Par Value in
Exchange for Property or Services

When a company issues stock for property or services, the
company increases the respective asset account with a debit
and the respective equity accounts with credits. The asset
received in the exchange--such as land, equipment, inventory,
or any services provided to the corporation such as legal or
accounting services--is recorded at the fair market value of
the stock or the asset or services received, whichever is more
clearly determinable.

   To illustrate, assume that La Cantina issues 2,000 shares of
authorized common stock in exchange for legal services
provided by an attorney. The legal services have a value of
$8,000 based on the amount the attorney would charge.
Because La Cantina's stock is not actively traded, the asset will
be valued at the more easily determinable market value of the
legal services. La Cantina must recognize the market value of
the legal services as an increase (debit) of $8,000 to its Legal
Services Expense account. Similar to recording the stock issued
for cash, the Common Stock account is increased by the par
value of the issued stock, $1.50  2,000 shares, or $3,000. The
excess of the value of the legal services over the par value of the
stock appears as an increase (credit) to the Additional Paid-in
Capital from Common Stock account:

Figure 5.55 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

590 | 5.8 Typical Stock Transactions
Just after the issuance of both investments, the stockholders'
equity account, Common Stock, reflects the total par value of
the issued stock; in this case, $3,000 + $12,000, or a total of
$15,000. The amounts received in excess of the par value are
accumulated in the Additional Paid-in Capital from Common
Stock account in the amount of $5,000 + $160,000, or $165,000.
A portion of the equity section of the balance sheet just after
the two stock issuances by La Cantina will reflect the Common
Stock account stock issuances as shown in Figure 5.56.

Issuing No-Par Common Stock with a
Stated Value

Not all stock has a par value specified in the company's charter.
In most cases, no-par stock is assigned a stated value by the
board of directors, which then becomes the legal capital value.
Stock with a stated value is treated as if the stated value is a
par value. Assume that La Cantina's 8,000 shares of common
stock issued on June 1 for $21.50 were issued at a stated value
of $1.50 rather than at a par value. The total cash to be received
remains $172,000 (8,000 shares  $21.50), which is recorded
as an increase (debit) to Cash. The Common Stock account
increases with a credit for the stated value of the 8,000 shares
issued: 8,000  $1.50, or $12,000. The excess received over the

                                                     5.8 Typical Stock Transactions | 591
stated value is reported in the Additional Paid-in Capital from
Common Stock account at $160,000, based on the issue price
of $21.50 per share less the stated value of $1.50, or $20, times
the 8,000 shares issued:
The transaction looks identical except for the explanation.

Figure 5.57 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

If the 8,000 shares of La Cantina's common stock had been
no-par, and no stated value had been assigned, the $172,000
would be debited to Cash, with a corresponding increase in the
Common Stock account as a credit of $172,000. No entry would
be made to Additional Paid-in Capital account as it is reserved
for stock issue amounts above par or stated value. The entry
would appear as:

Issuing Preferred Stock

A few months later, Chad and Rick need additional capital to
develop a website to add an online presence and decide to
issue all 1,000 of the company's authorized preferred shares.
The 5%, $8 par value, preferred shares are sold at $45 each.
The Cash account increases with a debit for $45 times 1,000
shares, or $45,000. The Preferred Stock account increases for
the par value of the preferred stock, $8 times 1,000 shares, or
$8,000. The excess of the issue price of $45 per share over the
$8 par value, times the 1,000 shares, is credited as an increase
to Additional Paid-in Capital from Preferred Stock, resulting in
a credit of $37,000.

5.9 Treasury Stock

Sometimes a corporation decides to purchase its own stock
in the market. These shares are referred to as treasury stock.
A company might purchase its own outstanding stock for a
number of possible reasons. It can be a strategic maneuver to
prevent another company from acquiring a majority interest
or preventing a hostile takeover. A purchase can also create
demand for the stock, which in turn raises the market price of
the stock. Sometimes companies buy back shares to be used
for employee stock options or profit-sharing plans.

Acquiring Treasury Stock

When a company purchases treasury stock, it is reflected on
the balance sheet in a contra equity account. As a contra equity
account, Treasury Stock has a debit balance, rather than the
normal credit balances of other equity accounts. The total cost
of treasury stock reduces total equity. In substance, treasury
stock implies that a company owns shares of itself. However,
owning a portion of one's self is not possible. Treasury shares
do not carry the basic common shareholder rights because
they are not outstanding. Dividends are not paid on treasury
shares, they provide no voting rights, and they do not receive
a share of assets upon liquidation of the company. There are
two methods possible to account for treasury stock--the cost
method, which is discussed here, and the par value method,
which is a more advanced accounting topic. The cost method
is so named because the amount in the Treasury Stock account
at any point in time represents the number of shares held in
treasury times the original cost paid to acquire each treasury
share.

596 | 5.9 Treasury Stock
   Assume Duratech's net income for the first year was
$3,100,000, and that the company has 12,500 shares of
common stock issued. During May, the company's board of
directors authorizes the repurchase of 800 shares of the
company's own common stock as treasury stock. Each share
of the company's common stock is selling for $25 on the open
market on May 1, the date that Duratech purchases the stock.
Duratech will pay the market price of the stock at $25 per share
times the 800 shares it purchased, for a total cost of $20,000.
The following journal entry is recorded for the purchase of the
treasury stock under the cost method.

Figure 5.61 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Even though the company is purchasing stock, there is no
asset recognized for the purchase. An entity cannot own part of
itself, so no asset is acquired. Immediately after the purchase,
the equity section of the balance sheet (Figure 5.62) will show
the total cost of the treasury shares as a deduction from total
stockholders' equity.

                                                                      5.9 Treasury Stock | 597

9,200 shares.

Reporting Treasury Stock for Nestl
Holdings Group

Nestl Holdings Group sells a number of major brands of food
and beverages including Gerber, Hagen-Dazs, Purina,
and Lean Cuisine. The company's statement of stockholders'
equity shows that it began with 990 million Swiss francs (CHF)
in treasury stock at the beginning of 2016. In 2017, it acquired
additional shares at a cost of 3,547 million CHF, raising its total
treasury stock to 4,537 million CHF at the end of 2017, primarily
due to a share buy-back program.15

Reissuing Treasury Stock above
Cost

Management typically does not hold treasury stock forever.

                                                                      5.9 Treasury Stock | 599
The company can resell the treasury stock at cost, above cost,
below cost, or retire it. If La Cantina reissues 100 of its treasury
shares at cost ($25 per share) on July 3, a reversal of the original
purchase for the 100 shares is recorded. This has the effect
of increasing an asset, Cash, with a debit, and decreasing the
Treasury Stock account with a credit. The original cost paid for
each treasury share, $25, is multiplied by the 100 shares to be
resold, or $2,500. The journal entry to record this sale of the
treasury shares at cost is:

Figure 5.64 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

If the treasury stock is resold at a price higher than its original
purchase price, the company debits the Cash account for the
amount of cash proceeds, reduces the Treasury Stock account
with a credit for the cost of the treasury shares being sold, and
credits the Paid-in Capital from Treasury Stock account for the
difference. Even though the difference--the selling price less
the cost--looks like a gain, it is treated as additional capital
because gains and losses only result from the disposition of
economic resources (assets). Treasury Stock is not an asset.
Assume that on August 1, La Cantina sells another 100 shares
of its treasury stock, but this time the selling price is $28 per
share. The Cash Account is increased by the selling price, $28
per share times the number of shares resold, 100, for a total
debit to Cash of $2,800. The Treasury Stock account decreases
by the cost of the 100 shares sold, 100  $25 per share, for a total
credit of $2,500, just as it did in the sale at cost. The difference is
recorded as a credit of $300 to Additional Paid-in Capital from
Treasury Stock.

Reissuing Treasury Stock Below Cost

If the treasury stock is reissued at a price below cost, the
account used for the difference between the cash received
from the resale and the original cost of the treasury stock
depends on the balance in the Paid-in Capital from Treasury
Stock account. Any balance that exists in this account will be a
credit. The transaction will require a debit to the Paid-in Capital
from Treasury Stock account to the extent of the balance. If
the transaction requires a debit greater than the balance in the
Paid-in Capital account, any additional difference between the
cost of the treasury stock and its selling price is recorded as a
reduction of the Retained Earnings account as a debit. If there
is no balance in the Additional Paid-in Capital from Treasury
Stock account, the entire debit will reduce retained earnings.

   Assume that on October 9, La Cantina sells another 100
shares of its treasury stock, but this time at $23 per share.
Cash is increased for the selling price, $23 per share times the
number of shares resold, 100, for a total debit to Cash of $2,300.
The Treasury Stock account decreases by the cost of the 100
shares sold, 100  $25 per share, for a total credit of $2,500. The
difference is recorded as a debit of $200 to the Additional Paid-
in Capital from Treasury Stock account. Notice that the balance
in this account from the August 1 transaction was $300, which
was sufficient to offset the $200 debit. The transaction is
recorded as:

                                                                      5.9 Treasury Stock | 601
Figure 5.66 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Treasury stock transactions have no effect on the number of
shares authorized or issued. Because shares held in treasury
are not outstanding, each treasury stock transaction will
impact the number of shares outstanding. A corporation may
also purchase its own stock and retire it. Retired stock reduces
the number of shares issued. When stock is repurchased for
retirement, the stock must be removed from the accounts so
that it is not reported on the balance sheet. The balance sheet
will appear as if the stock was never issued in the first place.

For corporations, there are several reasons to consider sharing
some of their earnings with investors in the form of dividends.
Many investors view a dividend payment as a sign of a
company's financial health and are more likely to purchase its
stock. In addition, corporations use dividends as a marketing
tool to remind investors that their stock is a profit generator.

   This section explains the three types of dividends--cash
dividends, property dividends, and stock dividends--along

                                                                           5.10 Dividends | 605
with stock splits, showing the journal entries involved and the
reason why companies declare and pay dividends.

The Nature and Purposes of Dividends

Stock investors are typically driven by two factors--a desire to
earn income in the form of dividends and a desire to benefit
from the growth in the value of their investment. Members
of a corporation's board of directors understand the need to
provide investors with a periodic return, and as a result, often
declare dividends up to four times per year. However,
companies can declare dividends whenever they want and are
not limited in the number of annual declarations. Dividends
are a distribution of a corporation's earnings. They are not
considered expenses, and they are not reported on the income
statement. They are a distribution of the net income of a
company and are not a cost of business operations.

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

So Many Dividends

The declaration and payment of dividends varies among
companies. In December 2017 alone, 4,506 U.S. companies
declared either cash, stock, or property dividends--the largest
number of declarations since 2004.16 It is likely that these
companies waited to declare dividends until after financial
statements were prepared, so that the board and other
executives involved in the process were able to provide
estimates of the 2017 earnings.

606 | 5.10 Dividends
Some companies choose not to pay dividends and instead
reinvest all of their earnings back into the company. One
common scenario for situation occurs when a company
experiencing rapid growth. The company may want to invest all
their retained earnings to support and continue that growth.
Another scenario is a mature business that believes retaining
its earnings is more likely to result in an increased market value
and stock price. In other instances, a business may want to
use its earnings to purchase new assets or branch out into
new areas. Most companies attempt dividend smoothing, the
practice of paying dividends that are relatively equal period
after period, even when earnings fluctuate. In exceptional
circumstances, some corporations pay a special dividend,
which is a one-time extra distribution of corporate earnings. A
special dividend usually stems from a period of extraordinary
earnings or a special transaction, such as the sale of a division.
Some companies, such as Costco Wholesale Corporation, pay
recurring dividends and periodically offer a special dividend.
While Costco's regular quarterly dividend is $0.57 per share,
the company issued a $7.00 per share cash dividend in
2017.17 Companies that have both common and preferred stock
must consider the characteristics of each class of stock.

   Note that dividends are distributed or paid only to shares
of stock that are outstanding. Treasury shares are not
outstanding, so no dividends are declared or distributed for
these shares. Regardless of the type of dividend, the
declaration always causes a decrease in the retained earnings
account.

Dividend Dates

A company's board of directors has the power to formally vote

                                                                           5.10 Dividends | 607
to declare dividends. The date of declaration is the date on
which the dividends become a legal liability, the date on which
the board of directors votes to distribute the dividends. Cash
and property dividends become liabilities on the declaration
date because they represent a formal obligation to distribute
economic resources (assets) to stockholders. On the other
hand, stock dividends distribute additional shares of stock, and
because stock is part of equity and not an asset, stock
dividends do not become liabilities when declared.

   At the time dividends are declared, the board establishes
a date of record and a date of payment. The date of
record establishes who is entitled to receive a dividend;
stockholders who own stock on the date of record are entitled
to receive a dividend even if they sell it prior to the date of
payment. Investors who purchase shares after the date of
record but before the payment date are not entitled to receive
dividends since they did not own the stock on the date of
record. These shares are said to be sold ex dividend. The date of
payment is the date that payment is issued to the investor for
the amount of the dividend declared.

Cash Dividends

Cash dividends are corporate earnings that companies pass
along to their shareholders. To pay a cash dividend, the
corporation must meet two criteria. First, there must be
sufficient cash on hand to fulfill the dividend payment. Second,
the company must have sufficient retained earnings; that is, it
must have enough residual assets to cover the dividend such
that the Retained Earnings account does not become a
negative (debit) amount upon declaration. On the day the
board of directors votes to declare a cash dividend, a journal
entry is required to record the declaration as a liability.

608 | 5.10 Dividends
Accounting for Cash Dividends When Only
Common Stock Is Issued

Small private companies like La Cantina often have only one
class of stock issued, common stock. Assume that on
December 16, La Cantina's board of directors declares a $0.50
per share dividend on common stock. As of the date of
declaration, the company has 10,000 shares of common stock
issued and holds 800 shares as treasury stock. The total cash
dividend to be paid is based on the number of shares
outstanding, which is the total shares issued less those in
treasury. Outstanding shares are 10,000 - 800, or 9,200 shares.
The cash dividend is:

The journal entry to record the declaration of the cash
dividends involves a decrease (debit) to Retained Earnings (a
stockholders' equity account) and an increase (credit) to Cash
Dividends Payable (a liability account).

Figure 5.69 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

While a few companies may use a temporary account,
Dividends Declared, rather than Retained Earnings, most
companies debit Retained Earnings directly. Ultimately, any
dividends declared cause a decrease to Retained Earnings.

   The second significant dividend date is the date of record.
The date of record determines which shareholders will receive
the dividends. There is no journal entry recorded; the company
creates a list of the stockholders that will receive dividends.

                                                                           5.10 Dividends | 609
   The date of payment is the third important date related to
dividends. This is the date that dividend payments are
prepared and sent to shareholders who owned stock on the
date of record. The related journal entry is a fulfillment of the
obligation established on the declaration date; it reduces the
Cash Dividends Payable account (with a debit) and the Cash
account (with a credit).

Figure 5.70 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Property Dividends

A property dividend occurs when a company declares and
distributes assets other than cash. The dividend typically
involves either the distribution of shares of another company
that the issuing corporation owns (one of its assets) or a
distribution of inventory. For example, Walt Disney
Company may choose to distribute tickets to visit its theme
parks. Anheuser-Busch InBev, the company that owns the
Budweiser and Michelob brands, may choose to distribute a
case of beer to each shareholder. A property dividend may be
declared when a company wants to reward its investors but
doesn't have the cash to distribute, or if it needs to hold onto its
existing cash for other investments. Property dividends are not
as common as cash or stock dividends. They are recorded at
the fair market value of the asset being distributed. To illustrate
accounting for a property dividend, assume that Duratech
Corporation has 60,000 shares of $0.50 par value common
stock outstanding at the end of its second year of operations,
and the company's board of directors declares a property

610 | 5.10 Dividends

Comparing Small Stock Dividends, Large
Stock Dividends, and Stock Splits

Companies that do not want to issue cash or property
dividends but still want to provide some benefit to
shareholders may choose between small stock dividends, large

                                                                             5.10 Dividends | 611
stock dividends, and stock splits. Both small and large stock
dividends occur when a company distributes additional shares
of stock to existing stockholders.

   There is no change in total assets, total liabilities, or total
stockholders' equity when a small stock dividend, a large stock
dividend, or a stock split occurs. Both types of stock dividends
impact the accounts in stockholders' equity. A stock split
causes no change in any of the accounts within stockholders'
equity. The impact on the financial statement usually does not
drive the decision to choose between one of the stock dividend
types or a stock split. Instead, the decision is typically based
on its effect on the market. Large stock dividends and stock
splits are done in an attempt to lower the market price of
the stock so that it is more affordable to potential investors. A
small stock dividend is viewed by investors as a distribution of
the company's earnings. Both small and large stock dividends
cause an increase in common stock and a decrease to retained
earnings. This is a method of capitalizing (increasing stock) a
portion of the company's earnings (retained earnings).

Stock Dividends

Some companies issue shares of stock as a dividend rather
than cash or property. This often occurs when the company has
insufficient cash but wants to keep its investors happy. When
a company issues a stock dividend, it distributes additional
shares of stock to existing shareholders. These shareholders do
not have to pay income taxes on stock dividends when they
receive them; instead, they are taxed when the investor sells
them in the future.

   A stock dividend distributes shares so that after the
distribution, all stockholders have the exact same percentage
of ownership that they held prior to the dividend. There are
two types of stock dividends--small stock dividends and large

612 | 5.10 Dividends
stock dividends. The key difference is that small dividends are
recorded at market value and large dividends are recorded at
the stated or par value.

Small Stock Dividends

A small stock dividend occurs when a stock dividend
distribution is less than 25% of the total outstanding shares
based on the shares outstanding prior to the dividend
distribution. To illustrate, assume that Duratech Corporation
has 60,000 shares of $0.50 par value common stock
outstanding at the end of its second year of operations.
Duratech's board of directors declares a 5% stock dividend on
the last day of the year, and the market value of each share
of stock on the same day was $9. Figure 5.73 shows the
stockholders' equity section of Duratech's balance sheet just
prior to the stock declaration.

The 5% common stock dividend will require the distribution
of 60,000 shares times 5%, or 3,000 additional shares of stock.
An investor who owns 100 shares will receive 5 shares in the

                                                                            5.10 Dividends | 613
record the stock dividend declaration requires a decrease
(debit) to Retained Earnings for the market value of the shares
to be distributed: 3,000 shares  $9, or $27,000. An increase
(credit) to the Common Stock Dividends Distributable is
recorded for the par value of the stock to be distributed: 3,000
 $0.50, or $1,500. The excess of the market value over the
par value is reported as an increase (credit) to the Additional
Paid-in Capital from Common Stock account in the amount of
$25,500.

Figure 5.74 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

If the company prepares a balance sheet prior to distributing
the stock dividend, the Common Stock Dividend Distributable
account is reported in the equity section of the balance sheet
beneath the Common Stock account. The journal entry to
record the stock dividend distribution requires a decrease
(debit) to Common Stock Dividend Distributable to remove
the distributable amount from that account, $1,500, and an
increase (credit) to Common Stock for the same par value
amount.

Figure 5.75 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

To see the effects on the balance sheet, it is helpful to compare

614 | 5.10 Dividends
the stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet before
and after the small stock dividend.

Figure 5.76 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
Long Description

After the distribution, the total stockholders' equity remains
the same as it was prior to the distribution. The amounts within
the accounts are merely shifted from the earned capital
account (Retained Earnings) to the contributed capital
accounts (Common Stock and Additional Paid-in Capital).
However, the number of shares outstanding has changed. Prior
to the distribution, the company had 60,000 shares
outstanding. Just after the distribution, there are 63,000
outstanding. The difference is the 3,000 additional shares of
the stock dividend distribution. The company still has the same
total value of assets, so its value does not change at the time
a stock distribution occurs. The increase in the number of
outstanding shares does not dilute the value of the shares held
by the existing shareholders. The market value of the original
shares plus the newly issued shares is the same as the market
value of the original shares before the stock dividend. For
example, assume an investor owns 200 shares with a market
value of $10 each for a total market value of $2,000. She receives
10 shares as a stock dividend from the company. She now has
210 shares with a total market value of $2,000. Each share now
has a theoretical market value of about $9.52.

                                                                            5.10 Dividends | 615
Large Stock Dividends

A large stock dividend occurs when a distribution of stock to
existing shareholders is greater than 25% of the total
outstanding shares just before the distribution. The accounting
for large stock dividends differs from that of small stock
dividends because a large dividend impacts the stock's market
value per share. While there may be a subsequent change in
the market price of the stock after a small dividend, it is not as
abrupt as that with a large dividend.

   To illustrate, assume that Duratech Corporation's balance
sheet at the end of its second year of operations shows the
following in the stockholders' equity section prior to the
declaration of a large stock dividend.

Figure 5.77 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
Long Description

Also assume that Duratech's board of directors declares a 30%
stock dividend on the last day of the year, when the market
value of each share of stock was $9. The 30% stock dividend will
require the distribution of 60,000 shares times 30%, or 18,000
additional shares of stock. An investor who owns 100 shares
will receive 30 shares in the dividend distribution (30%  100
shares). The journal entry to record the stock dividend
declaration requires a decrease (debit) to Retained Earnings

616 | 5.10 Dividends
and an increase (credit) to Common Stock Dividends
Distributable for the par or stated value of the shares to be
distributed: 18,000 shares  $0.50, or $9,000. The journal entry
is:

Figure 5.78 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

The subsequent distribution will reduce the Common Stock
Dividends Distributable account with a debit and increase the
Common Stock account with a credit for the $9,000.

Figure 5.79 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

There is no consideration of the market value in the accounting
records for a large stock dividend because the number of
shares issued in a large dividend is large enough to impact
the market; as such, it causes an immediate reduction of the
market price of the company's stock.

   In comparing the stockholders' equity section of the balance
sheet before and after the large stock dividend, we can see that
the total stockholders' equity is the same before and after the
stock dividend, just as it was with a small dividend (Figure 5.80).

                                                                            5.10 Dividends | 617
Figure 5.80 Stockholders' Equity Section of the Balance Sheet for
Duratech By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long
Description

Similar to distribution of a small dividend, the amounts within
the accounts are shifted from the earned capital account
(Retained Earnings) to the contributed capital account
(Common Stock) though in different amounts. The number of
shares outstanding has increased from the 60,000 shares prior
to the distribution, to the 78,000 outstanding shares after the
distribution. The difference is the 18,000 additional shares in
the stock dividend distribution. No change to the company's
assets occurred; however, the potential subsequent increase in
market value of the company's stock will increase the investor's
perception of the value of the company.

Stock Splits

A traditional stock split occurs when a company's board of
directors issue new shares to existing shareholders in place
of the old shares by increasing the number of shares and
reducing the par value of each share. For example, in a 2-for-1
stock split, two shares of stock are distributed for each share
held by a shareholder. From a practical perspective,
shareholders return the old shares and receive two shares for

618 | 5.10 Dividends
each share they previously owned. The new shares have half
the par value of the original shares, but now the shareholder
owns twice as many. If a 5-for-1 split occurs, shareholders
receive 5 new shares for each of the original shares they owned,
and the new par value results in one-fifth of the original par
value per share.

   While a company technically has no control over its common
stock price, a stock's market value is often affected by a stock
split. When a split occurs, the market value per share is reduced
to balance the increase in the number of outstanding shares. In
a 2-for-1 split, for example, the value per share typically will be
reduced by half. As such, although the number of outstanding
shares and the price change, the total market value remains
constant. If you buy a candy bar for $1 and cut it in half, each
half is now worth $0.50. The total value of the candy does not
increase just because there are more pieces.

   A stock split is much like a large stock dividend in that both
are large enough to cause a change in the market price of the
stock. Additionally, the split indicates that share value has been
increasing, suggesting growth is likely to continue and result in
further increase in demand and value. Companies often make
the decision to split stock when the stock price has increased
enough to be out of line with competitors, and the business
wants to continue to offer shares at an attractive price for small
investors.

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

Samsung Boasts a 50-to-1 Stock Split

In May of 2018, Samsung Electronics18 had a 50-to-1 stock split
in an attempt to make it easier for investors to buy its

                                                                            5.10 Dividends | 619
stock. Samsung's market price of each share prior to the split
was an incredible 2.65 won ("won" is a Japanese currency), or
$2,467.48. Buying one share of stock at this price is rather
expensive for most people. As might be expected, even after a
slight drop in trading activity just after the split announcement,
the reduced market price of the stock generated a significant
increase to investors by making the price per share less
expensive. The split caused the price to drop to 0.053 won,
or $49.35 per share. This made the stock more accessible to
potential investors who were previously unable to afford a
share at $2,467.

   A reverse stock split occurs when a company attempts to
increase the market price per share by reducing the number
of shares of stock. For example, a 1-for-3 stock split is called
a reverse split since it reduces the number of shares of stock
outstanding by two-thirds and triples the par or stated value
per share. The effect on the market is to increase the market
value per share. A primary motivator of companies invoking
reverse splits is to avoid being delisted and taken off a stock
exchange for failure to maintain the exchange's minimum
share price.

   Accounting for stock splits is quite simple. No journal entry
is recorded for a stock split. Instead, the company prepares
a memo entry in its journal that indicates the nature of the
stock split and indicates the new par value. The balance sheet
will reflect the new par value and the new number of shares
authorized, issued, and outstanding after the stock split. To
illustrate, assume that Duratech's board of directors declares
a 4-for-1 common stock split on its $0.50 par value stock. Just
before the split, the company has 60,000 shares of common
stock outstanding, and its stock was selling at $24 per share.
The split causes the number of shares outstanding to increase
by four times to 240,000 shares (4  60,000), and the par value

620 | 5.10 Dividends
to decline to one-fourth of its original value, to $0.125 per share
($0.50  4). No change occurs to the dollar amount of any
general ledger account.

Figure 5.81 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

The split typically causes the market price of stock to decline
immediately to one-fourth of the original value--from the $24
per share pre-split price to approximately $6 per share post-
split ($24  4), because the total value of the company did not
change as a result of the split. The total stockholders' equity on
the company's balance sheet before and after the split remain
the same.

5.11 Earnings per Share
(EPS)

Earnings per share (EPS) measures the portion of a
corporation's profit allocated to each outstanding share of
common stock. Many financial analysts believe that EPS is the
single most important tool in assessing a stock's market price.
A high or increasing earnings per share can drive up a stock
price. Conversely, falling earnings per share can lower a stock's
market price. EPS is also a component in calculating the price-
to-earnings ratio (the market price of the stock divided by its
earnings per share), which many investors find to be a key
indicator of the value of a company's stock.

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

Microsoft Earnings Announcements
Exceeds Wall Street Targets

While a company's board of directors makes the final approval
of the reports, a key goal of each company is to look favorable to
investors while providing financial statements that accurately
reflect the financial condition of the company. Each quarter,
public companies report EPS through a public announcement
as one of the key measures of their profitability. These
announcements are highly anticipated by investors and
analysts. The suspense is heightened because analysts provide
earnings estimates to the public prior to each announcement

                                                      5.11 Earnings per Share (EPS) | 625
release. According to Matt Weinberger of Business Insider, the
announcement by Microsoft of its first quarter 2018 EPS
reported at $0.95 per share, higher than analysts' estimates of
$0.85 per share, caused the value of its stock to rise by more
than 3% within hours of the announcement.19 While revenue
was the other key metric in Microsoft's earnings
announcement, EPS carried more weight in the surge of the
company's market price.

Calculating Earnings per Share

Earnings per share is the profit a company earns for each of
its outstanding common shares. Both the balance sheet and
income statement are needed to calculate EPS. The balance
sheet provides details on the preferred dividend rate, the total
par value of the preferred stock, and the number of common
shares outstanding. The income statement indicates the net
income for the period. The formula to calculate basic earnings
per share is:

Figure 5.85 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

By removing the preferred dividends from net income, the
numerator represents the profit available to common
shareholders. Because preferred dividends represent the
amount of net income to be distributed to preferred
shareholders, this portion of the income is obviously not
available for common shareholders. While there are a number

626 | 5.11 Earnings per Share (EPS)
of variations of measuring a company's profit used in the
financial world, such as NOPAT (net operating profit after taxes)
and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and
amortization), GAAP requires companies to calculate EPS
based on a corporation's net income, as this amount appears
directly on a company's income statement, which for public
companies must be audited.

   In the denominator, only common shares are used to
determine earnings per share because EPS is a measure of
earnings for each common share of stock. The denominator
can fluctuate throughout the year as a company issues and
buys back shares of its own stock. The weighted average
number of shares is used on the denominator because of this
fluctuation. To illustrate, assume that a corporation began the
year with 600 shares of common stock outstanding and then
on April 1 issued 1,000 more shares. During the period January
1 to March 31, the company had the original 600 shares
outstanding. Once the new shares were issued, the company
had the original 600 plus the new 1,000 shares, for a total of
1,600 shares for each of the next nine months--from April 1
to December 31. To determine the weighted average shares,
apply these fractional weights to both of the stock amounts, as
shown in Figure 5.86.

Figure 5.86 Weighted Shares By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC
BY-NC-SA 4.0

If the shares were not weighted, the calculation would not
consider the time period during which the shares were
outstanding.

   To illustrate how EPS is calculated, assume Sanaron

                                                      5.11 Earnings per Share (EPS) | 627
Company earns $50,000 in net income during 2020. During
the year, the company also declared a $10,000 dividend on
preferred stock and a $14,000 dividend on common stock. The
company had 5,000 common shares outstanding the entire
year along with 2,000 preferred shares. Sanaron has generated
$8 of earnings ($50,000 less the $10,000 of preferred dividends)
for each of the 5,000 common shares of stock it has
outstanding.

Measuring Performance with EPS

EPS is a key profitability measure that both current and
potential common stockholders monitor. Its importance is
accentuated by the fact that GAAP requires public companies
to report EPS on the face of a company's income statement.
This is only ratio that requires such prominent reporting. If fact,
public companies are required to report two different earnings
per share amounts on their income statements--basic and
diluted. We've illustrated the calculation of basic EPS. Diluted
EPS, which is not demonstrated here, involves the
consideration of all securities such as stocks and bonds that
could potentially dilute, or reduce, the basic EPS.

   Earnings per share is interpreted differently by different
analysts. Some financial experts favor companies with higher
EPS values. The reasoning is that a higher EPS is a reflection
of strong earnings and therefore a good investment prospect.
A more meaningful analysis occurs when EPS is tracked over a
number of years, such as when presented in the comparative
income statements for Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc.'s
respective year ends in 2017, 2016, and 2015 shown in Figure
5.87.20 Cracker Barrel's basic EPS is labeled as "net income per
share: basic."

By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long
Description

Most analysts believe that a consistent improvement in EPS
year after year is the indication of continuous improvement in
the earning power of a company. This is what is seen in Cracker
Barrel's EPS amounts over each of the three years reported,
moving from $6.85 to $7.91 to $8.40. However, it is important
to remember that EPS is calculated on historical data, which
is not always predictive of the future. In addition, when EPS is
used to compare different companies, significant differences
may exist. If companies are in the same industry, that
comparison may be more valuable than if they are in different
industries. Basically, EPS should be a tool used in decision-
making, utilized alongside other analytic tools.

Would You Have Invested?

What if, in 1997, you invested $5,000 in Amazon? Today, your
investment would be worth nearly $1 million. Potential
investors viewing Amazon's income statement in 1997 would
have seen an EPS of a negative $0.11. In other
words, Amazon lost $0.11 for each share of common stock
outstanding. Would you have invested?

   Solution
   Answers will vary. A strong response would include the idea
that a negative or small EPS reflects upon the past historical
operations of a company. EPS does not predict the future.
Investors in 1997 looked beyond Amazon's profitability and saw
its business model having strong future potential.

6.1 Defining Managerial
Accounting

Financial accounting process provides a useful level of detail for
external users, such as investors and creditors, but it does not
provide enough detailed information for the types of decisions
made in the day-to-day operation of the business or for the
types of decisions that guide the company long
term. Managerial accounting is the process that allows
decision makers to set and evaluate business goals by
determining what information they need to make a particular
decision and how to analyze and communicate this
information. Let's explore the role of managerial accounting
in several different organizations and at different levels of the
organization, and then examine the primary responsibilities of
management.

   Three friends who are recent graduates from business
school, Alex, Hana, and Gillian, have each just begun their first
postgraduation jobs. They meet for lunch and discuss what
each of their jobs entails. Alex has taken a position as a market
analyst for a Fortune 500 company that operates in the
shipping industry. Her first assignment is to suggest and
evaluate ways the company can increase the revenue from
shipping contracts by 10 percent for the year. Before tackling
this project, she has a number of questions. What is the
purpose of this analysis? What type of information does she
need? Where would she find this information? Can she get
it from a basic income statement and balance sheet? How
will she know if her suggestions for pricing are creating more
shipping contracts and helping to meet the company's goal?
She begins with an analysis of the company's top fifty
customers, including the prices they pay, discounts offered,

636 | 6.1 Defining Managerial Accounting
discounts applied, frequency of shipments, and so on, to
determine if there are price adjustments that need to be made
to attract those customers to use the company's shipping
services more frequently.

   Hana has a position in the human resources department of a
pharmaceutical company and is asked to research and analyze
a new trend in compensation in which employers are forgoing
raises to employees and are instead giving large bonuses for
meeting certain goals. Her task is to ascertain if this new idea
would be appropriate for her company. Her questions are
similar to Alex's. What information does she need? Where
would she find this information? How would she determine the
impact of this type of change on the business? If implemented,
what information would she need to assess the success of the
plan?

   Gillian is working in the supply chain area of a major
manufacturer that produces the various mirrors found on cars
and trucks. Her first assignment is to determine whether it
is more cost effective and efficient for her company to make
or purchase a bracket used in the assembly of the mirrors.
Her questions are also similar to her friends' questions. Why
is the company considering this decision? What information
does she need? Where would she find this information? Would
choosing the option with the lowest cost be the correct choice?

   The women are surprised by how similar their questions are
despite how different their jobs are. They each are assigned
tasks that require them to use various forms of information
from many different sources to answer an important question
for their respective companies. Table 6.1 provides possible
answers to each of the questions posed in these scenarios.

Questions            Possible Answers

Alex, Marketing Analyst

What is the          To determine a better way to price their
purpose of this      services
analysis?

What type of         Financial and nonfinancial information, such
information does     as the number of contracts per client
she need?

Where would she      Financial statements, customer contracts,
find this            competitor information, and customer surveys
information?

Can she get it       No, she would need to use many other sources
from a basic         of information
income statement
and balance
sheet?

How will she know    By using a means to evaluate the success, such
if her suggestions   as by comparing the number of contracts
for pricing are      received from each company before the new
creating more        pricing structure with the number received
shipping contracts   after the pricing change of contracts
and helping to
meet the
company's goal?

Hana, Human Resources

What information     Financial and nonfinancial information, such
does she need?       as how other companies have implemented
                     this idea, including the amount of the bonus
                     and the types of measures on which the bonus
                     was measured

Where would she      Mostly from internal company sources, such as
find this            employee performance records, but also from
information?         industry and competitor sources

How would she        Perform surveys to determine the effect of the
determine the        bonus method on employee morale and
impact of this type  employee turnover; she could determine the
of change on the     effect on gross revenue of annual bonuses
business?            versus annual raises

638 | 6.1 Defining Managerial Accounting
Questions           Possible Answers

If implemented,     Measuring employee turnover; evaluating
what information    employee satisfaction after the change;
would she need to   assessing whether the performance measures
assess the success  being used to determine the bonus were
of the plan?        measures that truly impacted the company in
                    a positive manner

Gillian, Supply Chain

Why is the          Management likely wants to minimize costs,
company             and this particular part is one they believe may
considering this    be more cost effective to buy than to make
decision?

What information    She needs the cost to buy the part as well as all
does she need?      the costs that would be incurred to make the
                    part; whether her company has the ability
                    (capacity) to make the part; the quality of the
                    part if they buy it compared to if they make it;
                    the ability of a supplier of the part to deliver on
                    time

Where would she     She would find the information from internal
find this           records about production costs, from cost
information?        details provided by the external producer, and
                    from industry reports on the quality of
                    production from the external supplier

Would choosing      The lowest-cost option may not be the best
the option with     choice if the quality is subpar, if the part is not
the lowest cost be  delivered in a timely manner and thus throws
the correct         off or slows production, or if the use of a
choice?             purchased part will affect the relationship
                    between the company and the car
                    manufacturer to whom the mirror is ultimately
                    sold

The questions the women have and the answers they require
show that there are many types of information that a company
needs to make business decisions. Although none of these
individuals is given the title of manager, they need information
to help provide management with the information necessary
to make decisions to move the company forward with its
strategic plan. The scenarios of the three women are not
unique. These types of questions occur every day in businesses
across the world.

   Some decisions will be more clearly appropriate for higher-

                       6.1 Defining Managerial Accounting | 639
level management. For example, Lynx Boating Company
produces three different lines of boats (sport boats, pontoon
boats, and large cruisers). All three boat lines are profitable,
but the pontoon boat line seems to be less profitable than the
other two types of boats. Management may want to consider
abandoning the pontoon line and using that additional
capacity to produce one of the other more profitable lines. They
would need detailed financial information in order to make
such a decision.

   Service organizations also face decisions that require more
detailed information than is available in financial accounting
statements. A company's financial statements aggregate
information for the company as a whole, but for most
managerial decisions, information must be gathered in a
timely manner at a product, customer, or division level. For
example, the management of City Hospital is considering the
purchase of four new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
machines that scan three times faster than their current
machines and thus would allow the hospital's imaging
department to evaluate eight additional patients each day.
Each machine costs $425,000 and will last five years before
needing to be replaced. Would this be a wise investment for
City Hospital? Hospital management would need the
appropriate information to assess the alternatives in order to
make this decision. Throughout your study of managerial
accounting, you will learn about the types of information
needed to make these decisions, as well as techniques for
analyzing this information. First, it is important to understand
the various roles managers play in the organization in order
to understand the types of information and the level of detail
that are needed. Most of the job responsibilities of a manager
fit into one of three categories: planning, controlling, or
evaluating.

   The model in Figure 6.1 sums up the three primary
responsibilities of management and the managerial

640 | 6.1 Defining Managerial Accounting
accountant's role in the process. As you can see from the
model, the function of accomplishing an entity's mission
statement is a circular, ongoing process.

Planning

One of the first items on a new company's agenda is the
creation of a mission statement. A mission statement is a short
statement of a company's purpose and focus. This statement
should be broad enough that it will encompass future growth
and changes of the company. Table 6.2 contains the mission
statement of three different types of companies: a
manufacturer, an e-commerce company, and a service
company.

                                            6.1 Defining Managerial Accounting | 641
Table 6.2 Sample Mission Statements By: Rice University Openstax
                                      CC BY NC SA 4.0

Company Mission Statement

Dow        "To passionately create innovation for our stakeholders
Chemical at the intersection of chemistry, biology, and physics."1

Starbucks  "To inspire and nurture the human spirit--one person,
                                                    2
           one cup, and one neighborhood at a time."

Google     "Our mission is to organize the world's information and
           make it universally accessible and useful."3

Once the mission of the company has been determined, the
company can begin the process of setting goals, or what the
company expects to accomplish over time, and objectives, or
the targets that need to be met in order to meet the company's
goals. This is known as planning. Planning occurs at all levels
of an organization and can cover various periods of time. One
type of planning, called strategic planning, involves setting
priorities and determining how to allocate corporate resources
to help an organization accomplish both short-term and long-
term goals. For example, one hotel may want to be the low-
price, no-frills, clean alternative, while another may decide to
be the superior quality, high-price luxury hotel with many
amenities. Obviously, to be successful, either of these
businesses must determine the goals necessary to meet their
particular strategy.

   Typically, a strategic plan will span any number of years an
organization chooses (three, five, seven, or even ten years), and
often companies will have multiple strategic plans, such as
one for three years, one for five years, and one for ten years.
Given the time length involved in many plans, the organization
also needs to factor in the potential effects of changes in their
senior executive leadership and the composition of the board
of directors.

   What types of objectives are part of a strategic plan?
Strategic objectives should be diverse and will vary from
company to company and from industry to industry, but some

642 | 6.1 Defining Managerial Accounting
general goals can include maximizing market share, increasing
short-term profits, increasing innovation, offering the best
value for the cost, maintaining commitment to community
programs, and exceeding environmental protection mandates.

   From a managerial accounting perspective, planning
involves determining steps or actions to meet the strategic
or other goals of the company. For example, Daryn's Dairy, a
major producer of organic dairy products in the Midwest, has
made increasing the market share of its products one of its
strategic goals. However, to be truly effective, the goals need to
be defined specifically. For example, the goals might be stated
in terms of percentage growth, both annually and in terms of
the number of markets addressed in their growth projections.

   Also, Daryn's planning process would include the steps the
company plans to use to implement to increase market share.
These plans may include current-year plans, five-year plans,
and ten-year plans.

   The current-year plan may be to sell the company's products
in 10 percent more stores in the states in which it currently
operates. The five-year plan may be to sell the products
internationally in three countries, and the ten-year plan may
be to acquire their chief competitor and, thus, their customers.
Each of these plans will require outlining specific steps to reach
these goals and communicating those steps to the employees
who will carry out or have an impact on reaching these goals
and implementing these plans.

   Planning can involve financial and nonfinancial processes
and measures. One planning tool discussed in Budgeting is
the budgeting process, which requires management to assess
the resources--for example, time, money, and number and
type of employees needed--to meet current-year objectives.
Budgeting often includes both financial data, such as worker
pay rates, and nonfinancial data, such as the number of
customers an employee can serve in a given time period.

   A retail company can plan for the expected sales volume,

                                           6.1 Defining Managerial Accounting | 643
a hospital can plan for the number of x-rays they expect to
administer, a law firm can plan the hours expected for the
various types of legal services they perform, a manufacturing
firm can plan for the level of quality expected in each item
produced, and a utility company can plan for the level of air
pollutants that are acceptable. Notice that in each of these
examples, the aspect of the business that is being planned and
evaluated is a qualitative (nonfinancial) factor or characteristic.
In your study of managerial accounting, you will learn about
many situations in which both financial and nonfinancial data
or information are equally relevant. However, the qualitative
aspects are typically not quantified in dollars but evaluated
using some other standards, such as customers served or
students advised.

   While these functions are initially stated in qualitative terms,
most of these items would at some point be translated into
a dollar value or dollar effect. In each of these examples, the
managerial accounting function would help to determine the
variables that would help appropriately measure the desired
goal as well as plan how to quantify these measures. However,
measures are only useful if tracked and used to determine
their effectiveness. This is known as the control function of
management.

Controlling

To measure whether plans are meeting objectives or goals,
management must put in place ways to assess success or lack
of success. Controlling involves the monitoring of the planning
objectives that were put into place. For example, if you have
a retail store and you have a plan to minimize shoplifting, you
can implement a control, such as antitheft tags that trigger an
alarm when someone removes them from the store. You could
also install in the ceilings cameras that provide a different view

644 | 6.1 Defining Managerial Accounting
of customers shopping and therefore may catch a thief more
easily or clearly. The antitheft tags and cameras serve as your
controls against shoplifting.

   Managerial accounting is a useful tool in the management
control function. Managerial accounting helps determine the
appropriate controls for measuring the success of a plan. There
are many types of controls that a company can use. Some
controls can be in the form of financial measures, such as the
ratio for inventory turnover, which is a measure of inventory
control and is defined as Cost of Goods Sold  Average
Inventory, or in the form of a performance measure, such as
decreasing production costs by 10 percent to help guide or
control the decisions made by managers. Other controls can be
physical controls, such as fingerprint identification or password
protection. Essentially, the controlling function in
management involves helping to coordinate the day-to-day
activities of a business so that these activities lead to meeting
corporate goals.

   Without controls, it is very unlikely a plan would be
successful, and it would be difficult to know if your plan was a
success. Consider the plan by Daryn's Dairy to increase market
share. The plan for the first year was to increase market share
by selling the company's products in 10 percent more stores
in the states in which the company already operates. How will
the company implement this plan? The implementation, or
carrying out, of the plan will require the company to put
controls in place to measure which new stores are successfully
selling the company's products, which products are being sold
the most, what the sales volume and dollar value of the new
stores are, and whether the sales in these new stores are
affecting the volume of sales in current stores. Without this
information, the company would not know if the plan is
reaching the desired result of increased market share.

   The control function helps to determine the courses of action
that are taken in the implementation of a plan by helping to

                                           6.1 Defining Managerial Accounting | 645
define and administer the steps of the plan. Essentially, the
control function facilitates coordination of the plan within the
organization. It is through the system of controls that the
actual results of decisions made in implementing a plan can
be identified and measured. Managerial accounting not only
helps to determine and design control measures, it also assists
by providing performance reports and control reports that
focus on variances between the planned objective
performance and the actual performance. Control is achieved
through effective feedback, or information that is used to
assess a process. Feedback allows management to evaluate
the results, determine whether progress is being made, or
determine whether corrective measures need to be taken. This
evaluation is in the next management function.

Evaluating

Managers must ultimately determine whether the company
has met the goals set in the planning phase. Evaluating, also
called assessing or analyzing, involves comparing actual
results against expected results, and it can occur at the
product, department, division, and company levels. When
there are deviations from the stated objectives, managers
must decide what modifications are needed.

   The controls that were put into place to coordinate the
implementation of a particular company plan must be
evaluated so that success can be measured, or corrective
action can be taken. Consider Daryn's Dairy's one-year plan to
increase market share by selling products in 10 percent more
stores in the states in which the company currently operates.
Suppose one of the controls put into place is to measure the
sales in the current stores to determine if selling the company's
products in new stores is adding new sales or merely moving
sales from existing stores. This control measure, same-store

646 | 6.1 Defining Managerial Accounting
sales, must be evaluated to determine the effect of the decision
to expand the selling of products within the state. This control
measure will be evaluated by comparing sales in the current
year in those stores to sales from the prior year in those same
stores. The results of this evaluation will help guide
management in their decision to move forward with their plan,
to modify the plan, or to scrap the plan.

   As discussed previously, not all evaluations will involve
quantitative or financial measures. In expanding market share,
the company wants to maintain or improve its reputation with
customers and does not want the planned increased
availability or easier access to their products to decrease
customer perceptions of the products or the company. They
could use customer surveys to evaluate the perceived effect on
the company's reputation as a result of implementing this one-
year plan. However, there are many ways that companies can
evaluate various controls. In addition to the financial gauges,
organizations are now measuring efficiencies, customer
development, employee retention, and sustainability.

   Managers spend their time in various stages of planning,
controlling, and evaluating. Generally, higher-level managers
spend more time on planning, whereas lower-level managers
spend more time on evaluating. At any level, managers work
closely with the managerial accounting team to help in each of
these stages. Managerial accountants help determine whether
plans are measurable, what controls should be implemented to
carry out a plan, and what are the proper means of evaluation
of those controls. This would include the type of feedback
necessary for management to assess the results of their plans
and actions. Management accountants generate the reports
and information needed to assess the results of the various
evaluations, and they help interpret the results.

   To put this in context, think about how you will spend your
weekend. First, you are the manager of your own time. You
must plan based on your workload and on how much time

                                           6.1 Defining Managerial Accounting | 647
you will spend studying, exercising, sleeping, and meeting with
friends. You then control how your plan is implemented by
setting self-imposed or possibly group meeting-imposed
deadlines, and last, you evaluate how well you carried out your
plan by gathering more data--such as grades on assignments,
personal fulfillment, and number of hours of sleep--to
determine if you met your plans (goals). Not planning,
controlling, and evaluating often results in less-than-desirable
outcomes, such as late assignments, too little sleep, or bad
grades. In this scenario, you did not need a separate
managerial accountant to help you with these functions,
because you could manage planning, controlling, and
evaluating on your own. However, in the business world, most
businesses will have both managers and managerial
accountants. Table 6.3 illustrates some examples.

Evaluating On-Campus versus Off-Campus
Living

The principal purpose of managerial accounting is to deliver
information useful for management decision-making. Many of
the techniques used in managerial accounting are useful for
decisions in your everyday life. In choosing whether to live on
campus or off campus, how might you use planning,
controlling, and evaluating in your decision-making process?
What types of financial and nonfinancial information might
you need?

6.2 Roles & Duties of
Managerial
Accountants

It is clear that management accountants must have a solid
foundation in accounting, in both financial and managerial
accounting, but other than accounting skills, what makes good
managerial accountants?

   They must have knowledge of the business in which they
      are working. Commercial awareness is knowing how a
      business is run and how it is influenced by the external
      environment and knowing and understanding the overall
      industry within which the business is operating.

   Collaboration, which involves working in cross-functional
      teams and earning the trust and respect of colleagues in
      order to complete a task, is vital to improving managerial
      accounting talents. They should be "team players."

   Management accountants should have effective
      communication skills that allow them to convey
      accounting information in both written and oral forms in a
      way that the intended audience can understand. Being
      able to gather the data quickly and accurately is
      important, but the data is meaningless if it is not
      presented in an intuitive style that the audience can
      understand.

   Strong technology skills are also essential. These skills
      include not only accounting and reporting software but
      also other programs that would assist in automating
      processes, improving efficiencies, and adding value to the
      company. For many companies, additional software and

652 | 6.2 Roles & Duties of Managerial Accountants
      accompanying technology are often needed for both their
      financial and managerial accounting functions. For
      example, enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems
      often play a major role in the creation of comprehensive
      accounting systems. This additional support is often
      provided by outside suppliers such
      as Hyperion, Cognos, Sage, SAP, PeopleSoft, and Oracle.
   Managerial accountants must possess extensive analytical
      skills. They must regularly work with financial analysts and
      management personnel to find ways to reduce expenses
      and analyze budgets. These skills include the ability to
      envision, verbalize, conceptualize, or solve both
      multifaceted and simplistic problems by making choices
      that make sense with the given information.
   Managerial accountants must have ethics and values.
      They should be an example to others and encourage them
      to follow internal control practices and procedures.

Managers at all levels make many different types of decisions
every day, but to make most decisions, they need specific
information. Some information is easily obtainable, and some is
not. Managers do not always know what information they need
or what is available, and they need to know if the decisions they
make are having the desired outcome and meeting specific
goals.

   To this point, we've described managerial accounting as a
process. The following definition considers it a profession.
Management accountants are the individuals who help
management with this information. The Institute of
Management Accountants (IMA) defines management
accounting as "a profession that involves partnering in
management decision making, devising planning and
performance management systems, and providing expertise in
financial reporting and control to assist management in the

                             6.2 Roles & Duties of Managerial Accountants | 653
formulation and implementation of an organization's
strategy."4

   The IMA also reports that nearly 75 percent of financial
professionals work in business as management accountants
in positions such as financial analysts, accounting managers,
controllers, and chief financial officers.5 These professionals
have a significant impact on businesses through influencing
the decision-making process and business strategy.

   Management accountants work at various levels of the
organization, from the project level to the division level to the
controller and chief financial officer. Often, management
accountants work where they are needed and not necessarily
at corporate headquarters. They tend to be hands-on in the
decision-making process. They need many types of
information to inform the many decisions they must make.

Organizational Structure

Most companies have an organizational chart that displays the
configuration and the delegation of authority in the decision-
making processes (Figure 6.2). The structure helps define roles
and responsibilities. The organizational charts provide
guidance to employees and other stakeholders by outlining
the official reporting affiliations that direct the workflow within
the organization. If the company is particularly efficient, it also
will include contact information within the chart. This is a
convenient directory to circulate among employees. It helps

                             6.2 Roles & Duties of Managerial Accountants | 655
them find a particular person in a certain position, or
determine whom to speak to about certain areas within the
company, or even identify a specific person's supervisor to
report positive or negative work behavior.

Figure 6.2 Sample Organizational Chart By: Rice University Source:
Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long Description

Stockholders of a company are the owners; however, they
elect a board of directors to manage that company for them.
The board selects the officers who will implement the policies
and strategic goals that the board has set in place. The chief
executive officer (CEO) is the corporation officer who has the
overall responsibility for the management of the company.
The person overseeing all of the accounting and finance
concerns is the chief financial officer (CFO). This individual is in
charge of the financial planning and record-keeping of the
organization and reports to the CEO. The controller is
responsible for the accounting side of the business
656 | 6.2 Roles & Duties of Managerial Accountants
(accounting records, financial statements, tax returns, and
internal reports) and reports to the CFO. Also reporting to the
CFO is the treasurer, who is in control of the finance side of the
business (cash position, corporation funds). An additional area
that sometimes falls under the control of the CFO is the
internal audit staff. Internal auditors supply independent
assurance that a company's internal control processes are
effective. However, there is strong support for keeping the
internal audit staff outside of the CFO, because of a possible
conflict of interest.

Careers

The field of managerial accounting, or corporate accounting,
is composed of the financial and accounting responsibilities
required to operate any type of business. Managerial
accountants are employed within organizations to monitor
costs, sales, budgets, and spending; conduct audits; predict
future requirements; and aid the executive leaders of the
organization with financial decision-making.

   Figure 6.3 lists approximate salaries for several financial and
managerial accounting employment positions. In reviewing
the salary information, be aware that there are often major
variances in salaries based on geographical locations. For
example, a cost accountant manager in San Francisco,
California, would typically be paid significantly more than an
accountant in a similar position in Fayetteville, Arkansas.
However, the cost of living, especially housing costs, in San
Francisco is also significantly higher than the cost of living in
Fayetteville.

Managerial accountants find employment opportunities in a
wide variety of settings and industries. Professionals in this
discipline are in high demand from public and private
companies, government agencies, and not-for-profit entities
(NFPs). Some areas of management accounting are versatile to
any sector (corporate, government, or NFP).

   A financial analyst assists in preparing budgets, tracking
      actual costs, examining task performance, scrutinizing
      different types of variances, and supporting other
      management personnel in organizing forecasts and
      projections.

   A budget analyst arranges and manages the master
      budget and compares master budget projections to
      actual results. This individual must be vastly aware of all
      operations in the budget and work closely with the rest of
      the accounting staff as well as management personnel.

658 | 6.2 Roles & Duties of Managerial Accountants
   An internal auditor typically reports to high-level
      executives within the company. An internal auditor is often
      called on to investigate budget variances, industrial
      sabotage, poor work quality, fraud, and theft. He or she
      also safeguards the internal controls and confirms they
      are working and effective.

   A cash-management accountant has responsibilities that
      include transferring monies between accounts,
      monitoring deposits and payments, reconciling cash
      balances, creating and tracking cash forecasts, and
      performing all other cash-related financial processes.

Other areas of managerial accounting are specific to the sector
in which accountants work. For example, the area of cost
accounting is more specific to the corporate or manufacturing
sector. These cost accountants amass large sums of data,
checking for accuracy and then formulating the cost of raw
materials, work in process, finished goods, labor, overhead, and
other associated manufacturing costs.

   Governmental entities also use accounting to communicate
with their constituents. Government agencies include all levels
of government, federal, state, county, and city, including
military, law enforcement, airports, and school systems.
Government accountants deal with budgets, auditing, and
payroll, the same as all other managerial accountants.
However, they must follow a different set of accounting rules
called the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB).

   Nonprofit (not-for-profit) organizations are tax-exempt
organizations that serve their communities in a variety of areas,
such as religion, education, social services, health care, and
the arts. Managerial accountants in this area are most often
focused on budgets. The biggest difference between a
corporate budget analyst and a nonprofit budget analyst is
that the nonprofit analyst works the budget backward,
compared to the corporate analyst. For example, if a

                             6.2 Roles & Duties of Managerial Accountants | 659
corporation was selling widgets, its budget would start with
a sales forecast of how many widgets the company thinks it
can sell. This gives the company a forecast of how much it
can spend on expenses and fixed assets. The nonprofit budget
analysts often start with the expenses. They forecast how much
the expenses will be in order to continue to offer their service to
the community. From there, they then adjust how much they
will need to obtain through fundraising, donations, grants, or
other sources to meet their expenses.

YOUR TURN

Career Planning

All companies need to plan ahead in order to continuously
move forward. Their top management must take into
consideration where they want the company to be in the next
three to five years. Just like a company, you also need to
consider where you want to be in three to five years, and you
need to start taking strides now to accomplish what it is you
need to in order to get there (Figure 6.4).

Answer the following:

 1. What job would you like to be doing in three to five years?
      What is your plan for getting there? Identify five to ten
      steps needed.

2. Do you have a specific company you would like to be
      working for in the next three to five years? What are the
      reasons you want to work for them?

 3. In order to acquire the position you want, at the company
      you want, you need a rsum. Your rsum is like the
      company report of "you." It needs to offer reliable
      information about your experiences and achievements.
      What are the basic elements of a rsum, and how will
      you provide reassurance that the information on your
      rsum is trustworthy?

Solution
   Answers will vary. Sample answer:

                             6.2 Roles & Duties of Managerial Accountants | 661
 1. I would like to own my own home remodeling company.
      Steps to get there include the following:
      A. complete double major in business and building
            construction
      B. in the summers before graduation, work for a local
            handyman franchise
      C. after graduation, work for a home builder as a project
            manager
      D. while working, save money for five years to be used to
            start my own company
      E. put together a business plan
      F. start my own business six years after graduation

2. I would like to work for a national home builder such
      as Pulte or Toll Brothers. Ideally, I would have an
      internship with one of them during college. I would like to
      work for a national builder or a large regional builder
      because they already have a good business model and I
      could learn how that works.

 3. My rsum needs to contain my education information
      such as the degree and my majors as well as classes that
      are pertinent to my career. It should also indicate all of my
      work experience and any particular skills or certifications I
      have achieved, such as Eagle Scout. An example of how
      this information may be presented on a rsum can be
      seen in Figure 6.5.

Certifications

There are many distinct accounting certifications that
accountants can earn in order to improve their careers, attain

                             6.2 Roles & Duties of Managerial Accountants | 663
promotions, and acquire raises in their pay. The certifications
are somewhat different from each other and focused toward
different career paths. Many accountants have more than one
of these credentials to diversify their paths.

   The Certified Public Accountant (CPA) is considered the top
tier in accounting certifications. Many companies or positions
require CPA certification. For example, most employees at
accounting firms earn a CPA certificate within the first few
of years of graduation. Some positions, such as controller or
CFO, often require CPA certification. In the United States, each
state has different educational and experience requirements
in order to obtain the CPA. The certification requires passing
the four-part CPA exam as well. This is administered by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).
There are four parts to the exam: Financial Accounting and
Reporting (FAR), Auditing and Attestation (AUD), Regulation
(REG), and Business Environment and Concepts (BEC). Each
part is graded on a 100-point scale. A score of seventy-five or
greater must be achieved in order to pass each section. The
exams can be intimidating, as it is a difficult process to go
through. As of 2017, the AICPA reported a pass rate of less than
50 percent, which may contribute to its high regard around the
world. After passing the CPA exam, candidates must work for
one year under the supervision of a licensed CPA before their
own license is approved by a state regulatory agency. Those
certified in public accounting work in all areas of accounting.
However, do not assume that being a CPA is the only way to
secure an excellent position in accounting.

   The Certified Management Accountant (CMA) is another
top-tiered certification for accountants. The CMA title identifies
the individual as a specialist in corporate accounting
management. The CMA has some overlap with the CPA, but
the CPA is focused more on compliance, tax, and controls.
CMAs favor financial analytics, budgeting, and strategic
assessment. This certification requires the minimum of a

664 | 6.2 Roles & Duties of Managerial Accountants
bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university, two
years of work experience, and successfully passing both parts
of the exam. Part one of the exam covers financial reporting,
planning, performance, and controls. Part two focuses on
financial decision-making. The exam is administered by the
IMA and has a 50 percent passing rate globally.

   Not as popular in the United States as the CPA, the Certified
Financial Analyst (CFA) certification is more in demand
throughout Europe and Asia. This certification prepares
accountants for a career in the finance and investment
domains. Requirements of this credential include a bachelor's
degree or four years' worth of experience, plus passing all three
sections of the exam. The exam is administered by the CFA
Institute. There are three separate exams, each one taking up
to six hours to complete. The exams must be completed in
succession. This credential is considered one of the more
rigorous ones to obtain, with a passing rate of less than 45
percent.

   The Enrolled Agent (EA) credential focuses on a career in
taxation, whether it is working in tax preparation for the public,
internally for a corporation, or for the government at the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The EA certification was created
by the IRS to signify significant knowledge of the US tax code
and the ability to apply the concepts of that code. Enrolled
agents have the privilege of being able to sign tax returns
as paid preparers, and they are able to represent their clients
in front of the IRS. The EA certification can be obtained by
passing a three-part exam covering all types of individual and
business tax returns. Once the certification is obtained,
enrolled agents must follow strict ethical standards and
complete 72 hours of continuing education courses every three
years.

   The Certified Internal Auditor (CIA) is a credential offered by
the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) and is one of the only
certifications that is accepted worldwide. CIAs tend to be

                             6.2 Roles & Duties of Managerial Accountants | 665
employed in auditing areas within government agencies,
banking, finance, or corporations. They examine financial
documents to investigate deficiencies in internal controls.
Requirements for this certification include a bachelor's degree,
two years of work experience in a related field, and passing the
three sections of the examination. Also required are providing
character references, following a code of ethics, and continuing
education.

   The Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE) certification signifies
proven proficiency in fraud prevention, detection, and
deterrence. CFEs are instructed in how to identify the red flags
that may indicate fraudulent actions. The designation is
awarded by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners
(ACFE) after applicants have met the following requirements:
bachelor's degree, two years of work-related experience, moral
character references, and the passing of four separate exams.

   The Certified Government Auditing Professional
(CGAP) designation is exclusively for auditors employed
throughout the public sector (federal, state, local) and is offered
by the IIA. Requirements for this credential are the same as
for the CIA. The exam has 115 multiple-choice questions and
covers four areas focusing on proficiency in generally accepted
government auditing standards (GAGAS).

   These certifications lead to different job responsibilities and
different career paths. As indicated, each of the certifications
requires varying degrees of education and has exams that are
unique to that particular certification. All of these certifications
also require a certain number of hours of continuing education
in order to keep the certification active. This ensures that the
certificate holder is up to date on changes in the field. There
are always many opportunities throughout the year to obtain
continuing education credits through seminars, webinars,
symposiums, and online and in-person classes.

6.3 Merchandising,
Manufacturing &
Service Organizations

Most businesses can be classified into one or more of these
three categories: manufacturing, merchandising, or service.
Stated in broad terms, manufacturing firms typically produce a
product that is then sold to a merchandising entity (a retailer)
For example, Proctor and Gamble produces a variety of
shampoos that it sells to retailers, such as Walmart, Target,
or Walgreens. A service entity provides a service such as
accounting or legal services or cable television and internet
connections.

   Some companies combine aspects of two or all three of these
categories within a single business. If it chooses, the same
company can both produce and market its products directly
to consumers. For example, Nike produces products that it
directly sells to consumers and products that it sells to retailers.
An example of a company that fits all three categories is Apple,
which produces phones, sells them directly to consumers, and
also provides services, such as extended warranties.

   Regardless of whether a business is a manufacturer of
products, a retailer selling to the customer, a service provider,
or some combination , all businesses set goals and have
strategic plans that guide their operations. Strategic plans look
very different from one company to another. For example, a
retailer such as Walmart may have a strategic plan that focuses
on increasing same store sales. Facebook's strategic plan may
focus on increasing subscribers and attracting new advertisers.
An accounting firm may have long-term goals to open offices
in neighboring cities in order to serve more clients. Although

        6.3 Merchandising, Manufacturing & Service Organizations | 669
the goals differ, the process all companies use to achieve their
goals is the same. First, they must develop a plan for how they
will achieve the goal, and then management will gather,
analyze, and use information regarding costs to make
decisions, implement plans, and achieve goals.

   Table 6.5 lists examples of these costs. Some of these are
similar across different types of businesses; others are unique

Merchandising Organizations

A merchandising firm is one of the most common types of

businesses. A merchandising firm is a business that purchases

finished products and resells them to consumers. Consider

your local grocery store or retail clothing store. Both of these

are merchandising firms. Often, merchandising firms are

referred to as resellers or retailers since they are in the business

of reselling a product to the consumer at a profit.

Think about purchasing toothpaste from your local drug

store. The drug store purchases tens of thousands of tubes

of toothpaste from a wholesale distributor or manufacturer in

order to get a better per-tube cost. Then, they add their mark-

up (or profit margin) to the toothpaste and offer it for sale

to you. The drug store did not manufacture the toothpaste;

instead, they are reselling a toothpaste that they purchased.

Virtually all of your daily purchases are made from

merchandising  firms                                  such

as Walmart, Target, Macy's, Walgreens, and AutoZone.

Merchandising firms account for their costs in a different

way from other types of business organizations. To understand

merchandising costs, Figure 6.6 shows a simplified income

statement for a merchandising firm:

6.3 Merchandising, Manufacturing & Service Organizations | 671

          Merchandising Firm By: Rice University Source:
          Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

This simplified income statement demonstrates how
merchandising firms account for their sales cycle or
process. Sales revenue is the income generated from the sale
of finished goods to consumers rather than from the
manufacture of goods or provision of services. Since a
merchandising firm has to purchase goods for resale, they
account for this cost as cost of goods sold--what it cost them
to acquire the goods that are then sold to the customer. The
difference between what the drug store paid for the toothpaste
and the revenue generated by selling the toothpaste to
consumers is their gross profit. However, in order to generate
sales revenue, merchandising firms incur expenses related to
the process of operating their business and selling the
merchandise. These costs are called operating expenses, and
the business must deduct them from the gross profit to
determine the operating profit. (Note that while the terms
"operating profit" and "operating income" are often used
interchangeably, in real-world interactions you should confirm
exactly what the user means in using those terms.) Operating

672 | 6.3 Merchandising, Manufacturing & Service Organizations
expenses incurred by a merchandising firm include insurance,
marketing, administrative salaries, and rent.

Balancing Revenue and Expenses

Plum Crazy is a small boutique selling the latest in fashion
trends. They purchase clothing and fashion accessories from
several distributors and manufacturers for resale. In 2017, they
reported these revenue and expenses:

         6.3 Merchandising, Manufacturing & Service Organizations | 673
Figure 6.8 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

   Before examining the income statement, let's look at Cost
of Goods Sold in more detail. Merchandising companies have
to account for inventory, a topic covered in Inventory. As you
recall, merchandising companies carry inventory from one
period to another. When they prepare their income statement,
a crucial step is identifying the actual cost of goods that were
sold for the period. For Plum Crazy, their Cost of Goods Sold was
calculated as shown in Figure 6.9.

Figure 6.9 Plum Crazy's Cost of Goods Sold Statement By: Rice
University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Once the calculation of the Cost of Goods Sold has been
completed, Plum Crazy can now construct their income
statement, which would appear as shown in Figure 6.10.

674 | 6.3 Merchandising, Manufacturing & Service Organizations
Since merchandising firms must pass the cost of goods on to
the consumer to earn a profit, they are extremely cost sensitive.
Large merchandising businesses like Walmart, Target,
and Best Buy manage costs by buying in bulk and negotiating
with manufacturers and suppliers to drive the per-unit cost.

Manufacturing Organizations

A manufacturing organization is a business that uses parts,
components, or raw materials to produce finished goods
(Figure 6.11). These finished goods are sold either directly to
the consumer or to other manufacturing firms that use them
as a component part to produce a finished product. For
example, Diehard manufactures automobile batteries that are
sold directly to consumers by retail outlets such as
AutoZone, Costco, and Advance Auto. However, these batteries
are also sold to automobile manufacturers such
as Ford, Chevrolet, or Toyota to be installed in cars during the
manufacturing process. Regardless of who the final consumer
of the final product is, Diehard must control its costs so that

         6.3 Merchandising, Manufacturing & Service Organizations | 675
the sale of batteries generates revenue sufficient to keep the
organization profitable.

         6.3 Merchandising, Manufacturing & Service Organizations | 677
Manufacturing firms are more complex organizations than
merchandising firms and therefore have a larger variety of
costs to control. For example, a merchandising firm may
purchase furniture to sell to consumers, whereas a
manufacturing firm must acquire raw materials such as
lumber, paint, hardware, glue, and varnish that they transform
into furniture. The manufacturer incurs additional costs, such
as direct labor, to convert the raw materials into furniture.
Operating a physical plant where the production process takes
place also generates costs. Some of these costs are tied directly
to production, while others are general expenses necessary to
operate the business. Because the manufacturing process can
be highly complex, manufacturing firms constantly evaluate
their production processes to determine where cost savings
are possible.

Cost Control

Controlling costs is an integral function of all managers, but
companies often hire personnel to specifically oversee cost
control. As you've learned, controlling costs is vital in all
industries, but at Hilton Hotels, they translate this into the
position of Cost Controller. Here is an excerpt from one of
Hilton's recent job postings.

   Position Title: Cost Controller
   Job Description: "A Cost Controller will work with all Heads of
Departments to effectively control all products that enter and
exit the hotel."6
   Job Requirements:
   "As Cost Controller, you will work with all Heads of

678 | 6.3 Merchandising, Manufacturing & Service Organizations
Departments to effectively control all products that enter and
exit the hotel. Specifically, you will be responsible for
performing the following tasks to the highest standards:

   Review the daily intake of products into the hotel and
      ensure accurate pricing and quantity of goods received

   Control the stores by ensuring accuracy of inventory and
      stock control and the pricing of goods received

   Alert relevant parties of slow-moving goods and goods
      nearing expiry dates to reduce waste and alter product
      purchasing to accommodate

   Manage cost reporting on a weekly basis
   Attend finance meetings, as required
   Maintain good communication and working relationships

      with all hotel areas
   Act in accordance with fire, health and safety regulations

      and follow the correct procedures when required"7

As you can see, the individual in this position will interact with
others across the organization to find ways to control costs
for the benefit of the company. Some of the benefits of cost
control include:

   Lowering overall company expenses, thereby increasing
      net income.

   Freeing up financial resources for investment in research
      & development of new or improved products, goods, or
      services

   Providing funding for employee development and
      training, benefits, and bonuses

   Allowing corporate earnings to be used to support
      humanitarian and charitable causes

   Manufacturing organizations account for costs in a way that

        6.3 Merchandising, Manufacturing & Service Organizations | 679
is similar to that of merchandising firms. However, as you will
learn, there is a significant difference in the calculation of cost
of goods sold. Figure 6.12 shows a simplification of the income
statement for a manufacturing firm:

          Figure 6.12 Simplified Income Statement for a
          Manufacturing Firm By: Rice University Source:
          Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

At first it appears that there is no difference between the
income statements of the merchandising firm and the
manufacturing firm. However, the difference is in how these
two types of firms account for the cost of goods sold.
Merchandising firms determine their cost of goods sold by
accounting for both existing inventory and new purchases, as
shown in the Plum Crazy example. It is typically easy for
merchandising firms to calculate their costs because they
know exactly what they paid for their merchandise.

   Unlike merchandising firms, manufacturing firms must
calculate their cost of goods sold based on how much they
manufacture and how much it costs them to manufacture
those goods. This requires manufacturing firms to prepare an
additional statement before they can prepare their income
statement. This additional statement is the Cost of Goods

680 | 6.3 Merchandising, Manufacturing & Service Organizations
Manufactured statement. Once the cost of goods
manufactured is calculated, the cost is then incorporated into
the manufacturing firm's income statement to calculate its
cost of goods sold.

   One thing manufacturing firms must consider in their cost
of goods manufactured is that, at any given time, they have
products at varying levels of production: some are finished and
others are still process. The cost of goods manufactured
statement measures the cost of the goods actually finished
during the period, whether or not they were started during
that period.

   Before examining the typical manufacturing firm's process
to track cost of goods manufactured, you need basic
definitions of three terms in the schedule of Costs of Goods
Manufactured: direct materials, direct labor, and
manufacturing overhead. Direct materials are the components
used in the production process whose costs can be identified
on a per item-produced basis. For example, if you are
producing cars, the engine would be a direct material item.
The direct material cost would be the cost of one engine. Direct
labor represents production labor costs that can be identified
on a per item-produced basis. Referring to the car production
example, assume that the engines are placed in the car by
individuals rather than by an automated process. The direct
labor cost would be the amount of labor in hours multiplied
by the hourly labor cost. Manufacturing overhead generally
includes those costs incurred in the production process that
are not economically feasible to measure as direct material
or direct labor costs. Examples include the department
manager's salary, the production factory's utilities, or glue used
to attach rubber molding in the auto production process. Since
there are so many possible costs that can be classified as
manufacturing overhead, they tend to be grouped and then
allocated in a predetermined manner to the production
process.

         6.3 Merchandising, Manufacturing & Service Organizations | 681
   Figure 6.13 is an example of the calculation of the Cost of
Goods Manufactured for Koeller Manufacturing. It
demonstrates the relationship between cost of goods
manufactured and cost of goods in progress and includes the
three main types of manufacturing costs.

Figure 6.13 Koeller Manufacturing's Cost of Goods Manufactured By:
Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long Description

As you can see, the manufacturing firm takes into account its
work-in-process (WIP) inventory as well as the costs incurred
during the current period to finish not only the units that were
in the beginning WIP inventory, but also a portion of any
production that was started but not finished during the
month. Notice that the current manufacturing costs, or the
additional costs incurred during the month, include direct
materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. Direct
materials are calculated as

682 | 6.3 Merchandising, Manufacturing & Service Organizations
Figure 6.14 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

All of these costs are carefully tracked and classified because
the cost of manufacturing is a vital component of the schedule
of cost of goods sold. To continue with the example, Koeller
Manufacturing calculated that the cost of goods sold was
$95,000, which is carried through to the Schedule of Cost of
Goods Sold (Figure 6.15).

Figure 6.15 Koeller Manufacturing's Cost of Goods Sold By: Rice

statement, the simplified statement will appear as shown

So, even though the income statements for the merchandising
firm and the manufacturing firm appear very similar at first
glance, there are many more costs to be captured by the
manufacturing firm. Figure 6.17 compares and contrasts the
methods merchandising and manufacturing firms use to
calculate the cost of goods sold in their income statement.

Service Organizations

A service organization is a business that earns revenue by
providing intangible products, those that have no physical
substance. The service industry is a vital sector of the U.S.
economy, providing 65% of the U.S. private-sector gross
domestic product and more than 79% of U.S. private-sector
jobs.8 If tangible products, physical goods that customers can
handle and see, are provided by a service organization, they
are considered ancillary sources of revenue. Large service
organizations such as airlines, insurance companies, and
hospitals incur a variety of costs in the provision of their
services. Costs such as labor, supplies, equipment, advertising,

686 | 6.3 Merchandising, Manufacturing & Service Organizations
and facility maintenance can quickly spiral out of control if
management is not careful. Therefore, although their cost
drivers are sometimes not as complex as those of other types of
firms, cost identification and control are every bit as important
in the service industry.

   For example, consider the services that a law firm provides its
clients. What clients pay for are services such as representation
in legal proceedings, contract negotiations, and preparation of
wills. Although the true value of these services is not contained
in their physical form, they are of value to the client and the
source of revenue to the firm. The managing partners in the
firm must be as cost conscious as their counterparts in
merchandising and manufacturing firms. Accounting for costs
in service firms differs from merchandising and manufacturing
firms in that they do not purchase or produce goods. For
example, consider a medical practice. Although some services
provided are tangible products, such as medications or
medical devices, the primary benefits the physicians provide
their patients are the intangible services that are comprised of
his or her knowledge, experience, and expertise.

   Service providers have some costs (or revenue) derived from
tangible goods that must be taken into account when pricing
their services, but their largest cost categories are more likely
to be administrative and personnel costs rather than product
costs.

For example, Whichard & Klein, LLP, is a full-service accounting
firm with their primary offices in Baltimore, Maryland. With two
senior partners and a small staff of accountants and payroll
specialists, the majority of the costs they incur are related to
personnel. The value of the accounting and payroll services
they provide to their clients is intangible in comparison to
goods sold by a merchandiser or produced by a manufacturer
but has value and is the primary source of revenue for the firm.
At the end of 2019, Whichard and Klein reported the following
revenue and expenses:

transactions, and personal injury. The firm employs several

equipment and materials such computer networks, phone and
switchboard equipment, rent, insurance, and law library
materials necessary to support the practice, but these costs
represent a much smaller percentage of total cost than the
administrative and personnel costs.

6.4 Cost Behavior

Now that we have identified the three key types of businesses,
let's identify cost behaviors and apply them to the business
environment. In managerial accounting, different companies
use the term cost in different ways depending on how they will
use the cost information. Different decisions require different
costs classified in different ways. For instance, a manager may
need cost information to plan for the coming year or to make
decisions about expanding or discontinuing a product or
service. In practice, the classification of costs changes as the
use of the cost data changes. In fact, a single cost, such as rent,
may be classified by one company as a fixed cost, by another
company as a committed cost, and by even another company
as a period cost. Understanding different cost classifications
and how certain costs can be used in different ways is critical to
managerial accounting.

Any discussion of costs begins with the understanding that
most costs will be classified in one of three ways: fixed costs,
variable costs, or mixed costs. The costs that don't fall into one
of these three categories are hybrid costs, which are examined
only briefly because they are addressed in more advanced
accounting courses. Because fixed and variable costs are the
foundation of all other cost classifications, understanding
whether a cost is a fixed cost or a variable cost is very
important.

Fixed versus Variable Costs

A fixed cost is an unavoidable operating expense that does not
change in total over the short term, even if a business

                                                                       6.4 Cost Behavior | 693
experiences variation in its level of activity. Table 6.6 illustrates
the types of fixed costs for merchandising, service, and
manufacturing organizations.

Table 6.6 Examples of Fixed Costs By: Rice University Openstax CC

Type of   Fixed Cost
Business

Merchandising Rent, insurance, managers' salaries

Manufacturing Property taxes, insurance, equipment leases

Service   Rent, straight-line depreciation, administrative
          salaries, and insurance

We have established that fixed costs do not change in total
as the level of activity changes, but what about fixed costs
on a per-unit basis? Let's examine Tony's screen-printing
company to illustrate how costs can remain fixed in total but
change on a per-unit basis.

   Tony operates a screen-printing company, specializing in
custom T-shirts. One of his fixed costs is his monthly rent of
$1,000. Regardless of whether he produces and sells any T-
shirts, he is obligated under his lease to pay $1,000 per month.
However, he can consider this fixed cost on a per-unit basis, as
shown in Figure 6.25.

Figure 6.25 Individual Rent Cost per T-Shirt Produced By: Rice
University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

694 | 6.4 Cost Behavior
Tony's information illustrates that, despite the unchanging
fixed cost of rent, as the level of activity increases, the per-unit
fixed cost falls. In other words, fixed costs remain fixed in total
but can increase or decrease on a per-unit basis.

   Two specialized types of fixed costs are committed fixed
costs and discretionary fixed costs. These classifications are
generally used for long-range planning purposes and are
covered in upper-level managerial accounting courses, so they
are only briefly described here.

   Committed fixed costs are fixed costs that typically cannot
be eliminated if the company is going to continue to function.
An example would be the lease of factory equipment for a
production company.

   Discretionary fixed costs generally are fixed costs that can
be incurred during some periods and postponed during other
periods but which cannot normally be eliminated
permanently. Examples could include advertising campaigns
and employee training. Both of these costs could potentially be
postponed temporarily, but the company would probably incur
negative effects if the costs were permanently eliminated.
These classifications are generally used for long-range
planning purposes.

   In addition to understanding fixed costs, it is critical to
understand variable costs, the second fundamental cost
classification. A variable cost is one that varies in direct
proportion to the level of activity within the business. Typical
costs that are classified as variable costs are the cost of raw
materials used to produce a product, labor applied directly to
the production of the product, and overhead expenses that
change based upon activity. For each variable cost, there is
some activity that drives the variable cost up or down. A cost
driver is defined as any activity that causes the organization to
incur a variable cost. Examples of cost drivers are direct labor
hours, machine hours, units produced, and units sold. Table

                                                                       6.4 Cost Behavior | 695
6.7 provides examples of variable costs and their associated
cost drivers.

   Table 6.7 Variable Costs and Associated Cost Drivers By: Rice
                    University Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

-        Variable Cost              Cost Driver

Merchandising Total monthly hourly wages Hours business is for sales staff open during month

Manufacturing Direct materials used to Number of units produce one unit of product produced

Service  Cost of laundering linens  Number of hotel
         and towels                 rooms occupied

Unlike fixed costs that remain fixed in total but change on a
per-unit basis, variable costs remain the same per unit, but
change in total relative to the level of activity in the business.
Revisiting Tony's T-Shirts, Figure 6.26 shows how the variable
cost of ink behaves as the level of activity changes.

Figure 6.26 Variable Costs per Unit By: Rice University Source:
Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

As Figure 6.26 shows, the variable cost per unit (per T-shirt)
does not change as the number of T-shirts produced increases
or decreases. However, the variable costs change in total as
the number of units produced increases or decreases. In short,
total variable costs rise and fall as the level of activity (the cost
driver) rises and falls.

696 | 6.4 Cost Behavior
   Distinguishing between fixed and variable costs is critical
because the total cost is the sum of all fixed costs (the total
fixed costs) and all variable costs (the total variable costs). For
every unit produced, every customer served, or every hotel
room rented, for example, managers can determine their total
costs both per unit of activity and in total by combining their
fixed and variable costs together. The graphic in Figure
6.27 illustrates the concept of total costs.

Variable Costs By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Remember that the reason that organizations take the time
and effort to classify costs as either fixed or variable is to be able
to control costs. When they classify costs properly, managers
can use cost data to make decisions and plan for the future of
the business.

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

Boeing9

If you've ever flown on an airplane, there's a good chance you
know Boeing. The Boeing Company generates around $90
billion each year from selling thousands of airplanes to
commercial and military customers around the world. It
employs around 200,000 people, and it's indirectly responsible
for more than a million jobs through its suppliers, contractors,
regulators, and others. Its main assembly line in Everett, WA, is
housed in the largest building in the world, a colossal facility
that covers nearly a half-trillion cubic feet. Boeing is, simply put,
a massive enterprise.

   And yet, Boeing's managers know the exact cost of
everything the company uses to produce its airplanes: every
propeller, flap, seat belt, welder, computer programmer, and
so forth. Moreover, they know how those costs would change
if they produced more airplanes or fewer. They also know the
price at which they sold each plane and the profit the company
made on each sale. Boeing's executives expect their managers
to know this information, in real time, if the company is to
remain profitable.

Average Fixed Costs versus Average
Variable Costs

Another way management may want to consider their costs is
as average costs. Under this approach, managers can calculate
both average fixed and average variable costs. Average fixed
cost (AFC) is the total fixed costs divided by the total number of
units produced, which results in a per-unit cost. The formula is:

Figure 6.28 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

To show how a company would use AFC to make business
decisions, consider Carolina Yachts, a company that
manufactures sportfishing boats that are sold to consumers
through a network of marinas and boat dealerships. Carolina
Yachts produces 625 boats per year, and their total annual fixed
costs are $1,560,000. If they want to determine an average fixed
cost per unit, they will find it using the formula for AFC:

                                                                       6.4 Cost Behavior | 699
When they produce 625 boats, Carolina Yachts has an AFC of
$2,496 per boat. What happens to the AFC if they increase or
decrease the number of boats produced? Figure 6.29 shows
the AFC for different numbers of boats.

Figure 6.29 Average Fixed Costs for Carolina Yachts By: Rice
University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

We see that total fixed costs remain unchanged, but the
average fixed cost per unit goes up and down with the number
of boats produced. As more units are produced, the fixed costs
are spread out over more units, making the fixed cost per unit
fall. Likewise, as fewer boats are manufactured, the average
fixed costs per unit rises. We can use a similar approach with
variable costs.

   Average variable cost (AVC) is the total variable costs divided
by the total number of units produced, which results in a per-
unit cost. Like ATC, we can use this formula:

Figure 6.30 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

To demonstrate AVC, let's return to Carolina Yachts, which
incurs total variable costs of $6,875,000 when they produce 625

700 | 6.4 Cost Behavior
boats per year. They can express this as an average variable cost
per unit:

Because average variable costs are the average of all costs that
change with production levels on a per-unit basis and include
both direct materials and direct labor, managers often use AVC
to determine if production should continue or not in the short
run. As long as the price Carolina Yachts receives for their boats
is greater than the per-unit AVC, they know that they are not
only covering the variable cost of production, but each boat is
making a contribution toward covering fixed costs. If, at any
point, the average variable cost per boat rises to the point that
the price no longer covers the AVC, Carolina Yachts may
consider halting production until the variable costs fall again.

   These changes in variable costs per unit could be caused
by circumstances beyond their control, such as a shortage of
raw materials or an increase in shipping costs due to high
gas prices. In any case, average variable cost can be useful for
managers to get a big picture look at their variable costs per
unit.

   Here's a brief video recap based on Econ 102 (Principles of
Microeconomics)

Mixed Costs and Stepped Costs

Not all costs can be classified as purely fixed or purely
variable. Mixed costs are those that have both a fixed and
variable component. It is important, however, to be able to
separate mixed costs into their fixed and variable components
because, typically, in the short run, we can only change variable
costs but not most fixed costs. To examine how these mixed
costs actually work, consider the Ocean Breeze hotel.

   The Ocean Breeze is located in a resort area where the county
assesses an occupancy tax that has both a fixed and a variable
component. Ocean Breeze pays $2,000 per month, regardless
of the number of rooms rented. Even if it does not rent a single
room during the month, Ocean Breeze still must remit this
tax to the county. The hotel treats this $2,000 as a fixed cost.
However, for every night that a room is rented, Ocean Breeze
must remit an additional tax amount of $5.00 per room per
night. As a result, the occupancy tax is a mixed cost. Figure
6.31 further illustrates how this mixed cost behaves.

Figure 6.31 Mixed Costs Example for Ocean Breeze By: Rice
University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Notice that Ocean Breeze cannot control the fixed portion of
this cost and that it remains fixed in total, regardless of the
activity level. On the other hand, the variable component is
fixed per unit, but changes in total based upon the level of
activity. The fixed portion of this cost plus the variable portion

702 | 6.4 Cost Behavior
of this cost combine to make the total cost. As a result, the
formula for total cost looks like this:

          Figure 6.32 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC
          BY-NC-SA 4.0
where Y is the total mixed cost, a is the fixed cost, b is the
variable cost per unit, and x is the level of activity.
   Graphically, mixed costs can be explained as shown in Figure
6.33.

Figure 6.33 Ocean Breeze's Mixed Cost Graph By: Rice University
Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long Description
The graph shows that mixed costs are typically both fixed and

                                                                       6.4 Cost Behavior | 703
linear in nature. In other words, they will often have an initial
cost, in Ocean Breeze's case, the $2,000 fixed component of
the occupancy tax, and a variable component, the $5 per night
occupancy tax. Note that the Ocean Breeze mixed cost graph
starts at an initial $2,000 for the fixed component and then
increases by $5 for each night their rooms are occupied.

   Some costs behave less linearly. A cost that changes with the
level of activity but is not linear is classified as a stepped cost.
Step costs remain constant at a fixed amount over a range of
activity. The range over which these costs remain unchanged
(fixed) is referred to as the relevant range, which is defined as
a specific activity level that is bounded by a minimum and
maximum amount. Within this relevant range, managers can
predict revenue or cost levels. Then, at certain points, the step
costs increase to a higher amount. Both fixed and variable
costs can take on this stair-step behavior. For instance, wages
often act as a stepped variable cost when employees are paid
a flat salary and a commission or when the company pays
overtime. Further, when additional machinery or equipment is
placed into service, businesses will see their fixed costs stepped
up. The "trigger" for a cost to step up is the relevant range.
Graphically, step costs appear like stair steps (Figure 6.34).

704 | 6.4 Cost Behavior
Figure 6.34 Step Cost Graph By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC
BY-NC-SA 4.0

For example, suppose a quality inspector can inspect a
maximum of 80 units in a regular 8-hour shift and his salary is
a fixed cost. Then the relevant range for QA inspection is from
0-80 units per shift. If demand for these units increases and
more than 80 inspections are needed per shift, the relevant
range has been exceeded and the business will have one of two
choices:

   (1) Pay the quality inspector overtime in order to have the
additional units inspected. This overtime will "step up" the
variable cost per unit. The advantage to handling the increased
cost in this way is that when demand falls, the cost can quickly
be "stepped down" again. Because these types of step costs
can be adjusted quickly and often, they are often still treated as
variable costs for planning purposes.

   (2) "Step up" fixed costs. If the company hires a second
quality inspector, they would be stepping up their fixed costs.

                                                                       6.4 Cost Behavior | 705
In effect, they will double the relevant range to allow for a
maximum of 160 inspections per shift, assuming the second
QA inspector can inspect an additional 80 units per shift. The
down side to this approach is that once the new QA inspector is
hired, if demand falls again, the company will be incurring fixed
costs that are unnecessary. For this reason, adding salaried
personnel to address a short-term increase in demand is not a
decision most businesses make.

   Step costs are best explained in the context of a business
experiencing increases in activity beyond the relevant range. As
an example, let's return to Tony's T-Shirts.

   Tony's cost of operations and the associated relevant ranges
are shown in Table 6.9.

Table 6.9 Tony's T-Shirts Cost Options By: Rice University Openstax

                 per             machines and 2
                 month           employees

As you can see, Tony has both fixed and variable costs
associated with his business. His one screen-printing machine
can only produce 2,000 T-shirts per month and his current
employee can produce 20 shirts per hour (160 per 8-hour work
day). The space that Tony leases is large enough that he could
add an additional screen-printing machine and 1 additional

706 | 6.4 Cost Behavior
employee. If he expands beyond that, he will need to lease a
larger space, and presumably his rent would increase at that
point. It is easy for Tony to predict his costs as long as he
operates within the relevant ranges by applying the total cost
equation Y = a + bx. So, for Tony, as long as he produces 2,000
or fewer T-shirts, his total cost will be found by Y = $6,000 +
$0.75x, where the variable cost of $0.75 is the $0.25 cost of the
ink per shirt and $0.50 per shirt for labor ($10 per hour wage/
20 shirts per hour). As soon as his production passes the 2,000
T-shirts that his one employee and one machine can handle,
he will have to add a second employee and lease a second
screen-printing machine. In other words, his fixed costs will
rise from $6,000 to $8,000, and his variable cost per T-shirt
will rise from $0.75 to $1.25 (ink plus 2 workers). Thus, his new
cost equation is Y = $8,000 + $1.25x until he "steps up" again
and adds a third machine and moves to a new location with a
presumably higher rent. Let's take a look at this in chart form
to better illustrate the "step" in cost Tony will experience as he
steps past 2,000 T-shirts.

   Tony's cost information is shown in the chart for volume
between 500 and 4,000 shirts.

                                                                       6.4 Cost Behavior | 707

When presented graphically, notice what happens when Tony
steps outside of his original relevant range and has to add a
second employee and a second screen-printing machine:

It is important to remember that even though Tony's costs
stepped up when he exceeded his original capacity (relevant
range), the behavior of the costs did not change. His fixed costs
still remained fixed in total and his total variable cost rose as
the number of T-shirts he produced rose. Table
6.10 summarizes how costs behave within their relevant
ranges.

Product versus Period Costs

Many businesses can make decisions by dividing their costs
into fixed and variable costs, but there are some business
decisions that require grouping costs differently. Sometimes
companies need to consider how those costs are reported in
the financial statements. At other times, companies group
costs based on functions within the business. For example, a
business would group administrative and selling expenses by
the period (monthly or quarterly) so that they can be reported
on an Income Statement. However, a manufacturing firm may
carry product costs such as materials from one period to the
other in order to have the costs "travel" with the units being
produced. It is possible that both the selling and administrative
costs and materials costs have both fixed and variable
components. As a result, it may be necessary to analyze some
fixed costs together with some variable costs. Ultimately,
businesses strategically group costs in order to make them
more useful for decision-making and planning. Two of the
broadest and most common grouping of costs are product
costs and period costs.

   Product costs are all those associated with the acquisition
or production of goods and products. When products are
purchased for resale, the cost of goods is recorded as an asset
on the company's balance sheet. It is not until the products are
sold that they become an expense on the income statement.
By moving product costs to the expense account for the cost
of goods sold, they are easily matched to the sales revenue
income account. For example, Bert's Bikes is a bicycle retailer
who purchases bikes from several wholesale distributors and
manufacturers. When Bert purchases bicycles for resale, he
places the cost of the bikes into his inventory account, because
that is what those bikes are--his inventory available for sale.
It is not until someone purchases a bike that it creates sales
revenue, and in order to fulfill the requirements of double-

710 | 6.4 Cost Behavior
entry accounting, he must match that income with an
expense: the cost of goods sold (Figure 6.37).

Figure 6.37 Journal Entry for Cost of Goods Sold Product costs are
collected in the finished goods inventory, where they remain until the
goods are sold By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Some product costs have both a fixed and variable component.
For example, Bert purchases 10 bikes for $100 each. The
distributor charges $10 per bike for shipping for 1 to 10 bikes
but $8 per bike for 11 to 20 bikes. This shipping cost is fixed per
unit but varies in total. If Bert wants to save money and control
his cost of goods sold, he can order an 11th bike and drop his
shipping cost by $2 per bike. It is important for Bert to know
what is fixed and what is variable so that he can control his
costs as much as possible.

   What about the costs Bert incurs that are not product
costs? Period costs are simply all of the expenses that are not
product costs, such as all selling and administrative expenses.
It is important to remember that period costs are treated as
expenses in the period in which they occur. In other words, they
follow the rules of accrual accounting practice by recognizing
the cost (expense) in the period in which they occur regardless
of when the cash changes hands. For example, Bert pays his
business insurance in January of each year. Bert's annual
insurance premium is $10,800, which is $900 per month. Each
month, Bert will recognize 1  12 of this insurance cost as an
expense in the period in which it is incurred (Figure 6.38).

                                                                        6.4 Cost Behavior | 711
Figure 6.38 Journal Entry for Insurance Expense Bert applies 1  12 of
the prepaid insurance premium per month to the expense account in
order to match period costs with period revenues By: Rice University
Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Why is it so important for Bert to know which costs are product
costs and which are period costs? Bert may have little control
over his product costs, but he maintains a great deal of control
over many of his period costs. For this reason, it is important
that Bert be able to identify his period costs and then
determine which of them are fixed and which are variable.
Remember that fixed costs are fixed over the relevant range,
but variable costs change with the level of activity. If Bert wants
to control his costs to make his bike business more profitable,
he must be able to differentiate between the costs he can and
cannot control.

   Just like a merchandising business such as Bert's Bikes,
manufacturers also classify their costs as either product costs
or period costs. For a manufacturing business, product costs
are the costs associated with making the product, and period
costs are all other costs. For the purposes of external reporting,
separating costs into period and product costs is not all that
is necessary. However, for management decision-making
activities, refinement of the types of product costs is helpful.

   In a manufacturing firm, the need for management to be
aware of the types of costs that make up the cost of a product
is of paramount importance. Let's look at Carolina Yachts again
and examine how they can classify the product costs
associated with building their sportfishing boats. Just like
automobiles, every year, Carolina Yachts makes changes to
their boats, introducing new models to their product line.

712 | 6.4 Cost Behavior
When the engineers begin to redesign boats for the next year,
they must be careful not to make changes that would drive
the selling price of their boats too high, making them less
attractive to the customer. The engineers need to know exactly
what the addition of another feature will do to the cost of
production. It is not enough for them to get total product cost
data; instead, they need specific information about the three
classes of product costs: materials, labor, and overhead.

   As you've learned, direct materials are the raw materials and
component parts that are directly economically traceable to a
unit of production.

   Table 6.11 provides some examples of direct materials.

Table 6.11 Examples of Direct Materials By: Rice University Openstax
                                       CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Manufacturing  Product            Direct Materials
Business

Bakery         Birthday           Flour, sugar, eggs, milk
               cakes

Automobile     Cars               Glass, steel, tires, carpet
manufacturer

Furniture manufacturer Recliners  Wood, fabric, cotton
                                  batting

In each of the examples, managers are able to trace the cost
of the materials directly to a specific unit (cake, car, or chair)
produced. Since the amount of direct materials required will
change based on the number of units produced, direct
materials are almost always classified as a variable cost. They
remain fixed per unit of production but change in total based
on the level of activity within the business.

   It takes more than materials for Carolina Yachts to build a
boat. It requires the application of labor to the raw materials
and component parts. You've also learned that direct labor is
the work of the employees who are directly involved in the
production of goods or services. In fact, for many industries,
the largest cost incurred in the production process is labor.

                                  6.4 Cost Behavior | 713
For Carolina Yachts, their direct labor would include the wages
paid to the carpenters, painters, electricians, and welders who
build the boats. Like direct materials, direct labor is typically
treated as a variable cost because it varies with the level of
activity. However, there are some companies that pay a flat
weekly or monthly salary for production workers, and for these
employees, their compensation could be classified as a fixed
cost. For example, many auto mechanics are now paid a flat
weekly or monthly salary.

   While in the example Carolina Yachts is dependent upon
direct labor, the production process for companies in many
industries is moving from human labor to a more automated
production process. For these companies, direct labor in these
industries is becoming less significant. For an example, you can
research the current production process for the automobile
industry.

   The third major classification of product costs for a
manufacturing business is overhead. Manufacturing overhead
(sometimes referred to as factory overhead) includes all of the
costs that a manufacturing business incurs, other than the
variable costs of direct materials and direct labor required to
build products. These overhead costs are not directly
attributable to a specific unit of production, but they are
incurred to support the production of goods. Some of the items
included in manufacturing overhead include supervisor
salaries, depreciation on the factory, maintenance, insurance,
and utilities. It is important to note that manufacturing
overhead does not include any of the selling or administrative
functions of a business. For Carolina Yachts, costs like the sales,
marketing, CEO, and clerical staff salaries will not be included
in the calculation of manufacturing overhead costs but will
instead be allocated to selling and administrative expenses.

   As you have learned, much of the power of managerial
accounting is its ability to break costs down into the smallest
possible trackable unit. This also applies to manufacturing

714 | 6.4 Cost Behavior
overhead. In many cases, businesses have a need to further
refine their overhead costs and will track indirect labor and
indirect materials.

   When labor costs are incurred but are not directly involved
in the active conversion of materials into finished products,
they are classified as indirect labor costs. For example, Carolina
Yachts has production supervisors who oversee the
manufacturing process but do not actively participate in the
construction of the boats. Their wages generally support the
production process but cannot be traced back to a single unit.
For this reason, the production supervisors' salary would be
classified as indirect labor. Similar to direct labor, on a product
or department basis, indirect labor, such as the supervisor's
salary, is often treated as a fixed cost, assuming that it does
not vary with the level of activity or number of units produced.
However, if you are considering the supervisor's salary cost on
a per unit of production basis, then it could be considered a
variable cost.

   Similarly, not all materials used in the production process can
be traced back to a specific unit of production. When this is
the case, they are classified as indirect material costs. Although
needed to produce the product, these indirect material costs
are not traceable to a specific unit of production. For Carolina
Yachts, their indirect materials include supplies like tools, glue,
wax, and cleaning supplies. These materials are required to
build a boat, but management cannot easily track how much
of a bottle of glue they use or how often they use a particular
drill to build a specific boat. These indirect materials and their
associated cost represent a small fraction of the total materials
needed to complete a unit of production. Like direct materials,
indirect materials are classified as a variable cost since they
vary with the level of production. Table 6.12 provides some
examples of manufacturing costs and their classifications.

                                                                        6.4 Cost Behavior | 715

Prime Costs versus Conversion Costs

In certain production environments, once a business has
separated the costs of the product into direct materials, direct
labor, and overhead, the costs can then be gathered into two
broader categories: prime costs and conversion costs. Prime
costs are the direct material expenses and direct labor costs,
while conversion costs are direct labor and general factory
overhead combined. Please note that these two categories of
costs are examples of cost categories where a particular cost
can be included in both. In this case, direct labor is included in
both prime costs and conversion costs.

   These cost classifications are common in businesses that
produce large quantities of an item that is then packaged into
smaller, sellable quantities such as soft drinks or cereal. In these
types of production environments, it easier to lump the costs of
direct labor and overhead into one category, since these costs
are what are needed to convert raw materials into a finished
product.

   Although it seems as if there are many classifications or
labels associated with costs, remember that the purpose of

716 | 6.4 Cost Behavior
cost classification is to assist managers in the decision-making
process. Since this type of data is not used for external
reporting purposes, it is important to understand that (1) a
single cost can have many different labels; (2) the terms are
used independently, not simultaneously; and (3) each
classification is important to understand in order to make
business decisions. Figure 6.39 uses some example costs to
demonstrate these principles.

Effects of Changes in Activity Level on
Unit Costs and Total Costs

We have spent considerable time identifying and describing
the various ways that businesses categorize costs. However,
categorization itself is not enough. It is important not only to
understand the categorization of costs but to understand the
relationships between changes in activity levels and the
changes in costs in total. It is worth repeating that when a
cost is considered to be fixed, that cost is only fixed for the
relevant range. Once the boundary of the relevant range has
been reached or moved beyond, fixed costs will change and

                                                                       6.4 Cost Behavior | 717
then remain fixed for the new relevant range. Remember that,
within a relevant range of activity, where the relevant range
refers to a specific activity level that is bounded by a minimum
and maximum amount, total fixed costs are constant, but costs
change on a per-unit basis. Let's examine an example that
demonstrates how changes in activity can affect costs.

YOUR TURN

Spring Break Trip Planning

Margo is planning an 8-day spring break trip from Atlanta,
Georgia, to Tampa, Florida, leaving on Sunday and returning
the following Sunday. She has located a condominium on the
beach and has put a deposit down on the unit. The rental
company has a maximum occupancy for the condominium
of seven adults. There is an amusement park that she plans
to visit. She is going to use her parents' car, an SUV that can
carry up to six people and their luggage. The SUV can travel
an average of 20 miles per gallon, the total distance is
approximately 1,250 miles (550 miles each way plus driving
around Tampa every day), and the average price of gas is $3 per
gallon. A season pass for an amusement park she wants to visit
is $168 per person. Margo estimates spending $40 per day per
person for food. She estimates the costs for the trip as follows:

Figure 6.40 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Now that she has cost estimates, she is trying to decide how
many of her friends she wants to invite. Since the car can only
seat six people, Marg made a list of five other girls to invite. Use
her data to answer the following questions and fill out the cost
table:

 1. What are the total variable costs for the trip?
2. What are the average variable costs for the trip?
 3. What are the total fixed costs for the trip?
4. What are the average fixed costs for the trip?
 5. What are the average costs per person for the trip?
6. What would the trip cost Margo if she were to go alone?

 7. What additional costs would be incurred if a seventh girl
      was invited on the trip? Would this be a wise decision
      (from a cost perspective)? Why or why not?

8. Which cost will not be affected if a seventh girl was invited
      on the trip?

Answers will vary. All responses should recognize that there
is no room in the car for the seventh girl and her luggage,
although the condominium will accommodate the extra
person. This means they will have to either find a larger vehicle
and incur higher gas expenses or take a second car, which will
at least double the fixed gas cost.

7.1 Exploring
Contribution Margin

Before examining contribution margins, let's review some key
concepts: fixed costs, relevant range, variable costs, and
contribution margin. Fixed costs are those costs that will not
change within a given range of production. For example, in the
current case, the fixed costs will be the student sales fee of
$100. No matter how many shirts the club produces within the
relevant range, the fee will be locked in at $100. The relevant
range is the anticipated production activity level. Fixed costs
remain constant within a relevant range. If production levels
exceed expectations, then additional fixed costs will be
required.

   For example, assume that the students are going to lease
vans from their university's motor pool to drive to their
conference. A university van will hold eight passengers, at a
cost of $200 per van. If they send one to eight participants,
the fixed cost for the van would be $200. If they send nine to
sixteen students, the fixed cost would be $400 because they
will need two vans. We would consider the relevant range to
be between one and eight passengers, and the fixed cost in
this range would be $200. If they exceed the initial relevant
range, the fixed costs would increase to $400 for nine to sixteen
passengers.

   Variable costs are those costs that vary per unit of
production. Direct materials are often typical variable costs,
because you normally use more direct materials when you
produce more items. In our example, if the students sold 100
shirts, assuming an individual variable cost per shirt of $10, the
total variable costs would be $1,000 (100  $10). If they sold 250

726 | 7.1 Exploring Contribution Margin
shirts, again assuming an individual variable cost per shirt of
$10, then the total variable costs would $2,500 (250  $10).

   Contribution margin is the amount by which a product's
selling price exceeds its total variable cost per unit. This
difference between the sales price and the per unit variable
cost is called the contribution margin because it is the per
unit contribution toward covering the fixed costs. It typically is
calculated by comparing the sales revenue generated by the
sale of one item versus the variable cost of the item:

Figure 7.1 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

In our example, the sales revenue from one shirt is $15 and the
variable cost of one shirt is $10, so the individual contribution
margin is $5. This $5 contribution margin is assumed to first
cover fixed costs first and then realized as profit.

   It is not just small operations that benefit from cost-volume-
profit (CVP) analysis. At some point, all businesses find
themselves asking the same basic questions: How many units
must be sold in order to reach a desired income level? How
much will each unit cost? How much of the sales price from
each unit will help cover our fixed costs? For
example, Starbucks faces these same questions every day, only
on a larger scale. When they introduce new menu items, such
as seasonal specialty drinks, they must determine the fixed
and variable costs associated with each item. Adding menu
items may not only increase their fixed costs in the short run
(via advertising and promotions) but will bring new variable
costs. Starbucks needs to price these drinks in a way that
covers the variable costs per unit and additional fixed costs and
contributes to overall net income. Regardless of how large or
small the enterprise, understanding how fixed costs, variable

costs, and volume are related to income is vital for sound
decision-making.

Understanding how to use fixed costs, variable costs, and sales
in CVP analyses requires an understanding of the term margin.
You may have heard that restaurants and grocery stores have
very low margins, while jewelry stores and furniture stores have
very high margins. What does "margin" mean? In the broadest
terms, margin is the difference between a product or service's
selling price and its cost of production. Recall the accounting
club's T-shirt sale. The difference between the sales price per T-
shirt and the purchase price of the T-shirts was the accounting
club's margin:

728 | 7.1 Exploring Contribution Margin
          Figure 7.3 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC
          BY-NC-SA 4.0

We previously learned the characteristics of fixed and variable
costs and introduced the basics of cost behavior. Let's now
apply these behaviors to the concept of contribution margin.
The company will use this "margin" to cover fixed expenses
and hopefully to provide a profit. Let's begin by examining
contribution margin on a per unit basis.

Unit Contribution Margin

When the contribution margin is calculated on a per unit basis,
it is referred to as the contribution margin per unit or unit
contribution margin. You can find the contribution margin per
unit using the equation shown in Figure 7.4.

Figure 7.4 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

It is important to note that this unit contribution margin can be
calculated either in dollars or as a percentage. To demonstrate

                                               7.1 Exploring Contribution Margin | 729
this principle, let's consider the costs and revenues of Hicks
Manufacturing, a small company that manufactures and sells
birdbaths to specialty retailers.

   Hicks Manufacturing sells its Blue Jay Model for $1100 and
incurs variable costs of $20 per unit. In order to calculate their
per unit contribution margin, we use the formula in Figure
7.5 to determine that on a per unit basis, their contribution
margin is:

Figure 7.5 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

This means that for every Blue Jay model they sell, they will
have $80 to contribute toward covering fixed costs, such as
rent, insurance, and manager salaries. But Hicks
Manufacturing manufactures and sells more than one model
of birdbath. They also sell a Cardinal Model for $75, and these
birdbaths incur variable costs of $15 per unit. For the Cardinal
Model, their contribution margin on a per unit basis is the $75
sales price less the $15 per unit variable costs is as follows:

730 | 7.1 Exploring Contribution Margin
Figure 7.6 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

This demonstrates that, for every Cardinal model they sell, they
will have $60 to contribute toward covering fixed costs and, if
there is any left, toward profit. Every product that a company
manufactures or every service a company provides will have a
unique contribution margin per unit. In these examples, the
contribution margin per unit was calculated in dollars per unit,
but another way to calculate contribution margin is as a ratio
(percentage).

Contribution Margin Ratio

The contribution margin ratio is the percentage of a unit's

                                                7.1 Exploring Contribution Margin | 731
selling price that exceeds total unit variable costs. In other
words, contribution margin is expressed as a percentage of
sales price and is calculated using this formula:

Figure 7.7 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

For Hicks Manufacturing and their Blue Jay Model, the
contribution margin ratio will be

Figure 7.8 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

At a contribution margin ratio of 80%, approximately $0.80 of
each sales dollar generated by the sale of a Blue Jay Model
is available to cover fixed expenses and contribute to profit.
The contribution margin ratio for the birdbath implies that,
for every $1 generated by the sale of a Blue Jay Model, they
have $0.80 that contributes to fixed costs and profit. Thus, 20%
of each sales dollar represents the variable cost of the item
and 80% of the sales dollar is margin. Just as each product or
service has its own contribution margin on a per unit basis,
each has a unique contribution margin ratio. Although this
process is extremely useful for analyzing the profitability of a
single product, good, or service, managers also need to see
the "big picture" and will examine contribution margin in total
across all products, goods, or services.

of $0.50 per T-shirt sold in addition to a salary of $400 per
month. Construct a contribution margin income statement for
two different months: in one month, assume 100 T-shirts are
sold, and in the other, assume 200 T-shirts are sold.

Total Contribution Margin

This "big picture" is gained by calculating total contribution
margin--the total amount by which total sales exceed total
variable costs. We calculate total contribution margin by
multiplying per unit contribution margin by sales volume or

                                               7.1 Exploring Contribution Margin | 733
number of units sold. This approach allows managers to
determine how much profit a company is making before
paying its fixed expenses. For Hicks Manufacturing, if the
managers want to determine how much their Blue Jay Model
contributes to the overall profitability of the company, they can
calculate total contribution margin as follows:

Figure 7.10 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

For the month of April, sales from the Blue Jay Model
contributed $36,000 toward fixed costs. Looking at
contribution margin in total allows managers to evaluate
whether a particular product is profitable and how the sales
revenue from that product contributes to the overall
profitability of the company. In fact, we can create a specialized
income statement called a contribution margin income
statement to determine how changes in sales volume impact
the bottom line.

   To illustrate how this form of income statement can be used,
contribution margin income statements for Hicks
Manufacturing are shown for the months of April and May.

   In April, Hicks sold 500 Blue Jay Models at $100 per unit,

734 | 7.1 Exploring Contribution Margin
which resulted in the operating income shown on the
contribution margin income statement:

Figure 7.11 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long
Description
In May, 750 of the Blue Jay models were sold as shown on
the contribution margin income statement. When comparing
the two statements, take note of what changed and what
remained the same from April to May.

Figure 7.12 By: Rice University Source: OpenstaxCC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long
Description

                                               7.1 Exploring Contribution Margin | 735
Using this contribution margin format makes it easy to see
the impact of changing sales volume on operating income.
Fixed costs remained unchanged; however, as more units are
produced and sold, more of the per-unit sales price is available
to contribute to the company's net income.

   Before going further, let's note several key points about CVP
and the contribution margin income statement. First, the
contribution margin income statement is used
for internal purposes and is not shared with external
stakeholders. Secondly, in this specialized income statement,
when "operating income" is shown, it actually refers to "net
operating income" without regard to income taxes.
Companies can also consider taxes when performing a CVP
analysis to project both net operating income and net income.
(The preparation of contribution margin income statements
with regard to taxes is covered in advanced accounting
courses; here, we will consider net income as net operating
income without regard to taxes.)

   Regardless of whether contribution margin is calculated on
a per-unit basis, calculated as a ratio, or incorporated into an
income statement, all three express how much sales revenue is
available to cover fixed expenses and contribute to profit. Let's
examine how all three approaches convey the same financial
performance, although represented somewhat differently.

   You will recall that the per-unit contribution margin was $80
for a Hicks Blue Jay birdbath. When Hicks sold 500 units, each
unit contributed $80 to fixed expenses and profit, which can be
verified from April's income statement:

Figure 7.13 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

736 | 7.1 Exploring Contribution Margin
Now, let's use May's Contribution Margin Income Statement as
previously calculated to verify the contribution margin based
on the contribution margin ratio previously calculated, which
was 80%, by applying this formula:

Figure 7.14 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Regardless of how contribution margin is expressed, it provides
critical information for managers. Understanding how each
product, good, or service contributes to the organization's
profitability allows managers to make decisions such as which
product lines they should expand or which might be
discontinued. When allocating scarce resources, the
contribution margin will help them focus on those products or
services with the highest margin, thereby maximizing profits.

The Evolution of Cost-Volume-Profit
Relationships

The CVP relationships of many organizations have become
more complex recently because many labor-intensive jobs
have been replaced by or supplemented with technology,
changing both fixed and variable costs. For those organizations
that are still labor-intensive, the labor costs tend to be variable
costs, since at higher levels of activity there will be a demand
for more labor usage. For example, assuming one worker is
needed for every 50 customers per hour, we might need two
workers for an average sales season, but during the
Thanksgiving and Christmas season, the store might
experience 250 customers per hour and thus would need five
workers.

   However, the growing trend in many segments of the
economy is to convert labor-intensive enterprises (primarily
variable costs) to operations heavily dependent on equipment
or technology (primarily fixed costs). For example, in retail,
many functions that were previously performed by people are
now performed by machines or software, such as the self-
checkout counters in stores such as Walmart, Costco,
and Lowe's. Since machine and software costs are often
depreciated or amortized, these costs tend to be the same or
fixed, no matter the level of activity within a given relevant
range.

   In China, completely unmanned grocery stores have been
created that use facial recognition for accessing the store.
Patrons will shop, bag the purchased items, leave the store,
and be billed based on what they put in their bags. Along with
managing the purchasing process, inventory is maintained by
sensors that let managers know when they need to restock an
item.

   In the United States, similar labor-saving processes have

738 | 7.1 Exploring Contribution Margin
been developed, such as the ability to order groceries or fast
food online and have it ready when the customer arrives.
Another major innovation affecting labor costs is the
development of driverless cars and trucks (primarily fixed
costs), which will have a major impact on the number of taxi
and truck drivers in the future (primarily variable costs). Do
these labor-saving processes change the cost structure for the
company? Are variable costs decreased? What about fixed
costs? Let's look at this in more detail.

   When ordering food through an app, there is no need to have
an employee take the order, but someone still needs to prepare
the food and package it for the customer. The variable costs
associated with the wages of order takers will likely decrease,
but the fixed costs associated with additional technology to
allow for online ordering will likely increase. When grocery
customers place their orders online, this not only requires
increased fixed costs for the new technology, but it can also
increase variable labor costs, as employees are needed to fill
customers' online orders. Many stores may move cashier
positions to online order fulfillment rather than hiring
additional employees. Other stores may have employees fill
online grocery orders during slow or downtimes.

   Using driverless cars and trucks decreases the variable costs
tied to the wages of the drivers but requires a major
investment in fixed-cost assets--the autonomous
vehicles--and companies would need to charge prices that
allowed them to recoup their expensive investments in the
technology as well as make a profit. Alternatively, companies
that rely on shipping and delivery companies that use
driverless technology may be faced with an increase in
transportation or shipping costs (variable costs). These costs
may be higher because technology is often more expensive
when it is new than it will be in the future, when it is easier
and more cost effective to produce and also more accessible.
A good example of the change in cost of a new technological

                                               7.1 Exploring Contribution Margin | 739
innovation over time is the personal computer, which was very
expensive when it was first developed but has decreased in
cost significantly since that time. The same will likely happen
over time with the cost of creating and using driverless
transportation.

   You might wonder why a company would trade variable
costs for fixed costs. One reason might be to meet company
goals, such as gaining market share. Other reasons include
being a leader in the use of innovation and improving
efficiencies. If a company uses the latest technology, such as
online ordering and delivery, this may help the company
attract a new type of customer or create loyalty with
longstanding customers. In addition, although fixed costs are
riskier because they exist regardless of the sales level, once
those fixed costs are met, profits grow. All of these new trends
result in changes in the composition of fixed and variable costs
for a company and it is this composition that helps determine
a company's profit.

   As you will learn in future chapters, in order for businesses to
remain profitable, it is important for managers to understand
how to measure and manage fixed and variable costs for
decision-making. In this chapter, we begin examining the
relationship among sales volume, fixed costs, variable costs,
and profit in decision-making. We will discuss how to use the
concepts of fixed and variable costs and their relationship to
profit to determine the sales needed to break even or to reach
a desired profit. You will also learn how to plan for changes
in selling price or costs, whether a single product, multiple
products, or services are involved.

The break-even point is the dollar amount (total sales dollars)
or production level (total units produced) at which the
company has recovered all variable and fixed costs. In other
words, no profit or loss occurs at break-even because Total Cost
= Total Revenue. Figure 7.15 illustrates the components of the
break-even point:

Figure 7.15 Break-Even Point By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC
BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long Description

The basic theory illustrated in Figure 7.15 is that, because of the
existence of fixed costs in most production processes, in the
first stages of production and subsequent sale of the products,
742 | 7.2 Breakeven Analysis
the company will realize a loss. For example, assume that in an
extreme case the company has fixed costs of $20,000, a sales
price of $400 per unit and variable costs of $250 per unit, and
it sells no units. It would realize a loss of $20,000 (the fixed
costs) since it recognized no revenue or variable costs. This loss
explains why the company's cost graph recognized costs (in
this example, $20,000) even though there were no sales. If it
subsequently sells units, the loss would be reduced by $150 (the
contribution margin) for each unit sold. This relationship will
be continued until we reach the break-even point, where total
revenue equals total costs. Once we reach the break-even point
for each unit sold the company will realize an increase in profits
of $150.

   For each additional unit sold, the loss typically is lessened
until it reaches the break-even point. At this stage, the
company is theoretically realizing neither a profit nor a loss.
After the next sale beyond the break-even point, the company
will begin to make a profit, and the profit will continue to
increase as more units are sold. While there are exceptions
and complications that could be incorporated, these are the
general guidelines for break-even analysis.

   As you can imagine, the concept of the break-even point
applies to every business endeavor--manufacturing, retail, and
service. Because of its universal applicability, it is a critical
concept to managers, business owners, and accountants.
When a company first starts out, it is important for the owners
to know when their sales will be sufficient to cover all of their
fixed costs and begin to generate a profit for the business.
Larger companies may look at the break-even point when
investing in new machinery, plants, or equipment in order to
predict how long it will take for their sales volume to cover new
or additional fixed costs. Since the break-even point represents
that point where the company is neither losing nor making
money, managers need to make decisions that will help the
company reach and exceed this point as quickly as possible.

                                                               7.2 Breakeven Analysis | 743
No business can operate for very long below break-even.
Eventually the company will suffer losses so great that they are
forced to close their doors.

   To illustrate the concept of break-even, we will return to Hicks
Manufacturing and look at the Blue Jay birdbath they
manufacture and sell.

Sales Where Operating Income Is $0

Hicks Manufacturing is interested in finding out the point at
which they break even selling their Blue Jay Model birdbath.
They will break even when the operating income is $0. The
operating income is determined by subtracting the total
variable and fixed costs from the sales revenue generated by
an enterprise. In other words, the managers at Hicks want to
know how many Blue Jay birdbaths they will need to sell in
order to cover their fixed expenses and break even. Information
on this product is:

   In order to find their break-even point, we will use the
contribution margin for the Blue Jay and determine how many

744 | 7.2 Breakeven Analysis
contribution margins we need in order to cover the fixed
expenses, as shown in the formula in Figure 7.17.

Figure 7.17 Break-Even Point in Units By: Rice University Source:
Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Applying this to Hicks calculates as:
What this tells us is that Hicks must sell 225 Blue Jay Model
birdbaths in order to cover their fixed expenses. In other words,
they will not begin to show a profit until they sell the 226th unit.
This is illustrated in their contribution margin income
statement.

Figure 7.18 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

The break-even point for Hicks Manufacturing at a sales
volume of $22,500 (225 units) is shown graphically in Figure
7.19.

                                                               7.2 Breakeven Analysis | 745
Figure 7.19 Hicks Manufacturing Break-Even Point for 225 Units By:
Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long Description

As you can see, when Hicks sells 225 Blue Jay Model birdbaths,
they will make no profit, but will not suffer a loss because all
of their fixed expenses are covered. However, what happens
when they do not sell 225 units? If that happens, their
operating income is negative.

Sales Where Operating Income Is
Negative

In a recent month, local flooding caused Hicks to close for
several days, reducing the number of units they could ship
and sell from 225 units to 175 units. The information in Figure
7.20 reflects this drop in sales.

746 | 7.2 Breakeven Analysis
Figure 7.20 Hicks Manufacturing Contribution Margin Income
Statement By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
At 175 units ($17,500 in sales), Hicks does not generate enough
sales revenue to cover their fixed expenses and they suffer a
loss of $4,000. They did not reach the break-even point of 225
units.

                                                               7.2 Breakeven Analysis | 747
Sales Where Operating Income Is Positive

What happens when Hicks has a busy month and sells 300
Blue Jay birdbaths? We have already established that the
contribution margin from 225 units will put them at break-
even. When sales exceed the break-even point the unit
contribution margin from the additional units will go toward
profit. This is reflected on their income statement.

Figure 7.22 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Again, looking at the graph for break-even (Figure 7.23), you will
see that their sales have moved them beyond the point where
total revenue is equal to total cost and into the profit area of the
graph.

748 | 7.2 Breakeven Analysis

Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long Description

Hicks Manufacturing can use the information from these
different scenarios to inform many of their decisions about
operations, such as sales goals.

   However, using the contribution margin per unit is not the
only way to determine a break-even point. Recall that we were
able to determine a contribution margin expressed in dollars
by finding the contribution margin ratio. We can apply that
contribution margin ratio to the break-even analysis to
determine the break-even point in dollars. For example, we
know that Hicks had $18,000 in fixed costs and a contribution
margin ratio of 80% for the Blue Jay model. We will use this
ratio (Figure 7.24) to calculate the break-even point in dollars.

Figure 7.24 Break-Even Point in Dollars By: Rice University Source:
Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

                                                               7.2 Breakeven Analysis | 749
Applying the formula to Hicks gives this calculation:

Hicks Manufacturing will have to generate $22,500 in monthly
sales in order to cover all of their fixed costs. In order for us to
verify that Hicks' break-even point is $22,500 (or 225 units) we
will look again at the contribution margin income statement at
break-even:

Figure 7.25 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

By knowing at what level sales are sufficient to cover fixed
expenses is critical, but companies want to be able to make a
profit and can use this break-even analysis to help them.

Examples of the Effects of Variable and
Fixed Costs in Determining the
Break-Even Point

Companies typically do not want to simply break even, as they
are in business to make a profit. Break-even analysis also can
help companies determine the level of sales (in dollars or in
units) that is needed to make a desired profit. The process for
750 | 7.2 Breakeven Analysis
factoring a desired level of profit into a break-even analysis is
to add the desired level of profit to the fixed costs and then
calculate a new break-even point. We know that Hicks
Manufacturing breaks even at 225 Blue Jay birdbaths, but what
if they have a target profit for the month of July? They can
simply add that target to their fixed costs. By calculating a
target profit, they will produce and (hopefully) sell enough bird
baths to cover both fixed costs and the target profit.

   If Hicks wants to earn $16,000 in profit in the month of May,
we can calculate their new break-even point as follows:

We have already established that the $18,000 in fixed costs is
covered at the 225 units mark, so an additional 200 units will
cover the desired profit (200 units  $80 per unit contribution
margin = $16,000). Alternatively, we can calculate this in terms
of dollars by using the contribution margin ratio.

As done previously, we can confirm this calculation using the
contribution margin income statement:

Figure 7.26 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Note that the example calculations ignored income taxes,
which implies we were finding target operating income.
However, companies may want to determine what level of sales
would generate a desired after-tax profit. To find the break-

                                                                7.2 Breakeven Analysis | 751
even point at a desired after-tax profit, we simply need to
convert the desired after-tax profit to the desired pre-tax profit,
also referred to as operating income, and then follow through
as in the example. Suppose Hicks wants to earn $24,000 after-
taxes, what level of sales (units and dollars) would be needed to
meet that goal? First, the after-tax profit needs to be converted
to a pre-tax desired profit:

If the tax rate for Hicks is 40%, then the $24,000 after-tax profit
is equal to a pre-tax profit of $40,000:

The tax rate indicates the amount of tax expense that will result
from any profits and 1 - tax rate indicates the amount
remaining after taking out tax expense. The concept is similar
to buying an item on sale. If an item costs $80 and is on sale for
40% off, then the amount being paid for the item is 60% of the
sale price, or $48 ($80  60%). Another way to find this involves
two steps. First find the discount ($80  40% = $32) and then
subtract the discount from the sales price ($80 - $32 = $48).

   Taxes and profit work in a similar fashion. If we know the
profit before tax is $100,000 and the tax rate is 30%, then tax
expenses are $100,000  30% = $30,000. This means the after-
tax income is $100,000 - $30,000 = $70,000. However, in most
break-even situations, as well as other decision-making areas,
the desired after-tax profit is known, and the pre-tax profit
must be determined by dividing the after-tax profit by 1 - tax
rate.

   To demonstrate the combination of both a profit and the
after-tax effects and subsequent calculations, let's return to the
Hicks Manufacturing example. Let's assume that we want to
calculate the target volume in units and revenue that Hicks
must sell to generate an after-tax return of $24,000, assuming
the same fixed costs of $18,000.

   Since we earlier determined $24,000 after-tax equals

752 | 7.2 Breakeven Analysis
$40,000 before-tax if the tax rate is 40%, we simply use the
break-even at a desired profit formula to determine the target
sales.

This calculation demonstrates that Hicks would need to sell 725
units at $100 a unit to generate $72,500 in sales to earn $24,000
in after-tax profits.

   Alternatively, target sales in sales dollars could have been
calculated using the contribution margin ratio:

Once again, the contribution margin income statement proves
the sales and profit relationships.

Figure 7.27 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
Long Description

Thus, to calculate break-even point at a particular after-tax
income, the only additional step is to convert after-tax income
to pre-tax income prior to utilizing the break-even formula. It is
good to understand the impact of taxes on break-even analysis
as companies will often want to plan based on the after-tax
effects of a decision as the after-tax portion of income is the
only part of income that will be available for future use.

                                                               7.2 Breakeven Analysis | 753
Application of Break-Even Concepts for a
Service Organization

Because break-even analysis is applicable to any business
enterprise, we can apply these same principles to a service
organization. For example, Marshall & Hirito is a mid-sized
accounting firm that provides a wide range of accounting
services to its clients but relies heavily on personal income
tax preparation for much of its revenue. They have analyzed
the cost to the firm associated with preparing these returns.
They have determined the following cost structure for the
preparation of a standard 1040A Individual Income Tax Return:

Figure 7.28 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

They have fixed costs of $14,000 per month associated with the
salaries of the accountants who are responsible for preparing
the Form 1040A. In order to determine their break-even point,
they first determine the contribution margin for the Form
1040A as shown:

Figure 7.29 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

754 | 7.2 Breakeven Analysis
Now they can calculate their break-even point:

Remember, this is the break-even point in units (the number
of tax returns) but they can also find a break-even point
expressed in dollars by using the contribution margin ratio.
First, they find the contribution margin ratio. Then, they use the
ratio to calculate the break-even point in dollars:

We can confirm these figures by preparing a contribution
margin income statement:

Figure 7.30 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Therefore, as long as Marshall & Hirito prepares 56 Form
1040 income tax returns, they will earn no profit but also incur
no loss. What if Marshall & Hirito has a target monthly profit
of $10,000? They can use the break-even analysis process to
determine how many returns they will need to prepare in order
to cover their fixed expenses and reach their target profit:

They will need to prepare 96 returns during the month in order
to realize a $10,000 profit. Expressing this in dollars instead of

                                                               7.2 Breakeven Analysis | 755
units requires that we use the contribution margin ratio as
shown:

Marshall & Hirito now knows that, in order to cover the fixed
costs associated with this service, they must generate $38,400
in revenue. Once again, let's verify this by constructing a
contribution margin income statement:

Figure 7.31 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

As you can see, the $38,400 in revenue will not only cover the
$14,000 in fixed costs, but will supply Marshall & Hirito with the
$10,000 in profit (net income) they desire.

   As you've learned, break-even can be calculated using either
contribution margin per unit or the contribution margin ratio.
Now that you have seen this process, let's look at an example of
these two concepts presented together to illustrate how either
method will provide the same financial results.

   Suppose that Channing's Chairs designs, builds, and sells
unique ergonomic desk chairs for home and business. Their
bestselling chair is the Spine Saver. Figure 7.32 illustrates how
Channing could determine the break-even point in sales
dollars using either the contribution margin per unit or the
contribution margin ratio.

756 | 7.2 Breakeven Analysis
Figure 7.32 Channing's Break-Even Point By: Rice University Source:
Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long Description

Note that in either scenario, the break-even point is the same in
dollars and units, regardless of approach. Thus, you can always
find the break-even point (or a desired profit) in units and then
convert it to sales by multiplying by the selling price per unit.
Alternatively, you can find the break-even point in sales dollars
and then find the number of units by dividing by the selling
price per unit.

College Creations

College Creations, Inc (CC), builds a loft that is easily adaptable
to most dorm rooms or apartments and can be assembled into

                                                               7.2 Breakeven Analysis | 757
a variety of configurations. Each loft is sold for $500, and the
cost to produce one loft is $300, including all parts and labor.
CC has fixed costs of $100,000.
A. What happens if CC produces nothing?
B. Now, assume CC produces and sells one unit (loft). What

      are their financial results?
C. Now, what do you think would happen if they produced

      and sold 501 units?
D. How many units would CC need to sell in order to break

      even?
E. How many units would CC need to sell if they wanted to

      have a pretax profit of $50,000?
Solution

   A. If they produce nothing, they will still incur fixed costs of
$100,000. They will suffer a net loss of $100,000.

   B. If they sell one unit, they will have a net loss of $99,800.

Figure 7.33 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

C. If they produce 501 units, they will have operating income of
$200 as shown:

758 | 7.2 Breakeven Analysis
Figure 7.34 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

D. Break-even can be determined by FC  CM per unit: $100,000
 $200 = 500. Five hundred lofts must be sold to break even.

   E. The desired profit can be treated like a fixed cost, and the
target profit would be (FC + Desired Profit)  CM or ($100,000
+ $50,000)  $200 = 750. Seven hundred fifty lofts need to be
sold to reach a desired income of $50,000. Another way to have
found this is to know that, after fixed costs are met, the $200
per unit contribution margin will go toward profit. The desired
profit of $50,000  $200 per unit contribution margin = 250.
This means that 250 additional units must be sold. To break
even requires 500 units to be sold, and to reach the desired
profit of $50,000 requires an additional 250 units, for a total of
750 units.

The Effects on Break-Even under
Changing Business Conditions

Circumstances often change within a company, within an
industry, or even within the economy that impact the decision-
making of an organization. Sometimes, these effects are
sudden and unexpected, for example, if a hurricane destroyed
the factory of a company's major supplier; other times, they
occur more slowly, such as when union negotiations affect your

                                                               7.2 Breakeven Analysis | 759
labor costs. In either of these situations, costs to the company
will be affected. Using CVP analysis, the company can predict
how these changes will affect profits.

Changing a Single Variable

To demonstrate the effects of changing any one of these
variables, consider Back Door Caf, a small coffee shop that
roasts its own beans to make espresso drinks and gourmet
coffee. They also sell a variety of baked goods and T-shirts with
their logo on them. They track their costs carefully and use CVP
analysis to make sure that their sales cover their fixed costs and
provide a reasonable level of profit for the owners.

Change in Sales Price

The owner of Back Door has one of her employees conduct a
survey of the other coffee shops in the area and finds that they
are charging $0.75 more for espresso drinks. As a result, the
owner wants to determine what would happen to operating
income if she increased her price by just $0.50 and sales
remained constant, so she performs the following analysis:

760 | 7.2 Breakeven Analysis
Figure 7.35 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
Long Description

The only variable that has changed is the $0.50 increase in the
price of their espresso drinks, but the net operating income
will increase by $750. Another way to think of this increase in
income is that, if the sales price increases by $0.50 per expresso
drink and the estimated sales are 1,500 units, then this will
result in an increase in overall contribution margin of $750.
Moreover, since all of the fixed costs were met by the lower
sales price, all of this $750 goes to profit. Again, this is assuming
the higher sales price does not decrease the number of units
sold. Since the other coffee shops will still be priced higher than
Back Door, the owner believes that there will not be a decrease
in sales volume.

   When making this adjustment to their sales price, Back Door
Caf is engaging in target pricing, a process in which a
company uses market analysis and production information to
determine the maximum price customers are willing to pay
for a good or service in addition to the markup percentage.

                                                                7.2 Breakeven Analysis | 761
If the good can be produced at a cost that allows both the
desired profit percentage as well as deliver the good at a price
acceptable to the customer, then the company should proceed
with the product; otherwise, the company will not achieve its
desired profit goals.

Change in Variable Cost

In March, the owner of Back Door receives a letter from her
cups supplier informing her that there is a $0.05 price increase
due to higher material prices. Assume that the example uses
the original $3.75 per unit sales price. The owner wants to know
what would happen to net operating income if she absorbs the
cost increase, so she performs the following analysis:

Figure 7.36 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
Long Description

762 | 7.2 Breakeven Analysis
She is surprised to see that just a $0.05 increase in variable
costs (cups) will reduce her net income by $75. The owner
may decide that she is fine with the lower income, but if she
wants to maintain her income, she will need to find a new cup
supplier, reduce other costs, or pass the price increase on to
her customers. Because the increase in the cost of the cups
was a variable cost, the impact on net income can be seen by
taking the increase in cost per unit, $0.05, and multiplying that
by the units expected to be sold, 1,500, to see the impact on the
contribution margin, which in this case would be a decrease of
$75. This also means a decrease in net income of $75.

Change in Fixed Cost

Back Door Caf's lease is coming up for renewal. The owner
calls the landlord to indicate that she wants to renew her lease
for another 5 years. The landlord is happy to hear she will
continue renting from him but informs her that the rent will
increase $225 per month. She is not certain that she can afford
an additional $225 per month and tells him she needs to look
at her numbers and will call him back. She pulls out her CVP
spreadsheet and adjusts her monthly fixed costs upwards by
$225. Assume that the example uses the original $3.75 per unit
sales price. The results of her analysis of the impact of the rent
increase on her annual net income are:

                                                               7.2 Breakeven Analysis | 763
Figure 7.37 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
Long Description

Because the rent increase is a change in a fixed cost, the
contribution margin per unit remains the same. However, the
break-even point in both units and dollars increase because
more units of contribution are needed to cover the $225
monthly increase in fixed costs. If the owner of the Back Door
agrees to the increase in rent for the new lease, she will likely
look for ways to increase the contribution margin per unit to
offset this increase in fixed costs.

   In each of the prior examples, only one variable was
changed--sales volume, variable costs, or fixed costs. There are
some generalizations that can be made regarding how a
change in any one of these variables affects the break-even
point. These generalizations are summarized in Table 7.1.

Changing Multiple Variables

We have analyzed situations in which one variable changes,
but often, more than one change will occur at a time. For
example, a company may need to lower its selling price to
compete, but they may also be able to lower certain variable
costs by switching suppliers.

   Suppose Back Door Caf has the opportunity to purchase a
new espresso machine that will reduce the amount of coffee
beans required for an espresso drink by putting the beans
under higher pressure. The new machine will cost $15,000, but
it will decrease the variable cost per cup by $0.05. The owner
wants to see what the effect will be on the net operating
income and break-even point if she purchases the new
machine. She has arranged financing for the new machine and
the monthly payment will increase her fixed costs by $400 per

                                                               7.2 Breakeven Analysis | 765
month. When she conducts this analysis, she gets the following
results:

Figure 7.38 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
Long Description

Looking at the "what-if" analysis, we see that the contribution
margin per unit increases because of the $0.05 reduction in
variable cost per unit. As a result, she has a higher total
contribution margin available to cover fixed expenses. This is
good, because the monthly payment on the espresso machine
represents an increased fixed cost. Even though the
contribution margin ratio increases, it is not enough to totally
offset the increase in fixed costs, and her monthly break-even
point has risen from $4,125.00 to $4,687.50. If the new break-
even point in units is a realistic number (within the relevant
range), then she would decide to purchase the new machine
because, once it has been paid for, her break-even point will
fall and her net income will rise. Performing this analysis is an
effective way for managers and business owners to look into
766 | 7.2 Breakeven Analysis
the future, so to speak, and see what impact business decisions
will have on their financial position.

   Let's look at another option the owner of the Back Door
Caf has to consider when making the decision about this
new machine. What would happen if she purchased the new
machine to realize the variable cost savings and also raised her
price by just $0.20? She feels confident that such a small price
increase will go virtually unnoticed by her customers but may
help her offset the increase in fixed costs. She runs the analysis
as follows:

Figure 7.39 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
Long Description

The analysis shows the expected result: an increase in the per-
unit contribution margin, a decrease in the break-even point,
and an increase in the net operating income. She has changed
three variables in her costs--sales price, variable cost, and fixed
cost. In fact, the small price increase almost gets her back to

the net operating income she realized before the purchase of
the new expresso machine.

   By now, you should begin to understand why CVP analysis is
such a powerful tool. The owner of Back Door Caf can run an
unlimited number of these what-if scenarios until she meets
the financial goals for her company. There are very few tools in
managerial accounting as powerful and meaningful as a cost-
volume-profit analysis.

7.3 Margin of Safety

Our discussion of CVP analysis has focused on the sales
necessary to break even or to reach a desired profit, but two
other concepts are useful regarding our break-even sales.
Those concepts are margin of safety and operating leverage.
A company's margin of safety is the difference between its
current sales and its break-even sales. The margin of safety
tells the company how much they could lose in sales before
the company begins to lose money, or, in other words, before
the company falls below the break-even point. The higher the
margin of safety is, the lower the risk is of not breaking even or
incurring a loss. In order to calculate margin of safety, we use
the following formula:

Figure 7.40 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Let's look at Manteo Machine, a company that machines parts
that are then sold and used in the manufacture of farm
equipment. For their core product, the break-even analysis is as
follows:

772 | 7.3 Margin of Safety
Figure 7.41 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
Long Description

Interpreting this information tells Manteo Machine that, when
sales equal $153,000, they will be at the break-even point.
However, as soon as sales fall below this figure, they will have
negative net operating income. They have decided that they
want a margin of safety of $10,000. They can add this as if it
were a fixed cost (very much the same way we added target
profit earlier) and then find a new break-even point that
includes a $10,000 margin of safety. If they approached it from
this perspective, their new break-even would appear as follows:

                                                                    7.3 Margin of Safety | 773
Figure 7.42 Manteo Machine's Margin of Safety By: Rice University
Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long Description

As shown in Figure 7.42, the margin of safety of 1,900 units is
found from (FC + Margin of Safety)  CM per unit = $95,000
 $50. Thus, 1,900 units must be sold in order to meet fixed
cost and have a $10,000 margin of safety. Another way to see
this is to realize the $10,000 margin of safety will be met in
$50 increments based on the current contribution margin. This
means the company will need to sell an additional 200 units,
which is an additional $18,000 in sales to have the desired
margin of safety. The true break-even, where only fixed costs
were met, was 1,700 units, or $153,000 in sales. The point at
which the company would have a $10,000 margin of safety
is 1,900 units, or $171,000 in sales. Note that the new level of
units is the break-even units of 1,700 plus the 200 units for the
margin of safety. The same can be seen for the sales dollar.
The new level of desired sales dollars is the break-even sales of
$153,000 plus the additional $18,000 in sales for the margin of
safety.

   The margin of safety can also be determined when a
company knows its sales volume. For example, Manteo

774 | 7.3 Margin of Safety
Machine sold 2,500 units in March and wants to know its
margin of safety at that sales volume:

Figure 7.43 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

From this analysis, Manteo Machine knows that sales will have
to decrease by $72,000 from their current level before they
revert to break-even operations and are at risk to suffer a loss.

        acctg211/?p=347#oembed-1

Many companies prefer to consider the margin of safety as a
percentage of sales, rather than as a dollar amount. In order
to express margin of safety as a percentage, we divide the
margin of safety (in dollars) by the total budgeted or actual
sales volume. The formula to express margin of safety as a
percentage is:

Figure 7.44 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

                                                                    7.3 Margin of Safety | 775
Previously, we calculated Manteo Machine's margin of safety as
$72,000. As a percentage, it would be
$72,000$225,000=0.32or32%
This tells management that as long as sales do not decrease by
more than 32%, they will not be operating at or near the break-
even point, where they would run a higher risk of suffering
a loss. Often, the margin of safety is determined when sales
budgets and forecasts are made at the start of the fiscal year
and also are regularly revisited during periods of operational
and strategic planning.

7.4 Operating Leverage

In much the same way that managers control the risk of
incurring a net loss by watching their margin of safety, being
aware of the company's operating leverage is critical to the
financial well-being of the firm. Operating leverage is a
measurement of how sensitive net operating income is to a
percentage change in sales dollars. Typically, the higher the
level of fixed costs, the higher the level of risk. However, as sales
volumes increase, the payoff is typically greater with higher
fixed costs than with higher variable costs. In other words, the
higher the risk the greater the payoff.

   First, let's look at this from a general example to understand
payoff. Suppose you had $10,000 to invest and you were
debating between putting that money in low risk bonds
earning 3% or taking a chance and buying stock in a new
company that currently is not profitable but has an innovative
product that many analysts predict will take off and be the
next "big thing." Obviously, there is more risk with buying the
stock than with buying the bonds. If the company remains
unprofitable, or fails, you stand to lose all or a portion of your
investment ,whereas the bonds are less risky and will continue
to pay 3% interest. However, the risk associated with the stock
investment could result in a much higher payoff if the
company is successful.

   So how does this relate to fixed costs and companies?
Companies have many types of fixed costs including salaries,
insurance, and depreciation. These costs are present regardless
of our production or sales levels. This makes fixed costs riskier
than variable costs, which only occur if we produce and sell
items or services. As we sell items, we have learned that the
contribution margin first goes to meeting fixed costs and then

                                                              7.4 Operating Leverage | 777
to profits. Here is an example of how changes in fixed costs
affects profitability.

   Gray Co. has the following income statement:

What is the effect of switching $10,000 of fixed costs to variable
costs? What is the effect of switching $10,000 of variable costs

Long Description

Notice that in this instance, the company's net income stayed
the same. Now, look at the effect on net income of changing
fixed to variable costs or variable costs to fixed costs as sales
volume increases. Assume sales volume increase by 10%.

778 | 7.4 Operating Leverage
Figure 7.47 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
Long Description

As you can see from this example, moving variable costs to
fixed costs, such as making hourly employees salaried, is riskier
in that fixed costs are higher. However, the payoff, or resulting
net income, is higher as sales volume increases.

   This is why companies are so concerned with managing their
fixed and variable costs and will sometimes move costs from
one category to another to manage this risk. Some examples
include, as previously mentioned, moving hourly employees
(variable) to salaried employees (fixed), or replacing an
employee (variable) with a machine (fixed). Keep in mind that
managing this type of risk not only affects operating leverage
but can have an effect on morale and corporate climate as well.

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

Fluctuating Operating Leverage: Why Do
Stores Add Self-Service Checkout Lanes?

Operating leverage fluctuations result from changes in a
company's cost structure. While any change in either variable
or fixed costs will change operating leverage, the fluctuations
most often result from management's decision to shift costs

                                                              7.4 Operating Leverage | 779
from one category to another. As the next example shows,
the advantage can be great when there is economic growth
(increasing sales); however, the disadvantage can be just as
great when there is economic decline (decreasing sales). This is
the risk that must be managed when deciding how and when
to cause operating leverage to fluctuate.

   Consider the impact of reducing variable costs (fewer
employee staffed checkout lanes) and increasing fixed costs
(more self-service checkout lanes). A store with $125,000,000
per year in sales installs some self-service checkout lanes. This
increases its fixed costs by 10% but reduces its variable costs by
5%. As Figure 7.48 shows, at the current sales level, this could
produce a whopping 35% increase in net operating income.
And, if the change results in higher sales, the increase in net
operating income would be even more dramatic. Do the math
and you will see that each 1% increase in sales would produce
a 6% increase in net operating income: well worth the change,
indeed.

Costs 25,000, 27,500; Net Operating Income 6,250 8,438;
Percent Increase in Income 35 percent.

   The company in this example also faces a downside risk,
however. If customers disliked the change enough that sales
decreased by more than 6%, net operating income would drop
below the original level of $6,250 and could even become a loss.

   Operating leverage has a multiplier effect. A multiplier
effect is one in which a change in an input (such as variable
cost per unit) by a certain percentage has a greater effect (a
higher percentage effect) on the output (such as net income).
To explain the concept of a multiplier effect, think of having to
open a very large, heavy wooden crate. You could pull and pull
with your hands all day and still not exert enough force to get
it open. But, what if you used a lever in the form of a pry bar to
multiply your effort and strength? For every additional amount
of force you apply to the pry bar, a much larger amount of
force is applied to the crate. Before you know it, you have the
crate open. Operating leverage works much like that pry bar: if
operating leverage is high, then a very small increase in sales
can result in a large increase in net operating income.

How does a company increase its operating leverage?
Operating leverage is a function of cost structure, and
companies that have a high proportion of fixed costs in their

                                                              7.4 Operating Leverage | 781
cost structure have higher operating leverage. There is,
however, a cautionary side to operating leverage. Since high
operating leverage is the result of high fixed costs, if the market
for the company's products, goods, or services shrinks, or if
demand for the company's products, goods, or services
declines, the company may find itself obligated to pay for fixed
costs with little or no sales revenue to spare. Managers who
have made the decision to chase large increases in net
operating income through the use of operating leverage have
found that, when market demand falls, their only recourse is to
close their doors. In fact, many large companies are making the
decision to shift costs away from fixed costs to protect them
from this very problem.

7.5 Multi-product
Breakeven Analysis

Up to this point in our CVP analysis, we have assumed that a
company only sells one product, but we know that, realistically,
this is not the case. Most companies operate in a multi-product
environment, in which they sell different products,
manufacture different products, or offer different types of
services. Companies price each one of their products or
services differently, and the costs associated with each of those
products or services vary as well. In addition, companies have
limited resources, such as time and labor, and must decide
which products to sell or produce and in what quantities, or
which services to offer in order to be the most profitable. These
profitability considerations are often what contributes
substance to a sales mix decision

In order to perform a break-even analysis for a company that
sells multiple products or provides multiple services, it is
important to understand the concept of a sales mix. A sales
mix represents the relative proportions of the products that
a company sells--in other words, the percentage of the
company's total revenue that comes from product A, product
B, product C, and so forth. Sales mix is important to business
owners and managers because they seek to have a mix that
maximizes profit, since not all products have the same profit
margin. Companies can maximize their profits if they are able
to achieve a sales mix that is heavy with high-margin products,
goods, or services. If a company focuses on a sales mix heavy
with low-margin items, overall company profitability will often
suffer.

   Performing a break-even analysis for these multi-product

                                         7.5 Multi-product Breakeven Analysis | 783
businesses is more complex because each product has a
different selling price, a different variable cost, and, ultimately,
a different contribution margin. We must also proceed under
the assumption that the sales mix remains constant; if it does
change, the CVP analysis must be revised to reflect the change
in sales mix. For the sake of clarity, we will also assume that
all costs are companywide costs, and each product contributes
toward covering these companywide costs.

Calculating Break-Even Analysis in a
Multi-Product Environment

When a company sells more than one product or provides
more than one service, break-even analysis is more complex
because not all of the products sell for the same price or have
the same costs associated with them: Each product has its
own margin. Consequently, the break-even point in a multi-
product environment depends on the mix of products sold.
Further, when the mix of products changes, so does the break-
even point. If demand shifts and customers purchase more
low-margin products, then the break-even point rises.
Conversely, if customers purchase more high-margin products,
the break-even point falls. In fact, even if total sales dollars
remain unchanged, the break-even point can change based
on the sales mix. Let's look at an example of how break-even
analysis works in a multi-product environment.

   In multi-product CVP analysis, the company's sales mix is
viewed as a composite unit, a selection of discrete products
associated together in proportion to the sales mix. The
composite unit is not sold to customers but is a concept used
to calculate a combined contribution margin, which is then
used to estimate the break-even point. Think of a composite
unit as a virtual basket of fruit that contains the proportion

784 | 7.5 Multi-product Breakeven Analysis
of individual fruits equal to the company's sales mix. If we
purchased these items individually to make the fruit basket,
each one would have a separate price and a different
contribution margin. This is how a composite unit works in
CVP analysis. We calculate the contribution margins of all of
the component parts of the composite unit and then use the
total to calculate the break-even point. It is important to note
that fixed costs are allocated among the various components
(products) that make up this composite unit. Should a product
be eliminated from the composite unit or sales mix, the fixed
costs must be re-allocated among the remaining products.

   If we use the fruit basket as an example, we can look at
the individual fruits that make up the basket: apples, oranges,
bananas, and pears. We see that each individual fruit has a
selling price and a cost. Each fruit has its own contribution
margin. But how would we determine the contribution margin
for a composite of fruit, or in other words, for our basket of
f ruit?

   For our particular baskets, we will use 5 apples, 3 oranges, 2
bananas, and 1 pear. This means that our product mix is 5:3:2:1,
as shown in Figure 7.49.

Figure 7.49 Contribution Margin Based on Product Mix By: Rice
University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long Description

Notice that the composite contribution margin is based on the
number of units of each item that is included in the composite
item. If we change the composition of the basket, then the
composite contribution margin would change even though
contribution margin of the individual items would not change.

                                         7.5 Multi-product Breakeven Analysis | 785
For example, if we only include 4 apples, the contribution
margin of a single apple is still $0.35, but the contribution
margin of the apples in the basket is $1.40, not $1.75 as it is
when 5 apples are included in the basket. Let's look at an
additional example and see how we find the break-even point
for a composite good.

   We will consider West Brothers for an example of a multi-
product break-even analysis. West Brothers manufactures and
sells 3 types of house siding: restoration vinyl, architectural
vinyl, and builder grade vinyl, each with its own sales price,
variable cost, and contribution margin, as shown:

Figure 7.50 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

The sales mix for West Brothers is 5 ft2 of builder grade to 3
ft2 of architectural grade to 2 ft2 of restoration grade vinyl (a
ratio of 5:3:2). This sales mix represents one composite unit, and
the selling price of one composite unit is:

West Brothers' fixed costs are $145,000 per year, and the
variable costs for one composite unit are:

Figure 7.52 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

We will calculate the contribution margin of a composite unit
for West Brothers using the same formula as before:

Figure 7.53 By: Rice University Source: Openstax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Applying the formula, we determine that $73 - $42.25 = 30.75.
We then use the contribution margin per composite unit to
determine West Brothers' break-even point:
West Brothers will break even when it sells 4,715.45 (or 4,716
since it can't sell a partial unit) composite units. To determine
how many of each product West Brothers needs to sell, we
apply their sales mix ratio (5:3:2) to the break-even quantity as
follows:

Using a forecasted or estimated contribution margin income
statement, we can verify that the quantities listed will place
West Brothers at break-even.

West Brothers can use this CVP analysis for a wide range of
business decisions and for planning purposes. Remember,
however, that if the sales mix changes from its current ratio,
then the break-even point will change. For planning purposes,
West Brothers can change the sales mix, sales price, or variable
cost of one or more of the products in the composite unit and
perform a "what-if" analysis.

9.1 Traditional
Overhead Allocation

Barry thinks of his education as a job and spends forty hours a
week in class or studying. Barry estimates he has about eighty
hours per week to allocate between school and other activities
and believes everyone should follow his fifty-fifty rule of time
allocation. His roommate, Kamil, disagrees with Barry and
argues that allocating 50 percent of one's time to class and
studying is not a great formula because everyone has different
activities and responsibilities. Kamil points out, for example,
that he has a job tutoring other students, is involved with
student activities, and plays in a band, while Barry spends
some of his nonstudy time doing volunteer work and working
out.

   Kamil plans each week based on how many hours he will
need for each activity: classes, studying and coursework,
tutoring, and practicing and performing with his band. In
essence, he considers the details of each week's needs to
budget his time. Kamil explains to Barry that being aware of
the activities that consume his limited resources (time, in this
example) helps him to better plan his week. He adds that
individuals who have activities with lots of time commitments
(class, work, study, exercise, family, friends, and so on) must
be efficient with their time or they risk doing poorly in one
or more areas. Kamil argues these individuals cannot simply
assign a percentage of their time to each activity but should
use each specific activity as the basis for allocating their time.
Barry insists that assigning a set percentage to everything is
easy and the better method. Who is correct?

Both roommates make valid points about allocating limited

796 | 9.1 Traditional Overhead Allocation
resources. Ultimately, each must decide which method to use
to allocate time, and they can make that decision based on
their own analyses. Similarly, businesses and other
organizations must create an allocation system for assigning
limited resources, such as overhead. Whereas Kamil and Barry
are discussing the allocation of hours, the issue of allocating
costs raises similar questions. For example, for a manufacturer
allocating maintenance costs, which are an overhead cost, is
it better to allocate to each production department equally by
the number of machines that need to be maintained or by the
square footage of space that needs to be maintained?

   In the past, overhead costs were typically allocated based on
factors such as total direct labor hours, total direct labor costs,
or total machine hours. This allocation process, often called
the traditional allocation method, works most effectively when
direct labor is a dominant component in production. However,
many industries have evolved, primarily due to changes in
technology, and their production processes have become more
complicated, with more steps or components. Many of these
industries have significantly reduced their use of direct labor
and replaced it with technology, such as robotics or other
machinery. For example, a mobile phone production facility in
China replaced 90 percent of its workforce with robots.1

   In these situations, a direct cost (labor) has been replaced by
an overhead cost (e.g., depreciation on equipment). Because of
this decrease in reliance on labor and/or changes in the types
of production complexity and methods, the traditional method
of overhead allocation becomes less effective in certain
production environments. To account for these changes in
technology and production, many organizations today have
adopted an overhead allocation method known as activity-
based costing (ABC). This chapter will explain the transition to
ABC and provide a foundation in its mechanics.

   Activity-based costing is an accounting method that
recognizes the relationship between product costs and a

                                             9.1 Traditional Overhead Allocation | 797
production activity, such as the number of hours of
engineering or design activity, the costs of the set up or
preparation for the production of different products, or the
costs of packaging different products after the production
process is completed. Overhead costs are then allocated to
production according to the use of that activity, such as the
number of machine setups needed. In contrast, the traditional
allocation method commonly uses cost drivers, such as direct
labor or machine hours, as the single activity.

   Because of the use of multiple activities as cost drivers, ABC
costing has advantages over the traditional allocation method,
which assigns overhead using a single predetermined
overhead rate. Those advantages come at a cost, both in
resources and time, since additional information needs to be
collected and analyzed. Chrysler, for instance, shifted its
overhead allocation to ABC in 1991 and estimates that the
benefits of cost savings, product improvement, and
elimination of inefficiencies have been ten to twenty times
greater than the investment in the program at some sites. It
believes other sites experienced savings of fifty to one hundred
times the cost to implement the system.2

   As you've learned, understanding the cost needed to
manufacture a product is critical to making many
management decisions (Figure 9.1). Knowing the total and
component costs of the product is necessary for price setting
and for measuring the efficiency and effectiveness of the
organization. Remember that product costs consist of direct
materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. It is
relatively simple to understand each product's direct material
and direct labor cost, but it is more complicated to determine
the overhead component of each product's costs because
there are a number of indirect and other costs to consider.
A company's manufacturing overhead costs are all costs other
than direct material, direct labor, or selling and administrative
costs. Once a company has determined the overhead, it must

798 | 9.1 Traditional Overhead Allocation
establish how to allocate the cost. This allocation can come
in the form of the traditional overhead allocation method or
activity-based costing..

product is based on direct labor, direct material, and factory
overhead costs. By: Rice University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Component Categories under Traditional
Allocation

Traditional allocation involves the allocation of factory
overhead to products based on the volume of production
resources consumed, such as the amount of direct labor hours
consumed, direct labor cost, or machine hours used. In order
to perform the traditional method, it is also important to

                                             9.1 Traditional Overhead Allocation | 799
understand each of the involved cost components: direct
materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. Direct
materials and direct labor are cost categories that are relatively
easy to trace to a product. Direct material comprises the
supplies used in manufacturing that can be traced directly to
the product. Direct labor is the work used in manufacturing
that can be directly traced to the product. Although the
processes for tracing the costs differ, both job order costing
and process costing trace the material and labor through
materials requisition requests and time cards or electronic
mechanisms for measuring labor input. Job order costing
traces the costs directly to the product, and process costing
traces the costs to the manufacturing department.

Estimated Total Manufacturing Overhead
Costs

The more challenging product component to track is
manufacturing overhead. Overhead consists of indirect
materials, indirect labor, and other costs closely associated with
the manufacturing process but not tied to a specific product.
Examples of other overhead costs include such items as
depreciation on the factory machinery and insurance on the
factory building. Indirect material comprises the supplies used
in production that cannot be traced to an individual product,
and indirect labor is the work done by employees not directly
involved in the manufacturing process, such as the supervisors'
salaries or the maintenance staff's wages. Because these costs
cannot be traced directly to the product like direct costs are,
they have to be allocated among all of the products produced
and added, or applied, to the production and product cost.

   For example, the recipe for shea butter has easily identifiable
quantities of shea nuts and other ingredients. Based on the

800 | 9.1 Traditional Overhead Allocation
manufacturing process, it is also easy to determine the direct
labor cost. But determining the exact overhead costs is not
easy, as the cost of electricity needed to dry, crush, and roast
the nuts changes depending on the moisture content of the
nuts upon arrival.

   Until now, you have learned to apply overhead to production
based on a predetermined overhead rate typically using an
activity base. An activity base is considered to be a primary
driver of overhead costs, and traditionally, direct labor hours
or machine hours were used for it. For example, a production
facility that is fairly labor intensive would likely determine that
the more labor hours worked, the higher the overhead will be.
As a result, management would likely view labor hours as the
activity base when applying overhead costs.

   A predetermined overhead rate is calculated at the start of
the accounting period by dividing the estimated
manufacturing overhead by the estimated activity base. The
predetermined overhead rate is then applied to production
to facilitate determining a standard cost for a product. This
estimated overhead rate will allow a company to determine a
cost for the product without having to wait, possibly several
months, until all of the actual overhead costs are determined,
and to help with issues such as seasonal production or variable
overhead costs, such as utilities.

Calculation of Predetermined Overhead
and Total Cost under Traditional Allocation

The predetermined overhead rate is set at the beginning of the
year and is calculated as the estimated (budgeted) overhead
costs for the year divided by the estimated (budgeted) level
of activity for the year. This activity base is often direct labor
hours, direct labor costs, or machine hours. Once a company

                                             9.1 Traditional Overhead Allocation | 801
determines the overhead rate, it determines the overhead rate
per unit and adds the overhead per unit cost to the direct
material and direct labor costs for the product to find the total
cost.

To put this method into context, consider this example.
Musicality Manufacturing developed a recording device similar
to a microphone that allows musicians and music aficionados
to record their playing or singing along with any song publicly
available. There are three products that vary in features and
ability: Solo, Band, and Orchestra. Musicality was started by
musicians who majored in math and software engineering
while in college. Their main concern was building a quality
manufacturing plant, so they used the simpler traditional
allocation method. They started by determining their direct
costs, which are shown in Figure 9.3.

Figure 9.3 Material and Labor Costs for Musicality By: Rice University

Musicality determines the overhead rate based on direct labor
hours. At the beginning of the year, the company estimates
total overhead costs to be $2,500,000 and total direct labor
hours to be 1,250,000. The predetermined overhead rate is

802 | 9.1 Traditional Overhead Allocation
Musicality uses this information to determine the cost of each
product. For example, the total direct labor hours estimated for
the solo product is 350,000 direct labor hours. With $2.00 of
overhead per direct hour, the Solo product is estimated to have
$700,000 of overhead applied. When the $700,000 of overhead
applied is divided by the estimated production of 140,000 units
of the Solo product, the estimated overhead per product for
the Solo product is $5.00 per unit. The computation of the
overhead cost per unit for all of the products is shown in Figure
9.4.

Sales of each product have been strong, and the total gross

product as an example, 150,000 units are sold at a price of $20
per unit resulting in sales of $3,000,000. The cost of goods sold
consists of direct materials of $3.50 per unit, direct labor of $10
per unit, and manufacturing overhead of $5.00 per unit. With
150,000 units, the direct material cost is $525,000; the direct
labor cost is $1,500,000; and the manufacturing overhead
applied is $750,000 for a total Cost of Goods Sold of $2,775,000.

9.2 Cost Drivers

As you've learned, the most common bases for predetermined
overhead are direct labor hours, direct labor dollars, or machine
hours. Each of these costs is considered a cost driver because
of the causal relationship between the base and the related
costs: As the cost driver's usage increases, the cost of overhead
increases as well. Table 9.1 shows various costs and potential
cost drivers.

      Drivers By: Rice University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

   Expense

The more accurately a company can determine the cost drivers
for its products, the more accurate the costing information
will be, which in turn allows management to make better use
of the cost data in making decisions. As technology changes,
however, the mix between materials, labor, and overhead
changes. Often, improved technology means less waste of
material and fewer direct labor hours, but possibly more
overhead. For example, technology has changed the way
pharmaceuticals are manufactured. Advancing technology
allows for the now smaller labor force to be more productive
than a larger labor force from earlier years. While the labor cost
has changed, this decrease may only be temporary as a labor

806 | 9.2 Cost Drivers
force with higher costs and different skills is often needed.
Additionally, an increase in technology often raises overhead
costs. How accurate, then, is the company's product cost
information if it has become more efficient in its production
process? Should the company still be using a predetermined
overhead application rate based on direct labor hours or
machine hours? A detailed analysis of the cost drivers will
answer these questions.

   Another benefit of looking at cost drivers is that doing so
allows a company to analyze all costs. A company can
differentiate among costs that drive overhead and have value,
those that do not drive overhead but still add value, and those
that may or may not drive the overhead but do not add any
value. For example, a furniture manufacturer produces and
sells wooden tables in various colors. The painting process
involves a white base coat, a color coat, and a clear protective
top coat. The three coats are applied in a sealed room using
a spraying process followed by an ultraviolet drying process.
The depreciation on the spraying machines and the ultraviolet
bulbs used in the painting process are overhead costs. These
costs drive or increase overhead, and they add value to the
product by increasing the quality. Costs associated with
repainting or fixing any blemishes are overhead costs that are
necessary to sell the product but would not be considered
value-added costs. The goal is to eliminate as many of the
non-value-added costs as possible and subsequently reduce
overhead costs.

Cost Drivers and Overhead

In today's production environment, there are many activities
within the production process that can contribute to the cost
of the product, but determining the cost drivers may be
complicated because some of those activities may change over

                                                                          9.2 Cost Drivers | 807
time. Additionally, the appropriate level of assigning cost
drivers needs to be determined. In some cases, overhead costs
such as inspection increase with each unit inspected, and the
costs need to be allocated on a per-unit level. In other cases,
the overhead costs, such as machine setup costs, are incurred
each time a batch of products is manufactured and need to be
allocated at the batch level.

   For example, the labor hours for the staff taking, fulfilling,
and inspecting orders may increase as the number of orders
increases, driving up the overhead. Furthermore, the costs of
taking orders or of quality inspections can vary per product
and may not be captured properly. Technology improvements,
including switching to automated processes for production,
may decrease the labor hours of the production staff, driving
the labor-related overhead downward but potentially
increasing other overhead expenses. These activities--order
taking, fulfillment, and quality inspections--are potential cost
drivers associated with production, and they each drive the
overhead at varying rates.

Identify Cost Drivers

How does a company determine its cost drivers for indirect
materials, indirect labor, and other overhead costs? To begin
the determination of appropriate cost drivers, an accountant
analyzes the activities in the product production process that
contribute to the cost of that product. An activity is any action
that consumes company resources, such as taking orders for
a product, setting up machines to produce the product,
inspecting the product, and providing customer support
before and through the order process. For example, Musicality's
direct costs can be traced to the products, but there are
indirect costs associated with using various types of material
for each product. While the Orchestra product has more

808 | 9.2 Cost Drivers
intricate materials and labor, it has fewer costs associated with
requisitioning and conveying materials to the production line
than the other products have. Additionally, examining the
inspection costs indicates the Orchestra product is a simple
product to inspect, so random quality inspections are
sufficient. But individual inspections for both the Solo and
Band products are critical, and the overhead related to
inspection costs should be based on the number of
inspections.

   As you can imagine, the unique aspects of the production
process for each product affect the overhead cost of each
product. However, these costs may not be allocated to the
products appropriately when overhead is applied using a
predetermined rate based on one activity. While Solo, Band,
and Orchestra might appear to be different only in quality, they
are actually very different from each other when it comes to
manufacturing overhead costs.

   Whether the products produced require significantly
different overhead resources or not, the company benefits
from understanding what its cost drivers are. The more
efficiently each product's activities are tracked, the more actual
cost drivers are discovered, and the more accurately overhead
can be assigned to each product.

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

Cost Drivers for Small Businesses

The value of analyzing cost drivers can be used in budgeting
beyond allocating overhead to products. American
Express has forums designed to help small businesses be
successful. Knowing the cost drivers for your business can help

                                                                          9.2 Cost Drivers | 809
with budgeting. American Express states that all business
activities are related to five main cost drivers:3

   Employee head count is often the driver for office supply
      expense.

   Salesperson head count is often the driver for auto and
      other employee travel expense.

   The number of leads required to reach the target sales
      goal is often the driver for advertising, public relations,
      social media, search engine optimization expense, and
      other expenses associated with generating leads.

   Sales and all related variable expenses are often the driver
      for commissions, bad debt, insurance expense, and so on.

   Fixed costs, such as postage, web hosting fees, business
      licenses, and banking fees, are often overlooked as cost
      drivers.

9.3 Activity-based
Costing

As technology changes the ratio between direct labor and
overhead, more overhead costs are linked to drivers other than
direct labor and machine hours. This shift in costs gives
companies the opportunity to stop using the traditional single
predetermined overhead rate applied to all units of production
and instead use an overhead allocation approach based on
the actual activities that drive overhead. Making this change
allows management to obtain more accurate product cost
information, which leads to more informed decisions. Activity-
based costing (ABC) is the process that assigns overhead to
products based on the various activities that drive overhead
costs.

Historical Perspective on Determination of
Manufacturing Overhead Allocation

All products consist of material, labor, and overhead, and the
major cost components have historically been materials and
labor. Manufacturing overhead was not a large cost of the
product, so an overhead allocation method based on labor or
machine hours was logical. For example, as shown in Figure
9.3, Musicality determined the direct costs and direct labor for
their three products: Solo, Band, and Orchestra. Under the
traditional method of costing, the predetermined overhead
rate of $2 per direct labor hour was computed by dividing the
estimated overhead by the estimated direct labor hours. Based
on the number of direct labor hours and the number of units

                                                           9.3 Activity-based Costing | 811
produced for each product, the overhead per product is shown
in Figure 9.4.

   As technology costs decreased and production methods
became more efficient, overhead costs changed and became
a much larger component of product costs. For many
companies, and in many cases, overhead costs are now
significantly larger than labor costs. For example, in the last
few years, many industries have increased technology, and the
amount of overhead has doubled.4 Technology has changed
the manufacturing labor force, and therefore, the type and cost
of labor associated with those jobs have changed. In addition,
technology has made it easier to track the various activities and
their related overhead costs.

Figure 9.8 By: Rice University OpenStax CC BY NC SA 4.0 Long
Description

Costs can be gathered on a unit level, batch level, product level,
or factory level. The idea behind these various levels is that at
each level, there are additional costs that are encountered, so a
company must decide at which level or levels it is best for the
company to accumulate costs. A unit-level cost is incurred each
time a unit of product is produced and includes costs such as
materials and labor. A batch-level cost is incurred every time a
batch of items is manufactured, for example, costs associated
with purchasing and receiving materials. A product-level cost is
incurred each time a product is produced and includes costs
such as engineering costs, testing costs, or quality control
costs. A factory-level cost is incurred because products are
being produced and includes costs such as the plant
supervisor's salary and rent on the factory building. By

812 | 9.3 Activity-based Costing
definition, indirect labor is not traced to individual products.
However, it is possible to track some indirect labor to several
jobs or batches. A similar amount of information can be derived
for indirect material. An example of an indirect material in
some manufacturing processes is cleaning solution. For
example, one type of cleaning solution is used in the
manufacturing of pop sockets. It is not practical to measure
every ounce of cleaning solution used in the manufacture of
an individual pop socket; rather, it makes sense to allocate to a
particular batch of pop sockets the cost of the cleaning solution
needed to make that batch. Likewise, a manufacturer of frozen
french fries uses a different type of solution to clean potatoes
prior to making the french fries and would allocate the cost of
the solution based on how much is used to make each batch of
f ries.

Establishing an Activity-Based Costing
System

ABC is a five-stage process that allocates overhead more
precisely than traditional allocation does by applying it to the
products that use those activities. ABC works best in complex
processes where the expenses are not driven by a single cost
driver. Instead, several cost drivers are used as the overhead
costs are analyzed and grouped into activities, and each activity
is allocated based on each group's cost driver. The five stages
of the ABC process are:

 1. Identify the activities performed in the organization
2. Determine activity cost pools
 3. Calculate activity rates for each cost pool
4. Allocate activity rates to products (or services)
 5. Calculate unit product costs

                                                           9.3 Activity-based Costing | 813
The first step is to identify activities needed for production.
An activity is an action or process involved in the production
of inventory. There can be many activities that consume
resources, and management will need to narrow down the
activities to those that have the biggest impact on overhead
costs. Examples of these activities include:

   Taking orders
   Setting up machines
   Purchasing material
   Assembling products
   Inspecting products
   Providing customer service
The second step is assigning overhead costs to the identified
activities. In this step, overhead costs are assigned to each of
the activities to become a cost pool. A cost pool is a list of costs
incurred when related activities are performed. Table
9.2 illustrates the various cost pools along with their activities
and related costs.

                Costs to operate the machine: utilities,

                  insurance, etc.

products        Cost of label machine
                Cost of labels

Technological   Website maintenance

For example, the production cost pool consists of costs such
as indirect labor for those accepting the order, verifying the
customer has credit to pay for the order, maintenance and
depreciation on the machines used to produce the orders, and
utilities and rent for operating the machines. Figure
9.1 illustrates how the costs in each pool are allocated to each
product in a different proportion.

                                                           9.3 Activity-based Costing | 815
Figure 9.1 Allocating Overhead by Cost Pool By: Rice University
OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Once the costs are grouped into similar cost pools, the
activities in each pool are analyzed to determine which activity
"drives" the costs in that pool, leading to the third step of ABC:
identify the cost driver for each cost pool and estimate an
annual level of activity for each cost driver. As you've learned,
the cost driver is the specific activity that drives the costs in the
cost pools. Table 9.3 shows some activities and cost drivers for
those activities.

Table 9.3 Activities and Their Common Cost Drivers By:
         Rice University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Customer order    Number of orders

Production        Machine setups

Purchasing materials Purchase requisitions

Assembling products Direct labor hours

Inspecting products Inspection hours

Customer service  Number of contacts with customer

The fourth step is to compute the predetermined overhead
rate for each of the cost drivers. This portion of the process
is similar to finding the traditional predetermined overhead
rate, where the overhead rate is divided by direct labor dollars,
direct labor hours, or machine hours. Each cost driver will have
its own overhead rate, which is why ABC is a more accurate
method of allocating overhead.

   Finally, step five is to allocate the overhead costs to each
product. The predetermined overhead rate found in step four
is applied to the actual level of the cost driver used by each
product. As with the traditional overhead allocation method,
the actual overhead costs are accumulated in an account
called manufacturing overhead and then applied to each of the
products in this step.

   Notice that steps one through three represent the process
of allocating overhead costs to activities, and steps four and
five represent the process of allocating the overhead costs that
have been assigned to activities to the products to which they
pertain. Thus, the five steps of ABC involve two major
processes: first, allocating overhead costs to the various
activities to get a cost per activity, and then allocating the cost
per activity to each product based on that product's usage of
the activities.

   Now that the steps involved have been detailed, let's
demonstrate the calculations using the Musicality example.

YOUR TURN

Comparing Estimates to Actual Costs

A company has determined that its estimated 500,000
machine hours is the optimal driver for its estimated
$1,000,000 machine overhead cost pool. The $750,000 in the
material overhead cost pool should be allocated using the
estimated 15,000 material requisition requests. How much is
over- or underapplied if there were actually 490,000 machine
hours and 15,500 material requisitions that resulted in $950,000
in the machine overhead cost pool, and $780,000 in the
material cost pool? What does this difference indicate?

   Solution
   The predetermined overhead rate is $2 per machine hour
($1,000,000  500,000 machine hours) and $50 per material
requisition ($750,000  15,000 requisitions). The actual and
applied overhead can then be calculated to determine whether
it is over- or underapplied:

Figure 9.9 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA Long Description

The difference is a combination of factors. There were fewer
machine hours than estimated, but there was also less

818 | 9.3 Activity-based Costing
overhead than estimated. There were more requisitions than
estimated, and there was also more overhead.

The Calculation of Product
Costs Using the
Activity-Based Costing
Allocation Method

Musicality is considering switching to an activity-based costing
approach for determining overhead and has collected data to
help them decide which overhead allocation method they
should use. Performing the analysis requires these steps:

 1. Identify cost pools necessary to complete the product.
      Musicality determined its cost pools are:
         Setting up machines
         Purchasing material
         Inspecting products
         Assembling products
         Technological production

2. Assign overhead cost to the cost pools. Musicality has
      estimated the overhead for each cost pool to be:

                                                           9.3 Activity-based Costing | 819
      Figure 9.10 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA

 3. Identify the cost driver for each activity, and estimate an
      annual activity for each driver. Musicality determined the
      driver and estimated activity for each product to be the
      following:

      Figure 9.11 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA Long
      Description

4. Compute the predetermined overhead for each cost
      driver. Musicality determined this predetermined
      overhead rate for each driver:

820 | 9.3 Activity-based Costing
      Figure 9.12 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA Long
      Description

 5. Allocate overhead costs to products. Assuming Musicality's
      activities were as estimated, the amount allocated to each
      product is:

      Figure 9.13 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA Long
      Description

Now that Musicality has applied overhead to each product,
they can calculate the cost per unit. Management can review
its sales price and make necessary decisions regarding its
products. The overhead cost per unit is the overhead for each
product divided by the number of units of each product:

Figure 9.14 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA

                                                           9.3 Activity-based Costing | 821
The overhead per unit can be added to the unit cost for direct
material and direct labor to compute the total product cost per
unit:

Figure 9.15 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA

The sales price was set after management reviewed the
product cost with traditional allocation along with other factors
such as competition and product demand. The current sales
price, cost of each product using ABC, and the resulting gross
profit are shown in Figure 9.16.

Figure 9.16 Solo's Sales Price, ABC Costing, and Gross Profit By: Rice
University Openstax CC BY NC SA

The loss on each sale of the Solo product was not discovered
until the company did the calculations for the ABC method,
because the sales of the other products were strong enough
for the company to retain a total gross profit.

   Additionally, the more accurate gross profit for each product
calculated using ABC is shown in Figure 9.17:

822 | 9.3 Activity-based Costing
Figure 9.17 Solo's Gross Profit by Product By: Rice University
Openstax CC BY NC SA Long Description

The calculations Musicality did in order to switch to ABC
revealed that the Solo product was generating a loss for every
unit sold. Knowing this information will allow Musicality to
consider whether they should make changes to generate a
profit from the Solo product, such as increase the selling price
or carefully analyze the costs to identify potential cost
reductions. Musicality could also decide to continue selling
Solo at a loss, because the other products are generating
enough profit for the company to absorb the Solo product
loss and still be profitable. Why would a company continue
to sell a product that is generating a loss? Sometimes these
products are ones for which the company is well known or
that draw customers into the store. For example, companies
will sometimes offer extreme sales, such as on Black Friday, to
attract customers in the hope that the customers will purchase
other products. This information shows how valuable ABC can
be in many situations for providing a more accurate picture
than traditional allocation.

The Service Industries and Their Use of the
Activity-Based Costing Allocation Method

ABC costing was developed to help management understand
manufacturing costs and how they can be better managed.

                                                          9.3 Activity-based Costing | 823
However, the service industry can apply the same principles
to improve its cost management. Direct material and direct
labor costs range from nonexistent to minimal in the service
industry, which makes the overhead application even more
important. The number and types of cost pools may be
completely different in the service industry as compared to the
manufacturing industry. For example, the health-care industry
may have different overhead costs and cost drivers for the
treatment of illnesses than they have for injuries. Some of the
overhead related to monitoring a patient's health status may
overlap, but most of the overhead related to diagnosis and
treatment differ from each other.

9.4 Comparing
Traditional &
Activity-based Costing

Calculating an accurate manufacturing cost for each product
is a vital piece of information for a company's decision-making.
For example, knowing the cost to produce a unit of product
affects not only how a business budgets to manufacture that
product, but it is often the starting point in determining the
sales price.

   An important component in determining the total
production costs of a product or job is the proper allocation
of overhead. For some companies, the often less-complicated
traditional method does an excellent job of allocating
overhead. However, for many products, the allocation of
overhead is a more complex issue, and an activity-based
costing (ABC) system is more appropriate.

   Another factor to consider in determining which of the two
major overhead allocation methods to use is the cost
associated with collecting and analyzing information. When
making their decision regarding which method to use, the
company must consider these costs, both in time and
money. Table 9.4 compares overhead in the two systems. In
many cases, the ABC method is more expensive in terms of
time and other costs.

   The difference between the traditional method (using one
cost driver) and the ABC method (using multiple cost drivers)
is more complex than simply the number of cost drivers. When
direct labor is a large portion of the product cost, the overhead
costs tend to be consistently driven by one cost driver, which is
typically direct labor or machine hours; the traditional method

826 | 9.4 Comparing Traditional & Activity-based Costing
appropriately allocates those costs. When technology is a large
portion of the product cost, the overhead costs tend to be
driven by multiple drivers, so using multiple cost drivers in the
ABC method allows for a more precise allocation of overhead.

As shown with Musicality's products, not only are there
different costs for each product when comparing traditional
allocation with an activity-based costing, but ABC showed that
the Solo product creates a loss for the company. Activity-based
costing is a more accurate method, because it assigns
overhead based on the activities that drive the overhead costs.
It can be concluded, then, that the cost and subsequent gross
loss for each unit's sales provide a more accurate picture than
the overall cost and gross profit under the traditional
method. Table 9.4 compares the cost per unit using the
different cost systems and shows how different the costs can
be depending on the method used.

Advantages and Disadvantages of the

                    9.4 Comparing Traditional & Activity-based Costing | 827
Traditional Method of Calculating
Overhead

The traditional allocation system assigns manufacturing
overhead based on a single cost driver, such as direct labor
hours, direct labor dollars, or machine hours, and is optimal
when there is a relationship between the activity base and
overhead. This most often occurs when direct labor is a large
part of the product cost. The theory supporting the single cost
driver is that the cost driver selected increases as overhead
increases, and further analysis is more costly than it is valuable.
Each method has its advantages and disadvantages. These are
advantages of the traditional method:

   All manufacturing costs are classified as material, labor, or
      overhead and assigned to products regardless of whether
      they drive or are driven by production.

   All manufacturing costs are considered to be part of the
      product cost, whereas nonmanufacturing costs are not
      considered to be production costs and are not assigned to
      products, regardless of whether the costs are based on the
      products. For example, the machines used to receive and
      process customer orders are necessary because product
      orders must be taken, but their costs are not allocated to
      particular products.

   There is only one overhead cost pool and a single measure
      of activity, such as direct labor hours, which makes the
      traditional method simple and less costly to maintain. The
      predetermined overhead rate is based on estimated costs
      at the budgeted level of activity. Therefore, the overhead
      rate is consistent across products, but overhead may be
      over- or underapplied.

Disadvantages of the traditional method include:

828 | 9.4 Comparing Traditional & Activity-based Costing
   The use of the single cost driver does not allocate
      overhead as accurately as using multiple cost drivers.

   The use of the single cost driver may overallocate
      overhead to one product and underallocate overhead to
      another product, resulting in erroneous total costs and
      potentially setting an incorrect sales price.

   Traditional allocation assigns costs as period or product
      costs, and all product costs are included in the cost of
      inventory, which makes this method acceptable for
      generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

Advantages and Disadvantages of
Creating an Activity-Based Costing
System for Allocating Overhead

While ABC systems more accurately allocate the costs based
on the various resources used to make the product, they cost
more to use and, therefore, are not always the best method.
Management needs to consider each system and how it will
work within its own organization. Some advantages of activity-
based costing include:

   There are multiple overhead cost pools, and each has its
      own unique measure of activity. This provides more
      accurate rates for applying overhead, but it takes more
      time to implement and results in a higher cost.

   The allocation bases (i.e., measures of activity) often differ
      from those used in traditional allocation. Multiple cost
      pools allow management to group costs being influenced
      by similar drivers and to consider cost drivers beyond the
      typical labor or machine hour. This results in a more
      accurate overhead application rate.

   The activity rates may consider the level of activity at

                    9.4 Comparing Traditional & Activity-based Costing | 829
      capacity instead of the budgeted level of activity.
   Both nonmanufacturing costs and manufacturing costs

      may be assigned to products. The main rationale in
      assigning costs is the relationship between the cost and
      the product. If the cost increases as the volume of the
      product increases, it is considered part of overhead.

There are disadvantages to using ABC costing that
management needs to consider when determining which
method to use. Those disadvantages include:

   Some manufacturing costs may be excluded from
      product costs. For example, the cost to heat the factory
      may be excluded as a product cost because, while it is
      necessary for production, it does not fit into one of the
      activity-driven cost pools.

   It is more expensive, as there is a cost to collect and
      analyze cost driver information as well as to allocate
      overhead on the basis of multiple cost drivers.

   An ABC system takes much more to implement and
      operate, as information on cost drivers must be collected
      in an objective manner.

The advantages and disadvantages of both methods are as
previously listed, but what is the practical impact on the
product cost? There are several items to consider at the
product costs level:

   Adopting an ABC overhead allocation system can allow a
      company to shift manufacturing overhead costs between
      products based on their volume.

   Using an ABC method to better assign unit-level, batch-
      level, product-level, and factory-level costs can increase
      the per-unit costs of the low-volume products and
      decrease the per-unit costs of the high-volume products.

830 | 9.4 Comparing Traditional & Activity-based Costing
 The effects are not symmetrical; there is usually a larger
   change in the per-unit costs of the low-volume products.

 The cost of the products may include some period costs
   but not some of the product costs, so it is not considered
   GAAP compliant. The information is supplemental and
   very helpful to management, but the company still needs
   to compute the product's cost under the traditional
   method for financial reporting.

Costing

Job Order Costing versus Process Costing

Job order costing is an accounting system that traces the
individual costs directly to a final job or service, instead of to
the production department. It is used when goods are made
to order or when individual costs are easy to trace to individual
jobs, assuming that the additional information provides value.
In these circumstances, the individual costs are easy to trace to
the individual jobs.

                    One or more interactive elements has been
                    excluded from this version of the text. You can
        view them online here: https://psu.pb.unizin.org/
        acctg211/?p=1371#oembed-1

For example, assume that a homeowner wants to have a
custom deck added to her home. Also assume that in order
to fit her lot's topography and her anticipated uses for the
addition, she needs a uniquely designed deck. Her contractor
will design the deck, price the necessary components (in this
case, the direct materials, direct labor, and overhead), and
construct it.

   The final cost will be unique to this project. If another
homeowner wanted the contractor to construct a deck, the
contractor would go through the same design and pricing

836 | 8.1 Job Order v. Process Costing
process, and you would expect that the design and costs would

not be the same as those of the deck in the first example, since

the decks would differ from one another.

The job order costing method also works well for companies

such as movie production companies, print service providers,

advertising agencies, building contractors, accounting firms,

consulting entities, and repair service providers. For

example, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is believed to have cost $200

million to produce, whereas Logan only cost $97 million. The

production processes for both films differed significantly, so

that the accumulated costs for each job also differed
significantly. Both were made in 2017.1

In contrast, process costing is used when the manufacturing

process is continuous, so it is difficult to establish how much of

each material is used and exactly how much time is invested

in each unit of finished product. Therefore, in process costing,

costs are accounted for by the production process or

production department instead of by the product or by the job.

This method works well for manufacturers of products such

as Titleist golf  balls, Kellogg's cereal, Turkey  Hill ice

cream, CITGO gasoline, Dow Chemicals, or Sherwin Williams'

paints. However, process costing is not limited to basic

manufacturing activities: It can also be used in the

manufacturing of more complex items, such as small engines.

A process costing system assigns costs to each department

as the costs are incurred, and the costs to produce one unit

are calculated based on the information from the production

department. Unit costs are determined after total production

costs are determined.

One factor that can complicate the choice between job order

costing and process costing is the growth of automation in

the production process, which typically is accompanied by a

reduction in direct labor. The cost of the increase in equipment

(typically reflected as a depreciation expense) is allocated to

overhead, while the decreased need for labor usually reduces

                       8.1 Job Order v. Process Costing | 837
the direct labor cost. Because of these issues, some companies
choose a hybrid system, using process costing to account for
mass producing a part and using job order costing to account
for assembling some of those individual parts into a custom
product. Table 8.1 summarizes the use of these two systems.

To illustrate how a company can determine whether to use job
order costing or process costing, consider the cost accounting
options for a local restaurant. Macs & Cheese makes specialty
macaroni and cheese, and the company wants to erect a
special sign on an already constructed billboard outside a
stadium. It wants to use this space to target stadium
customers; thus, the company wants a sign built specifically for
that site. Dinosaur Vinyl is secured as the sign manufacturer
and would use job order costing to account for the associated
manufacturing costs because of the unique nature of the sign,
including the art work involved. However, if Macs & Cheese was
designing a costing system for the specialty food product they
market, they typically would use a process costing approach
because their product is made and marketed in homogeneous,
similar batches.

Organization of Flow of Goods through
Production

Regardless of the costing method used (job order costing,
process costing, or another method), manufacturing
companies are generally similar in their organizational
structure and have a similar flow of goods through production.
The diagram in Figure 8.1 shows a partial organizational chart
for sign manufacturer Dinosaur Vinyl. The CEO has several
direct reporting units--Financing, Production, Information
Technology, Marketing, Human Resources, and
Maintenance--each with a director responsible for several
departments.

Figure 8.1 Organizational Chart for a Manufacturing Company. The
different units within Dinosaur Vinyl illustrate the two main cost
categories of a manufacturing company: manufacturing costs (the
production unit), and selling and administrative costs. By: Rice

The diagram also shows the departments that report to the
production unit director and gives an indication as to the flow
of goods through production. The flow of goods through
production is more evident in Figure 8.2, which depicts

                                                  8.1 Job Order v. Process Costing | 839
Dinosaur Vinyl as a simple factory with three stages of
production.

Figure 8.2 Factory Layout for Dinosaur Vinyl. The flow of goods and
areas of manufacturing versus administrative costs are more easily
seen by looking at the factory layout for Dinosaur Vinyl. The
departments across the bottom represent administrative costs,
whereas the departments in the middle represent manufacturing
costs--although Design/Engineering can sometimes be considered
part of administrative costs, depending on how management
chooses to categorize those costs. The departments listed across the
top represent examples of manufacturing overhead. By: Rice
University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long Description

Raw materials are stored in the materials storeroom and
delivered to the appropriate production department--cutting,
painting, or assembly/finishing. The design department uses
direct labor to create the design specifications, and, when
completed, it sends them to the production department. The
production department uses the material and design
specifications and adds additional labor to create the sign. The
sign is transferred to the finishing department for final
materials and labor, before the sign is installed or delivered to
the customer.

840 | 8.1 Job Order v. Process Costing
Manufacturing Costs

In a manufacturing environment, the manufacturing costs are
also called product costs and include all expenses used to
manufacture the product: direct materials, direct labor, and
manufacturing overhead. The total of these costs becomes the
cost of ending inventory and later becomes the cost of goods
sold when the product is sold. Both job order costing and
process costing use categorized cost information to make
decisions and evaluate the effectiveness of the cost tracking
process. Because of the difference in how each of the two
costing systems track costs, different terminology is used. Thus,
it is important to separate product costs from period costs, and
it is sometimes important to separate product costs into prime
costs and conversion costs. Prime costs are costs that include
the primary (or direct) product costs: direct materials and
direct labor. Conversion costs are costs that include the
expenses necessary to convert direct materials into a finished
product: direct labor and manufacturing overhead. Their
relationship is shown in Figure 8.3.

                                                  8.1 Job Order v. Process Costing | 841
Figure 8.3 Manufacturing Costs Management sometimes needs
additional information to make decisions and needs the costs
categorized as prime costs or conversion costs. Prime costs and
conversion costs are not included together as direct labor is included
in both categories. By: Rice University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Job order costing systems assign costs directly to the product
by assigning direct materials and direct labor to the work in
process (WIP) inventory. As you learned previously, direct
materials are the components that can be directly traced to the
products produced, whereas direct labor is the labor cost that
can be directly traced to the products produced.

   Material and labor costs that cannot be traced directly to
the product produced are included in the overhead costs that
are allocated in the production costing process. Overhead is
applied to each product based on an activity base, which will
be explained later in this chapter.

   The assignment of direct materials and direct labor to each
production unit illustrates the job order costing system's focus
on prime costs, in contrast to the process costing system,

842 | 8.1 Job Order v. Process Costing
which assigns costs to the department and focuses on direct
materials and conversion costs, which are composed of a
combination of direct labor and overhead.

Selling and Administrative Costs

Selling and administrative costs (S&A) are period costs, and
these costs are expensed as incurred, instead of being included
in the product's costs, as they move through the relevant
inventory accounts. A period cost is a cost tied to a specific
time period, such as a month, quarter, or year, instead of being
associated with a particular job order. For example, if a
company paid an insurance company $12,000 for one year's
liability insurance coverage, the first month's expense would
be $1,000. This expense would not be related to a particular
job order, but instead would be classified as a period cost, and
in this case recorded monthly as an administrative expense.
Selling costs are the expenses related to the promotion and
sale of the company's products, whereas administrative costs
are the expenses related to the operations of the company. The
S&A costs are considered period costs because they include
costs of departments not directly associated with
manufacturing but necessary to operate the business. Some
examples include research and development costs, marketing
costs, sales commissions, administration building rent, the
CEO's salary expense, and accounting, payroll, and IT
department expenses.

YOUR TURN

Maria's Market

A grocery store's analysis of a recent customer survey finds an
increasing number of customers interested in being able to
custom-order meals to go. Maria sees this as an opportunity
to enter a niche market for busy families or individuals who
want home-cooked meals with a variety of options and
combinations, but who have little time. Maria already has an
expansive deli, bakery, and prepared foods section in the store
and sees this opportunity as a viable option to increase sales
and its customer base. With meals to go, customers can choose
from an array of options and can indicate the quantity of each
item and the time of pickup. The customer simply pulls up in a
designated spot at Maria's and the food is brought to their car,
packaged, and ready to take home to enjoy.

   What type of costing system will work best for the Maria's
Market? What sales price information, cost information, and
other options are important to this decision?

   Solution
   A job order cost system will work well for this store. In
addition to specific price and cost, these are other important
considerations.

   The optimal sales price should be set to encourage
      customers to purchase the meals.

   The materials, labor, and overhead cost should be
      considered for each meal option.
         Direct material costs may include the cost of the
            protein, grain, and vegetable option, as well as the cost
            of the packing containers.
         The direct labor cost is for employees who are directly

844 | 8.1 Job Order v. Process Costing
            involved in preparing the meals.
         Manufacturing overhead includes the cost of gloves

            used when preparing the meals, the cost of
            employees who support but are not directly involved
            in preparing the meals, and the cost to operate the
            oven.
   The cost of the various meal options should all be less than
      the sales price.
   The meal options should change to take advantage of
      seasonal items.
   There may be a need to vary the sales price, depending on
      the combinations selected.

Recording Costs in Job Order
Costing versus Process
Costing

Both job order costing and process costing track the costs of
materials, labor, and overhead as components of virtually all
products. The process of production does not change because
of the costing method: The costing method is chosen based on
the process of production and is intended to provide the most
accurate representation of the costs incurred in the production
process.

   Maintaining accounting records for each system has its
advantages. A job order costing system uses a job cost sheet to
keep track of individual jobs and the direct materials, direct
labor, and overhead associated with each job. The focus of a
job order costing system is tracking costs per job, since each

                                                 8.1 Job Order v. Process Costing | 845
job is unique and therefore has different costs relative to other
jobs. Maintaining this information is typically more expensive
than process costing, and it is often used for the production
of smaller, more individualized jobs because the benefit of
knowing the cost of each product outweighs the additional
cost of maintaining a job order costing system.

   In contrast, a process costing system does not need to
maintain the cost for individual jobs because the jobs use a
continual system of production, and the items are typically not
significantly unique but instead are basically equivalent. The
accounting emphasis is in keeping records for the individual
departments, which is useful for large batches or runs. Process
costing is the optimal system to use when the production
process is continuous and when it is difficult to trace a
particular input cost to an individual product. Process costing
systems assign costs to each department as the costs are
incurred. The costs to produce one unit are calculated, based
on the information from the production department.
Therefore, the focus of process costing systems is on measuring
and assigning the conversion costs to the proper department
in order to best determine the cost of individual units.

   Under either costing method, accounting theory explains
why it is important to understand when costs become
expenses. A primary reason for separating production costs
from other company expenses is the expense recognition
principle, which requires costs to be expensed when they
match the revenue being earned and to separate the costs
of production from other costs for the proper timing of
recognition of expenses. Think about measuring the profit
from the sale of an item, say a TV, in a nonmanufacturing
environment. It is logical to subtract the costs associated with
buying the TV in order to determine the profit, before applying
other costs from that sale. Suppose the TV was purchased as
inventory by the store in January and sold to a customer in
March. This requires that the cost of the TV not be recorded

846 | 8.1 Job Order v. Process Costing
as an expense (cost of goods sold) until March, when the sale
from the TV is recorded, thus matching the revenue with the
expense. Until that time, the TV and its cost are considered
inventory. This same idea applies to the manufacturing
process.

   Per the expense recognition principle, product costs--the
direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead
incurred to produce the job--are expensed on the income
statement for the period of the sale as cost of goods sold when
the completed job is sold. If the products are not sold, their
costs remain in ending inventory.

   Prior to the sale of the product, separating production costs
and assigning them to the product results in these costs
remaining with the inventory. Until they are sold, the costs
incurred are reflected in an assortment of inventory accounts,
such as raw materials inventory, work in process inventory, and
finished goods inventory.

   In contrast, period costs are not directly related to the
production process and are expensed during the period in
which they are incurred. This approach matches administrative
and other expenses shown on the income statement in the
same period in which the company earns income.

As you've learned, the actual overhead incurred during the year

is rarely equal to the amount that was applied to the individual

jobs. Thus, at year-end, the manufacturing overhead account

often has a balance, indicating overhead was either

overapplied or underapplied.

If, at the end of the term, there is a debit balance in

manufacturing  overhead,      the  overhead                 is

considered underapplied overhead. A debit balance in

manufacturing overhead shows either that not enough

overhead was applied to the individual jobs or overhead was

underapplied. If, at the end of the term, there is a credit balance

in manufacturing overhead, more overhead was applied to jobs

than was actually incurred. This shows the actual amount

was overapplied overhead.

The actual overhead costs are recorded through a debit to

manufacturing overhead. The same account is credited when

overhead is applied to the individual jobs in production, as

shown:

               8.2 Under- or Over-Applied Overhead | 849
Figure 8.4 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY SA 4.0

Since the overhead is first recorded in the manufacturing
overhead account, then applied to the individual jobs, traced
through finished goods inventory, and eventually transferred
to cost of goods sold, the year-end balance is eliminated
through an adjusting entry, offsetting the cost of goods sold. If
manufacturing overhead has a debit balance, the overhead is
underapplied, and the resulting amount in cost of goods sold is
understated. The adjusting entry is:

Figure 8.5 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY SA 4.0

If manufacturing overhead has a credit balance, the overhead
is overapplied, and the resulting amount in cost of goods sold
is overstated. The adjusting entry is:

Vinyl had actual overhead expenses of $256,500 and applied
overhead expenses of $250,000, as shown:

Figure 8.7 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY SA 4.0

Since manufacturing overhead has a debit balance, it is
underapplied, as it has not been completely allocated. The
adjusting journal entry is:

Figure 8.8 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY SA 4.0

would be:

Figure 8.9 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY SA 4.0
To adjust for overapplied or underapplied manufacturing
overhead, some companies have a more complicated, three-
part allocation to work in process, finished goods, and cost of
goods sold. This method is typically used in the event of larger
variances in their balances or in bigger companies. (You will
learn more about this in future cost or advanced managerial
accounting courses.)

8.3 Three Major
Components of
Product Costs in Job
Order

In order to set an appropriate sales price for a product,
companies need to know how much it costs to produce an
item. Just as a company provides financial statement
information to external stakeholders for decision-making, they
must provide costing information to internal managerial
decision makers. Virtually every tangible product has direct
materials, direct labor, and overhead costs that can include
indirect materials and indirect labor, along with other costs,
such as utilities and depreciation on production equipment. To
account for these and inform managers making decisions, the
costs are tracked in a cost accounting system.

   While the flow of costs is generally the same for all costing
systems, the difference is in the details: Product costs have
material, labor, and overhead costs, which may be assessed
differently. In most production facilities, the raw materials are
moved from the raw materials inventory into the work in
process inventory. The work in process involves one or more
production departments and is where labor and overhead
convert the raw materials into finished goods. The movement
of these costs through the work in process inventory is shown
in Figure 8.15.

and manufacturing overhead enter the work in process inventory as
the costs associated with the products that are in production. Once
the products are completed, their costs are transferred to the finished
goods inventory. By: Rice University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long
Description

At this stage, the completed products are transferred into the
finished goods inventory account. When the product is sold,
the costs move from the finished goods inventory into the cost
of goods sold.

   While many types of production processes could be
demonstrated, let's consider an example in which a contractor
is building a home for a client. The accounting system will
track direct materials, such as lumber, and direct labor, such
as the wages paid to the carpenters constructing the home.
Along with these direct materials and labor, the project will
incur manufacturing overhead costs, such as indirect materials,
indirect labor, and other miscellaneous overhead costs.
Samples of these costs include indirect materials, such as nails,
indirect labor, such as the supervisor's salary, assuming that
the supervisor is overseeing several projects at the same time,
and miscellaneous overhead costs such as depreciation on the
equipment used in the construction project.

   As direct materials, direct labor, and overhead are introduced
into the production process, they become part of the work
in process inventory value. When the home is completed, the
accumulated costs become part of the finished goods
inventory value, and when the home is sold, the finished goods
value of the home becomes the cost of goods sold. Figure
8.16 illustrates the flow of these costs through production.

The three general categories of costs included in
manufacturing processes are direct materials, direct labor,
and overhead. Note that there are a few exceptions, since some
service industries do not have direct material costs, and some
automated manufacturing companies do not have direct labor
costs. For example, a tax accountant could use a job order
costing system during tax season to trace costs. The one major
difference between the home builder example and this one
is that the tax accountant will not have direct material costs
to track. The few assets used will typically be categorized as
overhead.

   A benefit of knowing the production costs for each job in a
job order costing system is the ability to set appropriate sales
prices based on all the production costs, including direct
materials, direct labor, and overhead. The unique nature of the
products manufactured in a job order costing system makes
setting a price even more difficult. For each job, management
typically wants to set the price higher than its production cost.
Even if management is willing to price the product as a loss
leader, they still need to know how much money will be lost
on each product. To achieve this, management needs an
accounting system that can accurately assign and document
the costs for each product.

        8.3 Three Major Components of Product Costs in Job Order | 857
   If you're not familiar with the concept of a loss leader, a
simple example might help clarify the concept. A loss leader is
a product that is sold at a price that is often less than the cost
of producing it in order to entice you to buy accessories that
are necessary for its use. For example, you might pay $50 or
$60 for a printer (for which the producer probably does not
make any profit) in order to then sell you extremely expensive
printer cartridges that only print a few pages before they have
to be replaced. However, even pricing a product as a loss leader
requires analysis of the three categories of costs: direct
materials, direct labor, and overhead.

Direct Materials

Direct materials are those materials that can be directly traced
to the manufacturing of the product. Some examples of direct
materials for different industries are shown in Table 8.2 In order
to respond quickly to production needs, companies need raw
materials inventory on hand. While production volume might
change, management does not want to stop production to
wait for raw materials to be delivered. Further, a company
needs raw materials on hand for future jobs as well as for the
current job. The materials are sent to the production
department as it is needed for production of the products.

Each job begins when raw materials are put into the work
in process inventory. When the materials are requested for
production, a materials requisition slip is completed and shows
the exact items and quantity requested, along with the
associated cost. The completed form is signed by the requestor
and approved by the manager responsible for the budget.

   Returning to the example of Dinosaur Vinyl's order for Macs
& Cheese's stadium sign, Figure 8.17 shows the materials
requisition form for Job MAC001. This form indicates the
quantity and specific items to be put into the work in process.
It also transfers the cost of those items to the work in process
inventory and decreases the raw materials inventory by the
same amount. The raw materials inventory department
maintains a copy to document the change in inventory levels,
and the accounting department maintains a copy to properly
assign the costs to the particular job.

Dinosaur Vinyl has a beginning inventory of $1,000 in raw
materials: vinyl, and $300 in each of its ink inventories: raw

        8.3 Three Major Components of Product Costs in Job Order | 859
materials: black ink, raw materials: red ink, and raw materials:
gold ink. In order to have enough inventory on hand for all of
its jobs, it purchases $10,000 in vinyl and $500 in black ink.
The T-accounts in Figure 8.18 show the stated beginning debit
balances. An additional $10,000 of vinyl and $500 of black ink
were then purchased for anticipated use, providing the
demonstrated final account balances. The red ink and gold ink
balances did not change, since no additional quantities were
purchased.

   The beginning balances and purchases in each of these
accounts are illustrated in Figure 8.18.

Traditional billboards with the design printed on vinyl include
direct materials of vinyl and printing ink, plus the framing
materials, which consist of wood and grommets. The typical
billboard sign is 14 feet high by 48 feet wide, and Dinosaur Vinyl
incurs a vinyl cost of $300 per billboard. The price for the ink
860 | 8.3 Three Major Components of Product Costs in Job Order
varies by color. For this job, Dinosaur Vinyl needs two units of
black ink at a cost of $50 each, one unit of red ink and one unit
of gold ink at a cost of $60 each, twelve grommets at a cost of
$10 each, and forty units of wood at a cost of $1.50 per unit. The
total cost of direct materials is $700, as shown in Figure 8.19.

Figure 8.19 Direct Materials Needed for Job MAC001. The costs for
direct materials needed by both the production and finishing
departments are shown. By: Rice University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA

Some items are more difficult to measure per unit, such as
adhesives and other materials not directly traceable to the final
product. Their costs are assigned to the product as part of
manufacturing overhead as indirect materials.

   When Dinosaur Vinyl requests materials to complete Job
MAC001, the materials are moved from raw materials
inventory to work in process inventory. We will use the
beginning inventory balances in the accounts that were
provided earlier in the example. The requisition is recorded
on the job cost sheet along with the cost of the materials
transferred. The costs assigned to job MAC001 are $300 in vinyl,
$100 in black ink, $60 in red ink, and $60 in gold ink. During
the finishing stages, $120 in grommets and $60 in wood are
requisitioned and put into work in process inventory. The costs
are tracked from the materials requisition form to the work in
process inventory and noted specifically as part of Job MAC001

on the preceding job order cost sheet. The movement of goods
is illustrated in Figure 8.20.

Each of the T-accounts traces the movement of the raw
materials from inventory to work in process. The vinyl and ink
were used first to print the billboard, and then the billboard
went to the finishing department for the grommets and frame,
which were moved to work in process after the vinyl and ink.
The final T-account shows the total cost for the raw materials
placed into work in process on April 2 (vinyl and ink) and on
April 14 (grommets and wood).

Direct Labor

Direct labor is the total cost of wages, payroll taxes, payroll
benefits, and similar expenses for the individuals who work
directly on manufacturing a particular product. The direct labor
costs for Dinosaur Vinyl to complete Job MAC001 occur in the
production and finishing departments. In the production
department, two individuals each work one hour at a rate of
$15 per hour, including taxes and benefits. The finishing
department's direct labor involves two individuals working one
hour each at a rate of $18 per hour. Figure 8.21 shows the direct
labor costs for Job MAC001.

individuals working directly on the product. Individuals whose
contributions are indirect will be tracked under manufacturing
overhead. By: Rice University, OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long
Description

Job MAC001 is also manufactured with the work of individuals
whose contributions cannot be directly traced to the product:
These indirect labor costs are assigned to the product as part
of manufacturing overhead.

   A company can use various methods to trace employee
wages to specific jobs. For example, employees may fill
out time tickets that include job numbers and time per job, or
workers may scan bar codes of specific jobs when they begin
a job task. Figure 8.22 shows what time tickets might look like
on Job MAC001. Please note that in the employee time tickets

        8.3 Three Major Components of Product Costs in Job Order | 863
that are displayed, each employee worked on more than one
job. However, we are only going to track the expenses for Job
MAC001.

Manufacturing Overhead

Recall that the costs of a manufactured item are direct
materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. Costs that
support production but are not direct materials or direct labor
are considered overhead. Manufacturing overhead has three
components: indirect materials, indirect labor, and overhead.

Indirect Materials

Indirect material costs are derived from the goods not directly
traced to the finished product, like the sign adhesive in the
Dinosaur Vinyl example. Tracking the exact amount of adhesive
used would be difficult, time consuming, and expensive, so it
makes more sense to classify this cost as an indirect material.

   Indirect materials are materials used in production but not
traced to specific products because the net informational value
from the time and effort to trace the cost to each individual
product produced is impossible or inefficient. For example, a
furniture factory classifies the cost of glue, stain, and nails as
indirect materials. Nails are often used in furniture production;

        8.3 Three Major Components of Product Costs in Job Order | 865
however, one chair may need 15 nails, whereas another may
need 18 nails. At a cost of less than one cent per nail, it is not
worth keeping track of each nail per product. It is much more
practical to track how many pounds of nails were used for the
period and allocate this cost (along with other costs) to the
overhead costs of the finished products.

Indirect Labor

Indirect labor represents the labor costs of those employees
associated with the manufacturing process, but whose
contributions are not directly traceable to the final product.
These would include the costs of the factory floor supervisor,
the factory housekeeping staff, and factory maintenance
workers. For Dinosaur Vinyl, for example, labor costs for the
technician who maintains the printers would be indirect labor.
It would be too time consuming to determine how much of the
technician's time is attributable to each sign being produced.
It makes much more sense to classify that labor expense as
indirect labor.

   It is important to understand that the allocation of costs may
vary from company to company. What may be a direct labor
cost for one company may be an indirect labor cost for another
company or even for another department within the same
company. Deciding whether the expense is direct or indirect
depends on its task. If the employee's work can be directly tied
to the product, it is direct labor. If it is tied to the factory but not
to the product, it is indirect labor. If it is tied to the marketing
department, it is a sales and administrative expense, and not
included in the cost of the product. For example, salaries of
factory employees assembling parts are direct labor, salaries of
factory employees performing maintenance are indirect labor,
and salaries of employees in the marketing department are
sales and administration expenses.

866 | 8.3 Three Major Components of Product Costs in Job Order
Overhead

The last category of manufacturing overhead is
the overhead itself. These costs are necessary for production
but not efficient to assign to individual product production.
Examples of typical overhead costs are production facility
electricity, warehouse rent, and depreciation of equipment.

   But note that while production facility electricity costs are
treated as overhead, the organization's administrative facility
electrical costs are not included as as overhead costs. Instead,
they are treated as period costs, as office rent or insurance
would be.

   When both administrative and production activities occur in
a common building, the production and period costs would
be allocated in some predetermined manner. For example, if a
10,000 square foot building were physically allocated at 4,000
square feet for administrative purposes and 6,000 square feet
for production, a company might allocate its annual $30,000
property tax expense on a 40%  60% basis, or $12,000 as a
period cost for the administrative offices and a production
(overhead) cost of $18,000.

Accounting for Manufacturing Overhead

In all costing systems, the expense recognition principle
requires costs to be recorded in the period in which they are
incurred. The costs are expensed when matched to the
revenue with which they are associated; this is commonly
referred to as having the expenses follow the revenues. This
explains why raw material purchases are not assigned to the
job until the materials are requested. When companies use an
inventory account, the product costs are expensed when the
inventory is sold. It is common to have an item produced in

        8.3 Three Major Components of Product Costs in Job Order | 867
one year, such as 2017, and expensed as cost of goods sold
in a later year, such as 2018. In addition to the previously
mentioned revenue recognition treatment, this treatment is
justified under GAAP's matching principle. If the inventory has
not been sold, the company has an inventory asset rather than
an expense.

   The expense recognition principle also applies to
manufacturing overhead costs. The manufacturing overhead is
an expense of production, even though the company is unable
to trace the costs directly to each specific job. For example, the
electricity needed to run production equipment typically is not
easily traced to a particular product or job, yet it is still a cost
of production. As a cost of production, the electricity--one type
of manufacturing overhead--becomes a cost of the product
and part of inventory costs until the product or job is sold.
Fortunately, the accounting system keeps track of the
manufacturing overhead, which is then applied to each
individual job in the overhead allocation process.

   Managers use the information in the manufacturing
overhead account to estimate the overhead for the next fiscal
period. This estimated overhead needs to be as close to the
actual value as possible, so that the allocation of costs to
individual products can be accurate and the sales price can be
properly determined.

   Properly allocating overhead to the individual jobs depends
on finding a cost driver that provides a fair basis for the
allocation. A cost driver is a production factor that causes a
company to incur costs. An example would be a bakery that
produces a line of apple pies that it markets to local
restaurants. To make the pies requires that the bakery incur
labor costs, so it is safe to say that pie production is a cost driver.
It should also be safe to assume that the more pies made, the
greater the number of labor hours experienced (also assuming
that direct labor has not been replaced with a greater amount
of automation). We assume, in this case, that one of the

868 | 8.3 Three Major Components of Product Costs in Job Order
marketing advantages that the bakery advertises is 100%
handmade pastries.

   In traditional costing systems, the most common activities
used as cost drivers are direct labor in dollars, direct labor in
hours, or machine hours. Often in the production process, there
is a correlation between an increase in the amount of direct
labor used and an increase in the amount of manufacturing
overhead incurred. If the company can demonstrate such a
relationship, they then often allocate overhead based on a
formula that reflects this relationship, such as the upcoming
equation. In the case of the earlier bakery, the company could
determine an overhead allocation amount based on each hour
of direct labor or, in other cases, based on the ratio of
anticipated total direct labor costs to total manufacturing
overhead costs.

   For example, assume that the company estimates total
manufacturing overhead for the year to be $400,000 and the
direct labor costs for the year to be $200,000. This relationship
would lead to $2.00 of applied overhead for each $1.00 of direct
labor incurred. The manufacturing overhead cost can be
calculated and applied to each specific job, based on the direct
labor costs. The formula that represents the overhead
allocation relationship is shown, and it is the formula for
overhead allocation:

Figure 8.24 By: Rice University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

For example, Dinosaur Vinyl determined that the direct labor
cost is the appropriate driver to use when establishing an
overhead rate. The estimated annual overhead cost for
Dinosaur Vinyl is $250,000. The total direct labor cost is

        8.3 Three Major Components of Product Costs in Job Order | 869
estimated to be $100,000, so the allocation rate is computed as
shown:
Figure 8.25 By: Rice University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
Since the direct labor expense for MAC001 is $66, the overhead
allocated is $66 times the overhead application rate of $2.50
per direct labor dollar, or $165, as shown:

allocation.

8.4 Tracing the Flow of
Costs in Job Order

Job order costing can be used for many different industries,
and each industry maintains records for one or more inventory
accounts. The manufacturing industry keeps track of the costs
of each inventory account as the product is moved from raw
materials inventory into work in process, through work in
process, and into the finished goods inventory.

   Conversely, typical companies in the merchandising industry
sell products they do not manufacture and purchase their
inventory in an already completed state. It is relatively easy to
keep track of the inventory cost for a merchandising company
through its application of first-in/first-out (FIFO), last-in/last-
out (LIFO), weighted average, or specific identification
inventory techniques on the unsold items. The primary
difference in the four methods is the valuation of the cost of
goods sold and the remaining ending inventory valuation,
assuming that the company did not sell 100% of the inventory
that they had available for sale during a given period.
Companies are allowed to choose the method that they feel
best represents their cost flows through their cost of goods
sold and their ending inventory balances.

   Not all service companies have inventory, and those
companies do not have direct materials nor do they consider
their work in process their inventory, since their final product
is often an intangible asset, such as a legal document or tax
return. Regardless of whether the service has inventory
accounts, service companies all keep track of the direct labor
and overhead costs incurred while completing each job in
progress.

   Inventory is an asset reported on the balance sheet, and each

874 | 8.4 Tracing the Flow of Costs in Job Order
company needs to maintain accurate records for the cost of
each type of inventory: raw materials inventory, work in process
inventory, and finished goods inventory. All three costs are
computed in a similar manner. You can see in Figure 8.28 that
the general format is the same for maintaining all accounts,
whether the company uses a job order, process, or hybrid cost
system.

Figure 8.28 Cost of Inventory Accounts. Inventory is accounted for
across the flow through production. By: Rice University OpenStax CC
BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long Description

Each inventory account starts with a beginning balance at the
start of an accounting period. During the period, if additional
inventory is purchased, the new inventory amount is added to
the beginning balance to calculate the total inventory available
for use or sale. The ending inventory balance at the end of the
accounting period can then be subtracted from the inventory
available for use, and the total represents the cost of the
inventory used during the period.

                                  8.4 Tracing the Flow of Costs in Job Order | 875
   For example, if the beginning inventory balance were $400,
and the company bought an additional $1,000, it would have
$1,400 of inventory available for use. If the ending inventory
balance were $500, the amount of inventory used during the
period would be $900 ($400 + $1,000 = $1,400 - $500 = $900).

Raw Materials Inventory

Raw materials inventory is the total cost of materials that will
be used in the production process. Usually, several accounts
make up the raw materials inventory, and these can be actual
accounts or accounts subsidiary to the general raw materials
inventory account. In our example, Dinosaur Vinyl has several
raw materials accounts: vinyl, red ink, black ink, gold ink,
grommets, and wood.

   Within the raw materials inventory account, purchases
increase the inventory, whereas raw materials sent into
production reduce it. It is easy to reconcile the amount of
ending inventory and the cost of direct materials used in
production, since the materials requisition form (Figure 8.29)
keeps track of the inventory requested and sent into each
specific job. Since the costs are transferred with production,
the calculation shows the amount of materials used in
production:

Work in Process Inventory

In a job order cost system, the balance in the work in process
inventory account is continually updated as job costs are
recorded and is the total of all unfinished jobs, as shown on the
individual job cost sheets.

   The production cycle is a continuous cycle that begins with
raw materials being transferred to work in process, moving
through production, and ending as finished goods inventory.
Typically, as goods are being produced, additional jobs are
being started and finished, and the work in process inventory
includes unit costs of jobs still in production at the end of the
accounting period. At the end of the accounting cycle, there
will be jobs that remain unfinished in the production cycle,
and these represent the work in process inventory. The costs
on the job order cost sheet help reconcile the cost of the items
transferred to the finished goods inventory and the cost of the
work in process inventory.

   For example, Dinosaur Vinyl has completed Job MAC001. The
total cost of $931 is transferred to the finished goods inventory:

Figure 8.30 By: Rice University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

At this point, we need to examine an important component of
the costing process. The cost of goods manufactured (COGM)
is the costs of all of the units that a company completed and
transferred to the finished goods inventory during an
accounting period. Obviously, the cost of goods manufactured
is not just a single number that can be pulled from one

                                  8.4 Tracing the Flow of Costs in Job Order | 877
location. We have to look at all costs included in the
manufacturing process to determine the cost of goods
manufactured. The calculation begins with the beginning
balance in the work in process inventory, incorporates the new
production costs incurred during the current period (typically
a year), and then subtracts the ending balance in the work
in process inventory since these costs will be included in the
subsequent accounting period's cost of goods manufactured,
as shown:

Figure 8.31 By: Rice University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long
Description

Finished Goods Inventory

After each job has been completed and overhead has been
applied, the product is transferred to the finished goods
inventory where it stays until it is sold. As each job is
transferred, the costs are summarized and transferred as well,
and the job cost sheet is completed to show the actual
production cost of the product and the sales price of the items
produced.

   A job order cost system continually updates each job cost
sheet as materials, labor, and overhead are added. As a result,
all inventory accounts are constantly maintained. The materials
inventory balance is continually updated, as materials are
purchased and requisitioned for individual jobs. The work in

878 | 8.4 Tracing the Flow of Costs in Job Order
process inventory and finished goods inventory are master
accounts, and their balances are determined by adding the
total of the job cost sheets. The total of the incomplete jobs
becomes the total work in process inventory, and the total of
the completed and unsold jobs becomes the total of the
finished goods inventory.

   Similar to the raw materials and work in process inventories,
the cost of goods sold can be calculated as shown:

                                                                                        Figure 8.32

Cost of Goods Sold

The cost of goods sold is the manufacturing cost of the items
sold during the period. It is calculated by adding the beginning
finished goods inventory and the cost of goods manufactured
to arrive at the cost of goods available for sale. The cost of goods
available for sale less the ending inventory results in the cost of
goods sold.

   In our example, when the sale has occurred, the goods are
transferred to the buyer, and the product is transferred from
the finished goods inventory to the cost of goods sold. A
corresponding entry is also made to record the sale. Dinosaur
Vinyl's sales price for Job MAC001 was $2,000, and its cost of
goods sold was $931:

8.5 Predetermined
Overhead Rates &
Overhead Application

Job order cost systems maintain the actual direct materials
and direct labor for each individual job. Since production
consists of overhead--indirect materials, indirect labor, and
other overhead--we need a methodology for applying that
overhead. Unfortunately, the nature of indirect material,
indirect labor, and other overhead expenses makes it
impossible to determine the exact amount of overhead for
each specific job. For example, how do you know the cost of
electricity and heat for manufacturing one job? And, if you did,
is it fair to say products manufactured in January are more
expensive than the same product manufactured in March
because of heat expense?

Fundamental Characteristics of the
Overhead Determination Environment

Added to these issues is the nature of establishing an overhead
rate, which is often completed months before being applied
to specific jobs. Establishing the overhead allocation rate first
requires management to identify which expenses they
consider manufacturing overhead and then to estimate the
manufacturing overhead for the next year. Manufacturing
overhead costs include all manufacturing costs except for
direct materials and direct labor. Therefore, in order to estimate
manufacturing overhead, management must estimate the

       8.5 Predetermined Overhead Rates & Overhead Application | 885
future purchase prices of dozens, or sometimes hundreds, of
individual components, such as utilities, raw materials, contract
labor, or diesel fuel. Estimating overhead costs is difficult
because many costs fluctuate significantly from when the
overhead allocation rate is established to when its actual
application occurs during the production process. You can
envision the potential problems in creating an overhead
allocation rate within these circumstances.

   Before demonstrating the calculation of a predetermined
overhead allocation rate, let's review the basic principles of
revenue recognition and expense. In accounting, there are
three ways to recognize expenses:

 1. Direct relationship between the expense and the
      associated revenue. This method is used for many costs,
      and the expense is recognized when a direct relationship
      exists. For example, sales commission expenses can be
      directly traced to product sales, and a commission
      expense is recorded when a sale is made.

2. Systematic and rational allocation of expenses. This
      approach is used when costs exist and there is an
      expected benefit, even though the costs cannot be
      directly traced to the benefit. The assigning of expenses to
      a product or time period must be done in an objective and
      consistent manner. Examples of such expenses would
      include equipment rental for a factory or property
      insurance for the factory.
      Both of these expenses (direct relationship and systematic
      and rational) are also examples of the types of expenses
      that compose manufacturing overhead. An example of the
      current revenue recognition principle is a company paying
      $4,800 a year for property insurance. Since production
      rates can vary month to month, most producers would
      allocate $400 each month for property insurance, and this
      cost would be incorporated into the total overhead costs

886 | 8.5 Predetermined Overhead Rates & Overhead Application
      anticipated when estimating a manufacturing overhead
      allocation rate.
      The direct benefit is that the product will be sold and the
      revenue recognized. The overhead is associated but
      cannot be directly traced to an individual product, so the
      overhead expenses need to be assigned in a systematic
      and rational manner.
 3. Immediate recognition. This method is used when
      expenses exist but there is no direct expected benefit. In
      this case, the expense is recognized immediately. For
      example, research and development costs are necessary
      expenses but cannot be traced to a specific product, so
      they are expensed as incurred.

The allocation of overhead to the cost of the product is also
recognized in a systematic and rational manner. The expected
overhead is estimated, and an allocation system is determined.
The actual costs are accumulated in a manufacturing overhead
account. The overhead is then applied to the cost of the
product from the manufacturing overhead account. The
overhead used in the allocation is an estimate due to the
timing considerations already discussed.

   The application rate that will be used in a coming period,
such as the next year, is often estimated months before the
actual overhead costs are experienced. Often, the actual
overhead costs experienced in the coming period are higher or
lower than those budgeted when the estimated overhead rate
or rates were determined. At this point, do not be concerned
about the accuracy of the future financial statements that will
be created using these estimated overhead allocation rates.

   Despite improvements in technology and information flow,
using the actual overhead to calculate the application rate is
usually not possible because the actual overhead information
is available too late for management to make decisions. Also,
as you will learn, the results of the actual overhead costs, if

       8.5 Predetermined Overhead Rates & Overhead Application | 887
they were available, could be misleading. Therefore, most
manufacturing companies use predetermined overhead rates
for these reasons:

   Overhead costs are not uniform throughout the year. An
      example is electricity costs that vary by weather and time
      of day.

   Some overhead costs are fixed, and the cost per unit varies
      with production. For example, rent may be $1,000 per
      month. If 500 units were made during one month, and
      2,000 units were made the next month, the cost per unit
      would vary from $2 per unit to $0.50 per unit.

   The total number of units produced varies and is often
      known sooner than the cost of overhead. For example, a
      company may know it will have a contract to produce 100
      custom units long before it knows the utility costs for the
      next year.

As previously described, a predetermined overhead rate is
established prior to the beginning of the fiscal year and
typically is not changed during the year. The predetermined
rate is calculated as shown and is used to apply overhead costs
to work in process:

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

Overhead in the Movie Industry

The movie industry uses job order costing, and studios need
to allocate overhead to each movie. Their amount of allocated
overhead is not publicly known because while publications
share how much money a movie has produced in ticket sales,
it is rare that the actual expenses are released to the public.

   It has been speculated that Star Wars: The Force
Awakens cost $201,000,000, with $30,000,000 considered
overhead. Studios have estimated that the higher the movie
expenses, the more studio overhead is required, and it has also
been estimated that 10% of the total cost is assigned to studio
overhead.

Determining Estimated Overhead Cost

The estimated or budgeted overhead is the amount of
overhead determined during the budgeting process and
consists of manufacturing costs but, as you have learned,
excludes direct materials and direct labor. Examples of
manufacturing overhead costs include indirect materials,
indirect labor, manufacturing utilities, and manufacturing
equipment depreciation. Another way to view it is overhead
costs are those production costs that are not categorized as
direct materials or direct labor.

       8.5 Predetermined Overhead Rates & Overhead Application | 889
Selecting an Estimated Activity Base

As you have learned, the overhead needs to be allocated to the
manufactured product in a systematic and rational manner.
This allocation process depends on the use of a cost driver,
which drives the production activity's cost. Examples can
include labor hours incurred, labor costs paid, amounts of
materials used in production, units produced, or any other
activity that has a cause-and-effect relationship with incurred
costs.

   Direct labor hours, direct labor dollars, or machine hours are
often chosen as the allocation base because those costs are
associated with each product, and as the activity increases,
so does the manufacturing overhead. In other words, the
products that involve more direct labor hours, direct labor
dollars, or machine hours also increase utility expenses,
supervisor time (and thus indirect labor), equipment usage and
the related depreciation expense, and so forth.

   Traditionally, direct labor hours were used as the activity
base, but technology continually decreases the amount of
direct labor used in production, and machine hours or units
produced have become more common activity bases.
Management analyzes the costs and selects the activity as
the estimated activity base because it drives the overhead
costs of the unit.

Computing a Predetermined Overhead
Rate

Dinosaur Vinyl uses the expenses from the prior two years to
estimate the overhead for the upcoming year to be $250,000,
as shown in Figure 8.38.

890 | 8.5 Predetermined Overhead Rates & Overhead Application
Figure 8.38 Dinosaur Vinyl's Estimated Overhead. By: Rice University
OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Dinosaur Vinyl also used its payroll records to estimate that it
will spend $100,000 on direct labor. Using the predetermined
overhead rate calculation, the overhead rate is $2.50 per direct
labor dollar:

Figure 8.39 By: Rice University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Over the fiscal year, the actual costs are recorded as debits
into the account called manufacturing overhead. When the
overhead is applied to the jobs, the amount is first calculated
using the application rate. If the total labor paid for the job
is $66, the overhead applied to the job is $2.50 times that

        8.5 Predetermined Overhead Rates & Overhead Application | 891
amount, or $165. The entry to record the overhead for Job
MAC001 is:

Figure 8.40 By: Rice University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

That amount is added to the cost of the job, and the amount in
the manufacturing overhead account is reduced by the same
amount. At the end of the year, the amount of overhead
estimated and applied should be close, although it is rare for
the applied amount to exactly equal the actual overhead. For
example, Figure 8.41 shows the monthly costs, the annual
actual cost, and the estimated overhead for Dinosaur Vinyl for
the year. While the total amounts are close to each other, they
are not exact.

Cost of a Job

Determining the Costs of an Individual
Job Using Job Order Costing

When a job is completed, the costs of the job--the direct
materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead--are
totaled on the job cost sheet, and the total amount is
transferred to finished goods at the same time the product
is transferred, either physically or legally, such as in the case
of a home built by a contractor. Finally, when the product is
sold, the sale is recorded at the sale price, while the cost is
transferred from finished goods inventory to the cost of goods
sold expense account. Figure 8.42 shows the flow of costs from
raw materials inventory to cost of goods sold.

At all points in the process, the work in process should include

894 | 8.6 Calculating the Cost of a Job
the cost of direct materials and direct labor. When the job
is completed and overhead assigned, the overhead allocation
increases the cost of the work in process inventory. The cost
of each individual job is maintained on a job cost sheet, and
the total of all the work in process job cost sheets equals the
work in process inventory and the statement of cost of goods
manufactured, as you have learned.

   A job cost sheet is a subsidiary ledger that identifies the
individual costs for each job. Figure 8.43 shows the job cost

Sample Cost Information for Dinosaur
Vinyl

Dinosaur Vinyl worked on three jobs during the month:
POR143, MAC001, and TRJ441, and a fourth Job SWM505 had
been finished and moved to the finished goods inventory
account during the previous month.

   At the beginning of the month, the company had a
beginning raw materials inventory balance of $2,500, and

896 | 8.6 Calculating the Cost of a Job
during the month, it purchased an additional $10,500, giving
it a total of $13,000 in raw materials available for use in
production.

   The following example will examine four different production
jobs. Each of the four will be at beginning stages at either
the beginning of the current month or the end of the current
month.

 1. Job POR 143: This job was the only work in process
      inventory at the beginning of the current month, and it
      had $1,000 in direct material costs, and $0 of direct labor
      costs already allocated to the work in process inventory.
      During the current month, additional direct materials of
      $200 and direct labor of $150 were added to POR143. An
      overhead cost of $375 was applied to POR143 at the
      predetermined overhead rate of $2.50 per direct labor
      dollar. It was finished during the month and transferred to
      the finished goods inventory. The sale was not finalized
      during the month, so it continues to be part of the
      finished goods inventory.

2. Job MAC 001: This job was started and completed during
      the month. Since the job began in and was completed in
      the same month, there was no beginning balance in the
      work in process inventory. During the month it incurred
      $700 in direct materials costs, $66 in direct labor, and $165
      of overhead applied to the job before it was transferred to

      was finalized during the month at a sale price of $2,000, so
      the costs were transferred from finished goods inventory
      to cost of goods sold.

 3. Job TRJ441: This job was started during the current month.
      Its costs consist of $500 in direct material cost, $150 in
      direct labor expenses, and $375 in applied overhead. The
      job remains in the work in process inventory awaiting
      assembly.

Journal Entries to Move Direct Materials,
Direct Labor, and Overhead into Work in
Process

Dinosaur Vinyl keeps track of its inventory and orders
additional inventory to have on hand when the production
department requests it. This inventory is not associated with
any particular job, and the purchases stay in raw materials
inventory until assigned to a specific job. For example,
Dinosaur Vinyl purchased an additional $10,000 of vinyl and
$500 of black ink to complete Macs & Cheese's billboard. If the
purchase is made on account, the entry is as shown:

Figure 8.49 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA 4.0

As shown in Figure 8.49, for the production process for job
MAC001, the job supervisor submitted a materials requisition
form for $300 in vinyl, $100 in black ink, $60 in red ink, and $60
in gold ink. For the finishing process for Job MAC001, $120 in
grommets and $60 in finishing wood were requisitioned. The
entry to reflect these actions is:

Description

The production department employees work on the sign and
send it over to the finishing/assembly department when they
have completed their portion of the job.

   The direct cost of factory labor includes the direct wages
paid to the employees and all other payroll costs associated
with that labor. Typically, this includes wages and the payroll
taxes and fringe benefits directly tied to those wages. The
accounting system needs to keep track of the labor and the
other related expenses assigned to a particular job. These
records are typically kept in a time ticket submitted by
employees daily.

   On April 10, the labor time sheet totaling $30 is recorded for
Job MAC001 through this entry:

Figure 8.51 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA 4.0

The assembly personnel in the finishing/assembly department
complete Job MAC001 in two hours. The labor is recorded as

Figure 8.52 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA 4.0

Indirect materials also have a materials requisition form, but
the costs are recorded differently. They are first transferred into
manufacturing overhead and then allocated to work in process.
The entry to record the indirect material is to debit
manufacturing overhead and credit raw materials inventory.

   Indirect labor records are also maintained through time
tickets, although such work is not directly traceable to a
specific job. The difference between direct labor and indirect
labor is that the indirect labor records the debit to
manufacturing overhead while the credit is to factory wages
payable.

   Dinosaur Vinyl's time tickets indicate that $4,000 in indirect
labor costs were incurred during the period. The entry is:

Figure 8.53 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA 4.0

Dinosaur Vinyl also records the actual overhead incurred. As
shown in Figure 8.55, manufacturing overhead costs of $21,000
were incurred. The entry to record these expenses increases
the amount of overhead in the manufacturing overhead
account. The entry is:

When the sale has occurred, the goods are transferred to the
buyer. The product is transferred from the finished goods
inventory to cost of goods sold. A corresponding entry is also
made to record the sale. The sign for Job MAC001 had a sales
price of $2,000 and a cost of $931. These are the entries to

8.8 Job Order in the
Service Industries

Fundamentals of the Job Order Costing
Method for Service Entities

Instead of being dependent on materials, service
industries depend on labor. Since their work is labor intensive,
it makes sense to use labor as an activity base with billable
hours often as the best allocation base. For example, in an
audit, there often will be several accountants, with differing
levels of experience and expertise involved in the assignment.
The accounting firms have more billable hours at the staff level
and fewer billable hours at the partner level. And since the firm
bills the partner's time at a significantly higher rate than the
staff, it makes sense to apply overhead at the billable hours
instead of the billable costs.

   In service industries, there is no manufacturing overhead
because they are not manufacturing a product, but instead are
providing a service. Accordingly, overhead is called operating
overhead.

   Another terminology difference is the inventory accounts.
The jobs are considered movies or assignments in process, and
are transferred to a cost of service sold account instead of to a
finished goods inventory.

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

Tracking Costs in Healthcare

Healthcare is one of the industries that keeps track of materials,
such as medicine. In this industry, direct labor is shown to the
patient as the cost of the provider, such as a physician,
physician assistant, or nurse practitioner. Indirect labor
includes all other personnel from front desk staff to the nurse
who gathers vital signs or a technician who performs tests.
Patients do not see the overhead cost on their bill, but it is built
into the invoice as part of the practitioner or testing fees.

Service Entity Use of a Job Order Costing
System

To understand how a service provider uses a job order cost
system, let's consider the case of IFixIT. IFixIT Systems is
a Sony-authorized repair provider that fixes audiovisual
equipment brought in by customers. IFixIT requires customers
to pay $50 to diagnose the problem. IFixIt pays its employees
$25 per hour and assigns overhead equal to its direct labor
cost. The customers' bills do not show overhead and are instead
itemized as parts plus labor, where the cost for parts is the
original cost plus a markup, and the labor rate is $80 per hour.

   A customer brought in his TV and paid the $50 diagnostic
fee. IFixIT determined a new power cord was needed. To fix it,
IFixIT purchases the part from its suppliers at $42 and pays $75
in direct labor for 3 hours at $25 per hour. Overhead is applied
equal to the direct labor cost of $75. The customer is charged

                                       8.8 Job Order in the Service Industries | 909
$310, consisting of $70 for the part and 3 hours of labor at a rate
of $80 per hour. IFixIT records the journal entries shown:

Process Costing

912 | Process Costing
8.9 Process Costing
Overview

Process costing is the optimal costing system when a
standardized process is used to manufacture identical
products and the direct material, direct labor, and
manufacturing overhead cannot be easily or economically
traced to a specific unit. Process costing is used most often
when manufacturing a product in batches. Each department
or production process or batch process tracks its direct
material and direct labor costs as well as the number of units
in production. The actual cost to produce each unit through
a process costing system varies, but the average result is an
adequate determination of the cost for each manufactured
unit. Examples of items produced and accounted for using
a form of the process costing method could be soft drinks,
petroleum products, or even furniture such as chairs, assuming
that the company makes batches of the same chair, instead of
customizing final products for individual customers.

   For example, small companies, such as David and William's,
and large companies, such as Nabisco, use similar cost-
determination processes. In order to understand how much
each product costs--for example, Oreo cookies--Nabisco uses
process costing to track the direct materials, direct labor, and
manufacturing overhead used in the manufacturing of its
products. Oreo production has six distinct steps or
departments: (1) make the cookie dough, (2) press the cookie
dough into a molding machine, (3) bake the cookies, (4) make
the filling and apply it to the cookies, (5) put the cookies
together into a sandwich, and (6) and place the cookies into
plastic trays and packages. Each department keeps track of
its direct materials used and direct labor incurred, and

                                                      8.9 Process Costing Overview | 913
manufacturing overhead applied to facilitate determining the
cost of a batch of Oreo cookies.

Figure 8.60 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA

As previously mentioned, process costing is used when similar
items are produced in large quantities. As such, many
individuals immediately associate process costing with
assembly line production. Process costing works best when
products cannot be distinguished from each other and, in
addition to obvious production line products like ice cream or
paint, also works for more complex manufacturing of similar
products like small engines. Conversely, products in a job order
cost system are manufactured in small quantities and include
custom jobs such as custom manufacturing products. They
can also be legal or accounting tasks, movie production, or
major projects such as construction activities.

   The difference between process costing and job order
costing relates to how the costs are assigned to the products.
In either costing system, the ability to obtain and analyze cost
data is needed. This results in the costing system selected
being the one that best matches the manufacturing process.

                    One or more interactive elements has been
                    excluded from this version of the text. You can
        view them online here: https://psu.pb.unizin.org/
        acctg211/?p=1388#oembed-1

A job order cost system is often more expensive to maintain
than a basic process costing system, since there is a cost

914 | 8.9 Process Costing Overview
associated with assigning the individual material and labor to
the product. Thus, a job order cost system is used for custom
jobs when it is easy to determine the cost of materials and
labor used for each job. A process cost system is often less
expensive to maintain and works best when items are identical
and it is difficult to trace the exact cost of materials and labor
to the final product. For example, assume that your company
uses three production processes to make jigsaw puzzles. The
first process glues the picture on the cardboard backing, the
second process cuts the puzzle into pieces, and the final
process loads the pieces into the boxes and seals them. Tracing
the complete costs for the batch of similar puzzles would likely
entail three steps, with three separate costing system
components. In this environment, it would be difficult and not
economically feasible to trace the exact materials and the exact
labor to each individual puzzle; rather, it would be more
efficient to trace the costs per batch of puzzles.

   The costing system used typically depends on whether the
company can most efficiently and economically trace the costs
to the job (favoring job order costing system) or to the
production department or batch (favoring a process costing
system).

   While the costing systems are different from each other,
management uses the information provided to make similar
managerial decisions, such as setting the sales price. For
example, in a job order cost system, each job is unique, which
allows management to establish individual prices for individual
projects. Management also needs to establish a sales price for
a product produced with a process costing system, but this
system is not designed to stop the production process and
individually cost each batch of a product, so management
must set a price that will work for many batches of the product.

   In addition to setting the sales price, managers need to know
the cost of their products in order to determine the value of
inventory, plan production, determine labor needs, and make

                                                      8.9 Process Costing Overview | 915
long- and short-term plans. They also need to know the costs
to determine when a new product should be added or an old
product removed from production.

   In this chapter, you will learn when and why process costing
is used. You'll also learn the concepts of conversion costs and
equivalent units of production and how to use these for
calculating the unit and total cost of items produced using a
process costing system.

Basic Managerial Accounting Terms Used
in Job Order Costing and Process Costing

Regardless of the costing system used, manufacturing costs

consist of direct material, direct labor, and manufacturing

overhead. Figure 8.61 shows a partial organizational chart for

Rock City Percussion, a drumstick manufacturer. In this

example,  two  groups--administrative                and

manufacturing--report directly to the chief financial officer

(CFO). Each group has a vice president responsible for several

departments. The organizational chart also shows the

departments that report to the production department,

illustrating the production arrangement. The material storage

unit stores the types of wood used (hickory, maple, and birch),

the tips (nylon and felt), and packaging materials.

916 | 8.9 Process Costing Overview
Figure 8.61 The Organizational Chart for Rock City Percussion By:
Rice University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long Description

Understanding the company's organization is an important
first step in any costing system. Next is understanding the
production process. The most basic drumstick is made of
hickory and has a wooden tip. When the popular size 5A stick
is manufactured, the hickory stored in the materials storeroom
is delivered to the shaping department where the wood is cut
into pieces, shaped into dowels, and shaped into the size 5A
shape while under a stream of water. The sticks are dried, and
then sent to the packaging department, where the sticks are
embossed with the Rock City Percussion logo, inspected,
paired, packaged, and shipped to retail outlets such as Guitar
Center. The manufacturing process is described in Figure 8.62.

                                                     8.9 Process Costing Overview | 917
Figure 8.62 Rock City Percussion Manufacturing Process By: Rice
University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long Description

The different units within Rock City Percussion illustrate the
two main cost categories of a manufacturing company:
manufacturing costs and administrative costs.

Manufacturing Costs

Manufacturing costs or product costs include all expenses
required to manufacture the product: direct materials, direct
labor, and manufacturing overhead. Since process costing
assigns the costs to each department, the inventory at the end
of the period includes the finished goods inventory, and the
work in process inventory for each manufacturing department.
For example, using the departments shown in Figure 8.62, raw
materials inventory is the cost paid for the materials that
remain in the storeroom until requested.

   While still in production, the work in process units are moved
from one department to the next until they are completed,
so the work in process inventory includes all of the units in
the shaping and packaging departments. When the units are
completed, they are transferred to finished goods inventory
and become costs of goods sold when the product is sold.

918 | 8.9 Process Costing Overview
   When assigning costs to departments, it is important to
separate the product costs from the period costs, which are
those that are typically related with a particular time period,
instead of attached to the production of an asset. Management
often needs additional information to make decisions and
needs the product costs further categorized as prime costs
or conversion costs (Figure 8.63). Prime costs are costs that
include the primary (or direct) product costs: direct material
and direct labor. Conversion costs are the costs necessary to
convert direct materials into a finished product: direct labor
and manufacturing overhead, which includes other costs that
are not classified as direct materials or direct labor, such as
plant insurance, utilities, or property taxes. Also, note that direct
labor is considered to be a component of both prime costs and
conversion costs.

Figure 8.63 Prime Costs and Conversion Costs. Product costs can be
categorized as prime costs (direct product costs) or conversion costs
(costs incurred while converting the materials into a finished
product). Direct labor is accounted for in both categories. By: Rice
University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

                                                     8.9 Process Costing Overview | 919
Job order costing tracks prime costs to assign direct material
and direct labor to individual products (jobs). Process costing
also tracks prime costs to assign direct material and direct
labor to each production department (batch). Manufacturing
overhead is another cost of production, and it is applied to
products (job order) or departments (process) based on an
appropriate activity base.

Selling and Administrative Expenses

Selling and administrative (S&A) expenses are period costs,
which means that they are recorded in the period in which they
were incurred. Selling and administrative expenses typically
are not directly assigned to the items produced or services
provided and include costs of departments not directly
associated with manufacturing but necessary to operate the
business. The selling costs component of S&A expenses is
related to the promotion and sale of the company's products,
while administrative expenses are related to the administration
of the company. Some examples of S&A expenses include
marketing costs; administration building rent; the chief
executive officer's salary expense; and the accounting, payroll,
and data processing department expenses.

   These general rules for S&A expenses, however, have their
exceptions. For example, some items that are classified as
overhead, such as plant insurance, are period costs but are
classified as overhead and are attached to the items produced
as product costs.

   The expense recognition principle is the primary reason to
separate the costs of production from the other expenses of
the company. This principle requires costs to be recorded in
the period in which they are incurred. The costs are expensed
when matched to the revenue with which they are associated;

920 | 8.9 Process Costing Overview
this is commonly referred to as having the expenses follow the
revenues.

   Period costs are expensed during the period in which they
are incurred; this allows a company to apply the administrative
and other expenses shown on the income statement to the
same period in which the company earns income. Under
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), separating
the production costs and assigning them to the department
results in the costs of the product staying with the work in
process inventory for each department. This follows the
expense recognition principle because the cost of the product
is expensed when revenue from the sale is recognized.

Equivalent Units

In a process cost system, costs are maintained by each
department, and the method for determining the cost per
individual unit is different than in a job order costing system.
Rock City Percussion uses a process cost system because the
drumsticks are produced in batches, and it is not economically
feasible to trace the direct labor or direct material, like hickory,
to a specific drumstick. Therefore, the costs are maintained by
each department, rather than by job, as they are in job order
costing.

   How does an organization determine the cost of each unit in
a process costing environment? The costs in each department
are allocated to the number of units produced in a given
period. This requires determination of the number of units
produced, but this is not always an easy process. At the end of
the accounting period, there typically are always units still in
production, and these units are only partially complete. Think
of it this way: At midnight on the last day of the month, all
accounting numbers need to be determined in order to
process the financial statements for that month, but the

                                                      8.9 Process Costing Overview | 921
production process does not stop at the end of each
accounting period. However, the number of units produced
must be calculated at the end of the accounting period to
determine the number of equivalent units, or the number of
units that would have been produced if the units were
produced sequentially and in their entirety in a particular time
period. The number of equivalent units is different from the
number of actual units and represents the number of full or
whole units that could have been produced given the amount
of effort applied. To illustrate, consider this analogy. You have
five large pizzas that each contained eight slices. Your friends
served themselves, and when they were finished eating, there
were several partial pizzas left. In equivalent units, determine
how many whole pizzas are left if the remaining slices are
divided as shown in Figure 8.64

   Pie 1 had one slice
   Pie 2 had two slices
   Pie 3 had two slices
   Pie 4 had three slices
   Pie 5 had eight slices

Together, there are sixteen slices left. Since there are eight
slices per pizza, the leftover pizza would be considered two full
equivalent units of pizzas. The equivalent unit is determined
separately for direct materials and for conversion costs as part
of the computation of the per-unit cost for both material and
conversion costs.

Major Characteristics of Process Costing

Process costing is the optimal system for a company to use
when the production process results in many similar units. It is
used when production is continuous or occurs in large batches
and it is difficult to trace a particular input cost to a specific
individual product.

   For example, before David and William found ways to make
five large cookies per batch, their family always made one large
cookie per batch. In order to make five cookies at a time, they
had to gather the ingredients and baking materials, including
five bowls and five cookie sheets. The exact amount of
ingredients for one large cookie was mixed in each separate
bowl and then placed on the cookie sheet. When this method
was used, it was easy to establish that exactly one egg, two
cups of flour, three-quarter cup of chocolate chips, three-
quarter cup of sugar, one-quarter teaspoon salt, and so forth,
were in each cookie. This made it easy to determine the exact
cost of each cookie. But if David and William used one bowl
instead of five bowls, measured the ingredients into it and
then divided the dough into five large cookies, they could not

                                                     8.9 Process Costing Overview | 923
know for certain that each cookie has exactly two cups of flour.
One cookie may have 1 and 7 eighths cups and another may
have 1 and 15 sixteenths cups, and one cookie may have a few
more chocolate chips than another. It is also impossible to trace
the chocolate chips from each bag to each cookie because
the chips were mixed together. These variations do not affect
the taste and are not important in this type of accounting.
Process costing is optimal when the products are relatively
homogenous or indistinguishable from one another, such as
bottles of vegetable oil or boxes of cereal.

   Often, process costing makes sense if the individual costs or
values of each unit are not significant. For example, it would
not be cost effective for a restaurant to make each cup of iced
tea separately or to track the direct material and direct labor
used to make each eight-ounce glass of iced tea served to a
customer. In this scenario, job order costing is a less efficient
accounting method because it costs more to track the costs
per eight ounces of iced tea than the cost of a batch of tea.
Overall, when it is difficult or not economically feasible to track
the costs of a product individually, process costing is typically
the best cost system to use.

   Process costing can also accommodate increasingly complex
business scenarios. While making drumsticks may sound
simple, an immense amount of technology is involved. Rock
City Percussion makes 8,000 hickory sticks per day, four days
each week. The sticks made of maple and birch are
manufactured on the fifth day of the week. It is difficult to tell
the first drumstick made on Monday from the 32,000th one
made on Thursday, so a computer matches the sticks in pairs
based on the tone produced.

   Process costing measures and assigns the costs to the
associated department. The basic 5A hickory stick consists only
of hickory as direct material. The rest of the manufacturing
process involves direct labor and manufacturing overhead, so
the focus is on properly assigning those costs. Thus, process

924 | 8.9 Process Costing Overview
costing works well for simple production processes such as
cereal, rubber, and steel, and for more complicated production
processes such as the manufacturing of electronics and
watches, if there is a degree of similarity in the production
process.

   In a process cost system, each department accumulates its
costs to compute the value of work in process inventory, so
there will be a work in process inventory for each
manufacturing or production department as well as an
inventory cost for finished goods inventory. Manufacturing
departments are often organized by the various stages of the
production process. For example, blending, baking, and
packaging could each be categorized as manufacturing or
production departments for the cookie producer, while
cutting, assembly, and finishing could be manufacturing or
production departments with accompanying costs for a
furniture manufacturer. Each department, or process, will have
its own work in process inventory account, but there will only
be one finished goods inventory account.

   There are two methods used to compute the values in the
work in process and finished goods inventories. The first
method is the weighted-average method, which includes all
costs (costs incurred during the current period and costs
incurred during the prior period and carried over to the current
period). This method is often favored, because in the process
cost production method there often is little product left at the
end of the period and most has been transferred out. The
second method is the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, which
calculates the unit costs based on the assumption that the
first units sold come from the prior period's work in process
that was carried over into the current period and completed.
After these units are sold, the newer completed units can then
be sold. The theory is similar to the FIFO inventory valuation
process that you learned about in Accounting for Inventory.
(Since the FIFO process costing method is more complicated

                                                     8.9 Process Costing Overview | 925
than the weighted-average method, the FIFO method is
typically covered in more advanced accounting courses.)

   With processing, it is difficult to establish how much of each
material, and exactly how much time is in each unit of finished
product. This will require the use of the equivalent unit
computation, and management selects the method (weighted
average or FIFO) that best fits their information system.

   Process costing can also be used by service organizations
that provide homogeneous services and often do not have
inventory to value, such as a hotel reservation system. Although
they have no inventory, the hotel might want to know its costs
per reservation for a period. They could allocate the total costs
incurred by the reservation system based on the number of
inquiries they served. For example, assume that in a year they
incurred costs of $200,000 and served 50,000 potential guests.
They could determine an average cost by dividing costs by
number of inquiries, or $200,000  50,000 = $4.00 per potential
guest.

   In the case of a not-for-profit company, the same process
could be used to determine the average costs incurred by a
department that performs interviews. The department's costs
would be allocated based on the number of cases processed.
For example, assume a not-for-profit pet adoption organization
has an annual budget of $180,000 and typically matches 900
shelter animals with new owners each year. The average cost
would be $200 per match.

Similarities between Process Costing and
Job Order Costing

Both process costing and job order costing maintain the costs
of direct material, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.
The process of production does not change because of the

926 | 8.9 Process Costing Overview
costing method. The costing method is chosen based on the
production process.

   In job order cost production, the costs can be directly traced
to the job, and the job cost sheet contains the total expenses
for that job. Process costing is optimal when the costs cannot
be traced directly to the job. For example, it would be
impossible for David and William to trace the exact amount
of eggs in each chocolate chip cookie. It is also impossible to
trace the exact amount of hickory in a drumstick. Even two
sticks made sequentially may have different weights because
the wood varies in density. These types of manufacturing are
optimal for the process cost system.

   The similarities between job order cost systems and process
cost systems are the product costs of materials, labor, and
overhead, which are used determine the cost per unit, and the
inventory values. The differences between the two systems are
shown in Table 8.3.

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

Choosing Between Process Costing and Job
Order Costing

Process costing and job order costing are both acceptable
methods for tracking costs and production levels. Some
companies use a single method, while some companies use
both, which creates a hybrid costing system. The system a
company uses depends on the nature of the product the
company manufactures.

   Companies that mass produce a product allocate the costs
to each department and use process costing. For
example, General Mills uses process costing for its cereal,
pasta, baking products, and pet foods. Job order systems are
custom orders because the cost of the direct material and
direct labor are traced directly to the job being produced. For
example, Boeing uses job order costing to manufacture planes.

   When a company mass produces parts but allows
customization on the final product, both systems are used; this
is common in auto manufacturing. Each part of the vehicle is
mass produced, and its cost is calculated with process costing.
However, specific cars have custom options, so each individual
car costs the sum of the specific parts used.

8.10 Conversion Costs

In a processing environment, there are two concepts important
to determining the cost of products produced. These are the
concepts of equivalent units and conversion costs. As you have
learned, equivalent units are the number of units that would
have been produced if one unit was completed before starting
a second unit. For example, four units that are one-fourth
finished would equal one equivalent unit. Conversion costs are
the labor and overhead expenses that "convert" raw materials
into a completed unit. Each department tracks its conversion
costs in order to determine the quantity and cost per unit (see
TBD; we discuss this concept in more detail later).
Management often uses the cost information generated to set
the sales price; to set standard usage data and price for
material, labor, and overhead; and to allow management to
evaluate the efficiency of production and plan for the future.

Definition of Conversion Costs

Conversion costs are the total of direct labor and factory
overhead costs. They are combined because it is the labor and
overhead together that convert the raw material into the
finished product. Remember that factory, manufacturing, or
organizational overhead (you might see all three terms in
practice) is composed of three sources: indirect materials,
indirect labor, and all other overhead costs that are not indirect
materials or indirect labor. Materials are often added in stages
at discrete points of production, such as at the beginning,
middle, or end of a process, but conversion is usually applied
equally throughout the process. For example, in the opening
example, David and William do not add direct material

930 | 8.10 Conversion Costs
(ingredients) evenly throughout the cookie-making process.
They are all added at the beginning of the production process,
so they begin with the direct materials but add labor and
overhead throughout the rest of the process.

   Conversion costs can be explained through the process of
making Just Born's Peeps. Just Born makes 5.5 million Peeps
per day using three ingredients and the following process:3

 1. Use machines to add and mix the sugar, corn syrup, and
      gelatin into a mixture called a slurry. Send slurry through a
      whipper to give the marshmallow its fluffy texture.

2. Color the sugar.
 3. Deposit marshmallows on sugar-coated belts in the Peep

      shape. Send Peeps on belts through a wind tunnel that
      stirs up the sugar to coat the entire shape.
4. Add eyes, and inspect.
 5. Move the Peeps via belt into their appropriate tray, and
      wrap with cellophane.

In the Peep-making process, the direct materials of sugar, corn
syrup, gelatin, color, and packaging materials are added at the
beginning of steps 1, 2, and 5. While the fully automated
production does not need direct labor, it does need indirect
labor in each step to ensure the machines are operating
properly and to perform inspections (step 4).

Mechanics of Applying Conversion Costs

Let's return to our drumstick example to learn how to work
with conversion costs. Rock City Percussion has two
departments critical to manufacturing drumsticks: the
shaping and packaging departments.

   The shaping department uses only wood as its direct
material and water as its indirect material. In the shaping

                                                                 8.10 Conversion Costs | 931
department, the material is added first. Then, machines cut the
wood underwater into dowels, separate them, and move them
to machines that shape the dowels into drumsticks. These
machines need electricity to operate and personnel to monitor
and adjust the processes and to maintain the equipment.
When the shaping is finished, a conveyer belt transfers the
sticks to the finishing department.

   Since the drumsticks are made by performing one process
on one batch at a time, instead of producing one stick at a
time from start to finish, it is difficult to determine the exact
materials, labor, and overhead for a single pair of drumsticks.
It is easier to track the materials and conversion costs for one
batch and have those costs follow the batch to the next
process.

   Therefore, once the batch of sticks gets to the second
process--the packaging department--it already has costs
attached to it. In other words, the packaging department
receives both the drumsticks and their related costs from the
shaping department. For the basic size 5A stick, the packaging
department adds material at the beginning of the process.
The 5A uses only packaging sleeves as its direct material, while
other types may also include nylon, felt, and/or the ingredients
for the proprietary handgrip. Direct labor and manufacturing
overhead are used to test, weigh, and sound-match the
drumsticks into pairs.

   Thus, at the end of the accounting period, there are two work
in process inventories: one in the shaping department and one
in the packaging department.

   Direct materials are added at the beginning of shaping and
packaging departments, so the work in process inventory for
those departments is 100% complete with regard to materials,
but it is not complete with regard to conversion costs. If they
were 100% complete with regard to conversion costs, then they
would have been transferred to the next department.

8.11 Equivalent Units -
initial period

As described previously, process costing can have more than
one work in process account. Determining the value of the
work in process inventory accounts is challenging because
each product is at varying stages of completion and the
computation needs to be done for each department. Trying
to determine the value of those partial stages of completion
requires application of the equivalent unit computation. The
equivalent unit computation determines the number of units if
each is manufactured in its entirety before manufacturing the
next unit. For example, forty units that are 25% complete would
be ten (40  25%) units that are totally complete.

   Direct material is added in stages, such as the beginning,
middle, or end of the process, while conversion costs are
expensed evenly over the process. Often there is a different
percentage of completion for materials than there is for labor.
For example, if material is added at the beginning of the
process, the forty units that are 100% complete with respect
to material and 25% complete with respect to conversion costs
would be the same as forty units of material and ten units (40 
25%) completed with conversion costs.

   For example, during the month of July, Rock City Percussion
purchased raw material inventory of $25,000 for the shaping
department. Although each department tracks the direct
material it uses in its own department, all material is held in the
material storeroom. The inventory will be requisitioned for each
department as needed.

   During the month, Rock City Percussion's shaping
department requested $10,179 in direct material and started
into production 8,700 hickory drumsticks of size 5A. There was

934 | 8.11 Equivalent Units - initial period
no beginning inventory in the shaping department, and 7,500
drumsticks were completed in that department and
transferred to the finishing department. Wood is the only
direct material in the shaping department, and it is added at
the beginning of the process, so the work in process (WIP)
is considered to be 100% complete with respect to direct
materials. At the end of the month, the drumsticks still in the
shaping department were estimated to be 35% complete with
respect to conversion costs. All materials are added at the
beginning of the shaping process. While beginning the size 5A
drumsticks, the shaping department incurred these costs in
July:

Figure 8.65 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA

These costs are then used to calculate the equivalent units and
total production costs in a four-step process.

Step One: Determining the Units to Which
Costs Will Be Assigned

In addition to the equivalent units, it is necessary to track the
units completed as well as the units remaining in ending
inventory. A similar process is used to account for the costs
completed and transferred. Reconciling the number of units

                                             8.11 Equivalent Units - initial period | 935
and the costs is part of the process costing system. The
reconciliation involves the total of beginning inventory and
units started into production. This total is called "units to
account for," while the total of beginning inventory costs and
costs added to production is called "costs to be accounted for."
Knowing the total units or costs to account for is helpful since it
also equals the units or costs transferred out plus the amount
remaining in ending inventory.

   When the new batch of hickory sticks was started on July 1,
Rock City Percussion did not have any beginning inventory and
started 8,700 units, so the total number of units to account for
in the reconciliation is 8,700:

Figure 8.66 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA

The shaping department completed 7,500 units and
transferred them to the testing and sorting department. No
units were lost to spoilage, which consists of any units that
are not fit for sale due to breakage or other imperfections.
Since the maximum number of units that could possibly be
completed is 8,700, the number of units in the shaping
department's ending inventory must be 1,200. The total of the
7,500 units completed and transferred out and the 1,200 units
in ending inventory equal the 8,700 possible units in the
shaping department.

936 | 8.11 Equivalent Units - initial period
Figure 8.67 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA

Step Two: Computing the Equivalent Units
of Production

All of the materials have been added to the shaping
department, but all of the conversion elements have not; the
numbers of equivalent units for material costs and for
conversion costs remaining in ending inventory are different.
All of the units transferred to the next department must be
100% complete with regard to that department's cost or they
would not be transferred. So the number of units transferred
is the same for material units and for conversion units. The
process cost system must calculate the equivalent units of
production for units completed (with respect to materials and
conversion) and for ending work in process with respect to
materials and conversion.

   For the shaping department, the materials are 100%
complete with regard to materials costs and 35% complete
with regard to conversion costs. The 7,500 units completed
and transferred out to the finishing department must be 100%
complete with regard to materials and conversion, so they
make up 7,500 (7,500  100%) units. The 1,200 ending work
in process units are 100% complete with regard to material
and have 1,200 (1,200  100%) equivalent units for material. The
1,200 ending work in process units are only 35% complete with

                                             8.11 Equivalent Units - initial period | 937
regard to conversion costs and represent 420 (1,200  35%)
equivalent units.

Figure 8.68 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA

Step Three: Determining the Cost per
Equivalent Unit

Once the equivalent units for materials and conversion are
known, the cost per equivalent unit is computed in a similar
manner as the units accounted for. The costs for material and
conversion need to reconcile with the total beginning
inventory and the costs incurred for the department during
that month.

Figure 8.69 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA

The total materials costs for the period (including any
beginning inventory costs) is computed and divided by the
equivalent units for materials. The same process is then
completed for the total conversion costs. The total of the cost
per unit for material ($1.17) and for conversion costs ($2.80) is

938 | 8.11 Equivalent Units - initial period
the total cost of each unit transferred to the finishing
department ($3.97).

Step Four: Allocating the Costs to the
Units Transferred Out and Partially
Completed in the Shaping Department

Now you can determine the cost of the units transferred out
and the cost of the units still in process in the shaping
department. To calculate the goods transferred out, simply
take the units transferred out times the sum of the two
equivalent unit costs (materials and conversion) because all
items transferred to the next department are complete with
respect to materials and conversion, so each unit brings all its
costs. But the ending WIP value is determined by taking the
product of the work in process material units and the cost per
equivalent unit for materials plus the product of the work in
process conversion units and the cost per equivalent unit for
conversion.

Figure 8.70 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA

This information is accumulated in a production cost report.
This report shows the costs used in the preparation of a
product, including the cost per unit for materials and
conversion costs, and the amount of work in process and
finished goods inventory. A complete production cost report
for the shaping department is illustrated in Figure 8.71.

process. Journal entries are used to record and report the
financial information relating to the transactions. The example
that follows illustrates how the journal entries reflect the
process costing system by recording the flow of goods and
costs through the process costing environment.

$33,500 were ordered prior to being requisitioned by each
department: $25,000 for the shaping department and $8,500
for the packaging department. The July 1 journal entry to
record the purchases on account is:

Indirect Material Used

During July, the shaping department requisitioned $10,179 in
direct material. Similar to job order costing, indirect material
costs are accumulated in the manufacturing overhead
account. The overhead costs are applied to each department
based on a predetermined overhead rate. In the example,
assume that there was an indirect material cost for water of
$400 in July that will be recorded as manufacturing overhead.
The journal entry to record the requisition and usage of direct
materials and overhead is:

During July, the packaging department requisitioned $2,000 in
direct material and overhead costs for indirect material totaled
$300 for the month of July. The journal entry to record the
requisition and usage of materials is:

Applied Manufacturing Overhead to All
Production Departments

Manufacturing overhead includes indirect material, indirect
labor, and other types of manufacturing overhead. It is difficult,
if not impossible, to trace manufacturing overhead to a specific

                                       8.13 Journal Entries in Process Costing | 945
product, and yet, the total cost per unit needs to include
overhead in order to make management decisions.

   Overhead costs are accumulated in a manufacturing
overhead account and applied to each department on the
basis of a predetermined overhead rate. Properly allocating
overhead to each department depends on finding an activity
that provides a fair basis for the allocation. It needs to be an
activity common to each department and influential in driving
the cost of manufacturing overhead. In traditional costing
systems, the most common activities used are machine hours,
direct labor in dollars, or direct labor in hours. If the number of
machine hours can be related to the manufacturing overhead,
the overhead can be applied to each department based on the
machine hours. The formula for overhead allocation is:

Figure 8.84 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA

Rock City Percussion determined that machine hours is the
appropriate base to use when allocating overhead. The
estimated annual overhead cost is $340,000 per year. It was
also estimated that the total machine hours will be 34,000
hours, so the allocation rate is computed as:

Figure 8.85 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA

The shaping department used 700 machine hours, and with
an overhead application rate of $10 per direct labor hour, the
journal entry to record the overhead allocation is:

Transferred Costs of Finished Goods from
the Shaping Department to the

When the units are transferred from the shaping department
to the packaging department, they are transferred at $3.97
per unit, as calculated previously. The amount transferred from
the shaping department is the same amount listed on the
production cost report in Figure 8.88. The journal entry is:

10.1 Budgeting Basics

The Basics of Budgeting

All companies--large and small--have limits on the amount of
money or resources they can receive and pay out. How these
resources are used to reach their goals and objectives must
be planned. The quantitative plan estimating when and how
much cash or other resources will be received and when and
how the cash or other resources will be used is the budget.
As you've learned, some of the benefits of budgeting include
improved communication, planning, coordination, and
evaluation.

   All budgets are quantitative plans for the future and will be
constructed based on the needs of the organization for which
the budget is being created. Depending on the complexity,
some budgets can take months or even years to develop. The
most common time period covered by a budget is one year,
although the time period may vary from strategic, long-term
budgets to very detailed, short-term budgets. Generally, the
closer the company is to the start of the budget's time period,
the more detailed the budget becomes.

   Management begins with a vision of the future. The long-
term vision sets the direction of the company. The vision
develops into goals and strategies that are built into the
budget and are directly or indirectly reflected on the master
budget.

   The master budget has two major categories: the financial
budget and the operating budget. The financial budget plans
the use of assets and liabilities and results in a projected
balance sheet. The operating budget helps plan future revenue
and expenses and results in a projected income statement. The

954 | 10.1 Budgeting Basics
operating budget has several subsidiary budgets that all begin
with projected sales. For example, management estimates
sales for the upcoming few years. It then breaks down
estimated sales into quarters, months, and weeks and prepares
the sales budget. The sales budget is the foundation for other
operating budgets. Management uses the number of units
from the sales budget and the company's inventory policy to
determine how many units need to be produced. This
information in units and in dollars becomes the production
budget.

   The production budget is then broken up into budgets for
materials, labor, and overhead, which use the standard
quantity and standard price for raw materials that need to be
purchased, the standard direct labor rate and the standard
direct labor hours that need to be scheduled, and the standard
costs for all other direct and indirect operating expenses.
Companies use the historic quantities of the amount of
material per unit and the hours of direct labor per unit to
compute a standard used to estimate the quantity of materials
and labor hours needed for the expected level of production.
Current costs are used to develop standard costs for the price
of materials, the direct labor rate, as well as an estimate of
overhead costs.

   The budget development process results in various budgets
for various purposes, such as revenue, expenses, or units
produced, but they all begin with a plan. To save time and
eliminate unnecessary repetition, management often starts
with the current year's budget and adjusts it to meet future
needs.

   There are various strategies companies use in adjusting the
budget amounts and planning for the future. For example,
budgets can be derived from a top-down approach or from a
bottom-up approach. Figure 10.1 shows the general difference
between the top-down approach and the bottom-up
approach. The top-down approach typically begins with senior

                                                                 10.1 Budgeting Basics | 955
management. The goals, assumptions, and predicted revenue
and expenses information are passed from the senior manager
to middle managers, who further pass the information
downward. Each department must then determine how it can
allocate its expenses efficiently while still meeting the
company goals. The benefit of this approach is that it ties in
to the strategic plan and company goals. Another benefit of
passing the amount of allowed expenses downward is that
the final anticipated costs are reduced by the vetting (fact
checking and information gathering) process.

   In the top-down approach, management must devote
attention to efficiently allocating resources to ensure that
expenses are not padded to create budgetary slack. The
drawback to this approach to budgeting is that the budget
is prepared by individuals who are not familiar with specific
operations and expenses to understand each department's
nuances.

Figure 10.1 Top-Down versus Bottom-Up Approach to Budgeting The
top-down approach to budgeting starts with upper-level
management, while the bottom-up approach starts with input from
lower-level management. By: Rice University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA
4.0

The bottom-up approach (sometimes also named a self-

956 | 10.1 Budgeting Basics
imposed or participative budget) begins at the lowest level of
the company. After senior management has communicated
the expected departmental goals, the departments then plans
and predicts their sales and estimates the amount of resources
needed to reach these goals. This information is
communicated to the supervisor, who then passes it on to
upper levels of management. The advantages of this approach
are that managers feel their work is valued and that
knowledgeable individuals develop the budget with realistic
numbers. Therefore, the budget is more likely to be attainable.
The drawback is that managers may not fully understand or
may misunderstand the strategic plan.

   Other approaches in addition to the top-down and bottom-
up approaches are a combination approach and the zero-
based budgeting approach. In the combination approach,
guidelines and targets are set at the top while the managers
work to develop a budget within the targeted parameters.

   Zero-based budgeting begins with zero dollars and then
adds to the budget only revenues and expenses that can be
supported or justified. Figure 10.2 illustrates the difference
between traditional budget preparation and zero-based
budgeting in a bottom-up budgeting scenario. The advantage
to zero-based budgeting is that unnecessary expenses are
eliminated because managers cannot justify them. The
drawback is that every expense needs to be justified, including
obvious ones, so it takes a lot of time to complete. A
compromise tactic is to use a zero-based budgeting approach
for certain expenses, like travel, that can be easily justified and
linked to the company goals.

                                                                 10.1 Budgeting Basics | 957
Figure 10.2 Comparison of Traditional Budgeting Process and
Zero-Based Budgeting Process In a bottom-up budgeting
environment, the budget process begins with lower level or
operational management. Under a traditional budgeting, last year's
budget would be the starting point for creating the current budget.
Under a zero-based budgeting approach, all budget numbers are
derived newly each year or budget cycle. By: Rice University OpenStax

Often budgets are developed so they can adjust for changes in
the volume or activity and help management make decisions.
Changes and challenges can affect the budget and have an
impact on a company's plans. A flexible budget adjusts the cost

958 | 10.1 Budgeting Basics
of goods produced for varying levels of production and is more
useful than a static budget, which remains at one amount
regardless of the production level. A flexible budget is created
at the end of the accounting period, whereas the static budget
is created before the fiscal year begins.

   Additionally Figure 10.3 shows a comparison of a static
budget and a flexible budget for Bingo's Bags, a company that
produces purses and backpacks. In the flexible budget, the
budgeted costs are calculated with actual sales, whereas in the
static budget, budgeted costs are calculated with budgeted
sales. The flexible budget allows management to see what they
would expect the budget to look like based on the actual sales
and budgeted costs. Flexible budgets are addressed in greater
detail in Prepare Flexible Budgets.

Figure 10.3 Comparison of a Flexible Budget and a Static Budget By:
Rice University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long Description

In order to handle changes that occur in the future, companies
can also use a rolling budget, which is one that is continuously
updated. While the company's goals may be multi-year, the
rolling budget is adjusted monthly, and a new month is added
as each month passes. Rolling budgets allow management to
respond to changes in estimates or actual occurrences, but it

                                                                 10.1 Budgeting Basics | 959
also takes management away from other duties as it requires
continual updating. Figure 10.4 shows an example of how a
rolling quarterly budget would work. Notice that as one month
rolls off (is completed) another month is added to the budget
so that four quarters of a year are always presented.

Figure 10.4 Rolling Budget In a quarterly operating budget, the
budget always projects forward for four months, or one quarter. By:
Rice University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long Description

Because budgets are used to evaluate a manager's
performance as well as the company's, managers are
responsible for specific expenses within their own budget.
Each manager's performance is evaluated by how well he or
she manages the revenues and expenses under his or her
control. Each individual who exercises control over spending
should have a budget specifying limits on that spending.

The Role of the Master Budget

Most organizations will create a master budget--whether that
organization is large or small, public or private, or a
merchandising, manufacturing, or service company. A master
budget is one that includes two areas, operational and
financial, each of which has its own sub-budgets.
The operating budget spans several areas that help plan and

960 | 10.1 Budgeting Basics
manage day-to-day business. The financial budget depicts the
expectations for cash inflows and outflows, including cash
payments for planned operations, the purchase or sale of
assets, the payment or financing of loans, and changes in
equity. Each of the sub-budgets is made up of separate but
interrelated budgets, and the number and type of separate
budgets will differ depending on the type and size of the
organization. For example, the sales budget predicts the sales
expected for each quarter. The direct materials budget uses
information from the sales budget to compute the number
of units necessary for production. This information is used in
other budgets, such as the direct materials budget, which
plans when materials will be purchased, how much will be
purchased, and how much that material should cost.

   Figure 10.5 shows how operating budgets and financial
budgets are related within a master budget.

                                                                 10.1 Budgeting Basics | 961
Figure 10.5 Operating Budgets, Financial Budgets, and the
Relationship between Budgets By: Rice University OpenStax CC
BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long Description

The Role of Operating Budgets

An operating budget consists of the sales budget, production
budget, direct material budget, direct labor budget, and

962 | 10.1 Budgeting Basics
overhead budget. These budgets serve to assist in planning
and monitoring the day-to-day activities of the organization
by informing management of how many units need to be
produced, how much material needs to be ordered, how many
labor hours need to be scheduled, and the amount of overhead
expected to be incurred. The individual pieces of the operating
budget collectively lead to the creation of the budgeted
income statement. For example, Big Bad Bikes estimates it will
sell 1,000 trainers for $70 each in the first quarter and prepares
a sales budget to show the sales by quarter. Management
understands that it needs to have on hand the 1,000 trainers
that it estimates will be sold. It also understands that additional
inventory needs to be on hand in the event there are additional
sales and to prepare for sales in the second quarter. This
information is used to develop a production budget. Each
trainer requires 3.2 pounds of material that usually costs $1.25
per pound. Knowing how many units are to be produced and
how much inventory needs to be on hand is used to develop a
direct materials budget.

   The direct materials budget lets managers know when and
how much raw materials need to be ordered. The same is true
for direct labor, as management knows how many units will be
manufactured and how many hours of direct labor are needed.
The necessary hours of direct labor and the estimated labor
rate are used to develop the direct labor budget. While the
materials and labor are determined from the production
budget, only the variable overhead can be determined from
the production budget. Existing information regarding fixed
manufacturing costs are combined with variable
manufacturing costs to determine the manufacturing
overhead budget. The information from the sales budget is
used to determine the sales and administrative budget. Finally,
the sales, direct materials, direct labor, fixed manufacturing
overhead budget, and sales and administrative budgets are
used to develop a pro-forma income statement.

                                                                 10.1 Budgeting Basics | 963
The Role of Financial Budgets

A financial budget consists of the cash budget, the budgeted
balance sheet, and the budget for capital expenses. Similar to
the individual budgets that make up the operating budgets,
the financial budgets serve to assist with planning and
monitoring the financing requirements of the organization.
Management plans its capital asset needs and states them
in the capital expense budget. Management addresses its
collection and payment policies to determine when it will
receive cash from sales and when it will pay the material, labor,
and overhead expenses. The capital expense budget and the
estimated payment and collection of cash allow management
to build a cash budget and determine when it will need
financing or have additional funds to pay back loans. These
budgets taken together will be part of the budgeted balance
sheet. Figure 10.5 shows how these budgets relate.

Maintaining a Cash Balance

DaQuan recently began work as a senior accountant at Mad
Coffee Company. He learned he would be responsible for
monitoring the cash balance because there is a bank loan
requirement that a minimum balance of $10,000 be
maintained with the bank at all times. DaQuan asked to see
the cash budget so he could anticipate when the balance was
most likely to go below $10,000. How can DaQuan determine
potential cash balance issues by looking at the budget?

   Solution

964 | 10.1 Budgeting Basics
   Budgeting helps plan for those times when cash is in short
supply and bills need to be paid. Proper budgeting shows
when and for how long a cash shortage may exist. DaQuan
can see the months when the cash payments exceed the cash
receipts and when the company is in danger of having a cash
balance below the minimum requirement of $10,000. Knowing
the inflow and outflow of cash will help him plan and manage
the shortage through a line of credit, delay in purchasing, delay
in hiring, or delay in payment of non-essential items.

10.2 Operating Budgets

Operating budgets are a primary component of the master
budget and involve examining the expectations for the primary
operations of the business. Assumptions such as sales in units,
sales price, manufacturing costs per unit, and direct material
needed per unit involve a significant amount of time and input
from various parts of the organization. It is important to obtain
all of the information, however, because the more accurate the
information, the more accurate the resulting budget, and the
more likely management is to effectively monitor and achieve
its budget goals.

Individual Operating Budgets

In order for an organization to align the budget with the
strategic plan, it must budget for the day-to-day operations
of the business. This means the company must understand
when and how many sales will occur, as well as what expenses
are required to generate those sales. In short, each
component--sales, production, and other expenses--must be
properly budgeted to generate the operating budget
components and the resulting pro-forma budgeted income
statement.

   The budgeting process begins with the estimate of sales.
When management has a solid estimate of sales for each
quarter, month, week, or other relevant time period, they can
determine how many units must be produced. From there,
they determine the expenditures, such as direct materials
necessary to produce the units. It is critical for the sales
estimate to be accurate so that management knows how
many units to produce. If the estimate is understated, the

                                                             10.2 Operating Budgets | 967
company will not have enough inventory to satisfy customers,
and they will not have ordered enough material or scheduled
enough direct labor to manufacture more units. Customers
may then shop somewhere else to meet their needs. Likewise,
if sales are overestimated, management will have purchased
more material than necessary and have a larger labor force
than needed. This overestimate will cause management to
have spent more cash than was necessary.

Sales Budget

The sales budget details the expected sales in units and the
sales price for the budget period. The information from the
sales budget is carried to several places in the master budget.
It is used to determine how many units must be produced as
well as when and how much cash will be collected from those
sales.

   For example, Big Bad Bikes used information from
competitor sales, its marketing department, and industry
trends to estimate the number of units that will be sold in each
quarter of the coming year. The number of units is multiplied
by the sales price to determine the sales by quarter as shown in
Figure 10.6.

The sales budget leads into the production budget to

968 | 10.2 Operating Budgets
determine how many units must be produced each week,
month, quarter, or year. It also leads into the cash receipts
budget, which will be discussed in 10.3 Financial Budgets.

Production Budget

Estimating sales leads to identifying the desired quantity of
inventory to meet the demand. Management wants to have
enough inventory to meet production, but they do not want
too much in the ending inventory to avoid paying for
unnecessary storage. Management often uses a formula to
estimate how much should remain in ending inventory.
Management wants to be flexible with its budgeting, wants to
create budgets that can grow or shrink as needed, and needs
to have inventory on hand. So the amount of ending inventory
often is a percentage of the next week's, month's, or quarter's
sales.

   In creating the production budget, a major issue is how
much inventory should be on hand. Having inventory on hand
helps the company avoid losing a customer because the
product isn't available. However, there are storage costs
associated with holding inventory as well as having a lag time
between paying to manufacture a product and receiving cash
from selling that product. Management must balance the two
issues and determine the amount of inventory that should be
available.

   When determining the number of units needed to be
produced, start with the estimated sales plus the desired
ending inventory to derive the maximum number of units that
must be available during the period. Since the number of units
in beginning inventory are already produced, subtracting the
beginning inventory from the goods available results in the
number of units that need to be produced.

   After management has estimated how many units will sell

                                                             10.2 Operating Budgets | 969
and how many units need to be in ending inventory, it develops
the production budget to compute the number of units that
need to be produced during each quarter. The formula is the
reverse of the formula for the cost of goods sold.

Figure 10.7 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA 4.0

The number of units expected to be sold plus the desired
ending inventory equals the number of units that are available.
When the beginning inventory is subtracted from the number
of units available, management knows how many units must
be produced during that quarter to meet sales.

   In a merchandising firm, retailers do not produce their
inventory but purchase it. Therefore, stores such as Walmart do
not have raw materials and instead substitute the number of
units to be purchased in place of the number of units to be
produced; the result is the merchandise inventory to be
purchased.

   To illustrate the steps in developing a production budget,
recall that Big Bad Bikes is introducing a new product that the
marketing department thinks will have strong sales. For new
products, Big Bad Bikes requires a target ending inventory of
30% of the next quarter's sales. Unfortunately, they were unable
to manufacture any units before the end of the current year,
so the first quarter's beginning inventory is 0 units. As shown
in Figure 10.7, sales in quarter 2 are estimated at 1,000 units;
since 30% is required to be in ending inventory, the ending
inventory for quarter 1 needs to be 300 units. With expected

970 | 10.2 Operating Budgets
sales of 1,000 units for quarter 2 and a required ending
inventory of 30%, or 300 units, Big Bad Bikes needs to have
1,300 units available during the quarter. Since 1,300 units
needed to be available and there are zero units in beginning
inventory, Big Bad Bikes needs to manufacture 1,300 units, as
shown in Figure 10.8

Figure 10.8 Production Budget for Big Bad Bikes By: Rice University
OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long Description

The ending inventory from one quarter is the beginning
inventory for the next quarter and the calculations are all the
same. In order to determine the ending inventory in quarter 4,
Big Bad Bikes must estimate the sales for the first quarter of
the next year. Big Bad Bikes's marketing department believes
sales will increase in each of the next several quarters, and they
estimate sales as 3,500 for the first quarter of the next year and
4,500 for the second quarter of the next year. Thirty percent of
3,500 is 1,050, so the number of units required in the ending
inventory for quarter 4 is 1,050.

   The number of units needed in production for the first
quarter of the next year provides information needed for other
budgets such as the direct materials budget, so Big Bad Bikes
must also determine the number of units needed in
production for that first quarter. The estimated sales of 3,500
and the desired ending inventory of 1,350 (30% of the next
quarter's estimated sales of 4,500) determines that 4,850 units

                                                              10.2 Operating Budgets | 971
are required during the quarter. The beginning inventory is
estimated to be 1,050, which means the number of units that
need to be produced during the first quarter of year 2 is 3,800.

   The number of units needed to be produced each quarter
was computed from the estimated sales and is used to
determine the quantity of direct or raw material to purchase,
to schedule enough direct labor to manufacture the units, and
to approximate the overhead required for production. It is also
necessary to estimate the sales for the first quarter of the next
year. The ending inventory for the current year is based on
the sales estimates for the first quarter of the following year.
From this amount, the production budget and direct materials
budget are calculated and flow to the operating and cash
budget.

Direct Materials Budget

From the production budget, management knows how many
units need to be produced in each budget period.
Management is already aware of how much material it needs
to produce each unit and can combine the direct material per
unit with the production budget to compute the direct
materials budget. This information is used to ensure the correct
quantity of materials is ordered and the correct amount is
budgeted for those materials.

   Similar to the production budget, management wants to
have an ending inventory available to ensure there are enough
materials on hand. The direct materials budget illustrates how
much material needs to be ordered and how much that
material costs. The calculation is similar to that used in the
production budget, with the addition of the cost per unit.

   If Big Bad Bikes uses 3.2 pounds of material for each trainer
it manufactures and each pound of material costs $1.25, we
can create a direct materials budget. Management's goal is

972 | 10.2 Operating Budgets
to have 20% of the next quarter's material needs on hand as
the desired ending materials inventory. Therefore, the
determination of each quarter's material needs is partially
dependent on the following quarter's production
requirements. The desired ending inventory of material is
readily determined for quarters 1 through 3 as those needs are
based on the production requirements for quarters 2 through
4. To compute the desired ending materials inventory for
quarter 4, we need the production requirements for quarter 1
of year 2. Recall that the number of units to be produced during
the first quarter of year 2 is 3,800. Thus, quarter 4 materials
ending inventory requirement is 20% of 3,800. That information
is used to compute the direct materials budget shown
in Figure 10.9.

Figure 10.9 Direct Materials Budget for Big Bad Bikes By: Rice
University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long Description

Management knows how much the materials will cost and
integrates this information into the schedule of expected cash
disbursements, which will be shown in 10.3 Financial Budgets.
This information will also be used in the budgeted income
statement and on the budgeted balance sheet. With 6,000
units estimated for sale, 3.2 pounds of material per unit, and
$1.25 per pound, the direct materials used represent $24,000

                                                              10.2 Operating Budgets | 973
of the cost of goods sold. The remaining $7,240 is included in
ending inventory as units completed and raw material.

Direct Labor Budget

Management uses the same information in the production
budget to develop the direct labor budget. This information is
used to ensure that the proper amount of staff is available for
production and that there is money available to pay for the
labor, including potential overtime. Typically, the number of
hours is computed and then multiplied by an hourly rate, so
the total direct labor cost is known.

   If Big Bad Bikes knows that they need 45 minutes or 0.75
hours of direct labor for each unit produced, and the labor rate
for this type of manufacturing is $20 per hour, the computation
for direct labor simply begins with the number of units in the
production budget. As shown in Figure 10.10, the number of
units produced each quarter multiplied by the number of
hours per unit equals the required direct labor hours needed
to be scheduled in order to meet production needs. The total
number of hours is next multiplied by the direct labor rate per
hour, and the labor cost can be budgeted and used in the cash
disbursement budget and operating budget illustrated in 10.3
Financial Budgets.

Figure 10.10 Direct Labor Budget for Big Bad Bikes By: Rice
University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long Description

974 | 10.2 Operating Budgets
The direct labor of $105,750 will be apportioned to the
budgeted income statement and budgeted balance sheet.
With 0.75 hours of direct labor per unit and $20 per direct labor
hour, each unit will cost $15 in direct labor. Of the 7,050 units
produced, 6,000 units will be sold, so $90,000 represents the
labor portion of the cost of goods sold and will be shown on
the income statement, while the remaining $15,750 will be the
labor portion of ending inventory and will be shown on the
balance sheet.

Manufacturing Overhead Budget

The manufacturing overhead budget includes the remainder
of the production costs not covered by the direct materials
and direct labor budgets. In the manufacturing overhead
budgeting process, producers will typically allocate overhead
costs depending upon their cost behavior production
characteristics, which are generally classified as either variable
or fixed. Based on this allocation process, the variable
component will be treated as occurring proportionately in
relation to budgeted activity, while the fixed component will
be treated as remaining constant. This process is similar to the
overhead allocation process you learned in studying product,
process, or activity-based costing.

   For Big Bad Bikes to create their manufacturing overhead
budget, they first determine that the appropriate driver for
assigning overhead costs to products is direct labor hours. The
overhead allocation rates for the variable overhead costs are:
indirect material of $1.00 per hour, indirect labor of $1.25 per
hour, maintenance of $0.25 per hour, and utilities of $0.50 per
hour. The fixed overhead costs per quarter are: supervisor
salaries of $15,000, fixed maintenance salaries of $4,000,
insurance of $7,000, and depreciation expenses of $3,000.

   Given the direct labor hours for each quarter from the direct

                                                              10.2 Operating Budgets | 975
labor budget, the variable costs are the number of hours
multiplied by the variable overhead application rate. The fixed
costs are the same for each quarter, as shown in the
manufacturing overhead budget in Figure 10.11.

Figure 10.11 Manufacturing Overhead Budget for Big Bad Bikes By:
Rice University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long Description

The total manufacturing overhead cost was $131,863 for 7,050
units, or $18.70 per unit (rounded). Since 6,000 units are sold,
$112,200 (6,000 units  $18.70 per unit) will be expensed as
cost of goods sold, while the remaining $19,663 will be part of
finished goods ending inventory.

Sales and Administrative Expenses Budget

The direct materials budget, the direct labor budget, and the
manufacturing overhead budget plan for all costs related to
production, while the selling and administrative expense
budget contains a listing of variable and fixed expenses
estimated to be incurred in all areas other than production
costs. While this one budget contains all nonmanufacturing
expenses, in practice, it actually comprises several small
976 | 10.2 Operating Budgets
budgets created by managers in sales and administrative
positions. All managers must follow the budget, but setting
an appropriate budget for selling and administrative functions
is complicated and is not always thoroughly understood by
managers without a background in managerial accounting.

   If Big Bad Bikes pays a sales commission of $2 per unit sold
and a transportation cost of $0.50 per unit, they can use these
costs to put together their sales and administrative budget. All
other costs are fixed costs per quarter: sales salaries of $5,000;
administrative salaries of $5,000; marketing expenses of
$5,000; insurance of $1,000; and depreciation of $2,000. The
sales and administrative budget is shown in Figure 10.12, along
with the budgeted sales used in the computation of variable
sales and administrative expenses.

Figure 10.12 Sales and Administrative Expense Budget for Big Bad
Bikes By: Rice University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long Description

Only manufacturing costs are treated as a product cost and
included in ending inventory, so all of the expenses in the sales
and administrative budget are period expenses and included
in the budgeted income statement.

                                                             10.2 Operating Budgets | 977
Budgeted Income Statement

A budgeted income statement is formatted similarly to a
traditional income statement except that it contains budgeted
data. Once all of the operating budgets have been created,
these costs are used to prepare a budgeted income statement
and budgeted balance sheet. The manufacturing costs are
allocated to the cost of goods sold and the ending inventory.

   Big Bad Bikes uses the information on direct materials
(Figure 10.9), direct labor (Figure 10.10), and manufacturing
overhead (Figure 10.11) to allocate the manufacturing costs
between the cost of goods sold and the ending work in process
inventory, as shown in (Figure 10.13).

Figure 10.13 Allocating Costs to Cost of Goods Sold and Ending Work
in Process Inventory for Big Bad Bikes By: Rice University OpenStax
CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Once they perform this allocation, the budgeted income
statement can be prepared. Big Bad Bikes estimates an
interest of $954. It also estimates that $22,000 of its income will
not be collected and will be reported as uncollectible expense.
The budgeted income statement is shown in Figure 10.14.

10.3 Financial Budgets

Now that you have developed an understanding of operating
budgets, let's turn to the other primary component of the
master budget: financial budgets. Preparing financial budgets
involves examining the expectations for financing the
operations of the business and planning for the cash needs
of the organization. The budget helps estimate the source,
amount, and timing of cash collection and cash payments as
well as determine if and when additional financing is needed
or debt can be paid.

Individual Financial Budgets

Preparing a financial budget first requires preparing the
capital asset budget, the cash budgets, and the budgeted
balance sheet. The capital asset budget represents a
significant investment in cash, and the amount is carried to
the cash budget. Therefore, it needs to be prepared before the
cash budget. If the cash will not be available, the capital asset
budget can be adjusted and, again, carried to the cash budget.

   When the budgets are complete, the beginning and ending
balance from the cash budget, changes in financing, and
changes in equity are shown on the budgeted balance sheet.

Capital Asset Budget

The capital asset budget, also called the capital expenditure
budget, shows the company's plans to invest in long-term
assets. Some assets, such as computers, must be replaced

982 | 10.3 Financial Budgets
every few years, while other assets, such as manufacturing
equipment, are purchased very infrequently. Some assets can
be purchased with cash, whereas others may require a loan.
Budgeting for these types of expenditures requires long-range
planning because the purchases affect cash flows in current
and future periods and affect the income statement due to
depreciation and interest expenses.

Cash Budget

The cash budget is the combined budget of all inflows and
outflows of cash. It should be divided into the shortest time
period possible, so management can be quickly made aware
of potential problems resulting from fluctuations in cash flow.
One goal of this budget is to anticipate the timing of cash
inflows and outflows, which allows a company to try to avoid
a decrease in the cash balance due to paying out more cash
than it receives. In order to provide timely feedback and alert
management to short-term cash needs, the cash flow budget
is commonly geared toward monthly or quarterly
figures. Figure 10.15 shows how the other budgets tie into the
cash budget.

                                                               10.3 Financial Budgets | 983
Figure 10.15 Relationship between Budgets By: Rice University
OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long Description

Cash is so important to the operations of a company that, often,
companies will arrange to have an emergency cash source,
such as a line of credit, to avoid defaulting on current payables
due and also to protect against other unanticipated expenses,
such as major repair costs on equipment. This line of credit
would be similar in function to the overdraft protection offered
on many checking accounts.

   Because the cash budget accounts for every inflow and
outflow of cash, it is broken down into smaller components.
The cash collections schedule includes all of the cash inflow
expected to be received from customer sales, whether those
customers pay at the same rate or even if they pay at all. The
cash collections schedule includes all the cash expected to be
received and does not include the amount of the receivables
estimated as uncollectible. The cash payments schedule plans
the outflow or payments of all accounts payable, showing
when cash will be used to pay for direct material purchases.
Both the cash collections schedule and the cash payments
schedule are included along with other cash transactions in

984 | 10.3 Financial Budgets
a cash budget. The cash budget, then, combines the cash
collection schedule, the cash payment schedule, and all other
budgets that plan for the inflow or outflow of cash. When
everything is combined into one budget, that budget shows if
financing arrangements are needed to maintain balances or if
excess cash is available to pay for additional liabilities or assets.

   The operating budgets all begin with the sales budget. The
cash collections schedule does as well. Since purchases are
made at varying times during the period and cash is received
from customers at varying rates, data are needed to estimate
how much will be collected in the month of sale, the month
after the sale, two months after the sale, and so forth. Bad
debts also need to be estimated, since that is cash that will not
be collected.

   To illustrate, let's return to Big Bad Bikes. They believe cash
collections for the trainer sales will be similar to the collections
from their bicycle sales, so they will use that pattern to budget
cash collections for the trainers. In the quarter of sales, 65%
of that quarter's sales will be collected. In the quarter after
the sale, 30% will be collected. This leaves 5% of the sales
considered uncollectible. Figure 10.16 illustrates when each
quarter's sales will be collected. An estimate of the net
realizable balance of Accounts Receivable can be reconciled by
using information from the cash collections schedule:

Figure 10.16 By: Rice University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long

                                                               10.3 Financial Budgets | 985
Figure 10.17 Illustration of a Cash Collections Schedule By: Rice
University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long Description

For example, in quarter 1 of year 2, 65% of the quarter 1 sales will
be collected in cash, as well as 30% of the sales from quarter
4 of the prior year. There were no sales in quarter 4 of the
prior year so 30% of zero sales shows the collections are $0.
Using information from Big Bad Bikes sales budget, the cash
collections from the sales are shown in Figure 10.18.

Figure 10.18 Cash Collections Schedule for Big Bad Bikes By: Rice
University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long Description

When the cash collections schedule is made for sales,
management must account for other potential cash
collections such as cash received from the sale of equipment
or the issuance of stock. These are listed individually in the cash
inflows portion of the cash budget.

   The cash payments schedule, on the other hand, shows
986 | 10.3 Financial Budgets
when cash will be used to pay for Accounts Payable. One such
example are direct material purchases, which originates from
the direct materials budget. When the production budget is
determined from the sales, management prepares the direct
materials budget to determine when and how much material
needs to be ordered. Orders for materials take place
throughout the quarter, and payments for the purchases are
made at different intervals from the orders. A schedule of cash
payments is similar to the cash collections schedule, except
that it accounts for the company's purchases instead of the
company's sales. The information from the cash payments
schedule feeds into the cash budget.

   Big Bad Bikes typically pays half of its purchases in the
quarter of purchase. The remaining half is paid in the following
quarter, so payments in the first quarter include payments for
purchases made during the first quarter as well as half of the
purchases for the preceding quarter. Figure 10.19 shows when
each quarter's purchases will be paid. Additionally, the balance
of purchases in Accounts Payable can be reconciled by using
information from the cash payment schedule as follows:

The first quarter of the year plans cash payments from the prior
quarter as well as the current quarter. Again, since the trainers
are a new product, in this example, there are no purchases in
the preceding quarter, and the payments are $0. Figure 10.21.

While the cash payments schedule is made for purchases of
material on account, there are other outflows of cash for the
company, and management must estimate all other cash
payments for the year. Typically, this includes the
manufacturing overhead budget, the sales and administrative
budget, the capital asset budget, and any other potential
payments of cash. Since depreciation is an expense not
requiring cash, the cash budget includes the amount from
the budgets less depreciation. Cash payments are listed on

988 | 10.3 Financial Budgets
the cash budget following cash receipts. Figure 10.22 shows the
major components of the cash budget.

budget will contain all the budgeted cash inflows and out flows from

4.0 Long Description

The cash budget totals the cash receipts and adds it to the
beginning cash balance to determine the available cash. From
the available cash, the cash payments are subtracted to
compute the net cash excess or deficiency of cash for the
quarter. This amount is the potential ending cash balance.
Organizations typically require a minimum cash balance. If the
potential ending cash balance does not meet the minimum
amount, management must plan to acquire financing to reach
that amount. If the potential ending cash balance exceeds the
minimum cash balance, the excess amount may be used to
pay any financing loans and interest.

   Big Bad Bikes has a minimum cash balance requirement of
$10,000 and has a line of credit available for an interest rate of
19%. They also plan to issue additional capital stock for $5,000
in the first quarter, to pay taxes of $1,000 during each quarter,
and to purchase a copier for $8,500 cash in the third quarter.

                                                               10.3 Financial Budgets | 989
The beginning cash balance for Big Bad Bikes is $13,000, which

Budgeted Balance Sheet

The cash budget shows how cash changes from the beginning
of the year to the end of the year, and the ending cash balance
is the amount shown on the budgeted balance sheet.
The budgeted balance sheet is the estimated assets, liabilities,
and equities that the company would have at the end of the
year if their performance were to meet its expectations. Table
10.1 shows a list of the most common changes to the balance
sheet and where the information is derived.

Other balance sheet changes throughout the year are reflected
in the income statement and statement of cash flows. For
example, the beginning cash balance of Accounts Receivable
plus the sales, less the cash collected results in the ending
balance of Accounts Receivable. A similar formula is used to
compute the ending balance in Accounts Payable. Other
budgets and information such as the capital asset budget,
depreciation, and financing loans are used as well.

   To explain how to use a budgeted balance sheet, let's return
to Big Bad Bikes. For simplicity, assume that they did not have
accounts receivable or payable at the beginning of the year.
They also incurred and paid back their financing during the
year, so there is no ending debt. However, the cash budget
shows cash inflows and outflows not related to sales or the
purchase of materials. The company's capital assets increased
by $8,500 from the copier purchase, and their common stock
increased by $5,000 from the additional issue as shown
in Figure 10.24.

Though there seem to be many budgets, they all fit together
like a puzzle to create an overall picture of how a company
expects the upcoming business year to look. Figure
10.15 detailed the components of the master budget, and can
be used to summarize the budget process. All budgets begin
with the sales budget. This budget estimates the number of
units that need to be manufactured and precedes the
production budget. The production budget (refer to Figure
10.5) provides the necessary information for the budgets
needed to plan how many units will be produced. Knowing
how many units need to be produced from the production
budget, the direct materials budget, direct labor budget, and
the manufacturing overhead budget are all prepared. The sales
and administrative budget is a nonmanufacturing budget that
relies on the sales estimates to pay commissions and other
variable expenses. The sales and expenses estimated in all of

992 | 10.3 Financial Budgets
these budgets are used to develop a budgeted income
statement.

   The estimated sales information is used to prepare the cash
collections schedule, and the direct materials budget is used
to prepare the cash payment schedule. The cash receipts and
cash payments budget are combined with the direct labor
budget, the manufacturing overhead budget, the sales and
administrative budget, and the capital assets budget to
develop the cash budget. Finally, all the information is used to
flow to the budgeted balance sheet.

10.4 Flexible Budgets

A company makes a budget for the smallest time period
possible so that management can find and adjust problems
to minimize their impact on the business. Everything starts
with the estimated sales, but what happens if the sales are
more or less than expected? How does this affect the budget?
What adjustments does a company have to make in order
to compare the actual numbers to budgeted numbers when
evaluating results? If production is higher than planned and
has been increased to meet the increased sales, expenses will
be over budget. But is this bad? To account for actual sales
and expenses differing from budgeted sales and expenses,
companies will often create flexible budgets to allow budgets
to fluctuate with future demand.

Flexible Budgets

A flexible budget is one based on different volumes of sales. A
flexible budget flexes the static budget for each anticipated
level of production. This flexibility allows management to
estimate what the budgeted numbers would look like at
various levels of sales. Flexible budgets are prepared at each
analysis period (usually monthly), rather than in advance, since
the idea is to compare the operating income to the expenses
deemed appropriate at the actual production level.

   Big Bad Bikes is planning to use a flexible budget when they
begin making trainers. The company knows its variable costs
per unit and knows it is introducing its new product to the
marketplace. Its estimations of sales and sales price will likely
change as the product takes hold and customers purchase
it. Big Bad Bikes developed a flexible budget that shows the

                                                                 10.4 Flexible Budgets | 997
change in income and expenses as the number of units
changes. It also looked at the effect a change in price would
have if the number of units remained the same. The expenses
that do not change are the fixed expenses, as shown in Figure
10.25.

Figure 10.25 Flexible Budget for Big Bad Bikes By: Rice University
OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long Description

Static versus Flexible Budgets

A static budget is one that is prepared based on a single level
of output for a given period. The master budget, and all the
budgets included in the master budget, are examples of static
budgets. Actual results are compared to the static budget
numbers as one means to evaluate company performance.
However, this comparison may be like comparing apples to
oranges because variable costs should follow production,
which should follow sales. Thus, if sales differ from what is
budgeted, then comparing actual costs to budgeted costs may
not provide a clear indicator of how well the company is

998 | 10.4 Flexible Budgets
meeting its targets. A flexible budget created each period
allows for a comparison of apples to apples because it will
calculate budgeted costs based on the actual sales activity.

   For example, Figure 10.26 shows a static quarterly budget for
1,500 trainers sold by Big Bad Bikes. The budget will change if
there are more or fewer units sold.

Figure 10.26 Static Budget for Big Bad Bikes By: Rice University
OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long Description

Budget with Varying Levels of Production

Companies develop a budget based on their expectations for
                                                                 10.4 Flexible Budgets | 999
their most likely level of sales and expenses. Often, a company
can expect that their production and sales volume will vary
from budget period to budget period. They can use their
various expected levels of production to create a flexible
budget that includes these different levels of production. Then,
they can modify the flexible budget when they have their
actual production volume and compare it to the flexible
budget for the same production volume. A flexible budget is
more complicated, requires a solid understanding of a
company's fixed and variable expenses, and allows for greater
control over changes that occur throughout the year. For
example, suppose a proposed sale of items does not occur
because the expected client opted to go with another supplier.
In a static budget situation, this would result in large variances
in many accounts due to the static budget being set based on
sales that included the potential large client. A flexible budget
on the other hand would allow management to adjust their
expectations in the budget for both changes in costs and
revenue that would occur from the loss of the potential client.
The changes made in the flexible budget would then be
compared to what actually occurs to result in more realistic and
representative variance. This ability to change the budget also
makes it easier to pinpoint who is responsible if a revenue or
cost target is missed.

   Big Bad Bikes used the flexible budget concept to develop
a budget based on its expectation that production levels will
vary by quarter. By the fourth quarter, sales are expected to be
strong enough to pay back the financing from earlier in the
year. The budget shown in Figure 10.27 illustrates the payment
of interest and contains information helpful to management
when determining which items should be produced if
production capacity is limited.

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

Flexible Budgets and Sustainability

The ability to provide flexible budgets can be critical in new or
changing businesses where the accuracy of estimating sales
or usage my not be strong. For example, organizations are
often reporting their sustainability efforts and may have some
products that require more electricity than other products. The
reporting of the energy per unit of output has sometimes been
in error and can mislead management into making changes
that may or may not help the company. For example, based
on the energy per unit reported, management may decide to

                                                                10.4 Flexible Budgets | 1001
change the product mix, the amount that is outsourced, and/or
the amount that is produced.1 If the energy output isn't correct,
the decisions may be wrong and create an adverse impact on
the budget.

10.5 Fundamentals of
Standard Costs

A syllabus is one way an instructor can communicate
expectations to students. Students can use the syllabus to plan
their studying to maximize their grade and to coordinate the
amount and timing of studying for each course. Knowing what
is expected, and when it is expected, allows for better plans
and performance. When your performance does not match
your expectations, a variance arises--a difference between the
standard and the actual performance. You then need to
determine why the difference occurred. You want to know why
you did not receive the grade you expected so you can make
adjustments for the next assignment to earn a better grade.

   Companies operate in a similar manner. They have an
expectation, or standard, for production. For example, if a
company is producing tables, it might establish standards for
such components as the amount of board feet of lumber
expected to be used in producing each table or the number
of hours of direct labor hours it expected to use in the table's
production. These standards can then be used in establishing
standard costs that can be used in creating an assortment of
different types of budgets.

   When a variance occurs in its standards, the company
investigates to determine the causes, so they can perform
better in the future. For example, General Motors has
standards for each item on a vehicle. It can determine the cost
and selling price of a power antenna by knowing the standard
material cost for the antenna and the standard labor cost of
adding the antenna to the vehicle. General Motors also can
add up all of the standard times for all vehicles it makes to

1006 | 10.5 Fundamentals of Standard Costs
determine if too much or too little labor was used in
production.

Fundamentals of Standard Costs

It is important to establish standards for cost at the beginning
of a period to prepare the budget; manage material, labor, and
overhead costs; and create a reasonable sales price for a good.
A standard cost is an expected cost that a company usually
establishes at the beginning of a fiscal year for prices paid
and amounts used. The standard cost is an expected amount
paid for materials costs or labor rates. The standard quantity is
the expected usage amount of materials or labor. A standard
cost may be determined by past history or industry norms.
The company can then compare the standard costs against
its actual results to measure its efficiency. Sometimes when
comparing standard costs against actual results, there is a
difference.

   This difference can be attributed to many reasons. For
example, the coffee company mentioned in the opening
vignette may expect to pay $0.50 per ounce for coffee grounds.
After the company purchased the coffee grounds, it discovered
it paid $0.60 per ounce. This variance would need to be
accounted for, and possible operational changes would occur
as a result. Cost accounting systems become more useful to
management when they include budgeted amounts to serve
as a point of comparison with actual results.

   Many departments help determine standard cost. Product
design, in conjunction with production, purchasing, and sales,
determines what the product will look like and what materials
will be used. Production works with purchasing to determine
what material will work best in production and will be the most
cost efficient. Sales will also help decide the material in terms
of customer demand. Production will work with personnel to

                                        10.5 Fundamentals of Standard Costs | 1007
determine labor costs for the product, which is based on how
long it will take to make the product, which departments will
be involved, and what type and number of employees it will
take.

   Consider how many different materials can go into a product.
For example, there are approximately 14,000 parts that
comprise the average automobile. The manufacturer will set
a standard price and a quantity used per automobile for each
part, and it will determine the labor required to install the part.
At Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' Belvidere Assembly Plant, for
example, there are approximately 5,000 employees assembling
automobiles.2 In addition to having standard costs associated
with each part, each employee has standards for the job he or
she performs.

   Standard costs are typically established for reasonably
attainable levels of efficiency (production). They serve as a
target and are useful in motivating standard performance.
An ideal standard level is set assuming that everything is
perfect, machines do not break down, employees show up on
time, there are no defects, there is no scrap, and materials are
perfect. This level of standard is not the best motivator, because
employees may see this level as unattainable. For example,
consider whether you would take a course if the letter grades
were as follows: an A is 99-100%, a B is 98-99%, a C is 97-98%,
a D is 96-97%, and below 96% is an F. These standards are
unreasonable and unrealistic, and they would not motivate
students to do well in the course.

   At the other end of the spectrum, if the standards are too
easy, there is little motivation to do better, and products may
not be properly built, may be built with inferior materials, or
both. For example, consider how you would handle the
following grading scale for your course: an A is 50-100%, a B
is 35-50%, a C is 10-35%, a D is 2-10%, and below 2% is an F.
Would you learn anything? Would you try very hard? The same

1008 | 10.5 Fundamentals of Standard Costs
considerations come into play for employees with standards
that are too easy.

   Instead of these two extremes, a company would set
an attainable standard, which is one that employees can reach
with reasonable effort. The standards are not so high that
employees will not try to reach them and not so low that they
do not give any incentive for employees to achieve profitability.

   In order for a company to establish its attainable standard
cost for each product, it must consider the standard costs for
materials, labor, and overhead. The material standard cost
consists of a standard price per unit of material and a standard
amount of material per unit. Returning to the opening
vignette, let us say the coffee shop is trying to establish the
standard materials cost for one cup of regular coffee. To keep
the example simple, we are not incorporating the cost of water
or the ceramic cup cost (since they are reused). Two
components for the cup of coffee will need to be considered:

 1. Price per ounce of coffee grounds
2. Amount of coffee grounds (materials) used per cup of

      coffee

To determine the standards for labor, the coffee shop would
need to consider two additional components:

 1. Labor rate per minute
2. Amount of time to make one cup of regular coffee

To determine the standard for overhead, the coffee shop would
first need to consider the fact that it has two types of overhead
as shown in Figure 10.28.

 1. Fixed overhead (does not change in total with production)
2. Variable overhead (does change in total with production)

All of this information is entered on a standard cost card.

Once a company determines a standard cost, they can then
evaluate any variances. A variance is the difference between a
standard cost and actual performance. There are favorable and
unfavorable variances. A favorable variance involves spending
less, or using less, than the anticipated or estimated standard.
An unfavorable variance involves spending more, or using
more, than the anticipated or estimated standard. Before
determining whether the variance is favorable or unfavorable,
it is often helpful for the company to determine why the
variance exists.

Developing a Standard Cost Card

Use the information provided to create a standard cost card for
production of one deluxe bicycle from Bicycles Unlimited.

   To make one bicycle it takes four pounds of material. The
material can usually be purchased for $5.25 per pound. The

1010 | 10.5 Fundamentals of Standard Costs
labor necessary to build a bicycle consists of two types. The first
type of labor is assembly, which takes 2.75 hours. These workers
are paid $11.00 per hour. The second type of labor is finishing,
which takes 4 hours. These workers are paid $15.00 per hour.
Overhead is applied using labor hours. The variable overhead
rate is $5.00 per labor hour. The fixed overhead rate is $3.00 per
hour.

   Solution

Figure 10.29 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA Long
Description

   Different factors may produce a variance. The company could
have paid too much or too little for production. It may have
purchased the wrong grade of material or hired employees
with more or less experience than required. Sometimes the
variances are interrelated. For example, purchasing
substandard materials may lead to using more time to make
the product and may produce more scrap. The substandard
material may have been more difficult to work with or had
more defects than the proper grade material. In such a
situation, a favorable material price variance could cause an
unfavorable labor efficiency variance and an unfavorable
material quantity variance. Employees who do not have the
expected experience level may save money in the wage rate

                                         10.5 Fundamentals of Standard Costs | 1011
but may require more hours to be worked and more material
to be used because of their inexperience.

   Another situation in which a variance may occur is when
the cost of labor and/or material changes after the standard
was established. Toward the end of the fiscal year, standards
often become less reliable because time has passed and the
environment has changed. It is not reasonable to expect the
price of all materials and labor to remain constant for 12
months. For example, the grade of material used to establish
the standard may no longer be available.

Manufacturing Cost Variances

As you've learned, the standard price and standard quantity
are anticipated amounts. Any change from these budgeted
amounts will produce a variance. There can be variances for
materials, labor, and overhead. Direct materials may have a
variance in price of materials or quantity of materials used.
Direct labor may have a variance in the rate paid to workers or
the amount of time used to make a product. Overhead may
produce a variance in expected fixed or variable costs, leading
to possible differences in production capacity and
management's ability to control overhead. More specifics on
the formulas, processes, and interpretations of the direct
materials, direct labor, and overhead variances are discussed in
each of this chapter's following sections.

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

Qualcomm3

Qualcomm Inc. is a large producer of telecommunications
equipment focusing mainly on wireless products and services.
As with any company, Qualcomm sets labor standards and
must address any variances in labor costs to stay on budget,
and control overall manufacturing costs.

   In 2018, Qualcomm announced a reduction to its labor force,
affecting many of its full-time and temporary workers. The
reduction in labor was necessary to suppress rising expenses
that could not be controlled through overhead or materials
cost-cutting measures. The variances between standard labor
rates and actual labor rates, and diminishing profit margins will
have contributed to this decision. It is important for Qualcomm
management to keep labor variances minimal in the future
so that large workforce reductions are not required to control
costs.

10.6 Direct Materials
Variances

As you've learned, direct materials are those materials used
in the production of goods that are easily traceable and are
a major component of the product. The amount of materials
used and the price paid for those materials may differ from
the standard costs determined at the beginning of a period.
A company can compute these materials variances and, from
these calculations, can interpret the results and decide how to
address these differences.

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

Buttering Popcorn

In a movie theater, management uses standards to determine
if the proper amount of butter is being used on the popcorn.
They train the employees to put two tablespoons of butter
on each bag of popcorn, so total butter usage is based on
the number of bags of popcorn sold. Therefore, if the theater
sells 300 bags of popcorn with two tablespoons of butter on
each, the total amount of butter that should be used is 600
tablespoons. Management can then compare the predicted
use of 600 tablespoons of butter to the actual amount used. If
the actual usage of butter was less than 600, customers may
not be happy, because they may feel that they did not get
enough butter. If more than 600 tablespoons of butter were
used, management would investigate to determine why. Some

                                                   10.6 Direct Materials Variances | 1015
reasons why more butter was used than expected (unfavorable
outcome) would be because of inexperienced workers pouring
too much, or the standard was set too low, producing
unrealistic expectations that do not satisfy customers.

Fundamentals of Direct Materials
Variances

The direct materials variances measure how efficient the
company is at using materials as well as how effective it is
at using materials. There are two components to a direct
materials variance, the direct materials price variance and the
direct materials quantity variance, which both compare the
actual price or amount used to the standard amount.

Direct Materials Price Variance

The direct materials price variance compares the actual price
per unit (pound or yard, for example) of the direct materials to
the standard price per unit of direct materials. The formula for
direct materials price variance is calculated as:

Figure 10.30 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA 4.0

Factoring out actual quantity used from both components of
the formula, it can be rewritten as:

1016 | 10.6 Direct Materials Variances
Figure 10.31 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA 4.0

With either of these formulas, the actual quantity used refers
to the actual amount of materials used to create one unit of
product. The standard price is the expected price paid for
materials per unit. The actual price paid is the actual amount
paid for materials per unit. If there is no difference between the
standard price and the actual price paid, the outcome will be
zero, and no price variance exists.

   If the actual price paid per unit of material is lower than
the standard price per unit, the variance will be a favorable
variance. A favorable outcome means you spent less on the
purchase of materials than you anticipated. If, however, the
actual price paid per unit of material is greater than the
standard price per unit, the variance will be unfavorable. An
unfavorable outcome means you spent more on the purchase
of materials than you anticipated.

   The actual price can differ from the standard or expected
price because of such factors as supply and demand of the
material, increased labor costs to the supplier that are passed
along to the customer, or improvements in technology that
make the material cheaper. The producer must be aware that
the difference between what it expects to happen and what
actually happens will affect all of the goods produced using
these particular materials. Therefore, the sooner management
is aware of a problem, the sooner they can fix it. For that reason,
the material price variance is computed at the time of
purchase and not when the material is used in production.

   Let us consider an example. Connie's Candy Company
produces various types of candies that they sell to retailers.
Connie's Candy establishes a standard price for candy-making

                                                   10.6 Direct Materials Variances | 1017
materials of $7.00 per pound. Each box of candy is expected
to use 0.25 pounds of candy-making materials. Connie's Candy
found that the actual price of materials was $6.00 per pound.
They still actually use 0.25 pounds of materials to make each
box. The direct materials price variance computes as:

In this case, the actual price per unit of materials is $6.00, the
standard price per unit of materials is $7.00, and the actual
quantity used is 0.25 pounds. This computes as a favorable
outcome. This is a favorable outcome because the actual price
for materials was less than the standard price. As a result of this
favorable outcome information, the company may consider
continuing operations as they exist, or could change future
budget projections to reflect higher profit margins, among
other things.

   Let us take the same example except now the actual price
for candy-making materials is $9.00 per pound. The direct
materials price variance computes as:

In this case, the actual price per unit of materials is $9.00, the
standard price per unit of materials is $7.00, and the actual
quantity used is 0.25 pounds. This computes as an unfavorable
outcome. This is an unfavorable outcome because the actual
price for materials was more than the standard price. As a
result of this unfavorable outcome information, the company
may consider using cheaper materials, changing suppliers, or
increasing prices to cover costs.

   Another element this company and others must consider is
a direct materials quantity variance.

1018 | 10.6 Direct Materials Variances
Direct Materials Quantity Variance

The direct materials quantity variance compares the actual
quantity of materials used to the standard materials that were
expected to be used to make the actual units produced. The
variance is calculated using this formula:

Figure 10.32 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA 4.0

Factoring out standard price from both components of the
formula, it can be rewritten as:

Figure 10.33 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA 4.0

With either of these formulas, the actual quantity used refers to
the actual amount of materials used at the actual production
output. The standard price is the expected price paid for
materials per unit. The standard quantity is the expected
amount of materials used at the actual production output. If
there is no difference between the actual quantity used and
the standard quantity, the outcome will be zero, and no
variance exists.

   If the actual quantity of materials used is less than the
standard quantity used at the actual production output level,
the variance will be a favorable variance. A favorable outcome
means you used fewer materials than anticipated, to make
the actual number of production units. If, however, the actual

                                                   10.6 Direct Materials Variances | 1019
quantity of materials used is greater than the standard
quantity used at the actual production output level, the
variance will be unfavorable. An unfavorable outcome means
you used more materials than anticipated to make the actual
number of production units.

   The actual quantity used can differ from the standard
quantity because of improved efficiencies in production,
carelessness or inefficiencies in production, or poor estimation
when creating the standard usage.

   Consider the previous example with Connie's Candy
Company. Connie's Candy established a standard price for
candy-making materials of $7.00 per pound. Each box of candy
is expected to use 0.25 pounds of candy-making materials.
Connie's Candy found that the actual quantity of candy-
making materials used to produce one box of candy was 0.20
per pound. The direct materials quantity variance computes as:

In this case, the actual quantity of materials used is 0.20
pounds, the standard price per unit of materials is $7.00, and
the standard quantity used is 0.25 pounds. This computes as
a favorable outcome. This is a favorable outcome because the
actual quantity of materials used was less than the standard
quantity expected at the actual production output level. As a
result of this favorable outcome information, the company may
consider continuing operations as they exist, or could change
future budget projections to reflect higher profit margins,
among other things.

   Let us take the same example except now the actual quantity
of candy-making materials used to produce one box of candy
was 0.50 per pound. The direct materials quantity variance
computes as:

In this case, the actual quantity of materials used is 0.50
pounds, the standard price per unit of materials is $7.00, and

1020 | 10.6 Direct Materials Variances
the standard quantity used is 0.25 pounds. This computes as an
unfavorable outcome. This is an unfavorable outcome because
the actual quantity of materials used was more than the
standard quantity expected at the actual production output
level. As a result of this unfavorable outcome information, the
company may consider retraining workers to reduce waste or
change their production process to decrease materials needs
per box.

   The combination of the two variances can produce one
overall total direct materials cost variance.

Total Direct Materials Cost Variance

When a company makes a product and compares the actual
materials cost to the standard materials cost, the result is
the total direct materials cost variance.

Figure 10.34 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA 4.0

An unfavorable outcome means the actual costs related to
materials were more than the expected (standard) costs. If the
outcome is a favorable outcome, this means the actual costs
related to materials are less than the expected (standard) costs.

   The total direct materials cost variance is also found by
combining the direct materials price variance and the direct
materials quantity variance. By showing the total materials
variance as the sum of the two components, management
can better analyze the two variances and enhance decision-
making.

materials price variance and direct materials quantity variance
to total direct materials cost variance.

For example, Connie's Candy Company expects to pay $7.00
per pound for candy-making materials but actually pays $9.00
per pound. The company expected to use 0.25 pounds of
materials per box but actually used 0.50 per box. The total
direct materials variance is computed as:

In this case, two elements contribute to the unfavorable
outcome. Connie's Candy paid $2.00 per pound more for
materials than expected and used 0.25 pounds more of
materials than expected to make one box of candy.

   The same calculation is shown using the outcomes of the
direct materials price and quantity variances.

changes to production elements as a result.

10.7 Direct Labor
Variances

In addition to evaluating materials usage, companies must
assess how efficiently and effectively they are using labor in the
production of their products. Direct labor is a cost associated
with workers working directly in the production process. The
company must look at both the quantity of hours used and
the rate of the labor and compare outcomes to standard costs.
Determining efficiency and effectiveness of labor leads to
individual labor variances. A company can compute these labor
variances and make informed decisions about labor operations
based on these differences.

Fundamentals of Direct Labor Variances

The direct labor variance measures how efficiently the
company uses labor as well as how effective it is at pricing
labor. There are two components to a labor variance, the direct
labor rate variance and the direct labor time variance.

Direct Labor Rate Variance

The direct labor rate variance compares the actual rate per
hour of direct labor to the standard rate per hour of labor for
the hours worked. The direct labor rate variance is calculated
using this formula:

1026 | 10.7 Direct Labor Variances
Figure 10.38 By: Rice University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Factoring out the actual hours worked from both components
of the formula, it can be rewritten as

Figure 10.39 By: Rice University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

With either of these formulas, the actual rate per hour refers to
the actual rate of pay for workers to create one unit of product.
The standard rate per hour is the expected rate of pay for
workers to create one unit of product. The actual hours worked
are the actual number of hours worked to create one unit of
product. If there is no difference between the standard rate and
the actual rate, the outcome will be zero, and no variance exists.

   If the actual rate of pay per hour is less than the standard
rate of pay per hour, the variance will be a favorable variance.
A favorable outcome means you paid workers less than
anticipated. If, however, the actual rate of pay per hour is
greater than the standard rate of pay per hour, the variance
will be unfavorable. An unfavorable outcome means you paid
workers more than anticipated.

   The actual rate can differ from the standard or expected
rate because of supply and demand of the workers, increased
labor costs due to economic changes or union contracts, or
the ability to hire employees at a different skill level. Once the
manufacturer makes the products, the labor costs will follow
the goods through production, so the company should

                                                       10.7 Direct Labor Variances | 1027
evaluate how the difference between what it expected to
happen and what actually happened will affect all the goods
produced using these particular labor rates.

   Let us again consider Connie's Candy Company with respect
to labor. Connie's Candy establishes a standard rate per hour
for labor of $8.00. Each box of candy is expected to require
0.10 hours of labor (6 minutes). Connie's Candy found that the
actual rate of pay per hour for labor was $7.50. They still actually
required 0.10 hours of labor to make each box. The direct labor
rate variance computes as:

   In this case, the actual rate per hour is $7.50, the standard
rate per hour is $8.00, and the actual hour worked is 0.10 hours
per box. This computes as a favorable outcome. This is a
favorable outcome because the actual rate of pay was less than
the standard rate of pay. As a result of this favorable outcome
information, the company may consider continuing operations
as they exist, or could change future budget projections to
reflect higher profit margins, among other things.

   Let us take the same example except now the actual rate of
pay per hour is $9.50. The direct labor rate variance computes
as:

   In this case, the actual rate per hour is $9.50, the standard
rate per hour is $8.00, and the actual hours worked per box
are 0.10 hours. This computes as an unfavorable outcome. This
is an unfavorable outcome because the actual rate per hour
was more than the standard rate per hour. As a result of this
unfavorable outcome information, the company may consider
using cheaper labor, changing the production process to be
more efficient, or increasing prices to cover labor costs.

   Another element this company and others must consider is
a direct labor time variance.

1028 | 10.7 Direct Labor Variances
Direct Labor Time Variance

The direct labor time variance compares the actual labor hours
used to the standard labor hours that were expected to be used
to make the actual units produced. The variance is calculated
using this formula:

Figure 10.40 By: Rice University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Factoring out the standard rate per hour from both
components of the formula, it can be rewritten as:

Figure 10.41 By: Rice University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

With either of these formulas, the actual hours worked refers
to the actual number of hours used at the actual production
output. The standard rate per hour is the expected hourly rate
paid to workers. The standard hours are the expected number
of hours used at the actual production output. If there is no
difference between the actual hours worked and the standard
hours, the outcome will be zero, and no variance exists.

   If the actual hours worked are less than the standard hours
at the actual production output level, the variance will be a
favorable variance. A favorable outcome means you used fewer
hours than anticipated to make the actual number of
production units. If, however, the actual hours worked are
greater than the standard hours at the actual production
output level, the variance will be unfavorable. An unfavorable

outcome means you used more hours than anticipated to
make the actual number of production units.

   The actual hours used can differ from the standard hours
because of improved efficiencies in production, carelessness or
inefficiencies in production, or poor estimation when creating
the standard usage.

   Consider the previous example with Connie's Candy
Company. Connie's Candy establishes a standard rate per hour
for labor of $8.00. Each box of candy is expected to require
0.10 hours of labor (6 minutes). Connie's Candy found that the
actual hours worked per box were 0.05 hours (3 minutes). The
actual rate per hour for labor remained at $8.00 to make each
box. The direct labor time variance computes as:

   In this case, the actual hours worked are 0.05 per box, the
standard hours are 0.10 per box, and the standard rate per
hour is $8.00. This computes as a favorable outcome. This is a
favorable outcome because the actual hours worked were less
than the standard hours expected. As a result of this favorable
outcome information, the company may consider continuing
operations as they exist, or could change future budget
projections to reflect higher profit margins, among other
things.

   Let us take the same example except now the actual hours
worked are 0.20 hours per box. The direct labor time variance
computes as:

   In this case, the actual hours worked per box are 0.20, the
standard hours per box are 0.10, and the standard rate per
hour is $8.00. This computes as an unfavorable outcome. This
is an unfavorable outcome because the actual hours worked
were more than the standard hours expected per box. As a
result of this unfavorable outcome information, the company

1030 | 10.7 Direct Labor Variances
may consider retraining its workers, changing the production
process to be more efficient, or increasing prices to cover labor
costs.

   The combination of the two variances can produce one
overall total direct labor cost variance.

Total Direct Labor Variance

When a company makes a product and compares the actual
labor cost to the standard labor cost, the result is the total
direct labor variance.

Figure 10.42 By: Rice University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

If the outcome is unfavorable, the actual costs related to labor
were more than the expected (standard) costs. If the outcome
is favorable, the actual costs related to labor are less than the
expected (standard) costs.

   The total direct labor variance is also found by combining the
direct labor rate variance and the direct labor time variance.
By showing the total direct labor variance as the sum of the
two components, management can better analyze the two
variances and enhance decision-making.

   Figure 10.43 shows the connection between the direct labor
rate variance and direct labor time variance to total direct labor
variance.

For example, Connie's Candy Company expects to pay a rate
of $8.00 per hour for labor but actually pays $9.50 per hour.
The company expected to use 0.10 hours of labor per box but
actually used 0.20 hours per box. The total direct labor variance
is computed as:

   In this case, two elements are contributing to the unfavorable
outcome. Connie's Candy paid $1.50 per hour more for labor
than expected and used 0.10 hours more than expected to
make one box of candy. The same calculation is shown as

CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE

Labor Costs in Service Industries

In the service industry, labor is the main cost. Doctors, for
example, have a time allotment for a physical exam and base
their fee on the expected time. Insurance companies pay
doctors according to a set schedule, so they set the labor
standard. They pay a set rate for a physical exam, no matter
how long it takes. If the exam takes longer than expected,
the doctor is not compensated for that extra time. This would
produce an unfavorable labor variance for the doctor. Doctors
know the standard and try to schedule accordingly so a
variance does not exist. If anything, they try to produce a
favorable variance by seeing more patients in a quicker time
frame to maximize their compensation potential.

10.8 Overhead
Variances

Recall that the standard cost of a product includes not only
materials and labor but also variable and fixed overhead. It
is likely that the amounts determined for standard overhead
costs will differ from what actually occurs. This will lead
to overhead variances.

Determination and Evaluation of
Overhead Variance

In a standard cost system, overhead is applied to the goods
based on a standard overhead rate. This is similar to the
predetermined overhead rate used previously. The standard
overhead rate is calculated by dividing budgeted overhead at
a given level of production (known as normal capacity) by the
level of activity required for that particular level of production.

Figure 10.46 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA 4.0

Usually, the level of activity is either direct labor hours or direct
labor cost, but it could be machine hours or units of production.

1036 | 10.8 Overhead Variances
Creation of Flexible Overhead Budget

To determine the overhead standard cost, companies prepare
a flexible budget that gives estimated revenues and costs at
varying levels of production. The standard overhead cost is
usually expressed as the sum of its component parts, fixed
and variable costs per unit. Note that at different levels of
production, total fixed costs are the same, so the standard fixed
cost per unit will change for each production level. However,
the variable standard cost per unit is the same per unit for each
level of production, but the total variable costs will change.

   We continue to use Connie's Candy Company to illustrate.
Suppose Connie's Candy budgets capacity of production at
100% and determines expected overhead at this capacity.
Connie's Candy also wants to understand what overhead cost
outcomes will be at 90% capacity and 110% capacity. The
following information is the flexible budget Connie's Candy
prepared to show expected overhead at each capacity level.

Figure 10.47 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA 4.0 Long
Description

Units of output at 100% is 1,000 candy boxes (units). The
standard overhead rate is the total budgeted overhead of
$10,000 divided by the level of activity (direct labor hours) of
2,000 hours. Notice that fixed overhead remains constant at

                                                           10.8 Overhead Variances | 1037
each of the production levels, but variable overhead changes
based on unit output. If Connie's Candy only produced at 90%
capacity, for example, they should expect total overhead to
be $9,600 and a standard overhead rate of $5.33 (rounded).
If Connie's Candy produced 2,200 units, they should expect
total overhead to be $10,400 and a standard overhead rate of
$4.73 (rounded). In addition to the total standard overhead rate,
Connie's Candy will want to know the variable overhead rates
at each activity level.

   Using the flexible budget, we can determine the standard
variable cost per unit at each level of production by taking the
total expected variable overhead divided by the level of activity,
which can still be direct labor hours or machine hours.

Figure 10.48 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA 4.0

Looking at Connie's Candies, the following table shows the
variable overhead rate at each of the production capacity levels.

  Table 10.2 Variable Overhead Rate at
each Production Capacity Level By: Rice

 University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Production Capacity      Variable/Unit

90%$3,600  1,800 = $2

100%$4,000  2,000 = $2

110%$4,400  2,200 = $2

Sometimes these flexible budget figures and overhead rates
differ from the actual results, which produces a variance.

1038 | 10.8 Overhead Variances
Determination of Variable Overhead
Variances

There are two components to variable overhead rates: the
overhead application rate and the activity level against which
that rate was applied. If we compare the actual variable
overhead to the standard variable overhead, by analyzing the
difference between actual overhead costs and the standard
overhead for current production, it is difficult to determine if
the variance is due to application rate differences or activity
level differences. Thus, there are two variable overhead
variances that will better provide these answers: the variable
overhead rate variance and the variable overhead efficiency
variance.

Determination of Variable Overhead Rate
Variance

The variable overhead rate variance, also known as the
spending variance, is the difference between the actual
variable manufacturing overhead and the variable overhead
that was expected given the number of hours worked. The
variable overhead rate variance is calculated using this formula:

Figure 10.49 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA 4.0

Factoring out actual hours worked, we can rewrite the formula
as

                                                           10.8 Overhead Variances | 1039
Figure 10.50 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA 4.0

If the outcome is favorable (a negative outcome occurs in the
calculation), this means the company spent less than what
it had anticipated for variable overhead. If the outcome is
unfavorable (a positive outcome occurs in the calculation), this
means the company spent more than what it had anticipated
for variable overhead.

   Connie's Candy Company wants to determine if its variable
overhead spending was more or less than anticipated. Connie's
Candy had this data available in the flexible budget:

Figure 10.51 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA 4.0

Connie's Candy also had this actual output information:

1040 | 10.8 Overhead Variances
Figure 10.52 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA 4.0

To determine the variable overhead rate variance, the standard
variable overhead rate per hour and the actual variable
overhead rate per hour must be determined. The standard
variable overhead rate per hour is $2.00 ($4,000  2,000 hours),
taken from the flexible budget at 100% capacity. The actual
variable overhead rate is $2.80 ($7,000  2,500), taken from the
actual results at 100% capacity. Therefore,

   This produces an unfavorable outcome. This could be for
many reasons, and the production supervisor would need to
determine where the variable cost difference is occurring to
make production changes.

   Let us look at another example producing a favorable
outcome. Connie's Candy had this data available in the flexible
budget:

                                                            10.8 Overhead Variances | 1041
Figure 10.53 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA 4.0

Connie's Candy also had this actual output information:

Figure 10.54 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA 4.0

To determine the variable overhead rate variance, the standard
variable overhead rate per hour and the actual variable
overhead rate per hour must be determined. The standard
variable overhead rate per hour is $2.00 ($4,000  2,000 hours),
taken from the flexible budget at 100% capacity. The actual
variable overhead rate is $1.75 ($3,500  2,000), taken from the
actual results at 100% capacity. Therefore,
1042 | 10.8 Overhead Variances
   This produces a favorable outcome. This could be for many
reasons, and the production supervisor would need to
determine where the variable cost difference is occurring to
better understand the variable overhead reduction.

   Interpretation of the variable overhead rate variance is often
difficult because the cost of one overhead item, such as
indirect labor, could go up, but another overhead cost, such
as indirect materials, could go down. Often, explanation of this
variance will need clarification from the production supervisor.
Another variable overhead variance to consider is the variable
overhead efficiency variance.

Determination of Variable Overhead
Efficiency Variance

The variable overhead efficiency variance, also known as the
controllable variance, is driven by the difference between the
actual hours worked and the standard hours expected for the
units produced. This variance measures whether the allocation
base was efficiently used. The variable overhead efficiency
variance is calculated using this formula:

Figure 10.55 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA 4.0

Factoring out standard overhead rate, the formula can be
written as

                                                           10.8 Overhead Variances | 1043
Figure 10.56 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA 4.0

If the outcome is favorable (a negative outcome occurs in the
calculation), this means the company was more efficient than
what it had anticipated for variable overhead. If the outcome
is unfavorable (a positive outcome occurs in the calculation),
this means the company was less efficient than what it had
anticipated for variable overhead.

   Connie's Candy Company wants to determine if its variable
overhead efficiency was more or less than anticipated. Connie's
Candy had the following data available in the flexible budget:

Connie's Candy also had the following actual output
information:

1044 | 10.8 Overhead Variances
Figure 10.58 By: Rice University Openstax CC BY NC SA 4.0

To determine the variable overhead efficiency variance, the
actual hours worked and the standard hours worked at the
production capacity of 100% must be determined. Actual hours
worked are 2,500, and standard hours are 2,000. The standard
variable overhead rate per hour is $2.00 ($4,000  2,000 hours),
taken from the flexible budget at 100% capacity. Therefore,

   This produces an unfavorable outcome. This could be for
many reasons, and the production supervisor would need to
determine where the variable cost difference is occurring to
make production changes.

   Let us look at another example producing a favorable
outcome. Connie's Candy had the following data available in

Connie's Candy also had the following actual output
information:

To determine the variable overhead efficiency variance, the
actual hours worked and the standard hours worked at the
production capacity of 100% must be determined. Actual hours
worked are 1,800, and standard hours are 2,000. The standard
variable overhead rate per hour is $2.00 ($4,000  2,000 hours),
taken from the flexible budget at 100% capacity. Therefore,
1046 | 10.8 Overhead Variances
   This produces a favorable outcome. This could be for many
reasons, and the production supervisor would need to
determine where the variable cost difference is occurring to
better understand the variable overhead efficiency reduction.

   The total variable overhead cost variance is also found by
combining the variable overhead rate variance and the variable
overhead efficiency variance. By showing the total variable
overhead cost variance as the sum of the two components,
management can better analyze the two variances and
enhance decision-making.

overhead rate variance and variable overhead efficiency
variance to total variable overhead cost variance.

outcome. Connie's Candy used fewer direct labor hours and
less variable overhead to produce 1,000 candy boxes (units).

   The same calculation is shown as follows in diagram format.

As with the interpretations for the variable overhead rate and
efficiency variances, the company would review the individual
components contributing to the overall favorable outcome for

decisions about production in the future. Other variances
companies consider are fixed factory overhead variances.

Fundamentals of Fixed Factory Overhead
Variances

The fixed factory overhead variance represents the difference
between the actual fixed overhead and the applied fixed
overhead. There are two fixed overhead variances. One variance

production was above or below the expected production level.

10.9 Management's
Use of Variance
Analysis

Companies use variance analysis in different ways. The starting
point is the determination of standards against which to
compare actual results. Many companies produce variance
reports, and the management responsible for the variances
must explain any variances outside of a certain range. Some
companies only require that unfavorable variances be
explained, while many companies require both favorable and
unfavorable variances to be explained.

   Requiring managers to determine what caused unfavorable
variances forces them to identify potential problem areas or
consider if the variance was a one-time occurrence. Requiring
managers to explain favorable variances allows them to assess
whether the favorable variance is sustainable. Knowing what
caused the favorable variance allows management to plan for it
in the future, depending on whether it was a one-time variance
or it will be ongoing.

   Another possibility is that management may have built the
favorable variance into the standards. Management may
overestimate the material price, labor rate, material quantity,
or labor hours per unit, for example. This method of
overestimation, sometimes called budget slack, is built into the
standards so management can still look good even if costs
are higher than planned. In either case, managers potentially
can help other managers and the company overall by noticing
particular problem areas or by sharing knowledge that can
improve variances.

   Often, management will manage "to the variances," meaning

1052 | 10.9 Management's Use of Variance Analysis
they will make decisions that may not be advantageous to
the company's best interests over the long run, in order to
meet the variance report threshold limits. This can occur when
the standards are improperly established, causing significant
differences between actual and standard numbers.

Management can use standard costs to prepare the budget for
the upcoming period, using the past information to possibly
make changes to production elements. Standard costs are a
measurement tool and can thus be used to evaluate
performance. As you've learned, management may manage
"to the variances" and can manipulate results to meet
expectations. To reduce this possibility, performance should be
measured on multiple outcomes, not simply on standard cost
variances.

   As shown in Table 10.3, standard costs have pros and cons
to consider when using them in the decision-making and
evaluation processes.

unfavorable or favorable outcomes is required to set future
expectations and adjust current production goals.

   Materials price variance:
   $50,000 unfavorable = ($16* - $15)  50,000 lb.
   *$800,000  50,000
   An unfavorable materials price variance occurred because
the actual cost of materials was greater than the expected or
standard cost. This could occur if a higher-quality material was
purchased or the suppliers raised their prices.
   Materials quantity variance:
   $150,000 unfavorable = (50,000 lb. - 40,000* lb.)  $15 per lb.
   *4 lb.  10,000 units
   An unfavorable materials quantity variance occurred
because the pounds of materials used were greater than the
pounds expected to be used. This could occur if there were
inefficiencies in production or the quality of the materials was
such that more needed to be used to meet safety or other
standards.

1058 | 10.9 Management's Use of Variance Analysis
   A favorable labor rate variance occurred because the rate
paid per hour was less than the rate expected to be paid
(standard) per hour. This could occur because the company
was able to hire workers at a lower rate, because of negotiated
union contracts, or because of a poor labor rate estimate used
in creating the standard.

   Labor quantity variance:
   $100,000 unfavorable = (25,000 hours - 20,000* hours)  $20
per hour
   *2 hours  10,000 units
   An unfavorable labor quantity variance occurred because the
actual hours worked to make the 10,000 units were greater
than the expected hours to make that many units. This could
occur because of inefficiencies of the workers, defects and
errors that caused additional time reworking items, or the use
of new workers who were less efficient.

10.10 How Budgets are
used to Evaluate Goals

As you've learned, an advantage of budgeting is evaluating
performance. Having a strong understanding of their budgets
helps managers keep track of expenses and work toward the
company's goals. Companies need to understand their revenue
and expense details to develop budgets as a tool for planning
operations and cash flow. Part of understanding revenue and
expenses is evaluating the prior year. Did the company earn the
expected profit? Could it have earned a higher profit? What
expenses or revenues were not on the budget? Critically
evaluating the actual results versus the estimated budgetary
results can help management plan for the future. Variance
analysis helps the manager analyze its results. It does not
necessarily find a problem, but it does indicate where a
problem may exist. The same is true for favorable variances as
well as unfavorable variances. A favorable variance occurs when
revenue is higher than budgeted or expenses are lower than
budgeted. An unfavorable variance is when revenue is lower
than budgeted or expenses are higher than budgeted.

Table 10.4 Comparing Favorable to Unfavorable Variances By: Rice
                     University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Favorable                   Unfavorable

Actual Sales > Budgeted Sales Actual Sales < Budgeted Sales

Actual Expenses < Budgeted  Actual Expenses > Budgeted
Expenses                    expenses

It is easy to understand that an unfavorable variance may be a
problem. But that is not always true, as a higher labor rate may
mean the company has a higher quality employee who is able
to waste less material. Likewise, having a favorable variance

1062 | 10.10 How Budgets are used to Evaluate Goals
indicates that more revenue was earned or less expenses were
incurred but further analysis can indicate if costs were cut too
far and better materials should have been purchased.

   If a company has only a static budget, meaningful
comparisons are difficult. Analyzing the sales for Bid Bad Bikes
will illustrate whether there was a profit and how net income
impacts the company. In the third quarter, Big Bad Bikes sold
1,400 trainers and had third quarter net income of $15,915 as
shown in Figure 10.73.

Figure 10.73 Actual Quarter 3 Income Statement for Big Bad Bikes
By: Rice University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long Description

                           10.10 How Budgets are used to Evaluate Goals | 1063
The company earned a profit during the third quarter, but
what does that mean to the company? Simply having net
income instead of a net loss does not help plan for the future.
The third quarter static budget was for the sale of 1,500 units.
Comparing that budget to the actual results shows whether
there is a favorable variance or an unfavorable variance. A
comparison of the actual costs with the budget for the third
quarter, as shown in Figure 10.74, has a favorable variance for
all of the expenses and an unfavorable variance for everything
associated with revenues.

Figure 10.74 Actual versus Static Budget for Big Bad Bikes By: Rice
University OpenStax CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Long Description

How do those results advise management when evaluating
the company's performance? It is difficult to look at one
variance and make a conclusion about the company or its
management. However, the variances can help narrow down
the areas that need addressing because they differ from the
budgeted amount. For example, looking at the variance when
using a static budget does not indicate the amount of the
variance results because they sold 100 fewer units than
budgeted. The variance for the cost of goods sold is favorable,

1064 | 10.10 How Budgets are used to Evaluate Goals
but it should be if production was less than the budget. A
static budget does not evaluate whether costs for 1,400 were
appropriate for production of those 1,400 units.

   Using a static budget to evaluate performance affects the
bottom line as well as the individual expenses. The net income
for the sale of 1,400 units is less than the budgeted net income
for 1,500 units, but it does not indicate whether expenses were
appropriate for 1,400 units. If there had been 1,600 units sold,
the expenses would be more than the budgeted amount, but
sales would be higher. Would it be fair to evaluate a manager's
control over their expenses using a static budget?

   Evaluating the expenses on a flexible budget computed for
the number of units sold would provide an indication of
management's ability to control expenses. As shown in Figure
10.75, some expenses have a favorable variance, while others
have an unfavorable variance. This type of variance analysis
provides more information to evaluate management and help
prepare the next year's budget. For example, the direct labor in
the flexible budget comparison shows an unfavorable variance,
meaning the direct labor expense was more than budgeted
for the production of 1,400 units. When comparing direct labor
expense, the direct labor in the static budget mentioned earlier
was even larger because it computed direct labor required to
manufacture 1,500 units. It is not surprising that the static
budget variance is favorable because 100 fewer units were
actually produced. However, that information is not as useful
as the unfavorable variance when comparing 1,400 units
produced versus the budgeted direct labor for 1,400 units used.
