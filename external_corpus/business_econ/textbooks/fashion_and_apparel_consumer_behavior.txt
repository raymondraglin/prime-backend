         Introduction

This book aims to provide content specifically discussing consumer behavior related to fashion
and apparel. Consumer behavior is a crucial subject in marketing and merchandising. However,
because consumers' decisions related to their appearances are largely influenced by their
identity, culture, and social environments, the studies of consumer behavior in the fashion/
apparel fields need to reflect and emphasize specific areas. The majority of the content in this
book has come from another open educational resource, Introduction to Consumer Behavior ,
by Andrea Niosi, as well as other open textbooks, websites, and articles created by Psychology,
Sociology, Anthropology, Business, and Marketing scholars and authors.

    This book is an outcome of a two-year project supported by Iowa State University's Miller
Open Education Mini Grant (2023). By Fall 2023 the book was reorganized and two chapters
specifically related to apparel and fashion consumers are added. By Fall 2024, the book content
was modified and supplemented with concepts and examples tailored to the books' audience.
The content will be continuously evaluated and updated.

                                                                                                                        INTRODUCTION | 9

What is Consumer
Behavior?

Consumer behavior is the processes involved when "individuals or groups select, purchase,
use, or dispose of products, services, ideas, or experiences to satisfy needs and desires"
(Solomon, 2020). Consumer behavior involves a series of actions at different stages of
consumption. For example, consumers might start by seeking recommendations for a product
they are interested in buying, and so they compare different brands. Then they might choose
to order their product online instead of buying it in person at a brick-and-mortar store. Post
purchase and after using the product, consumers might decide to leave a positive comment
online. Finally, they might become so emotionally attached to the product that they try to fix it
when it is broken!

    Consumer behavior is an ongoing process that starts long before and continues long after a
consumer buys a product, service, or experience (Table 1).

                                   How does a consumer determine a product or brand is
                                     preferable to all others?

Consumers

Who are consumers, you may ask? The answer is simple: Anyone can be a consumer as
long as they are involved in any of the behaviors in the process described above. However,
different individuals may play different roles in the consumption process. For example, a parent
(customer) may be the person who actually decides whether or not to buy a product instead
of the child (consumer) who chose the product from among other options because a YouTuber
recommended it.

    In this scenario, the parent is the buyer, the child is the user, and the YouTuber is the
influencer. All of them are considered consumers as they are all engaged in one or more
behaviors in the consumption process.

    To study consumer behavior, in addition to understanding the behaviors per se, we also
want to gain insights into why consumers do what they do as indicated by their demographic
background, psychographics, values, upbringing, culture, and people they closely interact with.
All of this information can have immense influence on how a consumer behaves in a certain
way.

The Importance of Consumer Behavior in Fashion &
Marketing

Because consumers' decisions related to their appearance are largely influenced by their
identity, culture, and social environments, the studies of consumers' behaviors in the fashion/
apparel fields need to emphasize specific areas. For individual consumers, this systematic
knowledge of their consumption behaviors helps us define and reinforce preferred behaviors
and results (e.g., shop more aware of the environment and its sustainability) and avoid
unwanted ones (e.g., overspending on fast fashion). Better knowledge of consumer behavior
can help brands and companies identify their market and deal with opportunities and threats to
their brands, products, and services.

    Lifestyle segmentation marketing is both a tactic and a great example of consumer behavior
knowledge application. This approach involves categorizing a target market into distinct groups
based on patterns of their behavior in daily life. These patterns may include their activities,

6 | WHATS CONSUMER BEHAVIOR
interests, and opinions (AIO) or more detailed psychographics pertaining to a certain type of
consumption.

    For example, professors Dahana, Miwa, and Morisada (2019) found that fashion lifestyles
can be defined based on a consumer's self-value (e.g., self-esteem, self-identity), self-image
(e.g., social connectedness, brand consciousness), and fashion orientation (e.g., fashion
involvement, self-expression, fashion leadership). They also found that segmenting consumers
based on their fashion lifestyle can help practitioners identify customers who may shop more
frequently, spend more, and stay loyal in the future.

    This segmentation approach goes beyond basic demographic characteristics like age,
gender, and income and focuses on understanding the deeper psychological and sociocultural
aspects that influence consumers' choices and preferences.

Disciplines Related to Consumer Behavior

Consumer behavior, compared to other fields of studies, is quite young and dynamic, as most
of the knowledge about it emerged from disciplines such as economics, psychology, social
psychology, sociology, anthropology, and neuroscience (Demirdijan & Senguder, 2004). Each
of these disciplines helps us understand the many aspects of consumer behavior from a
macro perspective that focuses on understanding the broader social, cultural, and structural
influences to a micro perspective that focuses on individual's internal processes, cognition, and
emotions.

    Consumer behavior can be viewed as the foundation for marketing, and the social sciences
disciplines can serve as the foundation for consumer behavior (Deighton, 2007).

  Consumer Behavior Research Examples:

      In her book Primates of Park Avenue, Dr. Wednesday Martin used her perspective as
      an anthropologist to describe the relationship between possessions and lifestyles
      and the structures of the social circles in the Upper East Side of New York City. See
      the video Primates of Park Avenue's Survival Tip #1: Charge or Be Charged

         See also Primates of Park Avenue: Definition of a Primate

         Dr. Terry Wu uses "neuron marketing," which looks into the connections between
      how consumers' perceptions toward stimuli such as a color, music, shape, in the
      products, ads, or packages and consumers' reactions to products and brands. See
      Neuromarketing: The new science of consumer decisions.

Modernism and Post-modernism

When consumer behavior research was developed, it relied heavily on disciplines that focused
on the micro perspectives such as microeconomics, behavioral economics, and psychology.
Researchers primarily adopted the modernism approach (also known as positivism) of inquiry
that emphasizes rationality, objectivity, and the search of universal principles that can be
generalized to different contexts. This is also the approach that most physicists and chemists
adopted (those rocket sciences!). This approach assumes there is a single truth as the cause
of consumption phenomenon that helps practitioners predict the outcomes.

    An example of this research inquiry using the modernism approach is as follows: when more
than X number of options are presented to consumers, they are less likely to purchase. The
possible "cause" in question is the number of options, and the possible outcome is whether the
consumer purchases or not.

    Researching consumer behavior using the modernism approach often involves quantitative
research methods for collecting and analyzing numeric data to understand the relationships of
variables and establish models to predict behaviors through surveys, experiments, and numeric
meta-data.

    In the mid-20th century, a new research inquiry approach emerged: post-modernism (also
known as interpretivism) that focuses on understanding and interpreting social phenomena
from the perspective of the individuals involved. Post-modernism emphasizes the subjective
meanings, interpretations, and experiences of individuals and seeks to uncover the social and
cultural contexts that shape their behaviors and actions. Therefore, the assumption of reality
involves multiple truths .

    Researching consumer behavior using a post-modernism approach often involves
qualitative research methods that focus on gathering rich, in-depth, and contextually nuanced
data to explore the complexities of behavior, experiences, and social interactions while using a
lens for sociology and anthropology.

Chapter Reflections

 1. Consumer behavior isn't a single action, but a process with 3 major steps: pre-purchase
      (including searching for information and comparing options), purchase, and post-
      purchase (evaluating your choices). How much time do you typically spend in each of
      these stages? Do you mull over a purchase for a day? A week? How does your personal
      consumer timeline affect the decisions you make when considering a purchase?

 2. Dhana, Miwa, and Morisada (2019) have studied how a consumer's self-value, image, and
      fashion orientation affect their fashion lifestyle. They identified four types of consumers:
      individualistic innovators, rational followers, self-actualized experts, and integrated
      shoppers. Based on their descriptions, how would you describe your shopping habits?

 3. Consumer behavior research spans multiple disciplines. Other fields, such as economics
      and sociology, also relate to consumer behavior. Look through the titles for recent
      publications in the Journal of Consumer Research. What other disciplines do you see
      represented here? Is your own major among them?

 4. How might consumer behavior research help solve real-world problems beyond marketing
      in the fashion industry?

 5. Which consumer research approach do you believe would yield the most actionable and
      meaningful insights for a fashion company today--and why?

                                                                                                          CHAPTER REFLECTIONS | 13

          Cause-related marketing: A collaborative and mutually beneficial relationship
             between a business and a non-profit organization that provides the business with
             greater access to consumer markets (in pursuit of sales, growth, and profit) and
             the non-profit with more exposure and awareness of its cause.

          Cognitive dissonance: A type of cognitive inconsistency, this term describes the
             discomfort consumers may feel when their beliefs, values, attitudes, or
             perceptions are inconsistent or contradictory to their original belief or
             understanding. Consumers with cognitive dissonance related to a purchasing
             decision will often seek to resolve this internal turmoil they are experiencing by
             returning the product or finding a way to justify it and minimizing their sense of
             buyer's remorse.

          Conscientious consumerism: A term used to describe consumers who act with a
             heightened sense of awareness, care, and sensitivity in their purchasing
             decisions. This form of consumerism centres the principles of sustainability and
             may either present as performative or values-based decision making.

          Consumer hyperchoice: A term that describes a purchasing situation in which a
             consumer is faced with an excess of choice that makes decision making difficult
             or nearly impossible.

          Detachment: The mental and emotional separation a consumer undergoes with
             an unwanted or no longed needed product; this is considered the "invisible" part
             of divestment.

          Disposable products: These are products that are designed for single use, which
             means they get discarded ("disposed of") immediately after use. Disposable
             products can have severely negative consequences on the environment if
             sustainability isn't factored into disposal options.

          Disposal: The process of discarding (getting rid of) something we no longer need
             or want. The act of throwing something away.

                                                                                                     KEY TERMS AND CONCEPTS | 17
          Disposition: The physical separation a consumer undergoes with an unwanted or
             no longed needed product; this is considered the "visible" part of divestment.

          Divestment: This term refers to the final stage of consumption after a product
             has been used and is no longer wanted or needed by the consumer. Divestment
             is comprised of disposition and detachment.

          Ethnocentric consumer: These consumers perceive their own culture or
             country's goods as being superior to others'.

          Ethnocentrism: Consumers who select brands because they represent their own
             culture and country of origin are making decisions based on ethnocentrism.
             Consumers who are quick to generalize and judge brands based on
             ethnocentrism are engaging their heuristics.

          Evaluation of alternatives: The third stage of the Consumer Decision Making
             Process, the evaluation of alternatives takes place when a consumer establishes
             criteria to evaluate the most viable purchasing option.

          Evoke set: A small set of "go-to" brands that consumers will consider as they
             evaluate the alternatives available to them before making a purchasing decision.

          Fast fashion: A term that describes the quick process of events that take place
             when fashion items go from the "catwalk" to retail outlets that mainly market to,
             and serve, mainstream consumers. Fast fashion has negative consequences on
             disposal and is an unsustainable process that leads to a high volume of waste
             as well as concerns about the ethical practices in clothing production.

          Full/extended decision making process: Consumer purchases made when a
             (new) need is identified and a consumer engages in a more rigorous evaluation,
             research, and alternative assessment process before satisfying the unmet need.

          Green marketing: The design, development, and promotion of products that
             serve to minimize negative and harmful effects on the environment. Green
             marketing is most visibly evident through packaging design, labeling, and
             messaging (e.g. "green dish soap").

          Greenwashing: A term used to describe an act of hypocrisy whereby a company
             proclaims to engage in "green" business (marketing) practices, but is actually
             engaging in harmful and devastating impacts on the environment. Those
             impacts may be hidden, disguised, or purposely misrepresented to consumers
             (and broader group of stakeholders) so the company can win favor with
             conscientious consumers.

          Heuristics: Also known as "mental shortcuts" or "rules of thumb," heuristics help
             consumers by simplifying the decision-making process.

18 | KEY TERMS AND CONCEPTS
 Inept set: The brands a consumer would not pay any attention to during the
   evaluation of alternatives process.

 Inert set: The brands a consumer is aware of but indifferent to, when evaluating
   alternatives in the consumer decision making process. The consumer may deem
   these brands irrelevant and will therefore exclude them from any extensive
   evaluation or consideration.

 Inertia: Purchasing decisions made out of habit.

 Information search: The second stage of the Consumer Decision Making
   Process, information search takes place when a consumer seeks relative
   information that will help them identify and evaluate alternatives before deciding
   on the final purchase decision.

 Lateral cycling: A feature of product disposal that involves selling, donating, or
   giving away unwanted items in an effort to keep them from ending up as waste
   in landfills. Lateral cycling is a more sustainable act of disposal than just
   throwing something away.

 Materialism: The prioritization of possessions (material possessions), money,
   and the consumer purchases above and beyond relationships, spirituality, and
   personal well-being.

 Need recognition: The first stage of the Consumer Decision Making Process,
   need recognition takes place when a consumer identifies an unmet need.

 Pinkwashing: Similar in spirit to "greenwashing," this term is used to describe an
   act of hypocrisy whereby a company aligns itself with a breast cancer
   fundraising endeavor (e.g. pink ribbon campaign) all the while producing
   products that are associated with the very causes of (breast) cancer itself.
   Brands that engage in pinkwashing may disguise or purposely misrepresent the
   (dangerous) ingredients in their products or the (unsafe and hazardous) working
   conditions used to bring the products to market in order to win favor with
   consumers who idealize the significance of the pink ribbon symbol.

 Planned obsolescence: A deliberate act marketers and businesses take in
   designing, producing, and marketing products that become obsolete quickly,
   therefore triggering consumers to buy the "next version" as a replacement.
   Planned obsolescence has negative consequences on disposal and the
   environment when products aren't designed with sustainable disposal in mind. It
   is also an unsustainable practice that prioritizes profit over consumer and
   environmental well-being.

 Recycling: Recycling involves the repurposing and transformation of discarded/

                                                                                         KEY TERMS AND CONCEPTS | 19
             disposed products (that would otherwise be thrown away) into something that
             has a different purpose. Recycling turns waste into reusable materials.
          Simple/routine decision making process: Consumer purchases made when a
             need is identified and a habitual ("routine") purchase is made to satisfy that
             need.
          Social impact: One of the dimensions of a sustainable business: an examination
             of a business's practices that relate to labor conditions as well as the entirety of
             its operations across that the supply chain to ensure those practices reflect
             social responsibility and ethical behavior.
          Upcycling: A process of product disposal that involves the repurposing of
             unwanted items that give them a "second life". Upcycling is a transformative
             process that takes an unwanted item and transforms it into a more functional or
             even attractive item than it once was. It is a more sustainable act of disposal
             than just throwing something away.

20 | KEY TERMS AND CONCEPTS
Consumer Decision
Making Process

An organization that wants to be successful must consider buyer behavior when developing
the marketing mix. Buyer behavior is the actions people take with regard to buying and using
products. Marketers must understand buyer behavior, such as how raising or lowering a price
will affect the buyer's perception of the product and therefore create a fluctuation in sales, or
how a specific review on social media can create an entirely new direction for the marketing
mix based on the comments (buyer behavior/input) of the target market.

The Consumer Decision Making Process

Once the process is started, a potential buyer can withdraw at any stage of making the actual
purchase. The tendency for a person to go through all six stages is likely only in certain buying
situations--a first time purchase of a product, for instance, or when buying high priced, long-
lasting, infrequently purchased articles. This is referred to as complex decision making.

    For many products, the purchasing behavior is a routine affair in which the aroused need
is satisfied in a habitual manner by repurchasing the same brand. That is, past reinforcement
in learning experiences leads directly to buying, and thus the second and third stages are
bypassed. This is called simple decision making.

    However, if something changes appreciably (price, product, availability, services), the buyer
may re-enter the full decision process and consider alternative brands. Whether complex or
simple, the first step is need identification (Assael, 1987).

                                                                                   CONSUMER DECISION MAKING PROCESS | 21
     Both simple (routine) and complex decision making begins with need recognition. The simple
     route jumps straight to select and purchase; whereas the complex process involves more
     thorough search and evaluation activities before a selection is made.

  When Inertia Takes Over

      When consumers make purchasing decisions out of habit, we call this inertia. This
      habitual form of purchasing involves little complex decision making once the
      consider has recognized a need (i.e., "I am out of printer paper"). These types of
      purchases require little effort on the consumer's side and brands are easily
      substituted for others if the purchasing experience can be made to be more
      convenient. In contrast, brand loyalty occurs when consumers go out of their way to
      repeatedly purchase a brand that they favour above all others. Consumers are
      unlikely to substitute the brand for another one and usually form a bond or
      connection with the brand over time.

Need Recognition

Whether we act to resolve a particular problem depends upon two factors:

 1. the magnitude of the discrepancy between our actual state (what we have or how we feel
      about our status quo) and desired state.

 2. the importance of the problem. A consumer may desire a new designer purse and own a
      five-year-old backpack. The discrepancy may be fairly large but may be relatively

22 | CONSUMER DECISION MAKING PROCESS
      unimportant compared to the other problems they face. People must resolve these types
      of conflicts (e.g., conflicts between the magnitude and the importance of the problem)
      before they can proceed. Otherwise, the buying process for a given product stops at this
      point, probably in frustration.

Once the problem is recognized it must be defined in such a way that the consumer can
actually initiate the action that will bring about a relevant problem solution. Note that, in many
cases, problem recognition and problem definition occur simultaneously, such as a consumer
running out of toothpaste. Consider the more complicated problem involved with status and
image-how we want others to see us. For example, you may know that you are not satisfied
with your appearance, but you may not be able to define it any more precisely than that(e.g.,
do they need a new outfit, or a completely new style, or just need to change their foundation
shade?). Consumers will not know where to begin solving their problem until the problem is
adequately defined.

    Keep in mind that a person's actual state and desired state are dynamic - they can change!
For example, your actual state of feeling cold can change in the next moment when you put on
a jacket or walk into a room with heat. Your desired state can change from "feeling warm" to
"feeling warm in style". The realization of the discrepancy between the actual and the desired
state due to the change of the desired state is also known as opportunity recognition. This
usually happens when marketing influences (e.g., an ad, a short video on TikTok, a promotion)
are in the picture.

    Marketers can become involved in the need recognition stage in three ways:

 1. First they need to know what problems consumers are facing in order to develop a
      marketing mix to help solve these problems. This requires that they measure problem
      recognition.

 2. Second, on occasion, marketers want to activate problem recognition. Public service
      announcements espousing the dangers of cigarette smoking is an example. Weekend and
      night shop hours are a response of retailers to the consumer problem of limited weekday
      shopping opportunities. This problem has become particularly important to families with
      two working adults.

 3. Finally, marketers can also shape the definition of the need or problem. If a consumer
      needs a new coat, do they define the problem as a need for inexpensive covering, a way to
      stay warm on the coldest days, a garment that will last several years, warm cover that will
      not attract odd looks from their peers, or an article of clothing that will express their
      personal sense of style? A salesperson or an ad may shape their answers

                                                                                   CONSUMER DECISION MAKING PROCESS | 23
Information Search

After a need is recognized, the prospective consumer may seek information to help identify and
evaluate alternative products, services, and outlets that will meet that need. Such information
can come from family, friends, personal observation, or other sources, such as Consumer
Reports, salespeople, or mass media.

    In some cases, the consumer already has the needed information based on past purchasing
and consumption experience. When they search in their memory for stored information, they
perform an internal information search. For example, bad experiences and lack of satisfaction
can result in the consumer avoiding that retailer. Or information learned about trends, fits,
sizing can help them evaluate the offerings from different brands better. Consumers may look
for information on the Internet or ask friends for recommendations, performing an external
information search.

    Such searches taking place before the purchase is made, regardless internal or external,
is known as pre-purchase information search. The promotional component of the marketers
offering is typically aimed at pre-purchase information search providing information to assist
the consumer in their problem solving process.

    In addition to pre-purchase information search, consumers conduct post-purchase and
ongoing information search as well. Consumers may conduct post-purchase information
search because they are seeking for confirmation of their decision, and they may conduct on-
going information (i.e., looking for information regarding a brand or a product category without
identifying a need) because they are generally interested in the product category and would like
to stay current and are open to new information. For example, a consumer who is interested in
fashion will be continuously observing other people's styles, following fashion influencers, and
reading Vogue.

    Information search can also identify new needs. As a new graduate shopping looks for
information of professional outfits, they may decide that outfits are not the only need, and
that they also need a haircut. At this point, the perceived need may change triggering a new
informational search. Information search involves mental as well as the physical activities
that consumers must perform in order to make decisions and accomplish desired goals in
the marketplace. It takes time, energy, money, and can often involve foregoing more desirable
activities. The extent of information can depend on many different situations, such as the
importance of the need, and whether the problem is new. The benefits of information search,
however, can outweigh the costs. For example, engaging in a thorough information search may
save money, improve quality of selection, or reduce risks. The Internet is a valuable information
source.

24 | CONSUMER DECISION MAKING PROCESS
Evaluation of Alternatives

After information is secured and processed, alternative products, services, and outlets are
identified as viable options. The consumer evaluates these alternatives, and, if financially and
psychologically able, makes a choice. The criteria used in evaluation varies from consumer to
consumer just as the needs and information sources vary. One consumer may consider price
most important while another puts more weight (importance) upon quality or convenience.

  Using the `Rule of Thumb'

      Consumers don't have the time or desire to ponder endlessly about every purchase!
      Fortunately for us, heuristics, also described as shortcuts or mental "rules of thumb",
      help us make decisions quickly and painlessly. Heuristics are especially important to
      draw on when we are faced with choosing among products in a category where we
      don't see huge differences or if the outcome isn't `do or die'.

         Heuristics are helpful sets of rules that simplify the decision-making process by
      making it quick and easy for consumers.

                    Common Heuristics in Consumer Decision Making

          Save the most money: Many people follow a rule like, "I'll buy the lowest-priced
             choice so that I spend the least money right now." Using this heuristic means you
             don't need to look beyond the price tag to make a decision. Wal-Mart built a
             retailing empire by pleasing consumers who follow this rule.

          You get what you pay for: Some consumers might use the opposite heuristic of
             saving the most money and instead follow a rule such as: "I'll buy the more
             expensive product because higher price means better quality." These consumers
             are influenced by advertisements alluding to exclusivity, quality, and
             uncompromising performance.

          Stick to the tried and true: Brand loyalty also simplifies the decision-making
             process because we buy the brand that we've always bought before. therefore,
             we don't need to spend more time and effort on the decision. Advertising plays a
             critical role in creating brand loyalty.
             In a study of the market leaders in thirty product categories, 27 of the brands that
             were #1 in 1930 were still at the top over 50 years later (Stevenson, 1988)! A well
             known brand name is a powerful heuristic.

          National pride: Consumers who select brands because they represent their own
             culture and country of origin are making decision based on ethnocentrism.

                                                                                   CONSUMER DECISION MAKING PROCESS | 25
             Ethnocentric consumers are said to perceive their own culture or country's goods
             as being superior to others'. Ethnocentrism can behave as both a stereotype and
             a type of heuristic for consumers who are quick to generalize and judge brands
             based on their country of origin.
          Visual cues: Consumers may also rely on visual cues represented in product and
             packaging design. Visual cues may include the color of the brand or product or
             deeper beliefs that they have developed about the brand. For example, if brands
             claim to support sustainability and climate activism, consumers want to believe
             these to be true. Visual cues such as green design and neutral-colored packaging
             that appears to be made of recycled materials play into consumers' heuristics.

The search for alternatives and the methods used in the search are influenced by such factors
as: (a) time and money costs; (b) how much information the consumer already has; (c) the
amount of the perceived risk if a wrong selection is made; and (d) the consumer's
predisposition toward particular choices as influenced by the attitude of the individual toward
choice behavior. That is, there are individuals who find the selection process to be difficult
and disturbing. For these people there is a tendency to keep the number of alternatives to a
minimum, even if they have not gone through an extensive information search to find that their
alternatives appear to be the very best. On the other hand, there are individuals who feel it
necessary to collect a long list of alternatives. This tendency can appreciably slow down the
decision-making function.

  Consumer Evaluations Made Easier

      The evaluation of alternatives often involves consumers drawing on their evoke,
      inept, and insert sets to help them in the decision making process.

     Evoke Set

         The brands and products that consumers compare--their evoked set--represent
      the alternatives being considered by consumers during the problem-solving process.
      Sometimes known as a "consideration" set, the evoked set tends to be small relative
      to the total number of options available. When a consumer commits significant time
      to the comparative process and reviews price, warranties, terms and condition of
      sale and other features it is said that they are involved in extended problem solving.
      Unlike routine problem solving, extended or extensive problem solving comprises
      external research and the evaluation of alternatives. Whereas, routine problem
      solving is low-involvement, inexpensive, and has limited risk if purchased, extended
      problem solving justifies the additional effort with a high-priced or scarce product,

26 | CONSUMER DECISION MAKING PROCESS
      service, or benefit (e.g., the purchase of a car). Likewise, consumers use extensive
      problem solving for infrequently purchased, expensive, high-risk, or new goods or
      services.

     Inept Set

         As opposed to the evoked set, a consumer's inept set represent those brands that
      they would not given any consideration too. For a consumer who is shopping around
      for an electric vehicle, for example, they would not even remotely consider gas-
      guzzling vehicles like large SUVs.

     Inert Set

         The inert set represents those brands or products a consumer is aware of, but is
      indifferent to and doesn't consider them either desirable or relevant enough to be
      among the evoke set. Marketers have an opportunity here to position their brands
      appropriately so consumers move these items from their insert to evoke set when
      evaluation alternatives.

Selection

The selection of an alternative, in many cases, will require additional evaluation. For example, a
consumer may select a favorite brand and go to a convenient outlet to make a purchase. Upon
arrival at the dealer, the consumer finds that the desired brand is out-of-stock. At this point,
additional evaluation is needed to decide whether to wait until the product comes in, accept a
substitute, or go to another outlet. The selection and evaluation phases of consumer problem
solving are closely related and often run sequentially, with outlet selection influencing product
evaluation, or product selection influencing outlet evaluation.

    While many consumers would agree that choice is a good thing, there is such a thing as
"too much choice" that inhibits the consumer decision making process. Consumer hyperchoice
is a term used to describe purchasing situations that involve an excess of choice thus making
selection for difficult for consumers. Dr. Sheena Iyengar studies consumer choice and collects
data that supports the concept of consumer hyperchoice. In one of her studies, she put out jars
of jam in a grocery store for shoppers to sample, with the intention to influence purchases. Dr.
Iyengar discovered that when a fewer number of jam samples were provided to shoppers, more
purchases were made. But when a large number of jam samples were set out, fewer purchases
were made (Green, 2010). As it turns out, "more is less" when it comes to the selection process.

The Purchase Decision

After much searching and evaluating, or perhaps very little, consumers at some point have to
decide whether they are going to buy. Anything marketers can do to simplify purchasing will be
attractive to buyers. This may include minimal clicks to online checkout; short wait times in line;

                                                                                   CONSUMER DECISION MAKING PROCESS | 27
and simplified payment options. When it comes to advertising marketers could also suggest
the best size for a particular use, or the right wine to drink with a particular food. Sometimes
several decision situations can be combined and marketed as one package. For example, travel
agents often package travel tours with flight and hotel reservations.

    To do a better marketing job at this stage of the buying process, a seller needs to know
answers to many questions about consumers' shopping behavior. For instance, how much
effort is the consumer willing to spend in shopping for the product? What factors influence
when the consumer will actually purchase? Are there any conditions that would prohibit or delay
purchase? Providing basic product, price, and location information through labels, advertising,
personal selling, and public relations is an obvious starting point. Product sampling, coupons,
and rebates may also provide an extra incentive to buy. Actually determining how a consumer
goes through the decision-making process is a difficult research task.

Post-Purchase Behavior

All the behavior determinants and the steps of the buying process up to this point are operative
before or during the time a purchase is made. However, a consumer's feelings and evaluations
after the sale are also significant to a marketer, because they can influence repeat sales and
also influence what the customer tells others about the product or brand.

    Keeping the customer happy is what marketing is all about. Nevertheless, consumers
typically experience some post-purchase anxiety after all but the most routine and inexpensive
purchases. TThis anxiety reflects a phenomenon called cognitive dissonance. According to
this theory, people strive for consistency among their cognitions (knowledge, attitudes, beliefs,
values). When there are inconsistencies, dissonance exists, which causes mental discomfort.
People will try to eliminate this discomfort by adjusting one of the elements (knowledge,
attitudes, beliefs, values). For example, cognitive dissonance may arise when a consumer
aspires to be more environmentally sustainable but decides to purchase from a fast fashion
brand. To illuminate the discomfort resulted from the inconsistency between their attitude
(i.e., be more sustainable) and their behavior (i.e., buying from a non-sustainable brand), the
consumer may change their attitude (e.g., have a thought "getting one shirt from a fast fashion
brand won't hurt too much") or change their behavior (e.g., returning the garment).

    In some cases, the consumer makes the decision to buy a particular brand already aware of
dissonant elements. In other instances, dissonance is aroused by disturbing information that
is received after the purchase (e.g., realizing the brand is involved in certain practices that are
inconsistent to the consumer's values). The marketer may take specific steps to reduce post-
purchase dissonance. Advertising that stresses the many positive attributes or confirms the
popularity of the product can be helpful. Providing personal reinforcement has proven effective
with big-ticket items such as automobiles and major appliances. Salespeople in these areas
may send cards or may even make personal calls in order to reassure customers about their
purchase.

30 | CONSUMER DECISION MAKING PROCESS
Product Disposal and
Disposal Options

The last stage in the Consumer Decision Making Process is disposal. What options do
consumers have at the end of a product's lifecycle? What about when we tire, get bored, or
outgrow something we own? Sustainable marketing requires a deliberate attempt to minimize
a product's end-of-life impact on the environment around us. That means consumers need a
range of options when they dispose of products they no longer need or want.

The Need for Responsible & Sustainable Disposal Options

There was a time when neither manufacturers nor consumers thought much about how
products got disposed of, so long as people bought them. But that's changed. How products
are being disposed of is becoming extremely important to consumers and society in general.
Computers and batteries, which leech chemicals into landfills, are a huge problem. Consumers
don't want to degrade the environment if they don't have to, and companies are becoming more
aware of this fact.

    Take for example Crystal Light, a water-based beverage that's sold in grocery stores. You
can buy it in a bottle. However, many people buy a concentrated form of it, put it in reusable
pitchers or bottles, and add water. That way, they don't have to buy and dispose of plastic bottle
after plastic bottle, damaging the environment in the process. Windex has done something
similar with its window cleaner. Instead of buying new bottles of it all the time, you can
purchase a concentrate and add water. You have probably noticed that most grocery stores now
sell cloth bags consumers can reuse instead of continually using and discarding of new plastic
or paper bags.

    Other companies are less concerned about conservation than they are about planned
obsolescence. Planned obsolescence is a deliberate effort by companies to make their
products obsolete, or unusable, after a period of time. The goal is to improve a company's sales
by reducing the amount of time between the repeat purchases consumers make of products.
When a software developer introduces a new version of product, it is usually designed to be
incompatible with older versions of it. For example, not all the formatting features are the

                                                                            PRODUCT DISPOSAL AND DISPOSAL OPTIONS | 31
same in Microsoft Word 2007 and 2010. Sometimes documents do not translate properly when
opened in the newer version. Consequently, you will be more inclined to upgrade to the new
version so you can open all Word documents you receive.

    Products that are disposable are another way in which firms have managed to reduce
the amount of time between purchases. Disposable lighters are an example. Do you know
anyone today that owns a nondisposable lighter? Believe it or not, prior to the 1960s, scarcely
anyone could have imagined using a cheap disposable lighter. There are many more disposable
products today than there were in years past--including everything from bottled water and
individually wrapped snacks to single-use eye drops and cell phones.

    End-of-life disposal options may either extend the life of a product or delay (and maybe even
completely omit) its final resting place in a landfill. Marketing's responsibility doesn't end at
the point of purchase: designing sustainability for the end of the product's lifecycle should be
factored in to the product design and marketing plan from the very beginning. Providing an easy
and accessible way for consumers to participate in sustainable end-of-life disposal options can
also be a lucrative option for marketers (e.g., Patagonia).

Disposition & Divestment Rituals

Divestment is the process users experience when separating from a product. Divestment
represents the combination of physical separation and mental and emotional separation
processes that users go through when ending the use cycle of a product (Gregson, Metcalfe,
& Crewe 2007; Glover, 2012). Divestment is the combination of disposition (i.e., physical
separation) and detachment (i.e., mental and emotional separation of the product).

          Divestment: Overarching term referring to the final phase of the consumption
             cycle after the purchase and the use phases.

          Disposition: Physical separation of the product, the visible part of divestment.
          Detachment: Mental and emotional separation of the product, the invisible part

             of divestment.

Often when we are trying to "get rid" of things we move them around in our house. Some
things, like clothing we've outgrown or no long want get stacked in a bedroom closet. Toys
that our children no longer want get piled in the basement. Furniture and household items we
have replaced with newer items occupy their own distinct territory in the garage. Our physical
separation, or disposition, of possessions rarely take a direct route and many people perform
their own ritual of collecting and storing items for a while--at least until less or no emotional
detachment is holding us back from parting ways.

  Recycling, Lateral Cycling, & Upcycling

      Most consumers are familiar with recycling--a process of turning waste into another
      form of new and reusable materials, but many might be surprised to know that
      recycled goods can sometimes command a premium price. When Canadian fashion
      retailer Aritzia came out with its signature down jacket the Super Puff, the brand also
      introduced consumers to its Super (Re) Puff, a version of the same jacket made with
      regenerated nylon from pre- and post consumer waste ("Aritzia to Launch...," 2020).
      Living up to its brand tagline, "Everyday Luxury," the Super (Re) Puff is priced about
      $50 more than it's less sustainably produced counterpart.

         Lateral cycling occurs when we sell, donate, or give away products to others who
      may use the products for the same intended purpose or for another purpose entirely.
      Examples of lateral cycling include disposing our products through garage sales;
      second-hand stores; online buy and sell communities such as Facebook
      Marketplace, Craigslist, eBay, Kijiji, etc. Lateral cycling can also occur when
      consumers exchange product ownership and isn't exclusive to selling used products
      for profit.

         In recent years the term upcycling has been used to describe when products get
      repurposed--almost like having a new or "second life." The online community and
      website, "Upcycle That," defines upcycling as "taking something that's considered
      waste and re-purposing it. The upcycled item often becomes more functional or
      beautiful than what it previously was" (About Upcycling, n.d.). Thanks to the
      upcycling process, some items even increase their value and fetch a higher price in
      the market.

         In 2019, Patagonia launched a new product line called, "ReCrafted," which upcycles
      waste fabric into unique and one-of-a kind garments (Segran, 2021). According to
      Alex Kremer, Patagonia's Director of Worn Wear, the company has created a new
      revenue stream by upcycling products and selling the new pieces at a premium --
      something all fashion brands could be doing.

Fast Fashion's Impact on Disposal

In recent years there has been much criticism of both the business model and practices of
those engaged in fast fashion. From shopping malls, to fashion magazines, to catalogs, to
online advertisements, consumers are exposed to countless opportunities to spend money on
fashionable apparel that exists within a short time span (Yang et al., 2017). The fast fashion
consumer buying trend encourages rampant consumerism because designs are usually based
on the most recent fashion trends presented in Fashion Week magazine twice a year (Yang
et al., 2017; Hines & Bruce, 2007; Muran, 2007). Because the supply chain--from catwalk to

                                                                            PRODUCT DISPOSAL AND DISPOSAL OPTIONS | 33
retailer--is well optimized in particular for the design and manufacturing process of clothing
collections, consumers are able to purchase the latest trends at a fraction of the cost of original
design clothing (Yang et al., 2017; Hines, 2010; Pfeiffer, 2007).

    The downside, of course, is that the proliferation of fast fashion combined with lower
consumer prices means both purchasing and disposing are happening at a faster pace as
well (Yang et al., 2017). Therefore, as Yang et al., discuss, fast fashion has also become
associated with "disposable fashion" (Hines, 2007). Not only is fast fashion "leading the way
in actual disposable clothing," Yang et al. write, "it is particularly worrisome for sustainable
development, because it creates a demand for cheap clothing and then, ultimately produces
and constantly churns out a massive amount of textile waste, accelerating carbon emissions
and global warming" ("Where does...clothing go," 2014).

Trends Impacting
Individual Consumer
Decision Making

The "evaluation of alternatives stage" in the Individual Decision Making Process is worthy of a
book on its own! There are many different techniques marketers will employ to get the attention
of consumers and be top-of-mind when they are ready to make a purchase. For many years now,
consumer attitudes and behaviors around sustainability and conscientious consumerism have
shifted and become a key determinant in individual consumer decision making. Marketers have
responded by creating strategies, campaigns, and promotions that win favor with consumers
and put them ahead of the competition. Naturally, the rush to the finish line often involves
manipulation, cutting corners, and deceiving consumers: often the hypocrisy goes unnoticed
and its impact overlooked.

Green Marketing

In the early 21st century, we are witnessing a profound shift in priorities as people clamor for
products and services that are good for their bodies, good for their community, and good for the
Earth. Some analysts call this new value conscientious consumerism. They estimate the U.S.
market for body-friendly and earth-friendly products at more than $200 billion.

    Just how widespread is conscientious consumerism? In a 2007 survey, eight in 10
consumers said they believe it's important to buy green products and that they'll pay more
to do so. Corporate responsibility is now one of the primary attributes shoppers look for
when they decide among competing brands. Consumer research strongly suggests that this
awareness often starts with personal health concerns and then radiates outward to embrace
the community and the environment. Predictably, advertisers have been quick to jump on
the green bandwagon. Green marketing, which emphasizes how products and services are
environmentally responsible, is red hot.

Social Impact

Social impact refers to the performance of a sustainable business relative to societies and
social justice. Internally, the social impact of a business refers to practices related to employees
and employment within the business; externally, social impact practices include participating in
Fair Trade practices.

    In addition to employment practices, social impact refers to respect of others. This entails
the respect of individuals and other businesses encountered locally and around the world. A
sustainable business will make reasonable efforts to ensure its policies, practices, products,
advertising, logo or mascot, and other aspects of the business are not offensive or disrespectful
to clients in the global market.

  Tips to Increase Your Social Impact

      Have you considered where your coffee, chocolate, clothing, or other products come
      from and the conditions under which they were produced? Social impact is one of the
      three pillars of a sustainable business, but it can be difficult to define and even more
      difficult to track and measure.

         A sustainable business should consider the social impact of its business
      operations on employees, those employed throughout the supply chain, and on the
      community. So how can a business begin to maximize its social impact?

         Here are some practices that will help create positive social impact:

            UN Global Compact: Review the 10 principles of the United Nations Global
              Compact and abide by them, whether or not the business becomes a
              signatory.

            Buy Fair Trade: Seek out opportunities to purchase Fair Trade products for
              your business. Fair Trade products ensure that those who produced the
              product in developing countries were paid a fair wage under humane working
              conditions. You can purchase Fair Trade clothing, handicrafts, coffee, cocoa,
              sugar, tea, bananas, honey, cotton, wine, fresh fruit, flowers, and other
              products.

            Company Policies and Practices: Consider the social impact of your
              company's policies and practices on employees (such as healthcare coverage,
              educational opportunities, and work-life balance).

            Philanthropy: Evaluate the impact of your corporate giving programs. Find
              opportunities that are strategically related to your core business, and focus
              your philanthropy in those areas, benefiting both the community and the
              business.

38 | TRENDS IMPACTING INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER DECISION MAKING
            Supply Chain: Understand the conditions under which the products and
              supplies you purchase were produced; work with suppliers to achieve
              transparency throughout the supply chain; check the web sites of any of the
              numerous watchdog organizations (e.g. CorpWatch, Sweatshop Watch,
              International Labour Rights Forum) to find world regions, specific companies,
              and industries known for human rights abuses that could be occurring within
              your supply chain.

            Labor: Make sure your business follows policies and practices that are fair to
              its labor force. A good place to start is SA8000 and the International Labour
              Standards. Review and understand the standards, whether or not your
              business seeks certification. Support freedom of association, collective
              bargaining, and nondiscrimination in your own place of business as well as
              with suppliers. In purchasing, avoid products that were produced using forced
              and child labor. Look for certifications from Fair Trade Federation, Fair Labour
              Association, Social Accountability International, RugMark, Verite, Worker
              Rights Consortium, or others that have independently evaluated labor
              conditions.

            Social Responsibility: Check out the 2010 release of the ISO 26000 standards
              on social responsibility for companies.

There are many examples of brands and corporations invested in maximizing their social
impact. These can be found in several different product categories, from ice cream (Ben &
Jerry's) to footwear (Adidas) to furniture (Herman Miller; Ikea). Some argue that the reason
many brands are engaging in social impact initiatives is to better align with consumers -- and
not just any consumers, but Generation Z more specifically (RippleMatch Team, 2020).

    In 2018, McKinsey & Company collaborated with Box 1824, a research agency, to learn more
about the "true digital natives" born between 1995 and 2010. The study revealed four core Gen
Z behaviors: that they value expression over brand labels; that they will mobilize for a variety of
different causes; that they believe in the power of dialogue to solve important problems; and,
that they relate to institutions in an analytic and pragmatic way (Francis & Hoefel, 2018).

    These core behaviors also have a direct impact on how Gen Z approaches consumption
and their relationships with brands; the most notable finding in the study was that Gen Z view,
"consumption as a matter of ethical concern" (Francis & Hoefel, 2018).

  TOMS Shoes' Social Impact Commitment

      TOMS Shoes is an example of a company making a commitment to maximize its
      social impact. In 2006, Blake Mycoskie founded TOMS Shoes with the singular
      mission of improving the lives of children by providing shoes to those in need. Shoes
      are produced in Argentina and China following fair labor practices while creating
      minimal environmental impact. Factories are monitored by TOMS and third-party
      independent auditors. TOMS Shoes are sold online and in retail locations around the
      world with the promise that for each pair purchased, TOMS will donate a second pair
      to a child in need in Argentina, South Africa, and other locations around the world.
      The public is invited to participate in "shoe drops" around the world and to
      experience firsthand the social contribution of TOMS Shoes.

Cause-Related Marketing

Cause-related marketing is one of the fastest-growing types of sponsorships. It occurs when
a company supports a nonprofit organization in some way. For example, M&M's sponsors the
Special Olympics and American Airlines raises money for breast cancer research with an annual
celebrity golf and tennis tournament. The airline also donates frequent flier miles to the cause.
Yoplait Yogurt donates money for breast cancer research for every pink lid that is submitted.
Cause-related marketing can have a positive PR impact by strengthening the affinity people
have for a company that does it.

  Different Flavors of Cause-Related Marketing

      There are many examples of high-profile cause-related marketing campaigns where
      some of our most beloved consumer products have teamed up with non-profits in
      order to achieve mutually beneficial goals. Some of these might even be familiar to
      you:

            Pepsi's support for a campaign called "Movember" that raises awareness
              about prostate cancer.

            Starbucks' involvement with REDto raise money for the Global Fund to Fight
              AIDS.

            Reebok and Avon's long association with Susan G. Komen Foundation's Walk
              to End Breast Cancer.

            Walmart and its support for the Childrens Miracle Network.

         In 2016, Ben & Jerry's (the famous ice cream makers) launched a new flavor of ice

40 | TRENDS IMPACTING INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER DECISION MAKING
      cream that was part of a cause marketing campaign of a different kind: their
      "Empower Mint" ice cream was introduced in connection to a political and social
      justice campaign of their own making called, "Democracy is in your Hands"
      (Carmicheal, 2020). The purpose of the campaign was to raise awareness about,
      voter suppression laws.

             "Voter-suppression laws are targeting Black, Brown, and low-income voters, the
             gutting of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) has allowed many states to move forward wtih
             plans to make it harder for people to vote, and money from wealthy donors is
             corrupting the system" ("Democracy...," n.d.).

         In addition to raising awareness about voter suppression, Ben & Jerry include calls-
      to-action on the website to register voters and join their fight for democracy and
      voter rights in America.

Greenwashing

The advertising industry has the potential to radically change people's attitudes and (more
importantly) their behaviors as we face the real consequences of environmental contamination.
Unfortunately, there's also the very real potential that it will "poison the well" as it jumps onto the
bandwagon a bit too energetically. It's almost impossible to find an ad for virtually any kind of
product, service, or company that doesn't tout its environmental credentials, whether the focus
of the ad is a detergent, a garment, a commercial airplane, or even an oil company.

    Greenwashing is the act of creating an environmental spin on products or activities without
genuine business-wide commitment to sustainability. Sustainability is a company-wide goal
that permeates through every task, role, department, division, and activity of the company.
Unwitting businesses may engage in greenwashing for a variety of reasons, such as a lack of
understanding of sustainability. Other reasons may include attempts to expand market share,
attract and manage employees, attract investors, derail critics, circumvent regulatory issues,
and improve image. However, greenwashing may damage an otherwise credible business's
image or reputation.

    As a result, complaints about greenwashing, or misleading consumers about a product's
environmental benefits, are skyrocketing. One egregious example is an ad for a gas-guzzling
Japanese sport utility vehicle that bills the car as having been "conceived and developed in the
homeland of the Kyoto accords," the international emissions-reduction agreement.

    To prevent a greenwash backlash, it's imperative for advertisers to act responsibly. There's
nothing wrong with trumpeting the environmental value of your product-- if the claims are
accurate and specific. Or you can suggest alternative methods to use your product that will
minimize its negative impact-- for example, Procter & Gamble runs an ad campaign in the
United Kingdom that urges consumers of its laundry detergents to wash their clothing at lower
temperatures (Pfanner, 2008).

                                                   TRENDS IMPACTING INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER DECISION MAKING | 41
    The Federal Trade Commission provides guidelines to evaluate green advertising claims; it
suggests that "if a label says `recycled,' check how much of the product or package is recycled.
The fact is that unless the product or package contains 100 percent recycled materials, the
label must tell you how much is recycled" ("Sorting Out...," 1999).

Pinkwashing

                Pink washing is a deliberate attempt to deceive customers with the purest of
                intentions: some choose goods associated with breast cancer fundraising
                (identified by the pink ribbon), but many lack awareness about these items being
                carcinogenic and contributing to higher rates of cancer.

Born from the concept of greenwashing came "pinkwashing"--a concept that describes the act
of making misleading claims to win customers over. Pinkwashing identifies brands that use the
"Pink Ribbon"--a symbol of breast cancer awareness--to raise funds for breast cancer research.
A number of brands, including car manufacturers, dairy companies, and personal hygiene and
cosmetics makers, adorn their products with pink ribbons all the while these products are
known to include carcinogens that cause (breast) cancer. At the very least the alignment of
these brands to the breast cancer cause is misleading; but of greater concern is that this
particular cause-related marketing plays on consumers heuristics to simply choose what might
seem like the "best," or the "right" product because it supports an important cause.

42 | TRENDS IMPACTING INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER DECISION MAKING
Student Op-Ed: Pinkwashing and the Pink Ribbon Symbol

  The pink ribbon is one of the most widely recognized symbols in the United States
  and is an international symbol of breast cancer awareness (Pool, 2011). Marketers
  are now pinkwashing and using the pink ribbon symbol to influence consumer
  decisions and increase sales. Pinkwashing is when a company is supporting the
  cause of breast cancer or promoting a pink ribbon product while producing,
  manufacturing, or selling products linked to the disease (Pool, 2011). A variety of
  cause-related marketers are using breast cancer to guilt consumers into buying
  products that are not beneficial to them (Pool, 2011). Cause-related marketing refers
  to a type of marketing involving a mutually beneficial collaboration between a
  corporation and a non-profit company (Solomon, 2014). Many consumers believe
  that purchasing a product with a Pink Ribbon symbol will express moral support for
  women with breast cancer when in most cases this is untrue (Pool, 2011).

     The study of compensatory decisions rules shows that when all things are equal,
  the company that is donating to a charity or has a good cause behind it, will likely be
  the product purchased (Solomon, 2014). The brand Yoplait has put a pink ribbon on
  the company's product and changed the product colour to pink during October to
  increase the likelihood of consumers purchasing the product (Pool, 2011). Yoplait is
  a pinkwasher because certain products from the company are made with milk from
  cows that have been injected with a synthetic hormone referred to as rBGH which
  has been known to have many health concerns, including cancer (Pool, 2011).
  Despite the Yoplait company making a small ten-cent donation to a breast cancer
  organization for every pink lid each consumer mails back to the company, the
  amount does not add up to be a lot of money (Pool, 2011). Yoplait is pinkwashing
  because the company is marketing that they support the cause of breast cancer while
  selling products that may lead to cancer.

     Pinkwashing is commonly performed by marketers throughout the world to
  increase exposure (Pool, 2011). A Fuse Tea sales representative stated that Fuse Tea
  changed the colour of its bottle to pink during breast cancer awareness month and
  handed out their new product to runners who were supporting breast cancer (Pool,
  2011). This action of making the bottle pink was to draw exposure to the product as
  they did not donate any of the proceeds to breast cancer. In addition, the Fused Tea
  company is a pinkwasher because their drink product is filled with artificial sugars
  which have been known to lead to cancer (Pool, 2011). It is hypocritical for Fuse Tea
  to make their product pink in attempt to increase exposure to breast cancer
  supporters because their product is known to be unhealthy (Pool, 2011).

     I recently became aware that, "the National Cancer Institute's annual budget is $1.8

                                               TRENDS IMPACTING INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER DECISION MAKING | 43
      billion, but only 5 percent goes towards cancer prevention" (Pool, 2011). I am
      shocked by this statement and feel that companies are using cause related
      marketing as an excuse to make more money. In addition, I don't understand what my
      valuable money is going towards when donating to a company. I have noticed that
      backlash by consumers has raised awareness of the misuse of the pink ribbon and
      cause- related marketing, but I am still shocked by how easily consumers are
      manipulated by certain companies. Thankfully, there is an amazing "Think Before You
      Pink" campaign that demands transparency and accountability on the part of
      companies that align themselves with breast cancer. In conclusion, I have learned to
      now be more aware of products and their ingredients along with question what
      companies are donating my money towards.

The willful blindness that guides corporations and global conglomerates in cause-related
marketing ventures can also be paralleled with what we are witnessing around climate change.
The wealthiest and most powerful companies and nations are contributing to the global demise
of women's health and climate degradation. KPU student Julie Hartman explores this
connection in her op-ed below.

  Student Op-Ed: (Pink-)Washing Away the Cause -- Manipulating
  Consumers Through Cause-Related Marketing Campaigns

      As consumers become more concerned with making smarter and more responsible
      purchasing decisions, companies become more concerned with improving their
      Corporate Social Responsibility ("CSR") as a means to generate customer sales
      (Solomon, White, & Dahl, 2015). One way in which companies can improve their CSR
      efforts is through cause-related marketing which is a "type of marketing that
      involves a collaboration between a for profit business and a non-profit organization
      for mutual benefit" (Solomon et al., 2015). Sometimes companies pursue cause-
      related marketing campaigns through unethical means, often negatively impacting
      the very consumer they are supposedly attempting to please; such is the case with
      "pink-washing" (Pool, 2011) a concept we'll examine more closely here.

         The pink ribbon that is the symbol of breast cancer may look innocent, but it is
      actually rooted in manipulation. Colour "is a powerful marketing tool that significantly
      influences consumer purchases, so much so that it accounts for 85 per cent of the
      reason why someone decides to purchase a product" (Kumar, 2017). Feelings and
      phrases associated with specific colours subconsciously influence consumer
      decision making (Kumar, 2017). Pink evokes feelings of universal love, friendship,
      and harmony; and is associated with phrases such as "tickled pink" which means "to

44 | TRENDS IMPACTING INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER DECISION MAKING
feel happy or content", and "in the pink" which means "to be healthy" (Bourn, 2010).
Combined, these associations give consumers a warm fuzzy feeling inside, making it
the perfect colour to use when developing a cause-related marketing campaign.
Plaster it all over products that claim to "support breast cancer" and consumers are
sure to believe the pink ribbon narrative (Pool, 2011).

   Pink-washing, as described by Breast Cancer Action who coined the term, is when
companies or organizations claim to care about breast cancer by promoting a pink
ribbon product while producing products that are linked to the disease ("4
Questions...," n.d.). While awareness campaigns, such as Komen for the Cure, are
"trendy", they don't do much to make a positive impact (Pool, 2011) They stress the
importance of self-exams and early detection knowing that it doesn't work for
everyone. These campaigns often claim they are trying to "find a cure" but deflect
when asked why they don't try to find the cause of breast cancer itself. Focusing on
the cause--or prevention--of this disease stands in direct opposition to those who
not only profit off breast cancer, but do so while continuing to produce products
containing known carcinogens (Pool, 2011).

   Globalization has led to the spread of breast cancer campaigns into new regions,
with their carcinogenic products in tow - resulting in increased risks of breast cancer
in countries where it previously had not been a major health risk (Pool, 2011). It can
be argued that this cause-related marketing campaign does more harm than good, in
relation to the cause that it promotes.

   When I reflect on pink-washing through the eye of an environmentalist I can see
many similarities between it and "greenwashing". The shared idea is that both seek to
convince consumers that their organizations are supporting causes while
simultaneously causing serious harm behind the scenes. Less apparent, however, is
the fact that both types of campaigns have a highly influential global presence.

   Although breast cancer and climate change may be issues invisible to some, they
still negatively impact a large global population. This invisibility is perhaps the
biggest hurdle in fighting climate change. Wealthy, developed countries have a
significantly greater carbon footprint than those of developing nations who will
experience the most devastating impacts of climate change. Because those living in
developed countries cannot see the impact first-hand and the concept of the Earth
dying feels so abstract and scary to them, it is easier to ignore the problem than to
approach it head on. I find this to parallel consumers of pink ribbon products in the
marketplace: they do so in good faith yet continue to be blissfully unaware of the foul
practices of the companies involved. They are unable to see the bigger picture
because they are blinded by the happy smiling faces of women featured in the
campaigns. With all the pink and the joy, it's almost an abstract concept to imagine

                                           TRENDS IMPACTING INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER DECISION MAKING | 45
      breast cancer being a deadly disease. And so, we remain detached from those who
      face the daily reality of breast cancer unless we know someone living with it,
      experience it ourselves, or take it upon ourselves to dig deeper than what is portrayed
      in marketing and the media.

Materialism & the Conscientious Consumer

Will money make you happy? A certain level of income is needed to meet our needs, and very
poor people are frequently dissatisfied with life (Diener & Seligman, 2004). However, having
more and more money has diminishing returns -- higher and higher incomes make less and
less difference to happiness. Wealthy nations tend to have higher average life satisfaction than
poor nations, but the United States has not experienced a rise in life satisfaction over the past
decades, even as income has doubled. The goal is to find a level of income that you can live
with and earn. Don't let your aspirations continue to rise so that you always feel poor, no matter
how much money you have. Research shows that materialistic people often tend to be less
happy, and putting your emphasis on relationships and other areas of life besides just money is
a wise strategy. Money can help life satisfaction, but when too many other valuable things are
sacrificed to earn a lot of money -- such as relationships or taking a less enjoyable job -- the
pursuit of money can harm happiness.

    It is important to always keep in mind that high materialism seems to lower life satisfaction
-- valuing money over other things such as relationships can make us dissatisfied. When people
think money is more important than everything else, they seem to have a harder time being
happy. And unless they make a great deal of money, they are not on average as happy as
others. Perhaps in seeking money they sacrifice other important things too much, such as
relationships, spirituality, or following their true interests. Or it may be that materialists just can
never get enough money to fulfill their dreams -- they always want more.

  Student Op-Ed: The Quick Fix

      In a society where materialism corrupts peoples' lives, "Minimalism: A documentary
      About the Important Things" (D'Avella, 2015), aims to show how your life can be
      better with less. People have become so accustomed to feeling they need these
      material items, that they don't think twice about the purchase as they assume
      happiness is a given. With this mindset, consumers are wired to be dissatisfied with
      what they have. To be able to transition to a minimalist life and live happier and
      financially free, consumers must eradicate their compulsive and addictive
      consumption behaviours.

         When you think of addiction, drugs, alcohol or gambling most likely come to mind.

46 | TRENDS IMPACTING INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER DECISION MAKING
However, addiction can manifest itself where you may least expect it. "Consumer
addiction is a physiological dependency on products or services" (Solomon, White, &
Dahl, 2015). Over the course of the last decade, Amazon has quickly become one of
the most addictive sources of consumer goods. More than 71 per cent of Americans
are Prime members and more than 46 per cent of them buy something once a week
(Moore, 2019). Addiction is defined as "the fact or condition of being addicted to a
particular substance, thing or activity.", and yet drug, alcohol and other substance
addictions are viewed with such negativity, whereas consumption addiction
(shopaholics) are met with a light and playful title.

   Shopaholics have all the same symptoms of any other addict, including
withdrawal. Addicted consumers do all this shopping to get that "quick fix" to feed
the urge. Consumers must convince themselves that they need every item they buy
because they will never admit they have a problem. Because of addictive
consumption, many consumers are living beyond their means and it is truly ruining
their lives. To take back control of their lives, the best thing consumers can do is
attempt to convert to a minimalist life and free themselves from the virus that is,
consumer addiction.

   On the other side of things, compulsive addiction also ruins many households.
"Compulsive consumption refers to repetitive shopping, often excessive, done as an
antidote to tension, anxiety, depression or boredom" (Solomon, White, & Dahl, 2015).
There are many reasons why people experience. Ultimately, the feeling of depression
and anxiety were only buried below the surface (D'Avella, 2015). Buying exactly what
you need, and nothing more, not only saves you money, but helps those feelings as
well. "Stripping your belongings down to the bare minimum feels like you are taking a
heavily weighted blanket off of your shoulders" (D'Avella, 2015).

   I believe that we, as a society, need to absorb certain aspects of the minimalist
lifestyle. Does that mean we should all live in tiny houses and have one outfit? No, it
does not. We should attempt to eradicate the negative behaviours associated with
our addictive and compulsive consumption to cleanse ourselves. Adopting the
minimalist lifestyle will not only help our mental health, but it will financially free you
from the strain of consumption (Solomon, White, & Dahl, 2015).

Chapter Reflections

 1. Consumer decision making isn't nearly as straight forward as, "need/want > buy". Making
      choices in a world of abundance can be an intense and often discouraging process.
      Watch this short Ted Talk by Dr. Sheena Iyengar about how to make choosing easier. What
      lessons should marketers take away from Dr. Iyengar's research and recommendations?

 2. As consumers we are often faced with the question (or dilemma) of what to do with our
      "stuff" when we're done with it. Throw it away? Add to the landfills in and around our
      cities? Donate? Repurpose? One popular form of disposal is called "lateral cycling."
      Explore lateral cycling as a marketing concept and a lifestyle related to anti-consumerist
      movements.

 3. What do upcycling and Habitat for Humanity have in common? Explore the Habitat for
      Humanity website to learn more about how upcycling factors into their building and
      design practices.

 4. How does "Upcycle That" turn peoples' trash into treasures? How can disposable
      consumer products be repositioned into luxury purchases? Learn more about Upcycle
      That's community and marketplace.

 5. Watch this video related to lateral cycling that shows how one woman created a
      movement by re-purposing children's' dolls. What is marketing's responsibility when it
      comes to disposal options and designing for longevity?

 6. Why is there such a need for abundance, and can we change our behaviors and attitudes
      towards food waste to help reduce the negative impacts it has on climate change? Watch
      this video where John Oliver tackles the food waste problem in the US. As a consumer,
      which aspects of the food waste problem troubles you the most? What changes would
      you like to see in...yourself, society, and government to help address the problems of food
      waste? How are marketers responsible for contributing to the problem and what can they
      do to eliminate it?

 7. What are the consequences of advertising to children? Consider food marketing: what
      impact does advertising junk food have on children? What about toys? What standards
      and expectations do these create in children and how can advertising to children evolve
      into excessive consumption? Learn more about Quebec's Consumer Protection Act. Do

      society? What role can legislation play in changing attitudes and behaviors in society?
 8. See Green America's 9 Cool Ways to Avoid Sweatshops. Discuss how a marketing
      campaign could be devised to persuade more corporations to actively avoid the use of
      sweatshops for production.
 9. Perhaps one of the most unique campaigns of 2016 came from Patagonia, a well-known
      brand committed to sustainability, who actually encouraged consumers to NOT purchase
      their products. Imagine that! This Drum article discusses the campaign and Patagonia's
      embrace of anti-consumerism with the intent to inspire more conscious consumption.
      Discuss Patagonia's anti-consumerism: can the brand attract more consumers by
      encouraging them to "buy less"? Will Patagonia inspire consumers to engage in more
      "conscious consumption"?

Key Terms and Concepts

          Compatibility: The degree to which an innovation fits with consumers' personal
             needs, values, lifestyles, and past experiences.

          Complexity: The levels of difficulty in understanding and using the innovation.
          Continuous innovation: Innovations that have the least disruption to consumers'

             established lifestyles.
          Diffusion of Innovation: A theory that describes consumers' acceptance of new

             ideas and trends in a bell-shaped curve.
          Discontinuous innovation: Innovations that drastically change consumers'

             lifestyles.
          Dynamically continuous innovation: Innovations that disrupt consumers' usual

             use of a certain product but do not radically alter it.
          Early adopters: According to the Diffusion of Innovation, early adopters are

             consumers who are willing to take some risks and typically assume some
             opinion leadership roles.
          Early majority: According to the Diffusion of Innovation, early majority are
             consumers who need to be more informed before deciding to adopt an
             innovation.
          Innovators: According to the Diffusion of Innovation, innovators are consumers
             who are willing to take risks of trying new things.
          Late Majority: According to the Diffusion of Innovation, the late majority are
             consumers who require more evidence to establish expectations of the
             innovations and often accept them due to peer pressure.
          Laggards: According to the Diffusion of Innovation, the laggards are consumers
             who prefer no change and may not adopt an idea until a style is an "old fashion.
          Relative advantage: The extent to which this innovation is superior in some

                                                                                                     KEY TERMS AND CONCEPTS | 55
             important way to existing products.
          Trialability: The degree to which consumers perceive an innovation may be tried

             out.

56 | KEY TERMS AND CONCEPTS
Diffusion of Innovation

Fashion innovations often appear as new ideas to consumers. This may include a new garment
type that is completely different from existing garments or is a common item used in an
innovative way or targeting a very different market. Women in the mid-1800 wearing "pants"
was one such example--women were not the target market for pants at all.

    Rogers (1962) proposed the concept of diffusion of innovation and described consumers'
acceptance of new ideas and trends in a bell-shaped curve that identifies five types of
consumers:

 1. Innovators (2.5% of the population): Consumers who are willing to take risks of trying new
      things.

 2. Early Adopters (13.5%): Consumers who are willing to take some risks and typically
      assume some opinion leadership roles.

 3. Early Majority (34%): Consumers who need to be more informed before deciding to adopt
      an innovation.

 4. Late Majority (34%): Consumers who require more evidence to establish expectations of
      the innovations and often accept them due to peer pressure.

 5. Laggards (16%): Consumers who prefer no change and may not adopt an idea until a style
      is an "old fashion."

Types of Innovation

Products evolve and ideas progress at different paces, causing some innovative products to be
more easily accepted by consumers than others.

    According to the effect of these innovations on consumers' established behavior, we can
classify innovation in three categories to help us determine the level of education needed to
help promote them (Robertson, 1967):

 1. Continuous: These innovations have the least disruption to consumers' established
      lifestyles. Think about the progression from rotary dial landline phones to push-button
      phones.

                                                                                                      DIFFUSION OF INNOVATION | 57
 2. Dynamically continuous: These innovations disrupt consumers' usual use of a certain
      product but do not radically alter them. Think about the progression from a stationed
      landline phone to a cordless landline phone and to a cellular phone.

 3. Discontinuous: These innovations drastically change consumers' lifestyles. Think about
      the introduction of smart phones: They are cellular phones, but they are portable handheld
      computers that provide location-based services.

Keep in mind that these categories are all based on consumers' evaluations and perceptions
and may differ depending on consumers' demographics, such as generation cohorts.

  Discussion

      What do you think of Instagram and TikTok's role in diffusing fashion ideas as
      opposed to couture brands' fashion shows and magazines?

Evaluation of Innovations

Like all other choices consumers make in their daily life, they evaluate innovations as an option
among many before deciding whether to adopt them. This decision, however, is not as easy,
as it may involve many uncertainties. For example, in addition to paying for the innovation, one
may not be sure if it will function as expected, whether people around them would approve this
purchase, whether the product suits them well, or even if they are confident enough to make the
product work. Understanding these associated risks helps consumers make the decision to buy
or not, and mitigating these uncertainties helps consumers to accept the product more easily.
According to Rogers (2010), consumers evaluate innovations on these four aspects:

 1. Relative advantage: Consumers evaluate the extent to which this innovation is superior in
      some important way to existing products.

 2. Compatibility: Consumers consider the degree to which an innovation fits with their
      personal needs, values, lifestyles, and past experiences. Think about an innovative
      technology product that can easily sync with your other devices as well as fit your
      personal style aesthetically!

 3. Complexity: Consumers evaluate the levels of difficulty in understanding and using the
      innovation. The easier it is to use the product, the more likely people will adopt the
      innovation.

 4. Trialability: Consumers need to assess the innovation. Trialability is the degree to which
      consumers perceive an innovation may be tried out. While many innovations in tangible
      products or services format can be tried out, some fashion innovations cannot be tried
      out, such as a new haircut as it cannot be undone in a short period of time.

Why do Consumers Wear
Clothes?

"Dress is an intentional and unintentional modification of appearance, what people do to
their bodies to maintain, manage, and alter appearance" (Reddy-Best, 2020). Dressing is an
important aspect in our everyday life, yet it can be a complex decision about what to buy and
what to wear at a specific location, time, and occasion.

    Knowing the reasons that people wear what they wear helps merchandisers offer the
products that satisfy consumer needs and, at times, help create a new culture. Many scholars
have their own perspectives on the reasons that people wear clothes. The most time-tested
postulation may be the four theories proposed by Dunlap (1928):

 1. Modesty Theory: Originating from the legend of the Garden of Eden, this theory holds that
      clothing was originally donned to cover genital parts. The practice has changed
      depending on what people consider "modest" as sexual self-conscious has been refined
      over time.

 2. Immodesty Theory: This theory maintains the salacious motivation for wearing clothes by
      arguing that people wear clothes to attract attention to certain parts of their body. This
      may be seen in some gown designs that emphasize upper body curves through
      exaggerated deep v-necklines.

 3. Protection Theory: People wear clothes to protect themselves from environmental and
      physical harm. For example, people wear hats and mittens during winter and a wetsuit
      when surfing.

 4. Adornment Theory: This theory maintains the notion of "attraction grabbing" but less in a
      sexual way. It has been developed to include motivation that involves personal
      decorations and aesthetic expressions. This may include external adornment, such as
      handbags and hair accessories, and bodily adornment, such as tattoos, plastic surgeries,
      and make-up.

However, in more recent research, scholars have focused more on the connection between

                                                                                     WHY DO CONSUMERS WEAR CLOTHES? | 61
identity and clothing choices on top of aesthetic expressions that were connected to
adornment theory.

    Consumers make choices about what they wear and how they appear in order to
communicate who they are and who they want to be, that is, their identity (Kaiser, 2012).
For example, you may wear a Cyclone T-shirt to show your identity as a cyclone when the
ISU football team plays the University of Iowa and you will avoid the colors representing the
opposing team. At the same time, you may aspire to dress professionally to impress your
colleagues during your summer internship at a company that you'd like to work at in the future.

Tensions

From a sociology point of view, fashion develops as a result of a variety of social tensions.
These tensions may arise over gender, body, status, and social regulations and push people to
adopt and adapt certain outfits or appearances over time.

    Eventually, they changed how people viewed these styles. For example, the women's
suffrage movement in the mid-19th century that called for reformation of physical freedom
for women, in addition to other women rights, pushed for the adoption of bloomers. Bloomers
are typically loose-fitted pants. Unlike the more confining and silhouette-emphasizing garments
that women wore long ago, such as corsets and layers of petticoats, bloomers provided
freedom of movement and symbolized the evolving gender roles. They were gradually accepted
by the wider public as a typical outfit for women.

Style Tribes

The term "style tribe" refers to distinctive groups or subcultures within a society that share
similar fashion choices, tastes, and cultural preferences. These groups often form around a
shared set of beliefs, values, and aesthetics, leading to the development of a unique and
identifiable style within their community. This term was coined by anthropologist and
photographer Ted Polhemus who analyzed street styles and the connection between progress
in fashion and identity.

62 | WHY DO CONSUMERS WEAR CLOTHES?
Members of a style tribe typically adopt specific clothing,

accessories, hairstyles, and other elements that distinguish them

from other groups and signal their affiliation to the tribe. These

subcultures may emerge as a response to shared interests, social

issues, music, art, or political beliefs and therefore form a shared

social identity.

A great example of such a subculture and style tribe is punk. The

punk spirit is associated with ideas such as non-conformity, anti-

authoritarianism, and anti-corporatism. Punk fashion is often

characterized by torn jeans, leather jackets, spiked armbands, DIY

ornamentation of clothes with studs, and political statements. Vivien

Westwood, a UK designer, is particularly known for her role as the Designer Vivienne
                                                                       Westwood was considered
punk fashion pioneer.                                                  one of the architects of

It's important to note that style tribes can vary significantly based punk fashion

on geographical location, cultural context, and historical periods.

They play a crucial role in shaping fashion trends, pushing the boundaries of creativity and

challenging societal norms surrounding appearance and self-expression.

Chapter Reflections

 1. Since 2020, the rise of fast fashion storefronts like SheIn and "fashion haul" content
      creators on TikTok have greatly affected the speed at which new "microtrends" rise and
      fall. Consider how fast-moving trends might change the typical "diffusion of innovation"
      process. For example, can late majority consumers still exist in a structure like this, or
      would they all fall into the laggards category?

 2. This TED Talk on The Solution to Fast Fashion by Josephine Philips discusses how
      tailoring, repairing, and thoughtfully purchasing clothing can limit waste. As a consumer,
      how do you approach this issue? Do you know how to fix clothing that fits badly or needs
      repair, or where to go for help?

 3. There are many reasons why people choose to wear a specific type or trend of clothing.
      Perhaps they want to express themselves, hide themselves, or simply meet the
      expectations of modern society. The band BABYMETAL wears clothing that meshes
      traditional punk and gothic paraphernalia (black clothing, metal, and sharp lines) with
      lolita fashion, a hyper-cute fashion subculture with shorter, full skirts, and fun, often
      colorful designs. Would you argue that BABYMETAL's fashion choices reflect their band's
      image, or not? Why?

 4. Kimberly Chrisman-Campbell's article "When American Suffragists Tried to `Wear the
      Pants'" discusses the backlash that women in the United States received when they
      attempted to wear pants while arguing for the right to vote. This is far from the last time
      that the "women in pants" debate would be relevant in the United States, though. As late
      as the 1960s, women on television were expected to wear skirts, making Mary Tyler
      Moore's choice to wear pants on the Dick Van Dyke show a major upset at the time, even
      though women in everyday life were wearing pants regularly without the same moral
      backlash that could be seen in the early 1900s. This decision was able to affect later
      television shows and support the normalization of women wearing pants. What other
      fashion innovations have you seen move from television into everyday life, or from
      everyday life to more mainstream media outlets?

 5. Danit Peleg's 2014 TED Talk imagined a future where consumers would download and 3D
      print their clothes at home. A decade later, this vision has yet to become mainstream.

                                                                                                          CHAPTER REFLECTIONS | 65
      What does this tell us about the diffusion of innovation in fashion--and what deeper
      physical, social, emotional, or cultural functions of clothing might be slowing that
      adoption?
 6. Vogue Business reports that Meta took a ~3 % stake (3 billion) in EssilorLuxottica in
      early 2025 -- leveraging its design heritage, global distribution, and fashion credibility to
      bring AI-powered smart eyewear to the mainstream. To what extent do you think
      technology -- specifically AIenabled smart glasses -- could transform how people see
      (literally and symbolically) fashion? What barriers--social, aesthetic, functional, or
      economical--might prevent these smart glasses from delivering on Meta's vision and
      achieving its business goals of this investment?

Learning Objectives

  In this section, we will learn about perception and how marketers use sensory
  marketing and the perceptual process to position brands in the marketplace.

     Upon completing this section, students should:
      1. Explain the role of sensory stimuli and sensory receptors.
      2. Distinguish between "sensation" and "perception."
      3. Identify and explain the key elements in the perceptual process.
      4. Describe how marketers develop positioning strategies.

Key Terms and Concepts

          Absolute threshold: A term that refers to the smallest (minimal) level of a stimuli
             (e.g. sound; sight, taste) that can still be detected at least half of the
             time.Attention: Following "exposure" in the perceptual process, Attention
             describes the dedicated effort and focus we give to incoming sensory
             information (e.g. sights, sounds).

          Differential threshold ("JND"): The differential threshold--also known as the JND
             or just noticeable difference--refers to the minimum difference in intensity that
             can be detected between two objects (e.g. the size of two bags of potato chips
             or the subtle difference in two logo designs).

          Exposure: This term refers to the vast amount of stimuli that surround us and
             that we come into contact with on a regular basis. In marketing this refers to the
             massive amount of commercial advertisements, commercials, products,
             branding, packaging, etc.

          Guerilla Marketing: A type of experiential advertising that is highly engaging,
             unanticipated, unique, unconventional, innovative, and designed with the intent to
             be memorable and become viral.

          Hype: Hype is a form of intense publicity and promotion that helps drive up the
             value of consumer goods and services. Consumers and resellers use social
             media platforms to exchange information and discuss products that are rare and
             sought-after are "hyping up" a good, which often results in a higher resale price.

          Interpretation: Following exposure and attention, Interpretation is the third part
             of the perceptual process and occurs when we give meaning to information and
             messages that have gained our attention.

          Limen: A threshold (like an invisible line) that separates what one can perceive
             and what one can't perceive: stimuli (sounds, sights) that fall below the limen are
             considered "subliminal" (not detectable, or below our own awareness level) and
             stimuli above the limen we detect and are aware of.

                                                                                                     KEY TERMS AND CONCEPTS | 69
          Perception: A term used to describe the process we undergo when we organize
             and interpret the sensations we experience. Perception gives us the ability to
             interpret meaning of what our sensory receptors are experiencing.

          Perceptual defense: In a marketing context, this occurs when consumers distort
             or ignore advertising messages that we may feel are personally threatening,
             uncomfortable, or even culturally unacceptable.

          Perceptual filters: When we take new information in, we organize and interpret it
             based on our prior experiences as well as our cultural norms. Perceptual filters
             help us make sense of new information and reduce anxiety when faced with the
             unknown (uncertainties).

          Perceptual mapping: A visual and graphic display (e.g. often a grid) that
             illustrates the perceptions customers have of a group of competing brands.

          Perceptual process: A process that begins when our sensory receptors (eyes,
             ears, tongue, nose, and skin) come in contact with sensory stimuli (sight, sounds,
             tastes, odors, and textiles) followed by the degree to which we pay attention to
             these stimuli and the meaning we draw from them (interpretation).

          Perceptual system: A system informed by our senses and sensory memories
             that help us interpret and understand the environment around us.

          Perceptual vigilance: In a marketing context, this occurs when consumers pay
             more attention (committed focus) to advertising messages that are relevant to
             our current state of being and/or meet our current unmet needs and wants.

          Positioning: A strategy developed by marketers to help influence how their target
             market (consumers) perceives a brand compared to the competition.

          Repositioning: This process involves changing the positioning of a brand so that
             the target market perceives the brand differently than before and anticipates
             different expectations and experiences compared to the competition.

          Salience: A term used to describe objects or stimuli that attract and hold our
             attention because we find them important relevant, prominent, or coming into our
             lives in a timely manner.

          Schemata: Described as being like "databases" in our memory, the schemata
             contains stored information based on our past experiences that help us make
             sense of and interpret new experiences.

          Selective attention: A term that describes our focused commitment to only
             some of the stimuli and senses that we come in contact with, based on what is
             relevant to our needs and/or interests.

70 | KEY TERMS AND CONCEPTS
 Selective distortion: A term used to describe situations in which people
   (consumers) interpret messages and information (advertisements/product
   labeling) in a way that supports their preexisting beliefs.

 Selective exposure: When we deliberately choose to come in contact with
   information from particular sources (e.g. social media, videos, advertisements,
   podcasts) we are engaging in selective exposure.

 Selective retention: A term used to describe when we forget information, despite
   it being important for us to retain and interpret (e.g. public service
   announcements that may help us live a better life, but we do not retain because
   we are uncomfortable with the idea of confronting our habits and/or behaviors).

 Sensation: The awareness we experience when our sensory receptors are
   engaged with the environment around us.

 Sensory adaptation: This terms describes a decreased sensitivity to stimulus
   (information/messages) after a long period of constant exposure. For
   consumers, this may be described as a form of (marketing/advertising) fatigue
   where they tune out (become less sensitive to) the same stimulus (ad) over time.

 Sensory marketing: Sensory marketing involves engaging consumers with one or
   more of their senses (see, touch, taste, smell, hear) with the intention to capture
   their attention and store the sensory information for future processing.

 Sensory receptors: A term used to encompass our eyes, ears, tongue, nose, and
   skin which come into contact with sensory stimuli -- the environment around us
   -- made up of sights, sounds, tastes, odors, and textiles.

 Stimuli: A smell, sound, object or anything else that engages our brain to pay
   attention and interpret what we have come in contact with in our environment.

 Subliminal perception/Subliminal advertising: The belief that "hidden
   messages" in marketing are effectively influencing consumers to engage in
   specific decision making behavior (e.g. secret messages telling consumers to
   buy certain brands).

 Weber's Law: This law states that the differential threshold (the just noticeable
   difference) is a constant proportion (or ratio) of the original stimulus.

                                                                                         KEY TERMS AND CONCEPTS | 71
72 | KEY TERMS AND CONCEPTS
Sensory Systems

The topics of sensation and perception are among the oldest and most important in all of
psychology. People are equipped with senses such as sight, hearing and taste that help us
to take in the world around us. Amazingly, our senses have the ability to convert real-world
information into electrical information that can be processed by the brain. The way we interpret
this information -- our perceptions -- is what leads to our experiences of the world.

    Sensation is the awareness resulting from the stimulation of a sense organ, and perception
is the organization and interpretation of sensations. Sensation and perception work seamlessly
together to allow us to experience the world through our sensory receptors (our eyes, ears,
nose, tongue, and skin) but also to combine what we are currently learning from the
environment with what we already know about it to make judgments and to choose appropriate
behaviors.

Sensory Systems

Humans possess powerful sensory capacities that allow us to sense the kaleidoscope of
sights, sounds, smells, and tastes that surround us. Our eyes detect light energy and our ears
pick up sound waves. Our skin senses touch, pressure, hot, and cold. Our tongues react to the
molecules of the foods we eat, and our noses detect scents in the air. The human perceptual
system is wired for accuracy, and people are exceedingly good at making use of the wide variety
of information available to them (Stoffregen & Bardy, 2001).

    The eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin sense the world around us, and in some cases
perform preliminary information processing on the incoming data. But by and large, we do not
experience sensation -- we experience the outcome of perception, the total package that the
brain puts together from the pieces it receives through our senses and that the brain creates for
us to experience. When we look out the window at a view of the countryside, or when we look
at the face of a good friend, we don't just see a jumble of colors and shapes -- we see, instead,
an image of a countryside or an image of a friend (Goodale & Milner, 2006).

                                                                                                                SENSORY SYSTEMS | 73
Sensory Receptors: Seeing

Whereas other animals rely primarily on hearing, smell, or touch to understand the world around
them, human beings rely primarily on vision. A large part of our cerebral cortex is devoted
to seeing, and we have substantial visual skills. Seeing begins when light falls on the eyes,
initiating the process of transduction. Once this visual information reaches the visual cortex,
it is processed by a variety of neurons that detect colors, shapes, and motion, and that create
meaningful perceptions out of the incoming stimuli.

    It has been estimated that the human visual system can detect and discriminate among
seven million color variations (Geldard, 1972), but these variations are all created by the
combinations of the three primary colors: red, green, and blue. The shade of a color, known as
hue, is conveyed by the wavelength of the light that enters the eye (we see shorter wavelengths
as more blue and longer wavelengths as more red), and we detect brightness from the intensity
or height of the wave (bigger or more intense waves are perceived as brighter).

  Understanding Color

      Color has always appealed to our visual senses and is commonly used as a
      marketing tool. It has a powerful psychological impact on consumers' behaviors and
      choices: studies have shown that particular colors simulate certain areas of the brain
      to promote excitement (DashBurst, 2018). Color can often be the main reason a
      consumer purchases a product or service.

         Have you ever wondered why the color red is
      associated with Coke, while Facebook is blue?
      Depending on the brand, its position in the market, and
      the feelings it wants to evoke in its consumers, color
      choice is serious business and not to be done without
      considerable thought and care.

         As expressed in Dashburst's 2018 article,
      "McDonald's chooses high-energy colors like red &
      yellow which appeal to children, kindle appetites and create a sense of urgency. Of
      course, Ronald McDonald himself is popular with the kids, but he's also sure to
      agitate parents quickly. This facilitates faster customer turnover" (Dashburst, 2018).

         On the other hand, Starbucks and its infamous use of green conveys a sense of
      "relaxation in their cafes, inviting customers to come in for a coffee break during a
      stressful day" (Dashburst, 2018).

         Clearly, choosing the "right" colors for a brand requires consideration of the kind of
      experience a brand wants to have with its consumers.

74 | SENSORY SYSTEMS
         Jesse Richardson, in his article, "3 Principles for High Conversions on Your
      Website" (2015), provides a brief summary of what many popular brand colors
      represent:

            Blue: Peace, Security, Reliable (Facebook, NASA, Dell)
            Black: Power, Intelligence, Strength (Nike, SONY, New York Times)
            Grey: Balance, Calm, Neutral (Honda, Apple, WIKIPEDIA)
            Green: Healthy, Growth, Restore (The Body Shop, Starbucks, Holiday Inn)
            Purple: Deep, Compassion, Respectable (Yahoo, Hallmark, Cadbury)
            Orange & Yellow: Warmth, Freedom, Social (Fanta, Mastercard, Nickelodeon)
            Red: Courage, Bold, Active (Red Bull, LEGO, Nintendo)

         Colors are also highly characteristic and represented in different cultures;
      psychological effects and interpretations vary depending on the specific culture. A
      color can have powerful influence on religious beliefs, politics, and art (Velarde, n.d.).
      For example, in the United States, the color pink can often by synonymous with
      femininity and thus stereotypical representations of hyper-femininity such as
      princesses and ballet dancers. Conversely, in Japan, pink has a "masculine
      association," according to Kate Smith (n.d.). "The annual spring blooming of the pink-
      blossomed cherry trees (the Sakura) is said to represent the young Japanese
      warriors who fell in battle in the prime of life (the Samurai; Smith, n.d.).

         In many Asian, and particularly Chinese cultures, the color red is strongly
      association with important cultural rituals and celebrations, such as marriage. It's a
      sign of success and happiness. In South Africa, however, red represents mourning,
      grief, and sadness.

Sensory Receptors: Hearing

Like vision and all the other senses, hearing begins with transmission. Sound waves that are
collected by our ears are converted into neural impulses, which are sent to the brain where they
are integrated with past experience and interpreted as the sounds we experience. The human
ear is sensitive to a wide range of sounds, from the faint tick of a clock in a nearby room to
the roar of a rock band at a nightclub, and we have the ability to detect very small variations in
sound. But the ear is particularly sensitive to sounds in the same frequency as the human voice.
A mother can pick out her child's voice from a host of others, and when we pick up the phone
we quickly recognize a familiar voice. In a fraction of a second, our auditory system receives
the sound waves, transmits them to the auditory cortex, compares them to stored knowledge
of other voices, and identifies the caller.

                                                                                                                SENSORY SYSTEMS | 75
  Using Music to Build Connections

      Consider how different your choice in music is from a workout at the gym, to doing
      homework on the weekend. We all have an intimate relationship with music in that it
      evokes a very emotional response and has a direct effect on our mood. Ever tried to
      go for a fast run listen to slow music? Brands will either select music or have original
      music written for them so consumers' hearing senses are engaged when interacting
      with the brand. Think about your favorite retail store, what kind of music do they
      play? Does it affect your mood and the length of time you spend in the store (I
      guarantee the brand is hoping so!).

Sensory Receptors: Tasting

Taste is important not only because it allows us to enjoy the food we eat, but, even more crucial,
because it leads us toward foods that provide energy (sugar, for instance) and away from
foods that could be harmful. Many children are picky eaters for a reason -- they are biologically
predisposed to be very careful about what they eat. Together with the sense of smell, taste
helps us maintain appetite, assess potential dangers (such as the odor of a gas leak or a
burning house), and avoid eating poisonous or spoiled food.

    Our ability to taste begins at the taste receptors on the tongue. The tongue detects six
different taste sensations, known respectively as sweet, salty, sour, bitter, piquancy (spicy), and
umami (savory).

  The Temptation of Sampling

      One of the best ways to sell food and beverage products is to allow consumers to
      taste them. Sampling--whether it's at your favorite farmer's market or Costco--is an
      effective way to engage consumers with their taste receptors so they can evaluate a
      product beyond their visual interpretation of it. Farmer's Markets have grown
      exponentially in urban settings and have successfully managed to create a kind of
      shopping utopia for many consumers: I cannot resist the stalls that are lined end to
      end with boxes of fresh Okanagan peaches every summer when they come to
      Vancouver. The smell of those peaches, the perfect texture and shape of them, and
      then the freshly cut and ready to sample slices...well, as you can probably image, I
      walk away with a dozen or more. My perception based on this experience is that
      peaches grown in the Okanagan are the best, bar none!

Sensory Receptors: Smelling

We have approximately 1,000 types of odor receptor cells (Bensafi et al., 2004), and it is
estimated that we can detect 10,000 different odors (Malnic, Hirono, Sato, & Buck, 1999). The
receptors come in many different shapes and respond selectively to different smells. Like a lock
and key, different chemical molecules fit into different receptor cells, and odors are detected
according to their influence on a combination of receptor cells. Just as the 10 digits from 0
to 9 can combine in many different ways to produce an endless array of phone numbers, odor
molecules bind to different combinations of receptors, and these combinations are decoded
in the olfactory cortex. The sense of smell peaks in early adulthood and then begins a slow
decline. By ages 60 to 70, the sense of smell has become sharply diminished. In addition,
women tend to have a more acute sense of smell than men.

  How Smells Create Preferences

      Consumers have strong emotional reactions to scents and odors. While some of us
      may be easily seduced by the smell of fresh baking, roasted coffee, and fried chicken,
      these odors may not be universally appealing to everyone. I grew up eating Italian
      food in my home: garlic was never used sparingly, we preferred to follow the "more is
      more" approach to flavoring. But if you grew up eating food absent of garlic, you
      might find its smell overpowering and unappetizing. Therefore, it is important to
      consider a consumer's cultural background and how it informs their processing of
      different odors.

Sensory Receptors: Touching

The sense of touch is essential to human development. The skin, the largest organ in the body,
is the sensory organ for touch. The skin contains a variety of nerve endings, combinations of
which respond to particular types of pressures and temperatures. When you touch different
parts of the body, you will find that some areas are more ticklish, whereas other areas respond
more to pain, cold, or heat.

  The Undeniable Power of Touch

      Can you imagine buying towels without touching them first? No, I can't either. Our
      sense of touch is one of the most important ways we interact with products and
      interpret their meaning. Consider the products you prefer to purchase in person (for
      me, fruit and vegetables) versus online (milk, cereal, olive oil) in your everyday life.
      Now what about when you take a trip to the mall, or visit your favorite fashion
      boutique? Our need to touch is critical to our ability to make judgement calls: a
      particular shirt may feel too thin; a sweater too scratchy; a belt too stiff. Product

                                                                                                                SENSORY SYSTEMS | 77
      packaging also encourages our desire to touch and engage in our haptic (touch)
      senses. The feel and shape of a bottle of Coke; the sleek elegance of a lipstick; and
      the smooth velvety box of a diamond ring all have important appeal and meaning to
      influence a consumer's preference and perception.

The Perceptual Process

Perception is how you interpret the world around you and make sense of it in your brain. You
do so via stimuli that affect your different senses -- sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste.
How you combine these senses also makes a difference. For example, in one study, consumers
were blindfolded and asked to drink a new brand of clear beer. Most of them said the product
tasted like regular beer. However, when the blindfolds came off and they drank the beer, many
of them described it as "watery" tasting (Ries, 2009). This suggests that consumers' visual
interpretation alone can influence their overall attitude towards a product or brand.

     The perceptual process begins when our sensory receptors (eyes, ears, tongue, nose, and skin)
     come in contact with sensory stimuli (sights, sounds, tastes, odours, and textiles) around us.
     Through our sensory system, we are exposed to an infinite amount of stimuli, some of which we
     pay attention to, and some we tune out completely. Those that receive our attention we evaluate
     and interpret their meaning based on our methods of cognitive and behavioural processing. After
     time, some of these stimuli become adapted and we seize to remark on their significance.

                                                                                                     THE PERCEPTUAL PROCESS | 81
The Perceptual Process

Perception is the process of selecting, organizing, and interpreting information. This process
includes the perception of select stimuli that pass through our perceptual filters, are organized
into our existing structures and patterns, and are then interpreted based on previous
experiences. Although perception is a largely cognitive and psychological process, how we
perceive the people and objects around us affects our communication. We respond differently
to an object or person that we perceive favorably than we do to something we find unfavorable.
But how do we filter through the mass amounts of incoming information, organize it, and make
meaning from what makes it through our perceptual filters and into our social realities?

    Ultimately, the perceptual process develops a consumer's perception of a brand and
formulates the brand's position vis--vis the competition on what marketers call a positioning
strategy.

  The Importance of Perception

      If consumers were to only rely on sensation, it is unlikely they would be able to draw
      any distinction between similar products. Peanut butter, cola, ice cream...each of
      these product categories have competitors vying to differentiate their products from
      one another. If you were to organize blind taste-tests with your friends where they
      could only rely on the sensation of taste, they may not be able to distinguish between
      them. So while sensation is what we experience when our sensory receptors are
      engaged, it is perception, that ultimately influences our consumer decisions and
      forms the basis of our preferences.

         For marketers, having your brand stand out in a crowded and noisy marketplace is
      critical to success: playing to consumers' senses is "next level" marketing as these
      rich experiences can code a brand into the consumer's memory. Capturing the
      consumer's attention through stunning visual appeals, catchy sounds, tasty samples,
      delicious aromas and hands-on experiences (also known as Guerilla Marketing)
      have completely over-taken the passive advertisements and billboards of the past.
      When done successfully, sensory marketing transitions a brand from "barely being
      noticed" to earning a top position in the consumer's mind.

82 | THE PERCEPTUAL PROCESS
Exposure

We take in information through all five of our senses, but our perceptual field (the world around
us) includes so many stimuli that it is impossible for our brains to process and make sense of
it all.

    Consumers are bombarded with messages on television, radio, magazines, the Internet,
and even bathroom walls. The average consumer is exposed to about three thousand
advertisements per day (Lasn, 1999). Consumers are online, watching television, and checking
their phones simultaneously. Some, but not all, information makes it into our brains. Selecting
information we see or hear (e.g., Instagram ads or YouTube videos) is called selective
exposure.

     Consumers are exposed to thousands of marketing images and messages on a daily basis. How
     many we actually pay attention to depends on our needs, wants, and the ability of marketers to
     stand out in a crowd.

Exposure speaks to the vast amount of commercial information--media messages,
commercial, and other forms of advertisements--we are constantly subjected to on a daily
basis.

    In 2017, Forbes.com contributing writer Jon Simpson challenged readers to count how
many brands they are exposed to from the moment they awake. From the bed to the shower to
the breakfast table, how many brands have you already come in contact with? 10? 20? Then turn
on your phone and start scrolling through your Twitter news feed...and now Instagram. Before
you leave for work or school, the number of brands you've been exposed to likely climbs into

                                                                                                     THE PERCEPTUAL PROCESS | 83
the hundreds. Simpson claims that, "[d]igital marketing experts estimate that most Americans
are exposed to around 1,000-4,000 ads each day" (Simpson, 2017).

    Given this sea of images, sounds, and messages, how can we possibly make sense of any
one brand's message? Consumers will devote a degree of mental processing to only those
messages that relate to their needs, wants, preferences, and attitudes. Brands are banking on
the fact that with higher degrees of exposure, at some point their message is going to "stick"
and capture consumers' attention at just the right moment.

    The absolute threshold of a sensation is defined as the intensity of a stimulus that allows
an organism to just barely detect it. The absolute threshold explains why you don't smell the
cologne someone is wearing in a classroom unless they are somewhat close to you.

    The differential threshold (or just noticeable difference, also referred to as "JND"), refers
to the change in a stimulus that can just barely be detected. In other words, it is the smallest
difference needed in order to differentiate between two stimuli.

    The German physiologist Ernst Weber (1795-1878) made an important discovery about the
JND -- namely, that the ability to detect differences depends not so much on the size of the
difference but on the size of the difference in relation to the absolute size of the stimulus.
Weber's Law maintains that the JND of a stimulus is a constant proportion of the original
intensity of the stimulus.

    As an example, if you have a cup of coffee that has only a very little bit of sugar in it (say
one teaspoon), adding another teaspoon of sugar will make a big difference in taste. But if you
added that same teaspoon to a cup of coffee that already had five teaspoons of sugar in it,
then you probably wouldn't taste the difference as much (in fact, according to Weber's Law, you
would have to add five more teaspoons to make the same difference in taste).

    Another interesting application of Weber's Law is in our everyday shopping behaviour. Our
tendency to perceive cost differences between products is dependent not only on the amount
of money we will spend or save, but also on the amount of money saved relative to the price of
the purchase. For example, if you were about to buy a soda or candy bar in a convenience store,
and the price of the items ranged from $1 to $3, you would likely think that the $3 item cost
"a lot more" than the $1 item. But now imagine that you were comparing between two music
systems, one that cost $397 and one that cost $399. Probably you would think that the cost of
the two systems was "about the same," even though buying the cheaper one would still save
you $2.

Attention

Attention is the next part of the perception process, in which we focus our attention on certain
incoming sensory information. Since we can't tune in to each and every one of the thousands of
messages and images we're exposed to daily, we tend to only pay attention to information that
we perceive to meet our needs or interests. This type of selective attention can help us meet
critical needs and get things done.

    Consider a hypothetical scenario: your car has finally broken down (for good) and you need

84 | THE PERCEPTUAL PROCESS
to look for something new. You're feeling stressed about what this is going to cost: a new car,
or even a decent used one, will set you back financially. Although car sharing has existed for
years now, you've never given it any thought: haven't had to, actually. But now, you take notice
of all the reserved parking spots for car sharing at school; and at the mall; and downtown. You
start seeing car sharing cars on the road more than you remember seeing before. You start
to wonder, "have these JUST appeared now, or has car sharing been this big all along, but I've
never noticed it before now?"

    This scenario points to the principle of salience: a situation in which we tend to pay
attention to information that attracts our attention in a particular context. The thing attracting
our attention is often something we might consider important, relevant, prominent, and timely.
At other times, people forget information, even if it's quite relevant to them, which is called
selective retention. Often the information contradicts the person's belief. A longtime chain
smoker who forgets much of the information communicated during an anti-smoking
commercial is an example. To be sure their advertising messages get through to you and you
remember them, companies use repetition. Despite how tired we grow of seeing the same
commercials over and over (and over, again), advertisers are hoping consumers will retain some
of the messages for when a need or want for their brand emerges.

    For many brands, however, this is an unacceptable way to get noticed! To have to wait until
a consumer has a timely need isn't strategic or reliable. It could take...forever! Brand salience
requires a brand to be top of mind when a consumer is ready to make a purchasing decision.
It means the consumer, regardless of need and timing, already knows about you (who you are,
what you're selling, and where to find you) and when it comes time to buy, they choose you over
the competition. As you might have guessed, the problem is this: how can a brand be noticed
when it lacks salience?

                       Five Ways to Command a Receiver's Attention

          Size: Bigger stimuli tend to command more attention.
          Color: Color that differs from its surroundings since contrast helps to make one

             brand stand out from the competition.
          Position: In North America, ads on the right-hand page of a magazine get more

             attention than those on the left-hand side.
          Placement: Ads in places where you don't expect to see them, such as walls of

             tunnels or on the ground in public spaces, get more attention because of their
             novel placements.
          Shock: Provocative content and eye-catching design can increase attention,
             benefit memory, and positively influence consumer behaviour (Dahl, et.al., 2003).

                                                                                                     THE PERCEPTUAL PROCESS | 85
  The Two Kinds of Perceptual Selectivity

      Perceptual defense is defined as, "[a] tendency to distort or ignore information that is
      either personally threatening or culturally unacceptable" (Rice University, n.d.). This
      presents a serious challenge for some marketers, particularly those who are
      designing persuasive messaging that acts as a public service announcement (or
      PSA). Anti-smoking, anti-drinking & driving, and messaging that confronts an
      audience on dangerous or harmful behaviour is often ignored because the audience
      may not identify that the message is for them, or they may be too defensive to
      process the contents of the message. (This isn't to say that PSA's are a waste of time
      and resources, but instead to highlight the difficulty and complexity in creating
      effective marketing messages to change behaviours and attitudes when they speak
      so personally to us).

         Perceptual vigilance on the other hand takes place when we, as consumers find
      ourselves in a position where we pay more attention to advertisements that meet our
      current needs and wants. While advertisements surround us on a day-to-day basis,
      we tune out those that are irrelevant or ill-suited to our particular situations. But when
      our car breaks down and we're thinking of buying a new one, we may start to "notice"
      car ads more. Or if we're considering planning a vacation, we may come to focus
      more on all the hotel and spa ads we largely ignored in the past.

Maximizing exposure with the intent to become noticed and make a strong impression on
consumers is the reason why brands might engage in guerilla marketing. This form of
marketing is often unconventional, unexpected, innovative, and memorable. Although it can be
risky, when executed successfully guerilla marketing will result in word-of-mouth advertising
and with any luck, become a viral sensation. Guerilla marketing differs from hype, which is
defined as "extravagant or intensive publicity or promotion" ("Hype marketing," 2020) and is
usually attributed to products that are rare or in limited supply. In resale markets, such as
consumer second-hand markets, hype is a driving force of value for products that are perceived
to have high social, emotional, and monetary value. Hype built on social media platforms that
is created by resellers of rare and much sought-after sneakers, for example, helps to drive the
price up beyond the sneakers' original retail prices.

    What is the hidden message in that magazine ad you're looking at? Are you getting
brainwashed by innocent-looking TV commercials that "order" you to buy a product? If you
believe advertisers are doing their best to place "secret messages" all around you, you're not
alone. Subliminal perception is a topic that has captivated the public for more than fifty years,
despite the fact that there is virtually no proof that this process has any effect on consumer
behaviour. Another word for perceptual threshold is limen (just remember "the secret of Sprite"),

86 | THE PERCEPTUAL PROCESS
and we term stimuli that fall below the limen subliminal. So subliminal perception (supposedly)
occurs when the stimulus is below the level of the consumer's awareness.

  Subliminal or Sublime?

      A survey of American consumers found that almost two-thirds believe in the
      existence of subliminal advertising, and more than one-half are convinced that this
      technique can get them to buy things they do not really want (Lev, 1991). They
      believe marketers design many advertising messages so the consumers perceive
      them unconsciously, or below the threshold of recognition. For example, several
      authors single out beverage ads as they point to ambiguous shapes in ice cubes they
      claim are actually women's bodies or erotic words. Most recently, ABC rejected a
      Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) commercial that invited viewers to slowly replay the ad
      to find a secret message, citing the network's long-standing policy against subliminal
      advertising. KFC argued that the ad wasn't subliminal at all because the company
      was telling viewers about the message and how to find it. The network wasn't
      convinced--but you should be (Ruggless, 2006).

         Like this KFC ad, most examples of subliminal advertising that people "discover"
      are not subliminal at all--on the contrary, the images are quite apparent. Remember,
      if you can see it or hear it, it's not subliminal; the stimulus is above the level of
      conscious awareness. Nonetheless, the continuing controversy about subliminal
      persuasion has been important in shaping the public's beliefs about advertisers' and
      marketers' abilities to manipulate consumers against their will.

         Although some research suggests that subliminal messages can work under very
      specific conditions, this technique has very little applicability to advertising even if
      we wanted to resort to it. For one, an advertiser would have to send a message that's
      very carefully tailored to each individual rather than to a large audience. In addition,
      there are wide individual differences in threshold levels (what we're capable of
      consciously perceiving); for a message to avoid conscious detection by consumers
      who have low thresholds, it would have to be so weak that it would not reach those
      who have high thresholds.

         However, a new study surely will add fuel to the long-raging debate. The
      researchers reported evidence that a mere thirty-millisecond exposure to a well-
      known brand logo can in fact influence behaviour; specifically the study found that
      people who were exposed to a quick shot of Apple's logo thought more creatively in a
      laboratory task (mission: come up with innovative uses for a brick) than did those
      who saw the IBM logo (Claburn, 2008). Apple will no doubt love the implication, but
      most other advertisers are too focused on efforts to persuade you when you're
      aware of what they're up to.

                                                                                                     THE PERCEPTUAL PROCESS | 87
Interpretation

Although selecting and organizing incoming stimuli happens very quickly, and sometimes
without much conscious thought, interpretation can be a much more deliberate and conscious
step in the perception process. Interpretation is the third part of the perception process, where
we assign meaning to our experiences using mental structures known as schemata. Schemata
are like databases of stored, related information that we use to interpret new experiences.
We all have fairly complicated schemata that have developed over time as small units of
information combined to make more meaningful complexes of information.

    It's important to be aware of schemata because our interpretations affect our behaviour.
For example, if you are doing a group project for class and you perceive a group member to
be shy based on your schema of how shy people communicate, you may avoid giving them
presentation responsibilities in your group project because you are of the belief that shy people
may not make good public speakers. Schemata also guide our interactions, providing a script
for our behaviours. We know, in general, how to act and communicate in a doctor's waiting
room, in a classroom, on a first date, and on a game show. Even a person who has never been
on a game show can develop a schema for how to act in that environment by watching The
Price Is Right, for example. People go to great lengths to make shirts with clever sayings or
act enthusiastically in hopes of being picked to be a part of the studio audience and hopefully
become a contestant on the show.

    We have schemata about individuals, groups, places, and things, and these schemata filter
our perceptions before, during, and after interactions. As schemata are retrieved from memory,
they are executed, like computer programs or apps on your smartphone, to help us interpret the
world around us. Just like computer programs and apps must be regularly updated to improve
their functioning, competent communicators update and adapt their schemata as they have
new experiences.

    Gestalt psychology The German word gestalt is usually translated as "organized whole" and
the catchphrase "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts" succinctly summarizes the
major message of this approach. Gestalt psychologists believed that perception was primarily
a top-down process involving meaningful units rather than a bottom-up process combining
elements of sensation. Only with the aid of prior experience could a consumer meaningfully
interpret often ambiguous sensory information. For example, when "reading" picture below,
you may determine what constitutes a rabbit versus a duck. Another way of influencing
interpretation of an ambiguous image is to establish a perceptual set through exposure to
conceptually related images or words. For example, if you first hear the sound of ducks or read
the words duck, you would be more likely to perceive the duck than the rabbit.

Adaptation

A fundamental process of perception is sensory adaptation -- a decreased sensitivity to a
stimulus after prolonged and constant exposure. When you step into a swimming pool, the
water initially feels cold, but after a while you stop noticing it. After prolonged exposure to the
same stimulus, our sensitivity toward it diminishes and we no longer perceive it. The ability to
adapt to the things that don't change around us is essential to our survival, as it leaves our
sensory receptors free to detect the important and informative changes in our environment and
to respond accordingly. We ignore the sounds that our car makes every day, which leaves us
free to pay attention to the sounds that are different from normal, and thus likely to need our
attention. Our sensory receptors are alert to novelty and are fatigued after constant exposure to
the same stimulus.

    As mentioned at the top of this page, consumers are exposed to thousands of advertising
and marketing messages each day. While some ads can successfully break through the noise
and capture our attention, over time we may just grow tired of the ad and it no longer interests
us. When left unchanged, the ad fails and fades into the background. Tuning out
advertisements is a marketer's nightmare (think of how much they've spent to get our attention
in the first place!) The question for the marketer becomes this: how much exposure is enough
to garner attention, but not so much to reach a state of adaptation where the consumer no longer
responds?

    When we experience a sensory stimulus that doesn't change, we stop paying attention to
it. This is why we don't feel the weight of our clothing, hear the hum of a projector in a lecture
hall, or see all the tiny scratches on the lenses of our glasses. When a stimulus is constant and
unchanging, we experience sensory adaptation. During this process we become less sensitive
to that stimulus. A great example of this occurs when we leave the radio on in our car after we
park it at home for the night. When we listen to the radio on the way home from work the volume
seems reasonable. However, the next morning when we start the car, we might be startled by
how loud the radio is. We don't remember it being that loud last night. What happened? What
happened is that we adapted to the constant stimulus of the radio volume over the course of
the previous day. This required us to continue to turn up the volume of the radio to combat the

                                                                                                     THE PERCEPTUAL PROCESS | 89
constantly decreasing sensitivity. However, after a number of hours away from that constant
stimulus, the volume that was once reasonable is entirely too loud. We are no longer adapted
to that stimulus!

92 | THE PERCEPTUAL PROCESS
Positioning

Positioning refers to the development of strategy that helps to influence how a particular
market segment perceives a brand, good, or service in comparison to the competition.
Positioning is all about defining a space in the mind of the customer -- something that your
customer thinks of and associates with your product.

    Remember that positioning doesn't just mean what your target market thinks about your
product. Rather, it's about how they think about it relative to competitors' products -- your
product is less expensive, performs better, or fits better with the customer's lifestyle.
Positioning often relates to a brand's strategic objectives.

Perceptual Mapping & Positioning Dimensions

Perceptual mapping is a graphic display explaining the perceptions of customers with relation
to product characteristics. Perceptual mapping is a diagrammatic technique used by marketers
in an attempt to visually display the perceptions of customers or potential customers. Typically
the position of a product, product line, brand, or company is displayed relative to their
competition. Some perceptual maps use different size circles to indicate the sales volume or
market share of the various competing products.

    Perceptual maps commonly have two dimensions even though they are capable of having
more than that. For example, in the perceptual map below, you can see consumer perceptions
of various automobiles on the two dimensions of sportiness/conservative and classy/
affordable. This sample of consumers felt that Porsche cars were the sportiest and classiest
of the ones in the study. They felt that Plymouth cars were the most practical and conservative.
Cars that are positioned close to each other were seen as similar on the relevant dimensions by
the consumer. For example, consumers saw Buick, Chrysler, and Oldsmobile as similar: they are
close competitors and form a competitive grouping. A company considering the introduction of
a new model may look for an area on the map free from competitors or find a way to further
differentiate and stand out from the crowd.

                                                                                                                         POSITIONING | 93
     Consumer perceptions of automobiles can be mapped by comparing (X axis) how conservative
     they are versus how sporty they are; and (Y axis) how classy and distinct they are versus how
     practical and affordable they are.

Positioning is facilitated by perceptual mapping to determine the ideal points of consumers.
This helps to determine if positioning should be functional, symbolic, or experiential. Strong
positioning will enable a single product to appeal to different customers for different reasons.
For example, two people are interested in buying a new car; one wants a car that is powerful
and stylish while the other buyer is looking for a car that is reliable and safe and yet they buy the
same exact car. One purchase solved a problem and exemplifies functional positioning while
the other purchase is an example of symbolic and/or experiential positioning.

Positioning Statements

After marketers work through the process of homing in on the best positioning strategy, they
arrive at the final step: the positioning statement. The positioning statement reflects everything
you've learned up to that point about how your product, service, or brand can best reach your
target segment. As a statement, it explains exactly how you plan to provide value to those target
customers. In effect, it's a short, persuasive argument.

    Typically, a positioning statement is one sentence that succinctly identifies the target
market and spells out what you want them to think about your brand. This statement should
include 1) the target segment, 2) the brand name, 3) the product/service category or frame of
reference in which you are establishing this market position, 4) the key points of differentiation,
and 5) the reasons customers should believe the positioning claims.

94 | POSITIONING
  Crafting the Positioning Statement

      The brand consultancy EquiBrand (n.d.) recommends the following straightforward
      formula for writing positioning statements:

         To [target audience], Product X is the only [category or frame of reference] that
      [points of differentiation/benefits delivered] because [reasons to believe].

         The parts of the formula supplied by you (the marketer) are as follows:

            The "target audience" is a brief description of the segment you're targeting
              with this positioning strategy. For example: young urban males, managing
              partners in law firms, or small business owners in the Pacific Northwest.

            "Product X" is your product, service, or brand name.
            The "category or frame of reference" is the category of products or services

              you're competing in. For instance: spectator sporting events, virtual assistant
              services, or employer 401K benefit plans.
            The "points of differentiation/benefits delivered" explains both what problem
              you solve and how you solve it in a different and better way than competitors.
              It highlights the competitive advantage(s) underpinning your positioning
              strategy. Be sure to explain not just what is different about you, but why
              customers care about that difference.
            The "reasons to believe" are any proof points or evidence that show your
              customers how you live up to your claims about how you are different and
              better.

Let's look at some examples of well-written positioning statements:

AMAZON (circa 2001, when it sold primarily books)

"For World Wide Web users who enjoy books, Amazon is a retail bookseller that provides instant
access to over 1.1 million books. Unlike traditional book retailers, Amazon provides a
combination of extraordinary convenience, low prices and comprehensive selection." ("Figuring
Out...," 2014).

    This clearly worded positioning statement follows the formula closely, even though the
"reasons to believe" are added as a second sentence. It presents the competitive advantage
("instant access to over 1.1 million books") as a clear differentiator, and with this wording
we also understand the problem Amazon solves-convenient access to lots of books. The
specific reasons to believe are highly desirable benefits for the target audience. Note that World
Wide Web refers to the Internet.

                                                                                                                         POSITIONING | 95
MOTEL 6

"To frugal people, Motel 6 is the alternative to staying with family and friends that provides a
welcoming, comfortable night's rest at a reasonable price." (Kelley & Jugenheimer, 2015).

    The Motel 6 example is a very concise positioning statement. It's interesting that the frame
of reference is "staying with friends and family," rather than "motels" generally. This shows
an astute understanding of the target customer's mindset and the recognition that the motel
chain's leading competitor is not staying in a motel. The point of differentiation also reveals the
problem Motel 6 solves: where to get a "welcoming, comfortable night's rest at a reasonable
price." Its points of differentiation and reasons to believe blur together, but the statement
provides well-focused direction for a marketing mix that targets "frugal people."

TIDE LAUNDRY DETERGENT

"For cost-conscious moms of large blue-collar families with active children, Tide is the brand
of laundry detergent that gets clothes their cleanest and keeps them looking new because
"improved" Tide formulation powers out stains while keeping clothes from fading and fraying."
(Kelley & Jugenheimer, 2015).

    This third positioning statement identifies the target audience so specifically that it's easy
to create a vivid mental picture of the customer. The problem Tide solves is very clear: getting
clothes clean. This statement emphasizes the product's competitive advantage around
cleaning power and superior formulation, while promising valued benefits that customers enjoy
when they use this product. The onus here is on the brand to provide these concrete benefits
around not "fading and fraying," but these are definite reasons to believe if indeed the product
can deliver.

Evaluating Positioning Statements

How do you know when a positioning statement is going to be effective? Obviously, positioning
statements should contain all the elements in the formula above, since that information is
needed to translate the positioning strategy into a well-developed marketing mix. There are
other criteria you should look for, as well. For example, the following:

   Is it tailored to the target market? Too often, positioning statements either leave out the
      target segment, or else the entire approach isn't really suited to that unique group. If a
      positioning statement would work just as well if you plugged in a completely different
      target segment, then you probably haven't thought deeply enough about your target's
      unique needs and what will make them want your product. Or, you've defined your target
      segment too narrowly, in which case you should revisit whom you're trying to reach.

   Is it simple, focused, and memorable? A positioning statement that is overly complex will
      be hard to execute against because it isn't focused enough to deliver a clear message to
      the customer. Make sure it is very clear what problem(s) you solve. Use easy-to-

96 | POSITIONING
      understand words instead of jargon that muddles the meaning. If your statement is
      running long, consider trimming a few differentiators or benefits. It's actually very good to
      prune down to the essentials so your meaning is crystal clear. Make every word count!
   Does it provide an unmistakable picture of your product, service, or brand? Your
      positioning statement should work beautifully for you, but not very well for your
      competitors. If you can substitute any competitor's name for your own in the positioning
      statement--and it still sounds credible--then you need some additional work on your
      differentiators and competitive advantages. If you are going to own your market niche, it
      must be a place that no one else can easily occupy.
   Can you deliver on the promise you make? The positioning statement promises some
      benefits or outcomes to your customers. You must be able to consistently live up to this
      promise--otherwise you'll lose credibility, and your offering will stand for something that's
      untrustworthy. If you can't live up to your promise, you need to take another, more realistic
      look at the offering's benefits and the customers' reasons to believe.
   Does it provide helpful direction for designing the marketing mix and other
      decisions? From the positioning statement, you should have a sense of what types of
      activities and messages are consistent with that positioning and support the brand you
      are working to build.

By combining customer research and perceptual mapping, a marketer can also create a
positioning statement using one of the three basic concepts discussed below.

                         The Three Basic Concepts for Positioning

          Functional Positions: Functional positions deal with solving a problem, providing
             benefits, and getting a favourable perception from investors, stockholders, and
             consumers.

          Symbolic Positions: Symbolic positions deal with self-image enhancement, ego
             identification, belongingness, social meaningfulness, and affective fulfillment.

          Experiential Positions: Experiential positions deal with providing sensory or
             cognitive stimulation.

                                                                                                                         POSITIONING | 97
Repositioning

Positioning is a powerful tool, but when you position a product, service, or brand, the world
doesn't stand still. Market conditions change. Your customers and competitors change. You
change.

    Positioning should be designed to last. But for most offerings, you'll eventually need to
revisit your positioning strategy and consider whether to make adjustments. This process
has a very logical name: repositioning. In some ways, repositioning is more challenging than
initial positioning because you're building on prior established work, trying to strengthen what's
working and fix what isn't--it's a bit like remodeling an old house instead of building one from
scratch.

    Just as the name implies, repositioning involves changing the identity of a product relative
to competing products. Many famous companies have saved failing products by repositioning
them in the market. When a company initiates a repositioning strategy, it needs to change
the expectations of stakeholders, including employees, stockholders, and financial backers.
An organization can reposition a product line, a brand, or an entire company. Determining
which type of repositioning is needed isn't always easy; it is important to understand the
changes in the current market and how competitors will react to the change. If a change is
volatile and is unprecedented, there may not be enough information available to use to make a
decision. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of a company can help determine when
repositioning may be necessary and how the change should occur.

  Brand Repositioning and the American Red Cross

      Despite the risks, repositioning can be wildly successful when it is handled
      effectively. A good case in point is the American Red Cross. In 2009, the U.S. had
      sunk into the Great Recession, and the American Red Cross ("ARC") was also feeling
      the pain. With its budget relying heavily on charitable donations, and with Americans
      giving less due to the recession, the nonprofit organization faced a budget deficit
      going into the fourth quarter.

         For many nonprofit organizations, the last quarter of the year is prime fundraising
      season, since people open their wallets for holiday giving. Up until 2009, this was not
      the case for the Red Cross. Americans gave generously to the organization during
      disasters, but the ARC wasn't people's top choice for holiday giving. Seeing an
      opportunity in this apparent disconnect, the ARC engaged a creative agency to help
      repositioning the organization in the minds of potential donors.

         Research confirmed that the competitive advantage of the American Red Cross, in
      consumers' minds, was providing help in times of disaster. The organization's then-
      current positioning of "Change a Life, Starting with Your Own" shared a powerful

98 | POSITIONING
 emotional message, but it did not reinforce the competitive advantage or create a
 sense of urgency around giving to the ARC. The repositioning effort developed a new
 positioning direction expressed in the tag line "Give the gift that saves the day."

    This message reinforced the powerful role that the Red Cross plays in times of
 disaster and invited Americans to be part of that important work. With words like
 "give the gift," it also implanted the idea of the ARC as a great recipient for holiday
 giving. The following video was created as part of the 2009 integrated marketing
 campaign that introduced this new positioning.

    The repositioning was a resounding success. Income increased more than 5
 percent compared to prior years. People who saw ads associated with the
 repositioning campaign were twice as likely to donate as people who didn't see them.
 The fourth quarter of 2009 was one of the strongest since 2000. Brand awareness
 increased by 6 percentage points. The benefits didn't stop in 2009, either. Building on
 their success, the ARC expanded the repositioning campaign in 2010. By the end of
 the year, income had increased 26 percent over 2009, and the average gift size
 increased 43 percent ("American Red Cross...," 2009).

    These impressive results reveal the power of repositioning when it is handled well.

Situational Factors and
Influences

In additional to demographic and social influences, we also examine some of the situational
factors that influence consumer decision making, such as the design and presentation of
a retail environment. While many retailers seek to maximize sales and grow their customer
base, "taking care" of the customer is something retailers are also becoming more focused on
today. Creating comfortable, accessible, and pleasant retail environments that help customers
achieve their shopping goals is a win-win for retailers and customers alike. And yes, the price-
conscious consumer may be less concerned with the tidiness of a change room or the careful
folding pattern of shirts, but nonetheless, it is still important for retailers to take care of their
customers. Whether they are limited due to time (shopping on a lunch break) or patience (have
you ever shopped with a toddler?), customers are influenced by nearly everything around them
when they are immersed in the retail experience.

    The science of consumer behavior describes and even defines how you shop and, more
importantly, why you buy. Smart retailers study consumer behavior patterns and lay out their
stores and merchandise accordingly. For example, did you know that 86 percent of women look
at price tags when they shop, while only 72 percent of men do (Underhill, 1999)? And did you
know that the average shopper doesn't actually notice anything that's in the entrance of a store?

Situational Influences on Consumer Decision Making

Shopping. It's the national pastime for some but a detested necessity for others. Whether you
love shopping ("Oh, that is sooooooo cute!") or do everything to avoid it ("I'm not going to the
mall, no matter what"), it is a major source of spending. But what makes you stop and pick up
one sweater but not another? What makes you buy a pair of jeans you weren't even looking for?
What makes you walk out of the store spending more than you had planned?

    Shopping experiences involve customers interacting with tangible and intangible aspects of
a shopping environment. Some of the most significant influences on our decisions to buy are:
atmospherics; crowding; location; layout; time; and, mood.

                                                                                SITUATIONAL FACTORS AND INFLUENCES | 101
Atmospherics

The effects of store atmospherics on shopping behaviour have been explored since the 1960s
(Turley & Millman, 2000). Kotler (1973) was the first to use and define the term atmospherics.
He argues that consciously controlled and designed consumption space can influence the
emotional state of the customers, which increase their likelihood of making purchases (Kotler,
1973). The set of controllable characteristics of environmental cues are "atmospherics".

    More recently, researchers have contextualized atmospheric cues such as music, lighting,
color, and crowding in retail settings, and investigated how these various atmospheric variables
contribute to shopping outcomes such as approach/avoidance, affective response,
merchandise/retailer evaluations, shopping satisfaction, and intention to purchase (Plunkett,
2013).

    Based on a review of empirical studies of atmospheric effects on shopping behaviour, Turley
& Milliman (2000) created a comprehensive table that systematically categorizes the variables
into five groups: external variables; general interior variables; layout and design variables; point
of purchase (POP) and decoration variables; and, human variables. Please refer to the table
below for more details.

                     Five atmospheric variables that impact shopping outcomes.

                      Variables         Variables        Variables

traffic                                 Dead areas
Exterior walls

Among the five groups of variables, external variables are those mostly determined when a
store location is selected and are most challenging to change after the store opens. However,
there are still aspects that are within the control of a retailer, but oftentimes overlooked. For
example, exterior signage, entrances and exterior display windows are all important elements
that can make positive first impressions on shoppers and entice them to enter the store. These
variables are integral to a retailer's brand image and should reflect a retailer's overall business
strategy.

    General interior variables are within the control of a retailer, but they are unlikely to be
changed regularly unless a remodeling project is done. The lifespan of a remodel is driven
by market competition, but generally speaking, many retailers have programs which call for
a minor renovation every five years and a full remodel every ten years (Avis, 2012). Among
the general interior variables, music, scents, temperature and cleanliness should be carefully
controlled and monitored on a regular basis. Retailers have full control over layout and design
variables and point-of-purchase (POP) and decoration variables, all of which directly contribute
to customers' shopping experiences. Human variables should be included in retailers' operation
strategies.

  Atmospherics in a Variety of Contexts

      Physical factors that firms can control, such as the layout of a store, music played at
      stores, the lighting, temperature, and even the smells you experience are called
      atmospherics. Perhaps you've visited the office of an apartment complex and
      noticed how great it looked and even smelled. It's no coincidence. The managers of
      the complex were trying to get you to stay for a while and have a look at their
      facilities. Research shows that "strategic fragrancing" results in customers staying in
      stores longer, buying more, and leaving with better impressions of the quality of
      stores' services and products. Mirrors near hotel elevators are another example.
      Hotel operators have found that when people are busy looking at themselves in the
      mirrors, they don't feel like they are waiting as long for their elevators (Moore, 2008).

                                        SITUATIONAL FACTORS AND INFLUENCES | 103
Crowding

Crowding is another situational factor. Have you ever left a store and not purchased anything
because it was just too crowded? Some studies have shown that consumers feel better about
retailers who attempt to prevent overcrowding in their stores. However, other studies have
shown that to a certain extent, crowding can have a positive impact on a person's buying
experience. The phenomenon is often referred to as "herd behavior" (Gaumer & Leif, 2005).

Location

Retailers have traditionally provided consumers with access to their goods and services
through retail stores. Location decisions are critical to the ultimate success of the retail
enterprise.

      Good locations allow ready access, attract large numbers of customers and increase the
      potential sales of retail outlets... even slight differences in location can have significant effects
      on market share and profitability (ghosh & McLafferty, 1987).

While many elements of retail and service strategy are dynamic and fast-changing, location
decisions are by contrast traditionally long-term and binding. For example, it is relatively
straightforward for a retailer or service provider to change pricing, product/service assortment
or advertising. However, the physical "bricks-and-mortar" of store locations are a form of
grounded capital that cannot be easily altered or quickly changed. As such, there is an
underlying inertia to retail location decisions; once made, the organization usually must live with
the decision for many years to come.

  Winning the Location Game

      Store locations also influence behavior. Starbucks has done a good job in terms of
      locating its stores. It has the process down to a science; you can scarcely drive a few
      miles down the road without passing a Starbucks. You can also buy cups of
      Starbucks coffee at many grocery stores and in airports--virtually any place where
      there is foot traffic.

104 | SITUATIONAL FACTORS AND INFLUENCES
Layout

                           The design and layout of a retail store should be done with care
                           and consideration for the customer. Large aisles and
                           easy-to-access items, for example, make shopping easier and
                           benefit the retailer's bottom line as well.

Have you ever been in a department story and couldn't find your way out? No, you aren't
necessarily directionally challenged. Marketing professionals take physical factors such as a
store's design and layout into account when they are designing their facilities. Presumably, the
longer you wander around a facility, the more you will spend. Grocery stores frequently place
bread and milk products on the opposite ends of the stores because people often need both
types of products. To buy both, they have to walk around an entire store, which of course, is
loaded with other items they might see and purchase.

    Think about the last time you went into a grocery store or drug store; you might not have
noticed anything until you were well inside the store, which means that the merchandise and
signs that were displayed in the area before you got your bearings were virtually invisible to you
(Underhill, 1999). Based on consumer research, there's a high likelihood that you turned right
when you entered the store. Take note the next time you go shopping; chances are, you'll turn
right after you walk in (Underhill, 1999).

    According to Paco Underhill, famous marketer, CEO and founder of EnviroSell, and author
of the book, Why We Buy: The Science of Shopping, consumers don't actually begin shopping
until a certain point after they enter the store. That's why smart retailers include a "transition
zone" at the entry to their store; it allows customers to get their bearings and choose their
shopping paths. In other words, products, signs, and displays that are in the very front of the
store might not be seen if there is not a transition for the customers when they enter. In the case
of Abercrombie & Fitch, the transition is the space just inside the entrance that includes the

                                                                                SITUATIONAL FACTORS AND INFLUENCES | 105
humongous photo of an Abercrombie model. When you go into Hollister, it's the outside porch
that serves the same purpose; it's a transition that allows you to get your focus and plot your
course in the store, even if you don't consciously realize it.

    Some retail environments have taken great care to design and support a comfortable and
intuitive shopping experience for their customers: a smooth transition zone at the front of the
store; a basket or bag located in the transition zone so customers can collect and hang on to
their selections easily; wide aisles that allow for multi-directional traffic, but also wheelchairs
and baby strollers; easy access to items that customers want to reach and examine closely in
their hands; and, clean and tidy change rooms that make customers feel comfortable getting
undressed in.

  The Way We Shop

      Come, let's go shopping together. Image you're walking into the mall and heading
      straight towards your favourite clothing store--Nike, Aritzia, Lululemon, Zara, The
      Gap. You enter the store, pause for a few moments to get the lay of the land, then
      pick up a shopping basket on your right (you're a serious shopper and have come to
      buy...spring is just around the corner, after all). You start moving through the right
      hand side of the store first, picking up a few items and adding them to your basket.
      You touch everything that catches your eye: feeling the denim to see if it's soft and
      stretchy; the shirts to see if they're cotton or linen; the dress to see if the fabric falls
      freely or is stiff and rigid. What you don't bother with are the clothes folded on the
      low shelf at the bottom of a table display: they're awkward to get to and you would
      have to bend down and set your basket aside just to pull one out. If you're on the
      petite side, you also don't bother with the items that are displayed up high (the sales
      staff are scarce and already helping other customers so you skip past that area).

         You avoid the narrow aisles because getting past someone standing and looking
      through some shirts will bring you into close contact with them--no thanks! A few
      minutes later someone brushes past your backside just as you are reaching for some
      shorts and you come close to leaving the store!

         Now you're making your way to the back of the store: the change rooms are here.
      You take a look to see how clean and/or crowded they are. Long line up? Forget it. No
      mirror in the room? Not a chance! You look to see if there's a chair or stool and some
      hooks to hang up your coat and bags. You will also decide on whether or not a
      different size is worth asking for if the staff are friendly and promise to make
      themselves available to you. After you try your items on, the cash can be found in the
      middle of the store. Purchase made, you exit the store and head to find some shoes
      to match your new spring clothes.

106 | SITUATIONAL FACTORS AND INFLUENCES
Research shows that customers shop in different types of stores with varying expectations for
their shopping experiences. Based on empirical findings, Yoon (2013) reported that department
store shoppers preferred affective experiences the most, whereas discount store and online
shoppers preferred rational experiences. The author reasoned that department stores tend to
draw customers with lifestyle products and pleasant store atmospherics, therefore, customers
expect to derive a hedonic shopping experience, which involves pure enjoyment, excitement,
captivation, escapism, and spontaneity beyond the purchase of product itself (Babin, Darden, &
Griffin, 1994).

    In contrast, customers shopping in discount stores and online usually are mostly value
seekers who focus on price or functionality of products. Therefore, they expect utilitarian value
when they shop. The customers may evaluate their shopping experience exclusively on the
tangible attributes of goods and services acquired from their shopping trips (Holbrook, 1986),
as well as on whether a purchase is made in a deliberate and efficient manner (Babin, Darden,
& Griffin, 1994).

    Store designs should aim to satisfy the types of shopping experience customers are looking
for. Permanent stores, department stores, specialty stores and boutiques should strive to
reflect more on customers' need for sensory and experiential shopping attributes, while
discount stores, dollar stores, hypermarkets, outlet stores, warehouse stores and thrift stores
need to highlight the value proposition that customers are seeking.

Time

The time of day, time of year, and how much time consumers feel like they have to shop affect
what they buy. Researchers have even discovered whether someone is a "morning person" or
"evening person" affects shopping patterns. Have you ever gone to the grocery store when you
are hungry or after pay day when you have cash in your pocket? When you are hungry or have
cash, you may purchase more than you would at other times.

    Seven-Eleven Japan is a company that's extremely in tune to time and how it affects buyers.
The company's point-of-sale systems at its checkout counters monitor what is selling well
and when, and stores are restocked with those items immediately--sometimes via motorcycle
deliveries that zip in and out of traffic along Japan's crowded streets. The goal is to get the
products on the shelves when and where consumers want them. Seven-Eleven Japan also
knows that, like Americans, its customers are "time starved." Shoppers can pay their utility bills,
local taxes, and insurance or pension premiums at Seven-Eleven Japan stores, and even make
photocopies (Bird, 2002).

    Companies worldwide are aware of people's lack of time and are finding ways to
accommodate them. Some doctors' offices offer drive-through shots for patients who are in a
hurry and for elderly patients who find it difficult to get out of their cars. Tickets.com allows
companies to sell tickets by sending them to customers' mobile phones when they call in. The
phones' displays are then read by barcode scanners when the ticket purchasers arrive at the
events they're attending. Likewise, if you need customer service from Amazon.com, there's no

                                                                                SITUATIONAL FACTORS AND INFLUENCES | 107
need to wait on the telephone. If you have an account with Amazon, you just click a button on
the company's Web site and an Amazon representative calls you immediately.

Mood

Have you ever felt like going on a shopping spree? At other times wild horses couldn't drag
you to a mall. People's moods temporarily affect their spending patterns. Some people enjoy
shopping. It's entertaining for them. At the extreme are compulsive spenders who get a
temporary "high" from spending.

    A sour mood can spoil a consumer's desire to shop. The crash of the U.S. stock market in
2008 left many people feeling poorer, leading to a dramatic downturn in consumer spending.
Penny pinching came into vogue, and conspicuous spending was out. Costco and Walmart
experienced heightened sales of their low-cost Kirkland Signature and Great Value brands as
consumers scrimped. Saks Fifth Avenue wasn't so lucky. Its annual release of spring fashions
usually leads to a feeding frenzy among shoppers, but spring 2009 was different. "We've
definitely seen a drop-off of this idea of shopping for entertainment," says Kimberly Grabel,
Saks Fifth Avenue's senior vice president of marketing (Rosenbloom, 2009). To get buyers in
the shopping mood, companies resorted to different measures. The upscale retailer Neiman
Marcus began introducing more mid-priced brands. By studying customer's loyalty cards, the
French hypermarket Carrefour hoped to find ways to get its customers to purchase nonfood
items that have higher profit margins.

    The glum mood wasn't bad for all businesses though. Discounters like Half-Priced books
saw their sales surge. So did seed sellers as people began planting their own gardens. Finally,
what about those products (Aqua Globes, Snuggies, and Ped Eggs) you see being hawked on
television? Their sales were the best ever. Apparently, consumers too broke to go on vacation or
shop at Saks were instead watching television and treating themselves to the products (Ward,
2009).

  Consumption Choices During a Pandemic

      What stories will future marketers tell of what it was like to be a consumer during the
      Coronavirus pandemic? How will they make sense of the fierce run on hand sanitizer
      and toilet paper in the early months of 2020? Will they tell stories about consumers
      hoarding food (despite grocery stores remaining open and never closing) and
      emptying the store shelves, leaving nothing but the odd odd can of green beans?
      What stories will we all tell in the future about our mood and mental state going into
      grocery stores only to find random food items available, scratching our heads at how
      we were going to turn them into meals for a week?

         Since May 2020, I've asked my students to reflect on what it is like to be a

108 | SITUATIONAL FACTORS AND INFLUENCES
consumer during a pandemic. They have shared their personal experiences with me
which I've found both comforting and fascinating.

   Most of us have agreed that when the pandemic started, luxury purchases went
out the window! The focus of our purchases have been on meeting our needs and
ensuring our safety: masks, soap, and technology for remote working and learning
were the principle types of purchases. Many also purchased items to take place of
not going to the gym: weights, new runners, and other exercise equipment. Some
purchases shifted; for example, the money my husband and I would normally spend
on clothes to wear to the office (him) and the university (me) was now spent on
"comfy" clothes like sweatshirts and jogging pants. We've saved money on dry-
cleaning, but spent more on heating our home over the winter since we're both
working remotely.

   We all had the same desire to make more purchases from home than to go to a
store: most of us were buying items online that we'd never considered before, such
as clothes, groceries, and household goods. Many of us found that online shopping
not only kept us safe from exposure, but also helped make us feel less anxious: we
could find what we needed and purchase it easier without having to go through the
stress of lining up and possibly coming in contact with another infected person.

   Perhaps one of the bigger challenges we've experienced as consumers is our
inability to use our senses to help guide our consumer decision making: many
students agreed that they missed being able to touch, smell, and see a product up
close and in person and that buying online often felt like a "leap of faith". Paco
Underhill studies consumer behaviour and helps retailers design more efficient,
respectful, and comfortable shopping environments for their consumers: Underhill
states that, "virtually all unplanned purchases--and many planned ones too--come
as a result of the shopper seeing, touching, selling, or tasting something that
promises pleasure, if not total fulfillment" (1999). If the pandemic has reduced, and
in some cases eliminated, our ability to use our senses, does this help explain why
we are feeling so much less fulfilled these days?

   Without a doubt, the extreme changes in lifestyle brought on by the pandemic has
forced all of us to consumer less frequently, more carefully, and in the absence of the
environmental and situational factors that normally have an enormous influence over
what we buy: we've had to reorient our consumption choices so they are more
aligned with our needs and less with our wants. We've opted for availability over
brand preference, not to be practical, but because we haven't had a choice in the
matter! We have also prioritized our health--both physical and mental--which is a
good thing for consumers now and forever.

                                                                         SITUATIONAL FACTORS AND INFLUENCES | 109

             respond to external events or stimuli.

          Classical conditioning (Pavlovian conditioning): A type of behavioral learning
             theory developed by Ivan Pavlov that explains how our responses (behavior) to
             one situation can inform our response (behavior) to a new situation.

          Cognitive biases: Described as errors in memory or judgement and often an
             inaccurate perception of something.

          Cognitive learning theories: Learning theories that focus on how people learn
             from mental processes and by observing others.

          Encoding: Describes the process of converting our experiences into memories.
          Family branding: A branding structure in which the brand focus is on the

             company name which appears on all the products (services) offered by that
             company. The association between products and corporate entity are strong and
             visible.
          Licensing: A branding strategy that involves the licensing of a brand name (to
             other companies) outside of its own product offering in order to bring more
             exposure to the brand.
          Long-term memory: The "LTM" is a system that enables us to store information
             for a longer period of time.
          Memory decay: The fading of memories over the passage of time.
          Modeling: Related to observational learning (cognitive learning theory), modeling
             involves imitating the behavior of others.

                                                                                                   KEY TERMS AND CONCEPTS | 117

             positive reinforcement involves providing rewards to encourage a particular type
             of behavior. Negative reinforcement involves removing something in order to
             encourage a particular type of behavior or action.

          Product line extensions: A branding and product strategy that occurs when

Behavioral Learning
Theories

Learning refers to the relatively permanent change in knowledge or behavior that is the result
of experience. Although you might think of learning in terms of what you need to do before
an upcoming exam, the knowledge that you take away from your classes, or new skills that
you acquire through practice, these changes represent only one component of learning. In fact,
learning is a broad topic that is used to explain not only how we acquire new knowledge and
behavior but also how we acquire a wide variety of other psychological processes, including the
development of both appropriate and inappropriate social behaviors, and even how a person
may acquire a debilitating psychological disorder such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
(PTSD).

    Learning is perhaps the most important human capacity. Learning allows us to create
effective lives by being able to respond to changes. We learn to avoid touching hot stoves, to
find our way home from school, and to remember which people have helped us in the past
and which people have been unkind. Without the ability to learn from our experiences, our lives
would be remarkably dangerous and inefficient.

    Theories of learning range from those that focus on simple stimulus-response connections
(behavioral theories) to perspectives that regard consumers as solvers of complex problems
who learn abstract rules and concepts as they observe others (cognitive theories). Basic
learning principles are at the heart of many advertising efforts.

  Learning Through Experiences

      Learning refers to the process by which consumers change their behavior after they
      gain information or experience. It's the reason you don't buy a bad product twice.
      Learning doesn't just affect what you buy; it affects how you shop. People with
      limited experience about a product or brand generally seek out more information
      than people who have used a product before.

                                                                                          BEHAVIORAL LEARNING THEORIES | 121
         Companies try to get consumers to learn about their products in different ways.
      Car dealerships offer test drives. Pharmaceutical reps leave samples and brochures
      at doctor's offices. Other companies give consumers free samples. To promote its
      new line of coffees, McDonald's offered customers free samples to try. Have you
      ever eaten the food samples at Costco or in your favorite grocery store? While
      sampling is an expensive strategy, it gets consumers to try the product and many
      customers buy it, especially right after trying in the store.

Behavioral Learning Theories

Behavioral learning theories assume that learning takes place as the result of responses to
external events. For example, if a song we remember fondly from high school gets repeatedly
paired with a brand name, over time our warm memories about the tune will rub off onto the
advertised product. Can you think of any advertisements that feature a favorite song from your
teenage years?

    According to this perspective, the feedback we receive as we go through life shapes our
experiences. Similarly, we respond to brand names, scents, "jingles" (a short song used in
advertisements), and other marketing stimuli because of the learned connections we form over
time. People also learn that actions they take result in rewards and punishments; this feedback
influences the way they will respond in similar situations in the future. Consumers who receive
compliments on a product choice will be more likely to buy that brand again, but those who get
food poisoning at a new restaurant are not likely to return to it in the future.

Classical Conditioning

Although Ivan Pavlov (1849-1936) won a Nobel Prize for studying digestion, he is much more
famous for something else: working with a dog, a bell, and a bowl of food. Many people are
familiar with the classic study of "Pavlov's dog," but rarely do they understand the significance
of its discovery. In his famous experiment, Pavlov rang a bell and then gave a dog some food.
After repeating this pairing multiple times, the dog eventually treated the bell as a signal for
food, and began salivating in anticipation of the treat.

    In fact, Pavlov's work helps explain why some people get anxious just looking at a crowded
bus, why the sound of a morning alarm is so hated, and even why we swear off certain foods
we've only tried once. Classical (or Pavlovian) conditioning is one of the fundamental ways
we learn about the world around us. But it is far more than just a theory of learning; it is also
arguably a theory of identity. For, once you understand classical conditioning, you'll recognize
that your favourite music, clothes, even political candidate, might all be a result of the same
process that makes a dog drool at the sound of bell.

122 | BEHAVIORAL LEARNING THEORIES
Figure 1. Top left: the dog food and dog are featured (dog salivates). Top right: The dog is introduced to
a ringing bell (no response from dog). Bottom left: The ringing bell is paired with the dog's food (dog
salivates). Bottom right: The dog becomes conditioned to salivate whenever it hears the ringing bell.

As illustrated in the image above, the dog food in Pavlov's experiment is called the
unconditioned stimulus (US) because it elicits an unconditioned response (UR). That is, without
any kind of "training" or "teaching," the stimulus produces a natural or instinctual reaction.
In Pavlov's case, the food (US) automatically makes the dog drool (UR). Other examples of
unconditioned stimuli include loud noises (US) that startle us (UR), or a hot shower (US) that
produces pleasure (UR).

    On the other hand, a conditioned stimulus (CS) produces a conditioned response (CR). A
conditioned stimulus is a signal that has no importance to the organism until it is paired with
something that does have importance. For example, in Pavlov's experiment, the bell is the
conditioned stimulus. Before the dog has learned to associate the bell (CS) with the presence
of food (US), hearing the bell means nothing to the dog. However, after multiple pairings of
the bell with the presentation of food, the dog starts to drool at the sound of the bell. This
drooling in response to the bell is the conditioned response (CR). Although it can be confusing,
the conditioned response is almost always the same as the unconditioned response. However,
it is called the conditioned response because it is conditional on (or, depends on) being paired
with the conditioned stimulus (e.g., the bell).

    To help make this clearer, consider becoming really hungry when you see the logo for a fast
food restaurant. There's a good chance you'll start salivating. Although it is the actual eating
of the food (US) that normally produces the salivation (UR), simply seeing the restaurant's logo
(CS) can trigger the same reaction (CR).

    We now believe that this same learning process is engaged, for example, when humans
associate a drug they've taken with the environment (or surroundings) in which they've taken

                                                                                          BEHAVIORAL LEARNING THEORIES | 123
it; when they associate a stimulus (e.g., a symbol for vacation, like a big beach towel) with an
emotional event (like a burst of happiness); or when they associate the smell of a particular
type of fast food with getting food poisoning.

    Although classical conditioning may seem "old" or "too simple" a theory, it is still widely
studied today as a type of associative learning, a form of learning that relies on the repetitive
pairing of stimuli. Swedish car brand, "Volvo" has successfully paired its name with the concept
of "safety" for years, giving consumers the sense that Volvos are among the safest cars on the
road (and ideal for young families).

  Classical Conditioning & the Consumer

      Classical conditioning has long been, and continues to be, an effective tool in
      marketing and advertising (Hawkins, Best, & Coney, 1998). The general idea is to
      create an advertisement that has positive features such that the ad creates
      enjoyment in the person exposed to it. The enjoyable ad serves as the unconditioned
      stimulus (US), and the enjoyment is the unconditioned response (UR). Because the
      product being advertised is mentioned in the ad, it becomes associated with the US,
      and then becomes the conditioned stimulus (CS). In the end, if everything has gone
      well, seeing the product online or in the store will then create a positive response in
      the buyer, leading them to be more likely to purchase the product.

         A similar strategy is used by corporations that sponsor teams or events. For
      instance, if people enjoy watching a university basketball team playing basketball,
      and if that team is sponsored by a product, such as Red Bull, then people may end up
      experiencing positive feelings when they view a can of Red Bull. Of course, the
      sponsor wants to sponsor only good teams and good athletes because these create
      more pleasurable responses.

         Advertisers use a variety of techniques to create positive advertisements, including
      enjoyable music, cute babies, attractive models, and funny spokespeople. In one
      study, Gorn (1982) showed research participants pictures of different writing pens of
      different colors, but paired one of the pens with pleasant music and the other with
      unpleasant music. When given a choice as a free gift, more people chose the pen
      color associated with the pleasant music. And Schemer, Matthes, Wirth, and Textor
      (2008) found that people were more interested in products that had been embedded
      in music videos of artists that they liked and less likely to be interested when the
      products were in videos featuring artists that they did not like.

         Another type of ad that is based on principles of classical conditioning is one that
      associates fear with the use of a product or behavior, such as those that show
      pictures of deadly automobile accidents to encourage seat belt use or images of
      lung cancer surgery on cigarette boxes to discourage smoking. These ads have also

124 | BEHAVIORAL LEARNING THEORIES
      been found to be effective (Das, de Wit, & Stroebe, 2003; Perloff, 2003; Witte & Allen,
      2000), due in large part to conditioning. When we see a cigarette and the fear of
      dying has been associated with it, we are hopefully less likely to light it up.

         Taken together then, there is ample evidence of the utility of classical conditioning,
      using both positive as well as negative stimuli, in advertising. This does not, however,
      mean that we are always influenced by these ads. The likelihood of conditioning
      being successful is greater for products that we do not know much about, where the
      differences between products are relatively minor, and when we do not think too
      carefully about the choices (Schemer et al., 2008).

Stimulus Generalization

Pavlov also experimented with presenting new stimuli that were similar, but not identical, to the
original conditioned stimulus. For instance, if the dog had been conditioned to being scratched
before the food arrived, the stimulus would be changed to being rubbed rather than scratched.
He found that the dogs also salivated upon experiencing the similar stimulus, a process known
as (stimulus) generalization. Stimulus generalization refers to the tendency to respond to
stimuli that resemble the original conditioned stimulus. The ability to generalize has important
evolutionary significance. If we eat some red berries and they make us sick, it would be a good
idea to think twice before we eat some purple berries. Although the berries are not exactly the
same, they nevertheless are similar and may have the same negative properties.

    Lewicki (1985) conducted research that demonstrated the influence of stimulus
generalization and how quickly and easily it can happen. In his experiment, high school students
first had a brief interaction with a female experimenter who had short hair and glasses. The
study was set up so that the students had to ask the experimenter a question, and (according
to random assignment) the experimenter responded either in a negative way or a neutral way
toward the students. Then the students were told to go into a second room in which two
experimenters were present and to approach either one of them. However, the researchers
arranged it so that one of the two experimenters looked a lot like the original experimenter, while
the other one did not (she had longer hair and no glasses). The students were significantly more
likely to avoid the experimenter who looked like the earlier experimenter when that experimenter

                                                                                          BEHAVIORAL LEARNING THEORIES | 125
had been negative to them than when she had treated them more neutrally. The participants
showed stimulus generalization such that the new, similar-looking experimenter created the
same negative response in the participants as had the experimenter in the prior session.

  The Copy Cat Brand Strategy

      The reactions we learn to one object tend to transfer to other, similar objects in a
      process psychologists term stimulus generalization. That explains why a drugstore's
      bottle of private brand mouthwash deliberately packaged to resemble Listerine
      mouthwash may evoke a similar response among consumers, who assume that this
      copy-cat product shares other characteristics of the original. Indeed, consumers in
      one study on shampoo brands tended to rate those with similar packages as similar
      in quality and performance as well.

         Stimulus generalization is the basic idea underlying numerous branding strategies
      that share this approach: (1) Create a brand name that consumers learn to associate
      with positive qualities; (2) paste that brand name on other, reasonably similar
      products; (3) stand back and let the positive associations transfer to the new item.

         This approach explains the success of these branding strategies:

            Family branding. Many products capitalize on the reputation of a company
              name. Companies such as Campbell's, Heinz, and General Electric rely on their
              positive corporate images to sell different product lines.

            Product line extensions. Marketers add related products to an established
              brand. Dole, which we associate with fruit, introduced refrigerated juices and
              juice bars, whereas Sun Maid went from raisins to raisin bread.

            Licensing. Companies often "rent" well-known names. Christian Dior licenses
              the designer's name to products from underwear to umbrellas.

Stimulus Discrimination

The flip side of stimulus generalization is stimulus discrimination -- the tendency to respond
differently to stimuli that are similar but not identical. Pavlov's dogs quickly learned, for
example, to salivate when they heard the specific tone that had preceded food, but not upon
hearing similar tones that had never been associated with food. Discrimination is also useful
-- if we do try the purple berries, and if they do not make us sick, we will be able to make the
distinction in the future. And we can learn that although two people in our class, Courtney and
Sarah, may look a lot alike, they are nevertheless different people with different personalities.

126 | BEHAVIORAL LEARNING THEORIES
Operant (Instrumental) Conditioning

Although classical conditioning is a powerful explanation for how we learn many different
things, there is a second form of conditioning that also helps explain how we learn. First studied
by Edward Thorndike (1874-1949), and later extended by B. F. Skinner (1904-1990), this second
type of conditioning is known as operant (instrumental) conditioning. Operant conditioning
occurs when a behavior (as opposed to a stimulus) is associated with the occurrence of a
significant event. In the best-known example, a rat in a laboratory learns to press a lever in
a cage (called a "Skinner box") to receive food. Because the rat has no "natural" association
between pressing a lever and getting food, the rat has to learn this connection. At first, the rat
may simply explore its cage, climbing on top of things, burrowing under things, in search of
food. Eventually while poking around its cage, the rat accidentally presses the lever, and a food
pellet drops in. This voluntary behavior is called an operant behavior, because it "operates" on
the environment (i.e., it is an action that the animal itself makes)

    Now, once the rat recognizes that it receives a piece of food every time it presses the lever,
the behavior of lever-pressing becomes reinforced. That is, the food pellets serve as reinforcers
because they strengthen the rat's desire to engage with the environment in this particular
manner. In a parallel example, imagine that you're playing a street-racing video game. As you
drive through one city course multiple times, you try a number of different streets to get to the
finish line. On one of these trials, you discover a shortcut that dramatically improves your overall
time. You have learned this new path through operant (instrumental) conditioning. That is, by
engaging with your environment (operant responses), you performed a sequence of behaviors
that that was positively reinforced (i.e., you found the shortest distance to the finish line).
And now that you've learned how to drive this course, you will perform that same sequence of
driving behaviors (just as the rat presses on the lever) to receive your reward of a faster finish.

    Operant conditioning research studies how the effects of a behavior influence the
probability that it will occur again. For example, the effects of the rat's lever-pressing behavior
(i.e., receiving a food pellet) influences the probability that it will keep pressing the lever.
For, according to Thorndike's law of effect, when a behavior has a positive (satisfying) effect
or consequence, it is likely to be repeated in the future. However, when a behavior has a
negative (painful/annoying) consequence, it is less likely to be repeated in the future (negative
reinforcement). Effects that increase behaviors are referred to as reinforcers, and effects that
decrease them are referred to as punishers.

    An everyday example that helps to illustrate operant conditioning is striving for a good
grade in class--which could be considered a reward for students (i.e., it produces a positive
emotional response). In order to get that reward (similar to the rat learning to press the lever),
the student needs to modify their behavior. For example, the student may learn that speaking
up in class gets them participation points (a reinforcer), so the student speaks up repeatedly.
However, the student also learns that they shouldn't speak up about just anything; talking
about topics unrelated to school actually punishes the students in their costs points (a form

                                                                                          BEHAVIORAL LEARNING THEORIES | 127
of punishment). Therefore, through the student's freely chosen behaviors, they learn which
behaviors are reinforced and which are punished.

    Understanding classical and operant conditioning provides psychologists with many tools
for understanding learning and behavior in the world outside the lab. This is in part because the
two types of learning occur continuously throughout our lives. It has been said that "much like
the laws of gravity, the laws of learning are always in effect" (Spreat & Spreat, 1982).

  Creating Loyal Customers Through Instrumental Conditioning

      Marketers have developed a number of sales and marketing techniques based on the
      principles of instrumental conditioning and specifically positive reinforcement. Each
      of these commonly known tactics encourages consumers to be loyal, frequent, and
      high-spending shoppers:

            Discounts
            Rebates
            Rewards Programs
            Frequency Marketing Programs
            Gifts & Giveaways
         What about marketing techniques designed to avoid negative consequences? Well,
      most notably would be furniture companies and auto dealerships who launch
      "inventory blow-out" advertising campaigns encouraging shoppers to "avoid taxes"
      and other perceived penalties if they buy within a specific time period.

130 | BEHAVIORAL LEARNING THEORIES
Cognitive Learning
Theories

In contrast to behavioral theories of learning, cognitive learning theory approaches stress the
importance of internal mental processes. This perspective views people as problem solvers
who actively use information from the world around them to master their environments.
Supporters of this view also stress the role of creativity and insight during the learning process.
One important aspect of a cognitive learning perspective is observational learning; this occurs
when people change their own attitudes or behaviors simply by watching the actions of
others--learning occurs as a result of vicarious rather than direct experience. This type of
learning is a complex process; people store these observations in memory as they accumulate
knowledge, perhaps using this information at a later point to guide their own behavior. Modeling
is the process of imitating the behavior of others. You should have no trouble thinking of
advertisements you've seen that encourage you to model an actor's behaviors at a later point in
time.

                             Children learn about the world around them by observing the
                             behaviors of others. Over time they may eventually model
                             these behaviors which inform their preferences, attitudes,
                             and ultimately their decision making as consumers.

                                                                                             COGNITIVE LEARNING THEORIES | 131
Observational Learning

Not all forms of learning are accounted for entirely by classical and operant conditioning.
Imagine a child walking up to a group of children playing a game on the playground. The game
looks fun, but it is new and unfamiliar. Rather than joining the game immediately, the child opts
to sit back and watch the other children play a round or two. Observing the others, the child
takes note of the ways in which they behave while playing the game. By watching the behavior
of the other kids, the child can figure out the rules of the game and even some strategies for
doing well at the game.

    This is called observational learning. This form of learning requires the observation of
other people's behaviors: it differs from the previously discussed learning theories (associative,
classical, operant) because it doesn't involve reinforcements or repetition. Instead,
observational learning takes on the form of modeling--as in modeling the behavior of others
(who are referred to as "social models") we've observed through media, for example.

    Social models are typically of higher status or authority compared to the observer, examples
of which include parents, teachers, and public health officers. In the example above, the children
who already know how to play the game could be thought of as being authorities--and are
therefore social models--even though they are the same age as the observer. By observing
how the social models behave, an individual is able to learn how to act in a certain situation.
Other examples of observational learning might include a child learning to place their napkin in
their lap by watching their parents at the dinner table, or a customer learning where to find the
washroom after observing where other customers have gone when leaving their tables.

    Bandura theorizes that the observational learning process consists of four parts. The first is
attention--as, quite simply, one must pay attention to what they are observing in order to learn.
The second part is retention: to learn one must be able to retain the behavior they are observing
in memory. The third part of observational learning, initiation, acknowledges that the learner
must be able to execute (or initiate) the learned behavior. Lastly, the observer must possess the
motivation to engage in observational learning.

Modeling

Modeling is the process of imitating the behavior of others. This is a particularly common form
of learning for young consumers, who often observe the behaviour of others (often individuals
who they look up to or admire, such as an online influencer) and imitate their behavior. Naturally,
when speaking of young consumers, the negative effects of this learning model are clear:
smoking, high-risk behavior, violence, self-harm, etc. are behaviors that children are not only
observing in others, but also learning how to copy and perform on their own. The responsibility
of advertisers with regard to their influence and impact on children and young consumers
has brought into question, what should be marketed to kids and what should not? Remember
advertisements for smoking? No? I do--but that's because I grew up at a time when there was
little consideration about the effects (role) models had on children. Often seen in smoking
commercials and billboards, attractive and idealized adults modeled to a young audience the

132 | COGNITIVE LEARNING THEORIES
perceived joy and sophistication that came along with being a smoker. After years of scrutiny,
activism, and eventually legislation, tobacco companies were no longer permitted to advertise
their products to children and young consumers.

  Student Op-Ed: Creating the "Pepsi Generation"

      Throughout Pepsi's history, the cola company has often utilized the modeling theory
      of learning to convey a brand message to consumers. The Cola Conquest is a
      documentary film that follows the creation and growth of cola drinks throughout the
      United States, and eventually around the world. Coca-Cola's main competitor, Pepsi,
      has been the only alternative with a shared history in what marketing historians call,
      the "Cola Wars," proving that the cola brand has always been a worthy competitor to
      the sugary drink conglomerate (Angelico, 1998).

         Since it's conception, Coke's marketing has represented quintessential American
      symbols and values of freedom and family, while often drawing on nostalgia and
      wholesome traditions to target middle to upper class American consumers of the
      dominant culture. To differentiate itself from Coke, Pepsi took an alternate direction,
      using, pop culture imagery and icons in its marketing to reach youth and street
      culture demographics (Angelico, 1998). The documentary features original Pepsi
      commercials starring Michael Jackson, who'd taken the world by storm with
      innovative creativity and catchy pop songs. Similarly, supermodel Cindy Crawford
      lent her star power to the youthful brand by acting as somewhat of a spokesperson
      (Webb, Angelico, & Neidik, 1998). This type of cognitive learning that we refer to as
      modeling demonstrates how celebrities and pop culture icons directly influence
      young (and youthful) consumers who learned to favour Pepsi over Coke (Dahl, White,
      & Solomon, 2015).

         Modeling can play an important factor in a consumer's decision making process
      since it plays into our desires to imitate the behaviour of others. Modeling as a
      marketing strategy can be particularly effective when the models are individuals (or
      more appropriately, "influencers") who consumers admire. Marketers utilize the
      learning theory of modeling by featuring individuals which consumers aspire to be
      like or imitate into their advertising campaigns (Dahl, White, & Solomon, 2015). When
      Pepsi launched the infamous, "Pepsi Generation" marketing campaign, they used
      celebrities, models, and edgy pop culture icons of the time, to connect the brand with
      consumers who identified as part of youth street culture (Angelico, 1998). Modeling
      proved to be a successful strategy for this campaign because it spoke directly to
      children who are more easily influenced by celebrity star-power as well as their peers
      (Dahl, White, & Solomon, 2015).

         These advertisement campaigns were proven highly successful since

                                                                                             COGNITIVE LEARNING THEORIES | 133
      entertainment and celebrity status was growing drastically in the 1980's (Angelico,
      1998). Michael Jackson was Pepsi's most successful celebrity model, inspiring
      subculture youth in the urban cities of the United States to model the pop icon's
      choice in cola drinks (Angelico, 1998). One individual shared with me that when
      Michael Jackson's first Pepsi commercial premiered, teens rushed home to record it
      and re-watched repeatedly it in admiration. (Angelico, 1998). Pepsi continues to
      apply this marketing strategy as seen in their infamous television commercial
      featuring model and reality star Kendall Jenner. The intention was to leverage
      Jenner's global popularity and influence on the youth market; however, the content
      and messaging of the ad was in poor taste and caused controversy by both
      appropriating and trivializing the Black Lives Matter activist movement that
      campaigns to bring awareness of and an end to systemic racism and violence
      towards black youth. Despite being pulled from the airways, Jenner's endorsement
      and association with Pepsi drew considerable attention towards the brand.

         In response to Coca Cola's capitalization on traditional upper-class American
      culture, I believe that Pepsi appropriately targeted a more specific consumer market
      of urban street culture, by integrating highly admired pop culture icons. As Coca-Cola
      has successfully captured the attention of mainstream consumers, Pepsi
      successfully adapted its brand by claiming a brand position closely reflective of
      street and pop culture, thereby becoming know as the "Pepsi Generation". Its
      positioning strategy established both a title adopted by youth and a much needed
      image for the brand which youth desired to be a part of.

Memory and Retrieval

The most exciting advertisement is worthless if it doesn't make a reasonably lasting impact on
the receiver. So, advertisers need to understand how our brains encode, or mentally program,
the information we encounter that helps to determine how we will remember it (if we do at
all). In general, we have a better chance of retaining incoming data we associate with other
information already in memory.

Types of Memory

Psychologists distinguish among three distinct types of memory systems, each of which plays
a role in processing brand-related information:

 1. Sensory Memory permits storage of the information we receive from our senses. This
      storage is very temporary; it lasts a couple of seconds at most. For example, when
      walking to work you pass by a French bistro cafe and you get a quick, aromatic whiff of
      espresso and fresh croissants. Although this sensation lasts only a few seconds, it is
      sufficient to allow you to consider whether you should investigate further. If you retain this
      information for further processing, it passes into short-term memory.

 2. Short-Term Memory ("STM") also stores information for a limited period of time, and it
      has limited capacity. This is similar to working memory in a computer; it holds the
      information we are currently processing. Our memories can store verbal input acoustically
      (in terms of how it sounds) or semantically (in terms of what it means). We store it when
      we combine small pieces of data into larger chunks. A chunk is a configuration that is
      familiar to the person and that they can think about as a unit. For example, a brand name
      like Beats by Dre can be a chunk that summarizes a great deal of detailed information
      about the product.

 3. Long-Term Memory ("LTM") is the system that allows us to retain information for a long
      period of time. Information passes from STM into LTM via the process of elaborative
      rehearsal. This means we actively think about the chunk's meaning and relate it to other
      information already in memory. Advertisers sometimes assist in the process when they
      devise catchy slogans or jingles that consumers repeat on their own and retain in their

                                                                                                      MEMORY AND RETRIEVAL | 137
      LTM. In her article, "26 Companies With Really Catchy Slogans & Brand Taglines," Lindsay
      Kolowich Cox explains that a great slogan is memorable, includes a key benefit,
      differentiates the brand, and imparts positive feelings about the brand (Cox, n.d.).

global brands and their slogans below in this interactive piece of content.

          Skittles: "Taste the rainbow"
          Red Bull: "Red Bull gives you wings"
          Ikea: "Swedish for common sense"

Encoding

Encoding is the process by which we place the things that we experience into memory. Unless
information is encoded, it cannot be remembered. I'm sure you've been to a party where you've
been introduced to someone and then -- maybe only seconds later -- you realize that you do not
remember the person's name. Of course it's not really surprising that you can't remember the
name, because you probably were distracted and you never encoded the name to begin with.
At a very basic level, memory encoding is like hitting "Save" on a computer file. Once a file is
saved, it can be retrieved as long as the hard drive is undamaged.

Retrieval

Even when information has been adequately encoded and stored ("saved"), it does not do us
any good if we cannot retrieve it. Retrieval refers to the process of reactivating information that
has been stored in memory. We are more likely to be able to retrieve items from memory when
conditions at retrieval are similar to the conditions under which we encoded them. Context-
dependent learning refers to an increase in retrieval when the external situation in which
information is learned matches the situation in which it is remembered. (Fun fact: my colleague

138 | MEMORY AND RETRIEVAL
swears that playing the same music while studying something learned in class will help with
retention!)

Storing Memories

It's important to understand how we store all of the massive amounts of information we retain
in our minds. Just like a really disorganized "filing cabinet from hell," our memories about
brands (not to mention everything else we know) are useless if we don't know where to find
them. Advertisers can structure their communication to make it more likely that subsequent
messages will call up the knowledge of a brand we've already retained.

    Memories that are stored in long-term memory (LTM) are not actually isolated from one
another; they are linked together into (i.e., associative network) -- patterns of knowledge in
LTM that help us organize information (i.e., Human Associative Model, Anderson, 1983 ). In
each network, there are memory units (e.g., events, items, brands, persons, attributes) linked by
their associations. The more density linked units form categories. Forming links in associative
networks, and using links, categories, and networks to guide behavior, is a fundamental part of
human nature. Mental categories of linked memory units are sometimes referred to as schema
or schemata (plural). We have schema about objects (that a triangle has three sides and may
take on different angles), about people (that Sam is friendly, likes to golf, and always wears
sandals), about events (the particular steps involved in ordering a meal at a restaurant), and
about social groups (we call these group schema stereotypes). Schemata are important in part
because they help us remember new information by providing an organizational structure for it.

  Duck-Rabbit

      Remember we looked at the duck-rabbit picture in topic 4 when we discussed
      interpretation? Now you can explain that we have a schema (a subset of associative
      networks) of ducks and a schema of bunnies that helped us interpret the picture as
      duck/bunny! The picture happens to deliver stimuli that assemble features we stored
      in duck/bunny schema.

                                                                                                      MEMORY AND RETRIEVAL | 139
  Schema & Consumers

      Ferris (2004) states that, "[s]chemas develop when exposure to a knowledge
      structure is repeated and consistent," which is generally what advertisements are,
      communications we are exposed to both consistently and repeatedly. Goodstein
      (1993) argues that while several different types of ad schema likely exist, consumers
      will often create schemata that are structured around product classes (e.g., alcohol,
      cars, insurance, and toys).

         Schema-based methods are used broadly in academic research as well as in the
      industry to explore consumers' perceptions and understanding of an object. It is
      used in advertising, brand building, and design! Schemata, help consumers
      generalize information and help them organize, store, and act on information in a
      short period of time.

     Ad Schema

         Since the advertising landscape is a noisy and cluttered one, most consumers are
      not interested in paying attention to every single marketing message or
      advertisement they come in contact with (Ferris, 2004). Advertising schema,
      therefore, allow consumers to sort and filter through the messages more efficiently:
      these structures and patterns of knowledge provide short-cuts in evaluating an ad we
      see on TV, online, or in a magazine within seconds. Ad schema explains why we
      "skip" some commercials and focus on others.

         Most product and service categories advertise in similar ways (I'm looking at
      you, realtors) which means their advertisements are shown "frequently and employ
      similar semantic, physical, and structural features" (Stoltman, 1991) enabling
      consumers to activate their schema (they know if they're going to want to see the ad
      or not based on its similarity to other brands' ads).

     Brand Schema

         Consumers construct their understanding of brands in different categories, such
      as brand associations (e.g., spokespersons), brand image, and brand personality
      (Halkias, 2015). The brand schema is a cognitive structure that consists of all the
      associations consumers attach to a brand (Halkias and Kokkinaki, 2014 ). Therefore,
      brand schema carry various functional and symbolic attributes of the brand, such as
      price specification (package, color scheme, price range), benefits (e.g., great quality,
      sustainability), symbolic meanings (e.g., carrying a certain brand image) (Halkias,
      2015). Try to think about Nike as an example for a moment. You would have your
      own schema about Nike's color, logo, price range, benefit, its past spokespersons, its
      tagline, how it would portrait you when you wear one of their products, etc.

140 | MEMORY AND RETRIEVAL
Accessing Memories

Not surprisingly, recall is enhanced when we pay more attention to the message in the first
place. Some evidence indicates that we can retrieve information about a pioneering brand
(the first brand to enter a market) more easily from memory than we can for follower brands,
because the first product's introduction is likely to be distinctive and, for the time being, has no
competitors to divert our attention (Kardes, Kalyanaram, Chandrashekaran & Dornoff, 1992). In
addition, we are more likely to recall descriptive brand names than those that do not provide
adequate cues as to what the product is (Zaichkowsky & Vipat, 1992).

    Of course, the nature of the ad itself also plays a big role in determining whether we'll
remember it. We're far more likely to remember spectacular magazine ads, including multi-
page spreads, three-dimensional pop-ups, scented ads, and ads with audio components (Sass,
2007).

    Here are some other factors advertisers need to remember:

   State-dependent retrieval: We are better able to access information if our internal state
      (for example, our mood at the time) is the same at the time of recall as when we learned
      the information. If, for example, we recreate the cues that were present when the
      information was first presented, we can enhance recall. That's why Life cereal uses a
      picture of "Mikey" from its commercial on the cereal box, which facilitates recall of brand
      claims and favorable brand evaluations (Keller, 1987).

   Familiarity: Familiarity enhances recall. Indeed, this is one of the basic goals of marketers
      who try to create and maintain awareness of their products. However, this sword can cut
      both ways: Extreme familiarity can result in inferior learning and recall. When consumers
      are highly familiar with a brand or an advertisement, they may pay less attention to the
      message because they do not believe that any additional effort will yield a gain in
      knowledge (Johnson & Russo, 1981; Lynch & Srull, 1982).

   Salience: The salience of a brand refers to its prominence or level of activation in
      memory. As we have already noted, stimuli that stand out in contrast to their
      environments are more likely to command attention which, in turn, increases the
      likelihood that we will recall them. This explains why unusual advertising (think Red Bull)
      or distinctive packaging (Tiffany's) tends to facilitate brand recall (Alba & Chattopadhyay,
      1986; Hirschman & Solomon, 1984).

   Novelty: Introducing a surprise element in an ad can be particularly effective in aiding
      recall, even if it is not relevant to the factual information the ad presents (Heckler &
      Childers, 1992). In addition, mystery ads, in which the ad doesn't identify the brand until
      the end, are more effective at building associations in memory between the product
      category and that brand--especially in the case of relatively unknown brands (Fazio, Herr,
      & Powell, 1992).

   Pictorial versus verbal cues: Is a picture worth a thousand words? Indeed, we are more

                                                                                                      MEMORY AND RETRIEVAL | 141
      likely to recognize information presented in picture form at a later time (Childers &
      Houston, 1984; Childers, Heckler, & Houston, 1986). Certainly, visual aspects of an ad are
      more likely to grab a consumer's attention. In fact, eye-movement studies indicate that
      about 90 per cent of viewers look at the dominant picture in an ad before they bother to
      view the copy (Krober-Riel, 1984). But, while ads with vivid images may enhance recall,
      they do not necessarily improve comprehension. One study found that television news
      items presented with illustrations (still pictures) as a backdrop result in improved recall
      for details of the news story, even though understanding of the story's content did not
      improve (Brosius, 1989).

  Creating Memories Through Story, Symbolism, & Semantics

      The encoding process is influenced by the type of meaning we experience from a
      stimulus. Sometimes we process a stimulus simply in terms of its sensory meaning,
      such as the literal color or shape of a package. We may experience a feeling of
      familiarity when, for example, we see an ad for a new snack food we have recently
      tasted. In many cases, though, we encode meanings at a more abstract level.
      Semantic meaning refers to symbolic associations, such as the idea that minimalists
      avoid plastic bags or that athletes drink Gatorade.

         Advertisers often communicate these kinds of meanings through a narrative, or
      story. For example, in 2006 New York-based creative agency SS+K developed
      television spots for the New York Knicks basketball team that featured some of the
      biggest Knicks fans, including film director Spike Lee, talking about the current state
      of the team, as well as lifelong Knicks fans who share fond memories of past glories.
      Starting in 2014, Procter & Gamble began airing commercials entitled, "Thank you
      mom"--an ad campaign featuring a heartfelt narrative about mom's supporting their
      future Olympians starting at a young age.

         Much of the social information we acquire gets represented in memory in story
      form, so constructing ads in the form of a narrative can be a very effective technique
      to connect with consumers. Narratives persuade people to construct mental
      representations of the information they view. Pictures aid in this construction and
      allow for a more developed and detailed mental representation (Escalas, 2004;
      Adaval & Wyer, 1998)

         Semantic advertising, on the other hand, applies semantic analysis techniques to
      web pages. The process is meant to accurately interpret and classify the meaning
      and/or main subject of the page and then populate it with targeted advertising spots.
      By closely linking content to advertising, it is assumed that the viewer will be more

      likely to show an interest (i.e., through engagement) in the advertised product or
      service.

                          Previous to the Coronavirus, public mask-wearing in most
                          western cultures was rarely ever seen. Since the pandemic,
                          mask-wearing is mandatory in most public spaces around the
                          world. From fashion statement to political statement, masks have
                          many layers of meaning for different people.

         Finally, perhaps there is no better symbol that represents the times, struggles, and
      stories of what living through the Coronavirus pandemic has been like, than the face
      mask. From journalists to cultural psychologists, many have published articles on
      how the symbol of the mask has evolved to carry different layers of meaning. In most
      western cultures, mask wearing in public was rare, to say the least. Since the
      pandemic, mask-wearing has proven to be life saving, prompting even the biggest
      critic to reevaluate the science and shift from prioritizing one's own health to the
      health of the collective. And while some people still see the mask as an invasive
      detractor of their personal rights and freedoms, many others have adopted it as a
      symbol of respect, care, and a new reality.

Nostalgia

Perhaps one of the best ways marketers connect with consumers is through the use of
nostalgia. Merriam-Webster (n.d.) defines nostalgia as, "a wistful or excessively sentimental
yearning for return to or of some past period or irrecoverable condition." For some, nostalgia
conjures up both happy and sad emotions and takes us back to a time that often felt simpler
and less complicated.

    In 2013, Microsoft released a television ad called, "Child of the 90's" that struck an emotional
chord with many members of Generation Y. The ad featured Pogs, Trolls, Hungry-Hungry
Hippos, Tamagotchis, bowl-style haircuts, and the Oregon Trail PC game. (I used to play this

                                                                                                      MEMORY AND RETRIEVAL | 143
ad in my class and always enjoyed the giggles, long sighs, and quiet, smiling head nods of
my students.) Unsurprisingly, nostalgia has great appeal to consumers in revitalizing distant
memories and warm sentiments of the past: taking Polaroid pictures; making mixed tapes for
a friend; and checking pay phones for forgotten quarters (note: the author is aware that she is
dating herself, rather severely, with these references).

  Student Op-Ed: The Art of Bittersweet Advertising

      What began as a brain tonic in a small pharmaceutical shop, has now become a
      multinational soda company widely regarded as the most recognizable brand in the
      world. Coca-Cola, now approaching its 128th year of business, has seen a lot of
      change over the years, most notably during "The Cola Wars" (Angelico, The Cola
      Conquest Episode 01--The Big Sell, 1998). Coca-Cola's ability to successfully use
      nostalgia and salience tactics, help them differentiate themselves from other cola
      brands (Solomon, White, & Dahl, 2015). Salience refers to the level of activation or
      prominence something may have in memory, whereas "the term Nostalgia is
      described as a bittersweet emotion in which the past is viewed with both sadness
      and longing" (Solomon, White, & Dahl, 2015). This presents an opportunity for
      companies to draw on those feelings to stand out.

         For many years, Coca-Cola was instructed to avoid directly targeting children with
      their advertisement. No product wants to be perceived as the root cause of health
      issues in the younger generation. In 1984 when Pepsi aired their hit commercial, with
      a cast full of very youthful looking children featuring Michael Jackson, they showed
      little regard for what Coca-Cola had been trying to avoid all this time. Coke had
      already taken a big hit before the advertisement, and then had to quickly figure out a
      way to bounce back. "Coca-Cola's response was a middle-aged version of its most
      successful advertisement ever, `Hilltop, I'd like to buy the world a Coke (1971)'. It may
      not have been as cool as Michael Jackson but, it sold" (Angelico, 1998). By using a
      memory marker, such as the 1971 advertisement, Coke understood that the ad would
      appeal to consumers because of the emotional effects associated with nostalgia
      (Solomon, White, & Dahl, 2015). Consumers who grew up on Coke were eager to
      relive all those feelings alongside their own families (Angelico, 1998) (Solomon,
      White, & Dahl, 2015).

         After hastily changing the Coca-Cola formula and receiving immense backlash,
      they released "Coke Classic" using the original formula only three months later
      (Angelico, The Cola Conquest Episode 02--Cola War And Peace, 1998). Although the
      original Coke formula was only gone for a few months, the return triggered an effect
      similar to that of a retro band. There happens to be a large niche of consumers who
      prefer nostalgic brands and according to research, that feeling is boiled down to the

144 | MEMORY AND RETRIEVAL
 need for "belongingness" (Solomon, White, & Dahl, 2015). The return of the formula
 brought all of Coca-Cola's history with it creating a path for new consumers to follow.
 Working hand in hand with nostalgia is salience (Solomon, White, & Dahl, 2015).
 Coca- Cola happens to have a very high salience due to its distinctive red packaging
 that has remained the same over the years. This is known as the Von Restorff effect.
 Because the packaging endured for over 128 years, this prompts consumers not only
 in brand recall, but it also creates a sense of nostalgia with regards to anything they
 may have done with Coca-Cola in their lives. A prominent colour such as red, their
 brand image, causes consumers' visual memory to think of Coca-Cola throughout the
 day (Solomon, White, & Dahl, 2015).

    I believe that Coca-Cola has utilized nostalgia and salience in a way that no other
 brand has ever been able to do. It is the most efficient and powerful method to
 attract consumers, old or new. Solomon, White and Dahl explained that an indirect
 effect of memory markers is that retro happened to be very cool with younger
 audiences who were going through self-identification periods and were looking to
 differentiate themselves from others (Solomon, White, & Dahl, 2015). All it took was a
 little competition for Coca-Cola to demonstrate the power of memories in the world
 of advertisement. With the help of memory markers, retro band, and the Von Restorff
 effect, salience and nostalgia tactics truly did help Coke stand-alone from the
 competition (Solomon, White, & Dahl, 2015).

Memory Failure and
Cognitive Biases

As we have seen, our memories are not perfect. They fail in part due to our inadequate encoding
and storage, and in part due to our inability to accurately retrieve stored information. But
memory is also influenced by the setting in which it occurs, by the events that occur to us after
we have experienced an event, and by the cognitive processes that we use to help us remember.
Although our cognition allows us to attend to, rehearse, and organize information, cognition
may also lead to distortions and errors in our judgments and our behaviors.

Memory Decay

Why do we forget? Some memories simply fade with the passage of time; they decay as the
structural changes learning produces in the brain simply go away. But most forgetting is due
to interference; as we learn additional information, it displaces the earlier information. Because
we store pieces of information in associative networks, we are more likely to retrieve a meaning
concept when it's connected by a larger number of links. As we integrate new concepts, a
stimulus is no longer as effective to retrieve the old response. These interference effects help
to explain why we have trouble remembering brand information. Since we tend to organize
attribute information by brand, when we learn additional attribute information about the brand
or about similar brands, this limits our ability to activate the older information (Meyers-Levy,
1989).

                                                                               MEMORY FAILURE AND COGNITIVE BIASES | 149
  The Cost of Failing to be Memorable

      Marketers obviously hope that consumers will not forget about their products.
      However, in a poll of more than 13,000 adults, more than half were unable to
      remember any specific ad they had seen, heard, or read in the past thirty days (Burke
      & Srull, 1988).

         How many can you remember right now? Quick, make a list! Clearly, forgetting by
      consumers is a big headache for marketers.

Cognitive Bias

Cognitive biases are errors in memory or judgment that are caused by the inappropriate use of
cognitive processes. The study of cognitive biases is important both because it relates to the
important psychological theme of accuracy versus inaccuracy in perception, and because being
aware of the types of errors that we may make can help us avoid them and therefore improve
our decision-making skills.

  Identifying Cognitive Biases

      Our perceptions about value and loss are formed by our experiences, culture,
      upbringing, and messages received through mass media. These are innate biases we
      learn over time, mostly unconsciously. These unconscious decisions distort our
      judgment and can lead to stereotyping and bad decision making.

         There are numerous cognitive biases that impact our decisions: here are 10 to
      watch out for:

            Anchoring Bias - Over-relying on the first piece of information obtained and
              using this as a baseline for comparisons.

            Availability Bias - Making decisions based on immediate information or
              examples that come to mind.

            Bandwagon Effect - Making a decision if there are others that also hold that
              belief or opinion. People tend to divide themselves into groups, and then
              attribute positive attributes to their own group. (Similar to "group think" and
              "herd mentality".)

            Choice-Supportive Bias - Once a decision is made, focusing on the benefits
              and ignoring or minimizing flaws.

            Confirmation Bias - Paying more attention to information that reinforces

150 | MEMORY FAILURE AND COGNITIVE BIASES
              previously held beliefs and ignoring evidence to the contrary.
            False-Consensus Effect - Overestimating how much other people agree with

              their own beliefs, behaviors, attitudes, and values. Leads people not only to
              incorrectly think that everyone else agrees with them, but it can also lead to
              overvaluing of opinions.
            Halo Effect - Tendency for an initial impression of a person to influence what
              we think of them overall. Assuming that because someone is good or bad at
              one thing they will be equally good or bad at another.
            Self-Serving Bias - Tendency for people tend to give themselves credit for
              successes but lay the blame for failures on outside causes. This plays a role in
              protecting your self-esteem.
            Hindsight Bias - Tendency to see events, even random ones, as more
              predictable than they are. (Similar to the the "I knew it all along" phenomenon.)
            Misinformation Effect - Tendency for memories to be heavily influenced by
              things that happened after the actual event itself. These memories may be
              incorrect or misremembered.

Perhaps one of the most relatable cognitive biases is the IKEA Effect, which is described
as the disproportionately high value we place on items that we have had a hand in creating
ourselves. This cognitive bias is more commonly expressed as a "a labor of love" showing
our affinity for the blood, sweat, and tears that we put into building a bookshelf; sewing a
quilt; assembly a large-scale LEGO project; or simply preparing a delicious dinner from a meal-
delivery service. Not only do consumers value the end product more (than if they'd purchased
one pre-assembled), they are even willing to pay more to put in the work!

    Specifically, consumers exhibit greater willingness to pay for self-made products than for
identical products that have been produced by someone else, even if the self-crafted product is
of inferior quality (e.g., Franke et al. 2010; Norton et al. 2012). Since effort is considered costly,
preferring self-made products over ready-made products incurs extra costs, which should
intuitively lower the willingness to pay. Remarkably, the higher willingness to pay as
demonstrated by the literature suggests the opposite and points to an overvaluation of the self-
made product. For example, in an experimental study, Norton et al. (2012) asked participants
to assemble a standardized IKEA storage box or hedonistic items such as a Lego car or an
origami model. Regardless of the product type, the participants exhibited greater willingness
to pay compared with the willingness to pay of third-parties and also compared with their own
willingness to pay for identical but pre-assembled products.

                                                                               MEMORY FAILURE AND COGNITIVE BIASES | 151
Source Monitoring

One potential error in memory involves mistakes in differentiating the sources of information.
Source monitoring refers to the ability to accurately identify the source of a memory. Perhaps
you've had the experience of wondering whether you really experienced an event or only
dreamed or imagined it. If so, you wouldn't be alone. Rassin, Merkelbach, and Spaan (2001)
reported that up to 25 per cent of undergraduate students reported being confused about real
versus dreamed events. Studies suggest that people who are fantasy-prone are more likely to
experience source monitoring errors (Winograd, Peluso, & Glover, 1998), and such errors also
occur more often for both children and the elderly than for adolescents and younger adults
(Jacoby & Rhodes, 2006).

The Sleeper Effect

In other cases we may be sure that we remembered the information from real life but be
uncertain about exactly where we heard it. Imagine for a moment that you have just read some
gossip online. Probably you would have discounted the information because you know that its
source is unreliable. But what if later you were to remember the story but forgot the source
of the information? If this happens, you might become convinced that the news story is true
because you forget to discount it. The sleeper effect refers to attitude change that occurs over
time when we forget the source of information (Pratkanis, Greenwald, Leippe, & Baumgardner,
1988).

    In still other cases we may forget where we learned information and mistakenly assume
that we created the memory ourselves. Canadian authors Wayson Choy, Sky Lee, and Paul Yee
launched a $6 million copyright infringement lawsuit against the parent company of Penguin
Group Canada, claiming that the novel Gold Mountain Blues contained "substantial elements" of
certain works by the plaintiffs ("Authors Sue Gold Mountain...," 2011). The suit was filed against
Pearson Canada Inc., author Ling Zhang, and the novel's U.K.-based translator Nicky Harman.
Zhang claimed that the book shared a few general plot similarities with the other works
but that those similarities reflect common events and experiences in the Chinese immigrant
community. She argued that the novel was "the result of years of research and several field trips
to China and Western Canada," and that she had not read the other works. Nothing was proven
in court.

    Finally, the musician George Harrison claimed that he was unaware that the melody of his
song My Sweet Lord was almost identical to an earlier song by another composer. The judge in
the copyright suit that followed ruled that Harrison did not intentionally commit the plagiarism.
(Please use this knowledge to become extra vigilant about source attributions in your written
work, not to try to excuse yourself if you are accused of plagiarism.)

The Sleeper Effect, Cognitive Bias, & MSG

  I can remember back to some time in my youth when there was a public fear of a
  flavour-enhancing ingredient commonly used in Asian cooking. Monosodim
  glutamate (better known as "MSG"), was the target of widespread criticism and
  public outcry because someone somewhere claimed it caused adverse side effects,
  ranging from headaches to numbness. Thinking back now I wonder where I first
  heard this? Who was responsible for this claim and was the source reliable? I was
  young and easily influenced by herd mentality (bandwagon effect) and never
  bothered to ask. I do remember, however, that every Asian restaurant I went to
  marketed themselves as being "MSG-free" even to the extent that they would
  advertise a large image of "MSG" in a circle with a line across it, like a no-smoking
  sign.

     Today I'm intrigued to know how this all happened: how did consumers all over the
  world develop a negative and unfavourable attitude towards MSG, and presumably
  like me, have no idea the source or validity of the panic in the first place?

                             Where it All Started

                                  MSG, a flavour-enriching substance used in
                                  frozen and packaged food items as well as in
                                  freshly cooked meals was falsely blamed to
                                  cause adverse side effects, but suspiciously
                                  only in Asian food and not western food items.

     In 1968, MSG's death knell rang in the form of a letter written to the New England
  Journal of Medicine by Dr. Robert Ho Man Kwok, a Chinese-American doctor from
  Maryland. Kwok (1968) claimed that after eating at Chinese restaurants, he often
  came down with certain unpleasant symptoms, namely "numbness at the back of the
  neck, gradually radiating to both arms and the back" and "general weakness and
  palpitation."(Geiling, 2013)

     After Kwok's letter was published, the New England Journal of Medicine received

                                                                           MEMORY FAILURE AND COGNITIVE BIASES | 153
      many more from readers who claimed to experience similar effects after eating
      Chinese food.

                           Debunking the MSG Myth

         Countless scientific and medical experiments were conducted in the two decades
      following Kwok's 1968 claim--from the FDA to the United Nations--and extensive
      examinations completed by many governments (Australia, Britain, Japan) which
      concluded that MSG was safe to use and consume as a food additive (Geiling, 2013).
      The U.S. Food & Drug Administration ("FDA") states the following on its website
      about MSG:

             FDA considers the addition of MSG to foods to be "generally recognized as safe"
             (GRAS). Although many people identify themselves as sensitive to MSG, in studies
             with such individuals given MSG or a placebo, scientists have not been able to
             consistently trigger reactions ("Questions & Answers"...2018).

         This leads me to wonder, what was really behind all this panic about MSG?

                          Confronting Consumer Bias

         Ian Mosby, a food historian who has researched what became known as the
      "Chinese restaurant syndrome" examined the topic more closely in his research
      publication, "That Won-Ton Soup Headache': The Chinese Restaurant Syndrome,
      MSG and the Making of American Food, 1968-1980". Mosby (2009) argued that the
      Chinese restaurant syndrome was, "at its core, a product of racialized discourse that
      framed much of the scientific, medical and popular discussion surrounding the
      condition." For example, Mosby points out that while Asian restaurants in the western
      world had to advertise loudly "No MSG," junk food and packaged good companies
      selling potato chips and cans of soup didn't (Mosby, 2012). As it turns out, MSG is
      not unique to just Asian cuisine and is used in a host of other packaged and frozen
      products as well as freshly prepared non-Asian dishes.

         Bias and prejudice towards Asian people and cuisine fueled an unnecessary
      marketing movement and the anti-MSG activism in many parts of the world, including
      in Canada were it is often believed that racism has no home. Mosby reminds us of
      why that isn't the case:

             The story of the `discovery' and `spread' of the Chinese restaurant syndrome - and its
             central idea that you were more likely to suffer an adverse reaction to MSG after
             eating Chinese food - therefore provides an instructive example of the ways in which
             ideas about supposedly `foreign' food and food cultures can often bring to the
             surface a range of prejudices and assumptions grounded in ideas about race and

154 | MEMORY FAILURE AND COGNITIVE BIASES
             ethnicity that, even in supposedly pluralistic and multicultural societies like Canada,
             continue to inform perceptions of the culinary `other'.

Schema & Confirmation Bias

Schema helps us remember information by organizing material into coherent representations.
However, although schemata can improve our memories, they may also lead to cognitive
biases. Using schemata may lead us to falsely remember things that never happened to us
and to distort or misremember things that did. For one, schemata lead to confirmation bias,
which is the tendency to verify and confirm our existing memories rather than to challenge and
disconfirm them. The confirmation bias occurs because once we have schemata, they influence
how we seek out and interpret new information. The confirmation bias leads us to remember
information that fits our schemata better than we remember information that disconfirms them
(Stangor & McMillan, 1992), a process that makes our stereotypes very difficult to change. And
we ask questions in ways that confirm our schemata (Trope & Thompson, 1997). If we think that
a person is an extrovert, we might ask her about ways that she likes to have fun, thereby making
it more likely that we will confirm our beliefs. In short, once we begin to believe in something --
for instance, a stereotype about a group of people -- it becomes very difficult to later convince
us that these beliefs are not true; the beliefs become self-confirming.

    Darley & Gross (1983) demonstrated how schemata about social class could influence
memory. In their research they gave participants a picture and some information about a Grade
4 girl named Hannah. To activate a schema about her social class, Hannah was pictured sitting
in front of a nice suburban house for one-half of the participants and pictured in front of an
impoverished house in an urban area for the other half. Then the participants watched a video
that showed Hannah taking an intelligence test. As the test went on, Hannah got some of the
questions right and some of them wrong, but the number of correct and incorrect answers
was the same in both conditions. Then the participants were asked to remember how many
questions Hannah got right and wrong.

    Demonstrating that stereotypes had influenced memory, the participants who thought that
Hannah had come from an upper-class background remembered that she had gotten more
correct answers than those who thought she was from a lower-class background.

                                                                               MEMORY FAILURE AND COGNITIVE BIASES | 155
  Schema & Pro-Environmental Consumers

      How have consumers' existing expectations about brands and retailers shaped their
      decision making? What actions can brands undertake to influence how consumers
      evaluate them? Consider the fashion and apparel industries and today's highly-
      involved and conscientious consumer.

         Many consumers today are becoming increasingly vocal about pro-environmental
      issues, making it imperative for retailers to be transparent about how their products
      are made ("Fashion with a conscience," 2017). Bhaduri (2019) tells us that several
      apparel brands have started to not only undertake "pro-environmental" initiatives, but
      also communicate their effort through marketing communications because research
      shows that consumers often evaluate brands and their communications based on
      their existing expectations (schemata). Research also suggests that brand messages
      that are congruent (aligned) to consumers' schemata will reinforce their existing
      expectations and be evaluated positively. A winning outcome for the brand!

Salience & Cognitive Accessibility

Another potential for bias in memory occurs because we are more likely to attend to, and thus
make use of and remember, some information more than other information. For one, we tend to
attend to and remember things that are highly salient, meaning that they attract our attention.

  Does Salience Fool Us?

      Things that are unique, colourful, bright, moving, and unexpected are more salient
      (McArthur & Post, 1977; Taylor & Fiske, 1978). In one relevant study, Loftus, Loftus,
      and Messo (1987) showed people images of a customer walking up to a bank teller
      and pulling out either a pistol or a chequebook. By tracking eye movements, the
      researchers determined that people were more likely to look at the gun than at the
      chequebook, and that this reduced their ability to accurately identify the criminal in a
      lineup that was given later.

         The salience of the gun drew people's attention away from the face of the criminal.
         In a consumer behaviour context, we see that a consumer's attention is attracted
      to and influenced by the most salient features they are faced with in the moment of
      buying (Bordalo, Gennaioli, & Shleifer, 2013). When deciding between two items--gym
      memberships, for example--the consumer might feel location is the most salient
      feature upon which they make their decision. Imagine if a consumer was considering
      purchasing a gym membership from one of two gyms. Gym A is close enough to the

156 | MEMORY FAILURE AND COGNITIVE BIASES
      consumer's home that they could walk to it. The price, however, is 25% higher than
      Gym B, which is only a 10 minute drive away. Despite the price difference and the
      money that could be saved, our consumer selects the more expensive gym nearby
      because they are more attracted to "location"; in fact, their attraction to this feature is
      in-proportional to price, which means that location has more salience to our (soon to
      be fit) consumer.

The salience of the stimuli in our social worlds has a big influence on our judgment, and in
some cases may lead us to behave in ways that might not benefit us. Imagine, for instance,
that you wanted to buy a new mobile device for yourself. You checked Consumer Reports online
and found that, although most of the leading devices differed on many dimensions, including
price, battery life, weight, camera size, and so forth, one particular device was nevertheless
rated significantly higher by owners than others. As a result, you decide that that is the one you
are going to purchase the next day.

    That night, however, you go to a party, and a friend shows you their brand new mobile device
and after checking it out, you decide it's perfect for your needs. You tell your friend that you
were thinking of buying the other brand and they convince you not to, saying it didn't download
music correctly, the battery died right after the warranty expired, and so forth -- and that they
would never buy one. Would you still plan to buy it, or would you switch your plans?

    If you think about this question logically, the information that you just got from your friend
isn't really all that important. You now know the opinion of one more person, but that can't
change the overall rating of the two devices very much. On the other hand, the information
your friend gives you, and the chance to use their device, are highly salient. The information
is right there in front of you, in your hand, whereas the statistical information from Consumer
Reports is only in the form of a table that you saw on your computer. The outcome in cases such
as this is that people frequently ignore the less salient (more important) information, such as
the likelihood that events occur across a large population (these statistics are known as base
rates), in favor of the less important but nevertheless more salient information.

    People also vary in the schemas that they find important to use when judging others
and when thinking about themselves. Cognitive accessibility refers to the extent to which
knowledge is activated in memory, and thus likely to be used in cognition and behavior. For
instance, you probably know a person who is a golf nut (or fanatic of another sport). All they
can talk about is golf. For them, we would say that golf is a highly accessible construct.
Because they love golf, it is important to their self-concept, they set many of their goals in
terms of the sport, and they tend to think about things and people in terms of it ("if they
play golf, they must be a good person!"). Other people have highly accessible schemata about
environmental issues, eating healthy food, or drinking really good coffee. When schemata are
highly accessible, we are likely to use them to make judgments of ourselves and others, and
this overuse may inappropriately color our judgments.

                                                                               MEMORY FAILURE AND COGNITIVE BIASES | 157

Chapter Reflections

 1. As an example of Classical Conditioning, explore the repeated pairing of Royale toilet
      paper and its imagery of fluffy white kittens. Describe how this learning theory is being
      used and how it may impact a consumer.

 2. Pick a well-known or popular consumer product that has a copy-cat brand (e.g. cereal,
      soft drinks, shampoo, pasta) available next or near it at a store. Take a photo of the
      products and discuss how stimulus generalization supports the strategy behind copy-cat
      branding.

 3. Many well-established health and beauty product lines have grown through product-line
      extensions. Find an example of product-line extension and describe how this relates to
      behavioural learning.

 4. Which brands use celebrity endorsement as a means to "model" behaviour for a youth
      target audience? Share and discuss your example using the concepts from the section on
      cognitive learning.

 5. Using Google and/or YouTube, identify as many celebrities as possible who have acted as
      endorsers for skincare product company ProActive. Who is this company targeting? What
      learning theory underpins the use of celebrity endorsers? Is this effective in your
      opinion--why or why not?

 6. There are many examples of how marketers use modelling as a way to both position and
      teach an audience about a brand. For example, skin care company Proactive has used
      many well-known celebrities as spokespeople to represent their skin care line. Discuss
      why modelling is an effective learning strategy in marketing using examples such as this
      commercial where Justin Bieber endorses Proactive.

 7. Provide examples of brands who have used "nostalgia" as a means to reach an audience
      and provide a longing for the past. Why is nostalgia used and is it an effective marketing
      tool? For inspiration, watch this video from Microsoft and discuss why it may make you
      feel nostalgic.

 8. Watch Dan Ariely's Ted Talk, "Are we in control of our own decisions?" and discuss the
      different ways confirmation biases influence our decision making as consumers.

                                                                                                         CHAPTER REFLECTIONS | 161
 9. Read Peter Yang's article, "How to Use Cognitive Biases For More Effective Marketing"
      and discuss the pro's, con's, and ethics of using confirmation biases as a marketing
      strategy to influence consumer decision making.

Key Terms and Concepts

          Cognitive dissonance (post-purchase dissonance): Also known as "consumer
             remorse" or "consumer guilt," this is an unsettling feeling consumers may
             experience post-purchase if they feel their actions are not aligned with their
             needs.

          Consumer involvement: A consumer's involvement level reflects how personally
             important or interested they are in purchasing/consuming an item.

          Customization: A marketing strategy used to increase involvement and
             engagement levels with consumers, customization involves the personalization
             of products for large groups of homogenous (similar) consumers.

          Drives/Drive theory: Drives represent the "tension" we feel when our body is out
             of balance, for example, due to hunger. Hunger is therefore a "drive state": drives
             represent physiological characteristics, or, things that we feel, and are motivated
             to resolve because they are essential to our survival.

          Expectancy theory: This theory works very differently from Drive theory because
             it explains our motivations when desirable outcomes are achieved through our
             own effort and performance.

          Extrinsic motivation: The tendency to take action and pursue a goal (motivation)
             because the outcome and achievement itself will be beneficial.

          Goals: A goal represents how we would like things to turn out, also known as a
             desired end state.

          Hedonic needs: Needs that are considered luxurious and highly desirable.
          Hemostasis: A term used to describe a natural (and harmonious) state of our

             body's systems. Homeostasis is achieved when a need or goal is satisfied (e.g.
             when we're hungry we eat; when we're tired we sleep).
          High involvement: High involvement decision making typically reflects when a
             consumer who has a high degree of interest and attachment to an item. These

                                                                                                   KEY TERMS AND CONCEPTS | 165
             items may be relatively expensive, pose a high risk to the consumer (can't be
             exchanged or refunded easily or at all), and require some degree of research or
             comparison shopping.

          Impulse buying: A type of purchase that is made with no previous planning or
             thought.

          Intrinsic motivation: The tendency to take action and pursue a goal (motivation)
             because the process itself will be beneficial and fulfilling.

          Limited problem solving: Consumers engage in limited problem solving when
             they have some information about an item, but continue to gather more
             information to inform their purchasing decision. This falls between "low" and
             "high" involvement on the involvement continuum.

          Low involvement: Low involvement decision making typically reflects when a
             consumer who has a low level of interest and attachment to an item. These
             items may be relatively inexpensive, pose low risk (can be exchanged, returned,
             or replaced easily), and not require research or comparison shopping.

          Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs: Abraham Maslow's "Hierarchy of Needs" (1943) is
             a motivational theory that places 5 needs in a hierarchical structure. It begins
             with basic (physiological) needs; safety needs; social needs; ego needs; and
             ends with self-actualization needs. Maslow's theory was based on the belief that
             lower-level needs should be attended to before upper-level needs could be.

          Motivation: The psychological energy, or driving force, that pushes us to pursue
             our goal(s).

          Motivational conflicts: In a marketing context, these different types of conflicts
             exist when consumers are faced with making a choice between purchasing
             decisions that bring on different outcomes -- positive and/or negative. The three
             motivational conflicts are approach-approach; approach-avoidance; and,
             avoidance-avoidance.

          Needs: A basic deficiency (lacking of) an essential item, such as food, water, and
             shelter.

          Personalization (individualization): A marketing strategy used to increase
             involvement and engagement levels with consumers, personalization involves
             tailoring a product (or service) to meet the unique needs & wants of a specific
             consumer.

          Prevention orientation: A self-regulatory orientation we use emphasizes goals as
             things we should be doing as well as things we should be avoiding. This
             orientation focuses on safety, responsibility, and security needs as well as

166 | KEY TERMS AND CONCEPTS
   avoiding problems, dangers, and potential threats.
 Promotion orientation: A self-regulatory orientation we use emphasizes goals as

   things we are hopeful about as well as things that bring accomplishment and
   advancement to our needs. This orientation focuses on things that we want to
   do that will bring us pleasure and positive outcomes.
 Routine response behavior: This concept describes when consumers make low-
   involvement decisions that are "automatic" in nature and reflect a limited amount
   of information the consumer has gathered in the past.
 Utilitarian needs: Needs that are considered practical and useful.

Needs, Wants, and Goals

Every New Year, many of us make resolutions -- or goals -- that eventually go unsatisfied: eat
healthier; pay better attention in class; volunteer, exercise more. As much as we know our lives
would improve if we actually achieved these goals, people quite often don't follow through.
But what if that didn't have to be the case? What if every time we made a goal, we actually
accomplished it? Each day, our behaviour is the result of countless goals -- maybe not goals in
the way we think of them, like lifting the heaviest weights or being the first person to land on
Mars. But even with "mundane" goals, like getting food from the grocery store, or showing up to
work on time, we are often enacting the same psychological processes involved with achieving
loftier dreams. To understand how we can better attain our goals, let's begin with defining what
a goal is and what underlies it, psychologically.

Goals

A goal is the cognitive representation of a desired state, or, in other words, our mental idea of
how we'd like things to turn out (Fishbach & Ferguson 2007; Kruglanski, 1996). This desired end
state of a goal can be clearly defined (e.g., stepping on the surface of Mars), or it can be more
abstract and represent a state that is never fully completed (e.g., eating healthy). Underlying all
of these goals, though, is motivation, or the psychological driving force that enables action in
the pursuit of that goal (Lewin, 1935).

    Motivation can stem from two places. First, it can come from the benefits associated with
the process of pursuing a goal (intrinsic motivation). For example, you might be driven by the
desire to have a fulfilling experience while working on your Mars mission. Second, motivation
can also come from the benefits associated with achieving a goal (extrinsic motivation), such
as the fame and fortune that come with being the first person on Mars (Deci & Ryan, 1985).
One easy way to consider intrinsic and extrinsic motivation is through your eyes as a student.
Does the student work hard on assignments because the act of learning is pleasing (intrinsic
motivation)? Or does the student work hard to get good grades, which will help land a good job
(extrinsic motivation)?

                                                                                                   NEEDS, WANTS, AND GOALS | 169
Needs & Wants

Consumer behaviour can be thought of as the combination of efforts and results related to the
consumer's need to solve problems. Consumer problem solving is triggered by the identification
of some unmet need. A family consumes all of the milk in the house; or the tires on the
family car wear out; or the bowling team is planning an end-of-the-season picnic: these present
consumers with a problem which must be solved. Problems can be viewed in terms of two
types of needs: physical (such as a need for food) or psychological (for example, the need to
be accepted by others).

    Although the difference is a subtle one, there is some benefit in distinguishing between
needs and wants. A need is a basic deficiency given a particular essential item. You need food,
water, air, security, and so forth. A want is placing certain personal criteria as to how that need
must be fulfilled. Therefore, when we are hungry, we often have a specific food item in mind.
Consequently, a teenager will lament to a frustrated parent that there is nothing to eat, while
standing in front of a full refrigerator.

    Most of marketing is in the want-fulfilling business, not the need- fulfilling business. Apple
does not want you to buy just any watch, they want you to want to buy an Apple Watch. Likewise,
Ralph Lauren wants you to want Polo when you shop for clothes. On the other hand, a nonprofit
such as the Canadian Cancer Association would like you to feel a need for a check-up and does
not care which doctor you go to. In the end, however, marketing is mostly interested in creating
and satisfying wants.

Utilitarian & Hedonic Needs

Often discussion around needs are further explained in the context of those which are
utilitarian (practical and useful in nature) and hedonic (luxurious or desirable in nature).
Consumers satisfying their utilitarian needs will be more price sensitive than consumers
seeking to satisfy hedonic needs who will justify high(er) prices due to the infrequency in which
they would purchase a luxury item. Cognitive dissonance, or consumer guilt, is more likely to be
associated with hedonic purchases than utilitarian ones.

Prevention & Promotion Orientation

Research also distinguishes between two distinct self-regulatory orientations (or perceptions
of effectiveness) in pursuing a goal: prevention and promotion.

    A prevention emphasizes safety, responsibility, and security needs, and views goals as
"oughts." That is, for those who are prevention-oriented, a goal is viewed as something they
should be doing, and they tend to focus on avoiding potential problems (e.g., exercising to avoid
health threats). This self-regulatory focus leads to a vigilant strategy aimed at avoiding losses
(the presence of negatives) and approaching non-losses (the absence of negatives).

    On the other hand, a promotion focus views goals as "ideals," and emphasizes hopes,
accomplishments, and advancement needs. Here, people view their goals as something they
want to do that will bring them added pleasure (e.g., exercising because being healthy allows
them to do more activities). This type of orientation leads to the adoption of an eager strategy
concerned with approaching gains (the presence of positives) and avoiding non-gains (the
absence of positives).

    To compare these two strategies, consider the goal of saving money. Prevention-focused
people will save money because they believe it's what they should be doing (an ought), and
because they're concerned about not having any money (avoiding a harm). Promotion-focused
people, on the other hand, will save money because they want to have extra funds (a desire) so
they can do new and fun activities (attaining an advancement). Although these two strategies
result in very similar behaviours, emphasizing potential losses will motivate individuals with
a prevention focus, whereas emphasizing potential gains will motivate individuals with a
promotion focus. And these orientations -- responding better to either a prevention or
promotion focus -- differ across individuals (chronic regulatory focus) and situations
(momentary regulatory focus; Higgins, 1997).

                                                                                                   NEEDS, WANTS, AND GOALS | 171
  Brands Applying Prevention or Promotion Orientations

      Marketing Professional Farah Khan, says every marketer needs to understand that
      different consumers can respond differently to the same marketing strategy (Khan,
      2015). How? The difference lies in how we perceive goals in relation to our personal
      values and believes (Khan, 2015). Prevention Orientation--or as Khan calls it, "Play to
      not lose" seeks ways to stay safe and secure; while Promotion Orientation--or "Play
      to win"--is all about risk and advancement.

     Prevention Orientation: Avoiding Negative Outcomes

         Marketers tailor their messages to consumers in order to appeal to their unique
      approaches to achieving goals. For example, consumers who are largely motivated
      to avoid harm/losses, act responsibly, and minimize damage, may be drawn to
      brands such as the ones below, which use persuasive messaging to highlight the
      avoidance of negative outcomes:

            The Body Shop & LUSH Cosmetics (cruelty-free).
            Patagonia (avoids excessive waste and environmentally harmful production

              practices).
            Thrift clothing stores, such as The Goodwill (sustainability; up-cycling).
            Vape accessories (reduced-risk smoking experience).

     Promotion Orientation: Seeking Rewards and Positive Outcomes

         On the other hand, consumers with a promotion-focused goal orientation seek to
      maximize gain, benefit, and reward. Brands that appeal to these consumers may
      include:

            Axe Body Spray (enhance attractiveness).
            Birchbox (personalized delivery of beauty products).
            Dove (promotes high self-esteem).
            Music festivals and concerts (memory-making experiences).

Motivational Conflicts

Motivational conflict (or ambivalence) arises when people experience two goals that are
incompatible with each other (Baker, Dickson, & Field, 2014). Consumers often find themselves
in a state of conflict when two or more competing goals conflict with each other.

    The three main types of motivational conflicts are:

 1. Approach-Approach: conflict occurs when a person must choose between two desirable
      choices (Solomon, 2017). If the goal is to take a vacation, you might be stuck between
      two really good options: a beach holiday or an alpine ski trip.

 2. Approach-Avoidance: conflict occurs when a person desires something, but also seeks to
      avoid it at the same time. This type of conflict carries both positive and negative
      outcomes for the consumer, such as eating delicious (yet unhealthy) junk food.

 3. Avoidance-Avoidance: conflict occurs when a person is faced to choose between two
      equally undesirable choices, both of which carry negative outcomes. Spending a sunny
      summer weekend studying for an exam or getting a failing grade on that exam are both
      very unpleasant outcomes!

Motivational Theories and
Models

Motivations are often considered in psychology in terms of drives, which are internal states that
are activated when the physiological characteristics of the body are out of balance, and goals,
which are desired end states that we strive to attain. Motivation can thus be conceptualized as
a series of behavioral responses that lead us to attempt to reduce drives and to attain goals by
comparing our current state with a desired end state (Lawrence, Carver, & Scheier, 2002).

Drive Theory

What is the longest you've ever gone without eating? A couple of hours? An entire day? How
did it feel? Humans rely critically on food for nutrition and energy, and the absence of food can
create drastic changes, not only in physical appearance, but in thoughts and behaviors. If you've
ever fasted for a day, you probably noticed how hunger (a form of "tension," or "hangry" as we
call it in my house) can take over your mind, directing your attention to foods you could be
eating (a cheesy slice of pizza, or perhaps some cold ice cream), and motivating you to obtain
and consume these foods. It's not until you've eaten that your hunger begins to face and the
tension you have experienced disappears.

    Hunger is a drive state, an affective experience (something you feel, like the sensation of
being tired or hungry) that motivates organisms to fulfill goals that are generally beneficial to
their survival and reproduction. Like other drive states, such as thirst or sexual arousal, hunger
has a profound impact on the functioning of the mind. It affects psychological processes,
such as perception, attention, emotion, and motivation, and influences the behaviors that these
processes generate.

                                                                                  MOTIVATIONAL THEORIES AND MODELS | 175
  How Food Advertising Engages Consumers

      How do marketers capitalize on the tension that exists when we are hungry or
      thirsty? Have you ever seen an ad for a juicy steak when you're feeling hungry? Or ice
      cream when it's warm outside and you've just eaten dinner? Marketers both enhance
      our drive state (the tension we feel when we have an unmet goal or desire) through
      commercials and other forms of advertisements, as well as solve it by making
      products readily available through wide and prolific distribution systems. Thirsty? No
      problem, walk about 10 metres and you're bound to find a Coke somewhere.

         Food advertising both engages our senses and enhances our drive state (think:
      food courts at shopping malls, sample stations at Costco, Ikea's restaurants, and
      farmers' markets in the summertime) and only the savvy of marketer who
      exasperates the tension is also there with product ready at hand.

Homeostasis

Like a thermostat on an air conditioner, the body tries to maintain homeostasis, the natural
state of the body's systems, with goals, drives, and arousal in balance. When a drive or goal is
aroused -- for instance, when we are hungry -- the thermostat turns on and we start to behave
in a way that attempts to reduce the drive or meet the goal (in this case to seek food). As the
body works toward the desired end state, the thermostat continues to check whether or not the
end state has been reached. Eventually, the need or goal is satisfied (we eat), and the relevant
behaviors are turned off. The body's thermostat continues to check for homeostasis and is
always ready to react to future needs.

    Many homeostatic mechanisms, such as blood circulation and immune responses, are
automatic and non-conscious. Others, however, involve deliberate action. Most drive states
motivate action to restore homeostasis using both "punishments" and "rewards." Imagine that
these homeostatic mechanisms are like molecular parents. When you behave poorly by
departing from the set point (such as not eating or being somewhere too cold), they raise their
voice at you. You experience this as the bad feelings, or "punishments," of hunger, thirst, or
feeling too cold or too hot. However, when you behave well (such as eating nutritious foods
when hungry), these homeostatic parents reward you with the pleasure that comes from any
activity that moves the system back toward the set point.

176 | MOTIVATIONAL THEORIES AND MODELS
Expectancy Theory

Expectancy theory explains motivations much differently than drive theory. While drive theory
explains why we are motivated to eat, drink, and sleep (to reduce tensions arising to unmet
needs--hunger, thirst, tiredness), expectancy theory explains motivations where desirable
outcomes can be achieved through our effort and performance.

    According to expectancy theory, individual motivation to put forth more or less effort
is determined by a rational calculation in which individuals evaluate their situation (Porter
& Lawler, 1968; Vroom, 1964). According to this theory, individuals ask themselves three
questions:

 1. Whether the person believes that high levels of effort will lead to outcomes of interest,
      such as performance or success. This perception is labeled expectancy. For example, do
      you believe that the effort you put forth in a class is related to performing well in that
      class? If you do, you are more likely to put forth effort.

 2. The degree to which the person believes that performance is related to subsequent
      outcomes, such as rewards. This perception is labeled instrumentality. For example, do
      you believe that getting a good grade in the class is related to rewards such as getting a
      better job, or gaining approval from your instructor, or from your friends or parents? If you
      do, you are more likely to put forth effort.

 3. Finally, individuals are also concerned about the value of the rewards awaiting them as a
      result of performance. The anticipated satisfaction that will result from an outcome is
      labeled valence. For example, do you value getting a better job, or gaining approval from
      your instructor, friends, or parents? If these outcomes are desirable to you, your
      expectancy and instrumentality is high, and you are more likely to put forth effort.

  Student Op-Ed: Share a Coke, but only some of you

      A consumer behaviour concept called "expectancy theory" can help illustrate how
      soft drink giant Coca-Cola (Coke) promoted class and race disparity in America.
      Expectancy Theory essentially explains that consumers' decisions are driven by
      "positive incentives" (Solomon, White & Dahl, 2014). Choosing a certain product
      rather than any other alternative provides a consumer with a more positive result, like
      a higher social status. Coke's marketing techniques during the time of America's civil
      rights movement and during its early competition against rival Pepsi, draws a
      connection between a widening socio-economic class gap and consumers' choices.

         In Irene Angelico's (1998) film, "The Cola Conquest," we see how Coke was
      conceived in Atlanta, Georgia at the end of the American Civil War. To its core, the
      Coca-Cola company is a deeply southern company built through civil unrest.

                                                                                  MOTIVATIONAL THEORIES AND MODELS | 177
      Specifically, Coke was born at a time when Black people were believed to be second-
      class citizens. And in their advertising, Coke used caricatures of Black people to
      demonstrate this belief. In Angelico's film, Coke is described as a symbol of
      nationalism to the American people: for white people this meant something to be
      protected; for Black people it meant everything they were denied (Angelico, 1998).

         Since its conception in 1886, the soda magnate has implemented an aggressive
      marketing strategy to capture as much of the market as possible. So when
      competition and copy cats came in, Coke easily pulled through with momentum they
      had been building for decades. At that point, consumers already associated "Coke"
      with being "American." When Pepsi launched into the marketplace, arguably Coke's
      biggest competitor to this day, Pepsi was branded as a second class drink. People
      still enjoyed Pepsi, but not in public. "Real Americans" drank Coke. Pepsi was
      reserved for "non-Americans" (this usually meant Black Americans).

         Consumers' decisions to choose Coke, as shown in the film, is born out of a desire
      to not be "othered" by friends, family, or strangers. Coke identified how the
      socioeconomic gap existing between classes could be leveraged as a positioning
      strategy to align the brand with emerging middle and upper-class Americans.
      Consequently, this ultimately meant a specific race too. I think it's critical to be aware
      of the fact that Coke's success came at the cost of dignity for Black Americans. I
      also feel that Coke, without question, operated on their collectives biases which
      informed their marketing: so instead of developing marketing strategies based on
      consumers' needs and wants, the company was guided by historical and racial
      differences.

         Now, when I look at advertisements I have to think more critically about the
      messages they are conveying: what are they telling me to think? I think the truth of
      the matter is that while some messages will always go over my head, I need to be
      aware of the fact that I won't always have context for every marketing message put
      in front of me.

         It's inevitable that how I see myself is probably always going to be tied to the
      products that I buy. But being smart about where I spend my money and recognizing
      that it's a privilege to have the freedom to choose, helps me to become a more
      socially responsible consumer. I think consumers need to realize that big
      corporations, like the Coca-Cola company, have a significant impact on shaping our
      cultures and that choosing a product might sometimes mean jeopardizing a whole
      community.

Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

One of the most important humanists, Abraham Maslow (1908-1970), conceptualized
personality in terms of a pyramid-shaped hierarchy of motives, also called the "Hierarchy of
Needs." At the base of the pyramid are the lowest-level motivations, including hunger and thirst,
and safety and belongingness. Maslow argued that only when people are able to meet the
lower-level needs are they able to move on to achieve the higher-level needs of self-esteem,
and eventually self-actualization, which is the motivation to develop our innate potential to the
fullest possible extent.

  Motivating Consumers in a Time of Crisis

      Following the economic crisis that began in 2008, the sales of new automobiles
      dropped sharply virtually everywhere around the world -- except the sales of Hyundai
      vehicles. Hyundai understood that people needed to feel secure and safe and ran an
      ad campaign that assured car buyers they could return their vehicles if they couldn't
      make the payments on them without damaging their credit. Seeing Hyundai's
      success, other carmakers began offering similar programs. Likewise, banks began
      offering "worry-free" mortgages to ease the minds of would-be homebuyers. For a
      fee of about $500, First Mortgage Corp., a Texas-based bank, offered to make a
      homeowner's mortgage payment for six months if he or she got laid off (Jares,
      2010).

         Likewise, during the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic, brands started to adopt a new
      line of "worry-free" messaging such as Pizza Hut's "contact-free" delivery option for
      consumers living under conditions of quarantine and physical isolation.

Maslow studied how successful people, including Albert Einstein, Abraham Lincoln, Martin
Luther King Jr., Helen Keller, and Mahatma Gandhi, had been able to lead such successful and
productive lives. Maslow (1970) believed that self-actualized people are creative, spontaneous,
and loving of themselves and others. They tend to have a few deep friendships rather than many
superficial ones, and are generally private. He felt that these individuals do not need to conform
to the opinions of others because they are very confident and thus free to express unpopular
opinions. Self-actualized people are also likely to have peak experiences, or transcendent
moments of tranquility accompanied by a strong sense of connection with others.

                                                                                  MOTIVATIONAL THEORIES AND MODELS | 179
        Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs begins at the bottom with basic or physiological needs such as
        water and food. Once those needs are met the next level of needs are safety, such as
        security and good health. The next level of needs are belonging, such as friendship and
        family. Once met, the next level of needs are esteem (or ego) such as the respect and
        admiration of others. And the final level of needs to be met are self-actualization which may
        be fulfilled through volunteering or creative endeavors.

Maslow & Blackfoot Nation

Maslow's work was informed by the Blackfoot (Niitsitapi or Siksikaitsitapi) people. In 1943,
Maslow spent several weeks performing anthropological research on Blackfoot territory, an
experience that had a "powerful impact" on him (Taylor, 2019). Cindy Blackstock, an academic,
child welfare activist, and member of Gitksan First Nation, along with Leroy Little Bear, an
academic and researcher who founded the Native American Studies Department at the
University of Lethridge (Little Bear later went on to be the founding director of the Native
American Program at Harvard University) have both put forward that Maslow's exposure to the
Blackfoot people, culture, and way of life was, "instrumental in his formation of the `hierarchy of
needs' model'" (Leroy Little Bear, n.d.; Taylor, 2019).

    According to Blackstock, Maslow's model is "a rip-off from the Blackfoot nation": instead
of a triangle, in the Blackfoot tradition they used a tipi to depict an upward motion to the
skies (Blackstock, 2014). And, while Maslow's model places self-actualization at the top of
the inverted triangle, the Blackfoot tradition identifies self-actualization as the foundation,
followed by "community actualization," then "cultural perpetuity" (Lincoln Michel, 2014). As
Arley Cruthers, a Communications Instructor at Kwantlen Polytechnic University points out, in

180 | MOTIVATIONAL THEORIES AND MODELS
Maslow's model self actualization represents the "pinnacle of human achievement," whereas
for the Blackfoot, self-actualization provides a foundation for greater community and cultural
purpose (Cruthers, n.d.).

    To see these models side-by-side and read more about their differences and how Maslow
appropriated Blackfoot culture to inform his research, visit Karen Lincoln Michel's blog post:
"Maslow's hierarchy connected to Blackfoot beliefs."

    These two competing models remind us how cultural context shapes consumers needs and
wants.

  Student Op-Ed: Coca-Cola Marketing for Maslow - Using Consumer
  Motivation to Create Life-Long Customers

      Abraham Maslow's hierarchical approach to motivation has been universally
      "adopted by marketers" (Solomon, White, & Dahl, 2015, p. 100) because it helps them
      to understand which level of need their target consumer is trying to meet and how to
      market their product to fulfill that need (Thompson, 2019). Coca-Cola (Coke) is
      known for its unique and innovative marketing strategies and their approach to
      Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs is no exception. Throughout history, Coke has expertly
      targeted every tier of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, and by doing so they have
      created and retained dedicated life-long customers.

         The first tier in Maslow's model is physiological, or basic, needs. The consumers at
      this level are solely seeking to satisfy their basic survival needs, such as water and
      staple food items (Walker, 2017). In 1986, Roberto C. Goizueta, the Chairman and
      CEO of Coke at the time, is quoted saying: "Eventually the number 1 beverage on
      earth will not be tea, or coffee, or wine, or beer, it will be soft drinks. Our soft drinks."
      (Angelico, Neidik, & Webb, 1998) proving that the company was determined to target
      the consumers in this motivation tier. Since then, Coca Cola has managed to
      convince consumers that it should be a staple in their diet, and for many, it has
      completely replaced water, but this was not always the case (Angelico et al., 1998).

         In 1886, John Pemberton combined the healing properties of the coco leaf and the
      cola nut to create a drink that would eventually become Coca Cola; he originally
      created and marketed it as a "brain-tonic" or "cure-all elixir" (Angelico et al., 1998).
      Though Maslow would not be born for another 20 or so years (The Editors of
      Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2019), Pemberton was inadvertently marketing his elixir to
      the second tier in Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs: safety needs; which includes health,
      security, and protection. According to Maslow, consumers will not be motivated by
      safety needs until their physiological needs have been met (Walker, 2017). While
      Coke is no longer regarded as a "health" drink, it still appeals to consumers
      motivated by safety needs because it provides them with the comforting feel of

                                                                                  MOTIVATIONAL THEORIES AND MODELS | 181
      home. During WW2, one severely wounded American soldier even credited holding in
      his hand an empty Coke bottle for being "the only thing that kept him from dying all
      night long" (Angelico et al., 1998).

         The motivational needs in the third tier, belonging and love, address consumers
      who feel their physiological and safety needs have been adequately satisfied who are
      now looking to spend more of their disposable income (Walker, 2017). This tier is an
      appealing choice for marketers (Walker, 2017), Coke included, due to the sheer
      volume of consumers motivated to make purchasing decisions that satisfy their
      social needs. Coke's global growth strategy resulting in the brand becoming "within
      an arm's reach" of the consumer at all times, combined with its air of nostalgia
      sentimentally depicted in advertisements featuring children and the good ol' days,
      resulted in many consumers purchasing Coke as a way to fulfill their intimacy
      motivations (Angelico et al., 1998). "Coca Cola is your friend. Wherever you go Coca
      Cola is always there, it's like coming home to mother." (Angelico et al., 1998).

         The second to final tier, self-esteem needs, generally consists of luxury brands
      (Walker, 2017). In modern-day Eurocentric and Western cultures, we might not
      consider Coke a luxury item, but its early history is rooted in social status and
      classism. Mid-20th century, as a feature of American culture and domestic
      hospitality, a host would be expected to serve friends and family Coke over Pepsi, the
      former regarded as a luxury and the latter regarded as a, "second-class drink"
      (Angelico et al., 1998).

         This social tier also encompasses motivations surrounding achievement, a theme
      present throughout Coke's marketing since the early days when a company hanging
      a Coke sign out resulted in "immediate business success" (Angelico et al., 1998).
      Achievement and success were also strong themes developed through the brand's
      sponsorship marketing strategies, namely as a feature sponsor for Olympic events
      including the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta (Angelico et al., 1998) , which continue to this
      day.

         Self-actualization needs, the final tier, addresses the motivations of consumers
      who have already fulfilled their needs in all of the previous tiers and now desire a
      sense of self-fulfillment and accomplishment (Walker, 2017). Asa Candler, who
      transformed Coke into the soda giant we know today, appealed to consumers--name
      business men at the time - in this tier by claiming "a Coca Cola taken at 8, energizes
      the brain `till 11" (Angelico et al., 1998). Candler also oversaw the creation of Coke's
      iconic Normal Rockwell-style of advertisements which would catalyze 2 decades of
      "ads linking Coke to life's special moments" (Angelico et al., 1998).

         I believe Coke is the perfect brand to study when learning about Maslow's
      Hierarchy of Needs. Being able to market to the different motivations of consumers

182 | MOTIVATIONAL THEORIES AND MODELS
 at each level of the model cannot be easy, but I believe it is the reason Coca Cola has
 maintained so much success over such a long period of time. Maslow's model
 teaches us that, "[c]onsumers may have different need priorities at different times
 and stages of their lives" (Solomon et. al, 2015, p. 101), thus by marketing to all 5
 tiers, Coca Cola can essentially guarantee life-long consumers.

184 | MOTIVATIONAL THEORIES AND MODELS
Involvement Levels

Depending on a consumer's experience and knowledge, some consumers may be able to
make quick purchase decisions and other consumers may need to get information and be
more involved in the decision process before making a purchase. The level of involvement
reflects how personally important or interested you are in consuming a product and how much
information you need to make a decision. The level of involvement in buying decisions may be
considered a continuum from decisions that are fairly routine (consumers are not very involved)
to decisions that require extensive thought and a high level of involvement. Whether a decision
is low, high, or limited, involvement varies by consumer, not by product.

Low Involvement Consumer Decision Making

At some point in your life you may have considered products you want to own (e.g. luxury
or novelty items), but like many of us, you probably didn't do much more than ponder their
relevance or suitability to your life. At other times, you've probably looked at dozens of products,
compared them, and then decided not to purchase any one of them. When you run out of
products such as milk or bread that you buy on a regular basis, you may buy the product as
soon as you recognize the need because you do not need to search for information or evaluate
alternatives. As Nike would put it, you "just do it." Low-involvement decisions are, however,
typically products that are relatively inexpensive and pose a low risk to the buyer if a mistake is
made in purchasing them.

    Consumers often engage in routine response behavior when they make low-involvement
decisions -- that is, they make automatic purchase decisions based on limited information or
information they have gathered in the past. For example, if you always order a Diet Coke at
lunch, you're engaging in routine response behavior. You may not even think about other drink
options at lunch because your routine is to order a Diet Coke, and you simply do it. Similarly, if
you run out of Diet Coke at home, you may buy more without any information search.

    Some low-involvement purchases are made with no planning or previous thought. These
buying decisions are called impulse buying. While you're waiting to check out at the grocery
store, perhaps you see a magazine with a notable celebrity on the cover and buy it on the spot
simply because you want it. You might see a roll of tape at a check-out stand and remember
you need one or you might see a bag of chips and realize you're hungry or just want them.

                                                                                                           INVOLVEMENT LEVELS | 185
These are items that are typically low-involvement decisions. Low involvement decisions aren't
necessarily products purchased on impulse, although they can be.

High Involvement Consumer Decision Making

By contrast, high-involvement decisions carry a higher risk to buyers if they fail. These are
often more complex purchases that may carry a high price tag, such as a house, a car, or an
insurance policy. These items are not purchased often but are relevant and important to the
buyer. Buyers don't engage in routine response behavior when purchasing high-involvement
products. Instead, consumers engage in what's called extended problem solving where they
spend a lot of time comparing different aspects such as the features of the products, prices,
and warranties.

    High-involvement decisions can cause buyers a great deal of post-purchase dissonance,
also known as cognitive dissonance which is a form of anxiety consumers experience if
they are unsure about their purchases or if they had a difficult time deciding between two
alternatives. Companies that sell high-involvement products are aware that post purchase
dissonance can be a problem. Frequently, marketers try to offer consumers a lot of supporting
information about their products, including why they are superior to competing brands and why
the consumer won't be disappointed with their purchase afterwards. Salespeople play a critical
role in answering consumer questions and providing extensive support during and after the
purchasing stage.

Limited Problem Solving

Limited problem solving falls somewhere between low-involvement (routine) and high-
involvement (extended problem solving) decisions. Consumers engage in limited problem
solving when they already have some information about a good or service but continue to
search for a little more information. Assume you need a new backpack for a hiking trip. While
you are familiar with backpacks, you know that new features and materials are available since
you purchased your last backpack. You're going to spend some time looking for one that's
decent because you don't want it to fall apart while you're traveling and dump everything you've
packed on a hiking trail. You might do a little research online and come to a decision relatively
quickly. You might consider the choices available at your favorite retail outlet but not look at
every backpack at every outlet before making a decision. Or you might rely on the advice of a
person you know who's knowledgeable about backpacks. In some way you shorten or limit your
involvement and the decision-making process.

Behaviour      impulsive

Purchasing     High/Regular basis                     Low-seldom/Special occasion
Frequency

Products, such as chewing gum, which may be low-involvement for many consumers often
use advertising such as commercials and sales promotions such as coupons to reach many
consumers at once. Companies also try to sell products such as gum in as many locations as
possible. Many products that are typically high-involvement such as automobiles may use more
personal selling to answer consumers' questions. Brand names can also be very important
regardless of the consumer's level of purchasing involvement. Consider a low-versus high-
involvement decision -- say, purchasing a tube of toothpaste versus a new car. You might
routinely buy your favorite brand of toothpaste, not thinking much about the purchase (engage
in routine response behavior), but not be willing to switch to another brand either. Having a
brand you like saves you "search time" and eliminates the evaluation period because you know
what you're getting.

    When it comes to the car, you might engage in extensive problem solving but, again, only be
willing to consider a certain brand or brands (e.g. your evoke set for automobiles). For example,
in the 1970s, American-made cars had such a poor reputation for quality that buyers joked that
a car that's not foreign is "crap." The quality of American cars is very good today, but you get
the picture. If it's a high-involvement product you're purchasing, a good brand name is probably
going to be very important to you. That's why the manufacturers of products that are typically
high-involvement decisions can't become complacent about the value of their brands.

                                                                                                           INVOLVEMENT LEVELS | 187
Ways to Increase Involvement Levels

Involvement levels--whether they are low, high, or limited--vary by consumer and less so by
product. A consumer's involvement with a particular product will depend on their experience
and knowledge, as well as their general approach to gathering information before making
purchasing decisions. In a highly competitive marketplace, however, brands are always vying
for consumer preference, loyalty, and affirmation. For this reason, many brands will engage
in marketing strategies to increase exposure, attention, and relevance; in other words, brands
are constantly seeking ways to motivate consumers with the intention to increase consumer
involvement with their products and services.

    Some of the different ways marketers increase consumer involvement are: customization;
engagement; incentives; appealing to hedonic needs; creating purpose; and, representation.

Customization

                             Fashion items such as shoes can be customized by
                             manufacturers to reflect a consumer's unique personal
                             preference, which is an effective way to increase consumer
                             involvement

With Share a Coke, Coca-Cola made a global mass customization implementation that worked
for them. The company was able to put the labels on millions of bottles in order to get
consumers to notice the changes to the coke bottle in the aisle. People also felt a kinship and
moment of recognition once they spotted their names or a friend's name. Simultaneously this
personalization also worked because of the printing equipment that could make it happen and
there are not that many first names to begin with. These factors lead the brand to be able to roll
this out globally (Mass Customization #12, 2017).

Engagement

Have you ever heard the expression, "content is king"? Without a doubt, engaging, memorable,

188 | INVOLVEMENT LEVELS
and unique marketing content has a lasting impact on consumers. The marketing landscape is
a noisy one, polluted with an infinite number of brands advertising extensively to consumers,
vying for a fraction of our attention. Savvy marketers recognize the importance of sparking
just enough consumer interest so they become motivated to take notice and process their
marketing messages. Marketers who create content (that isn't just about sales and promotion)
that inspires, delights, and even serves an audience's needs are unlocking the secret to
engagement. And engagement leads to loyalty.

    There is no trick to content marketing, but the brands who do it well know that stepping
away--far away--from the usual sales and promotion lines is critical. While content marketing
is an effective way to increase sales, grow a brand, and create loyalty, authenticity is at its core.

    Bodyform and Old Spice are two brands who very cleverly applied just the right amount of
self-deprecating humor to their content marketing that not only engaged consumers, but had
them begging for more!

  Content as a Key Driver to Consumer Engagement

      Engaging customers through content might involve a two-way conversation online, or
      an entire campaign designed around a single customer comment.

     Bodyform

         In 2012, Richard Neill posted a message to Bodyform's Facebook page calling out
      the brand for lying to and deceiving its customers and audiences for years. Richard
      went on to say that Bodyform's advertisements failed to truly depict any sense of
      reality and that in fact he felt set up by the brand to experience a huge fall. Bodyform,
      or as Richard addressed the company, "you crafty bugger," is a UK company that
      produces and sells feminine protection products to menstruating girls and women
      (Bodyform, n.d.). Little did Richard know that when he posted his humorous rant to
      Bodyform that the company would respond by creating a video speaking directly at
      Richard and coming "clean" on all their deceitful attempts to make having period look
      like fun. When Bodyform's video went viral, a brand that would have otherwise
      continued to blend into the background captured the attention of a global audience.

         Xavier Izaguirre says that, "[a]udience involvement is the process and act of
      actively involving your target audience in your communication mix, in order to
      increase their engagement with your message as well as advocacy to your brand."
      Bodyform gained global recognition by turning one person's rant into a viral publicity
      sensation (even though Richard was not the customer in this case).

     Old Spice

         Despite being a household name, in the years leading up to Old Spice's infamous
      "The Man Your Man Should Smell Like" campaign, sales were flat and the brand had

                                                                                                           INVOLVEMENT LEVELS | 189
      failed to strike a chord in a new generation of consumers. Ad experts at Wieden +
      Kennedy produced a single 30-second ad (featuring a shirtless and self-deprecating
      Isaiah Mustafa) that played around the time of the 2010 Super Bowl game. While the
      ad quickly gained notoriety on YouTube, it was the now infamous, "Response
      Campaign" that made the campaign a leader of its time in audience engagement.

Incentives

                           Loyalty and reward programs encourage loyalty and repeat
                           purchases, are also effective ways to increase consumer
                           involvement.

Customer loyalty and reward programs successfully motivate consumers in the decision
making process and reinforce purchasing behaviors (a feature of instrumental conditioning).
The rationale for loyalty and rewards programs is clear: the cost of acquiring a new customer
runs five to 25 times more than selling to an existing one and existing customers spend 67
per cent more than new customers (Bernazzani, n.d.). From the customer perspective, simple
and practical reward programs such as Beauty Insider--a point-accumulation model used by
Sephora--provides strong incentive for customer loyalty (Bernazzani, n.d.).

190 | INVOLVEMENT LEVELS
Appealing to Hedonic Needs

                                      Appealing to a consumer's hedonic
                                      needs--such as the desire for a luxurious
                                      vacation--is an effective way to increase
                                      consumer involvement.

A particularly strong way to motivate consumers to increase involvement levels with a product
or service is to appeal to their hedonic needs. Consumers seek to satisfy their need for fun,
pleasure, and enjoyment through luxurious and rare purchases. In these cases, consumers are
less likely to be price sensitive ("it's a treat") and more likely to spend greater processing time
on the marketing messages they are presented with when a brand appeals to their greatest
desires instead of their basic necessities.

Creating Purpose

Millennial and Digital Native consumers are profoundly different than those who came before
them. Brands, particularly in the consumer goods category, who demonstrate (and uphold) a
commitment to sustainability grow at a faster rate (4 per cent) than those who do not (1 per
cent) ("Consumer-Goods...," 2015). In a 2015 poll, 30,000 consumers were asked how much the
environment, packaging, price, marketing, and organic or health and wellness claims had on
their consumer-goods' purchase decisions, and to no surprise, 66 per cent said they would be
willing to pay more for sustainable brands. (Nielsen, 2015). A rising trend and important factor
to consider in evaluating consumer involvement levels and ways to increase them. So while

                                                                                                           INVOLVEMENT LEVELS | 191
cruelty-free, fair trade, and locally-sourced may all seem like buzz words to some, they are non-
negotiable decision-making factors to a large and growing consumer market.

Representation

                               The use of celebrity endorsements in a brand's marketing
                               strategy can increase consumer involvement.

Celebrity endorsement can have a profound impact on consumers' overall attitude towards
a brand. Consumers who might otherwise have a "neutral" attitude towards a brand (neither
positive nor negative) may be more noticed to take notice of a brand's messages and stimuli if
a celebrity they admire is the face of the brand.

    When sportswear and sneaker brand Puma signed Rihanna on to not just endorse the brand
but design an entire collection, sales soared in all the regions and the brand enjoyed a new
"revival" in the U.S. where Under Armour and Nike had been making significant gains ("Rihanna
Designs...," 2017). "Rihanna's relationship with us makes the brand actual and hot again with
young consumers," said chief executive Bjorn Gulden ("Rihanna Designs...," 2017).

Key Terms and Concepts

          AIOs: A=Activities; I=Interests; O=Opinions...the AIO's constitute the foundation
             and building blocks of a person's attitudes which typically define our lifestyle
             choices as consumers.

          Archetypes: Carl Jung (1875-1961) theoretical work on personalities included
             archetypes, which he believed to be "ancestral memories" reflecting the common
             experiences of people all over the world. His explanation of archetypes included
             a strong belief that they were mostly biological and handed down to us. More
             recent research on archetypes suggests that they come from our lived
             experiences and reflect our cultural characteristics (and are not biological or
             handed down).

          Brand: A brand consists of all tangible and intangible components that form a
             unique identity, thus distinguishing one entity from another, particularly in a
             competitive category.

          Brand associations: This concept refers to the thoughts, feelings, perceptions,
             images, experiences, believes, and attitudes from the consumer's experience
             that become tied to a brand. Anything linked in our memory to a brand--positive
             or negative--that forms a lasting impressions in the mind of a consumer.

          Brand awareness: The sum of all points of contact ("touchpoints") with a brand.
          Brand experience: The sum of all points of contact ("touchpoints") with a brand.
          Brand image: This is a symbolic construct (representation) that is created in our

             minds based on all the information and expectations we associate with a
             particular brand.
          Brand loyalty: This term refers to a consumer's commitment to repurchase a
             particular brand despite having other options available to them.
          Brand personality: A brand's personality is comprised of human-like
             characteristics that convey traits consumers can identity with themselves:

                                                                                                   KEY TERMS AND CONCEPTS | 199
             warmth; excitement; comfort; edginess; old-fashion; etc. Brand personality is
             created to persuade and influence consumer decision making based on the
             belief that consumers will purchase brands that are aligned with some aspect of
             their self-concept or self-complexity.

          Defense mechanisms: Freud believed that when the Ego seeks to find balance
             between the Id and the Superego, defense mechanisms are enacted to help us
             reduce tension. Freud believed that our unconscious mind creates these
             unconscious efforts to protect the ego from being overwhelmed by anxiety.

          Extended self: This term describes situations in which consumers further
             identify their self-concept through their purchasing decisions and consumption
             choices.

          Extrinsic brand attributes: These are the features and characteristics of a brand
             that enable consumers to form associations with it and give it meaning--such as
             a brand's price, its packaging, label, name, logo, and image.

          Five Factor Model of Personality: This model identifies five fundamental
             personality trait dimensions (characteristics) that are believed to be stable
             across time, cross-culturally shared, and an explanation for most human
             behavior. Those five traits are: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion,
             Agreeableness, and Neuroticism.

          Freudian theory: Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), an Austrian neurologist and
             founder of psychoanalysis, engaged in research and work that has shaped and
             influenced our contemporary understanding of personality and psychology.
             Freudian theory states that our behaviors are predetermined by our unconscious
             motivations.

          Id, ego, superego: Freud believed the mind was divided into three main
             components: the "Id" (the part that forms our impulsive behavior); the "Superego"
             (the part that forms our consciousness and sense of morality); and, the "Ego"
             (the part that forms our sense of reality and balances the Id and Superego).

          Ideal self: An idealized version of ourselves that is based on several factors
             including our experiences, the expectations we feel society has of us, and the
             traits we admire in others.

          Intrinsic brand attributes: These are the functional features and characteristics
             of a brand--such as its shape, performance, and capacity.

          Lifestyle marketing: Marketing campaigns designed to influence, persuade, and
             appeal to a consumer's "AIO's," values, worldviews, and personality identity.

          Looking glass self: Sometimes our self-concept is formed through our

200 | KEY TERMS AND CONCEPTS
   interactions with others and in these interactions we come to see, describe, and
   evaluate ourselves based on their reaction's to us.
 Neo-Freudian theories: Neo-Freudian theories were developed by psychologist
   and psychoanalysis -- many of whom were students of Freud's. They all
   developed their own theories on personality which either built on Freud's work or
   challenged it completely. Erik Erikson, Carl Jung, and Karen Horney are three of
   those people.
 Persona: Carl Jung (1875-1961) proposed the idea of a persona, which he
   explained as a sort of "mask" that we adopt that represents compromise
   between our "true self" and the person society expects us to be.
 Personality: A way to describe the various human characteristics that make us
   all different from one another.
 Personality traits: Personality traits refer to the basic dimensions that make us
   all different from one another.
 Person-situation debate: This concept supports the belief that our personalities
   are not consistent from one situation to the next. The belief here is that our
   personalities (and subsequent behaviors) are shaped by situational factors (e.g.
   what is happening in the environment around us).
 Psychographic segmentation: A marketing activity that involves the profiling of a
   market segment based on characteristics such as AIO's, personality, traits,
   lifestyle, and values. Psychographic segmentation undergoes a detailed and
   close examination of consumers with respect to their motivations, values, and
   media consumption habits.
 Reference groups: The groups of people in our lives that we use for social
   comparisons. Reference groups are used in social comparison theory.
 Self-affirmation theory: This theory suggests that people will try to reduce any
   threat to their own self-concept by focusing on (and affirming) their worth in a
   different and unrelated area.
 Self-awareness: The degree of cognitive awareness we have about ourselves.
 Self-complexity: This term explains the range in complexities some selves are
   compared to others. A more complex self suggests that we have several
   different ways of thinking about ourselves.
 Self-concept: This term describes how we see, understand, describe, and
   evaluate ourselves.
 Self-consciousness: This term describes the degree of self-awareness we

                                                                                       KEY TERMS AND CONCEPTS | 201
             experience when we are in situations that might make us feel uncomfortable
             (e.g. public judgement)and more aware of our self-concept.
          Self-efficacy: A person's belief in their own ability to succeed in a particular
             situation, context, or environment.
          Self-esteem: This term refers to the positive or negative feelings we have about
             ourselves. Self-esteem is most often determined by our own performance,
             appearance, and our relationships with others.
          Self-schemas: This terms describes how an aging and more complex self-
             concept becomes organized into different categories of the self.
          Social comparison theory: This theory explains how we further define our self-
             concept by comparing ourselves to other people. The comparisons are based on
             two dimensions: superiority/inferiority and similarity/difference. We use
             reference groups for social comparison.

202 | KEY TERMS AND CONCEPTS
Personality and Personality
Traits

Personality is derived from our interactions with and observations of others, from our
interpretations of those interactions and observations, and from our choices of which social
situations we prefer to enter or avoid (Bandura, 1986). In fact, behaviorists such as B.F.
Skinner explain personality entirely in terms of the environmental influences that the person
has experienced. Because we are profoundly influenced by the situations that we are exposed
to, our behavior does change from situation to situation, making personality less stable than
we might expect. And yet personality does matter -- we can, in many cases, use personality
measures to predict behavior across situations.

Personality Traits

When we observe people around us, one of the first things that strikes us is how different
people are from one another. Some people are very talkative while others are very quiet.
Some exhibit active behavior whereas others may live a more sedentary lifestyle. Some worry
a lot, others almost never seem anxious. Each time we use one of these words, words like
"talkative," "quiet," "active," or "anxious," to describe those around us, we are talking about a
person's personality -- the characteristic ways that people differ from one another. Personality
psychologists try to describe and understand these differences.

    Although there are many ways to think about the personalities that people have, Gordon
Allport and other "personologists" claimed that we can best understand the differences
between individuals by understanding their personality traits. Personality traits reflect basic
dimensions on which people differ (Matthews, Deary, & Whiteman, 2003).

    An important feature of personality traits is that they reflect continuous distributions rather
than distinct personality types. This means that when personality psychologists talk about
Introverts and Extraverts, they are not really talking about two distinct types of people who
are completely and qualitatively different from one another. Instead, they are talking about
people who score relatively low or relatively high along a continuous distribution. In fact, when

                                                                                PERSONALITY AND PERSONALITY TRAITS | 203
personality psychologists measure traits like Extraversion, they typically find that most people
score somewhere in the middle, with smaller numbers showing more extreme levels.

    There are three criteria that are characterize personality traits: (1) consistency, (2) stability,
and (3) individual differences.

 1. To have a personality trait, individuals must be somewhat consistent across situations in
      their behaviors related to the trait. For example, if they are talkative at home, they tend
      also to be talkative at work.

 2. Individuals with a trait are also somewhat stable over time in behaviors related to the trait.
      If they are talkative, for example, at age 30, they will also tend to be talkative at age 40.

 3. People differ from one another on behaviors related to the trait. Sleeping is not a
      personality trait and neither is consuming food -- virtually all individuals do these
      activities, and there are almost no individual differences. But people differ on how
      frequently they talk and how active they are, and thus personality traits such as
      Talkativeness and Activity Level do exist.

Traits are important and interesting because they describe stable patterns of behavior that
persist for long periods of time (Caspi, Roberts, & Shiner, 2005). Importantly, these stable
patterns can have broad-ranging consequences for many areas of our life (Roberts, Kuncel,
Shiner, Caspi, & Goldberg, 2007). For instance, think about the factors that determine success
in college. If you were asked to guess what factors predict good grades in college, you might
guess something like intelligence. This guess would be correct, but we know much more about
who is likely to do well. Specifically, personality researchers have also found the personality
traits like Conscientiousness play an important role in college and beyond, probably because
highly conscientious individuals study hard, get their work done on time, and are less distracted
by nonessential activities that take time away from school work. In addition, highly
conscientious people are often healthier than people low in conscientiousness because they
are more likely to maintain healthy diets, to exercise, and to follow basic safety procedures like
wearing seat belts or bicycle helmets. Over the long term, this consistent pattern of behaviors
can add up to meaningful differences in health and longevity.

    Thus, personality traits are not just a useful way to describe people you know; they actually
help psychologists predict how good a worker someone will be, how long he or she will live,
and the types of jobs and activities the person will enjoy. Thus, there is growing interest in
personality psychology among psychologists who work in applied settings, such as health
psychology or organizational psychology.

204 | PERSONALITY AND PERSONALITY TRAITS
  Why Personality Traits Matter in Marketing

      Various personality types, like people with various motives, are likely to respond in
      different ways to different market offerings. For example, an extrovert may enjoy the
      shopping experience and rely more on personal observation to secure information;
      thus, in-store promotion would become an important communication tool. Knowing
      the basic personality traits of target customers can be useful information for the
      manager in designing the marketing mix. Marketers have, however, found personality
      to be difficult to apply in developing marketing strategy. The primary reason for this
      is the lack of good ways to measure personality traits. Most available measures were
      developed to identify people with problems that needed medical attention. These
      have little value with consumers who are mentally healthy. As a result, most
      marketers have turned to lifestyle analysis.

The Five Factor Model

The fundamental work on trait dimensions conducted by Allport, Cattell, Eysenck, and many
others has led to contemporary trait models, the most important and well validated of which
is the Five-Factor (Big Five) Model of Personality. According to this model, there are five
fundamental underlying trait dimensions that are stable across time, cross-culturally shared,
and explain a substantial proportion of behavior (Costa & McCrae, 1992; Goldberg, 1982).

Descriptions of the Big Five Personality Traits

A large body of research evidence has supported the five-factor model (Diener & Lucas, 2019).
This system includes five broad traits that can be remembered with the acronym "OCEAN":
Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. Each of the major
traits from the Big Five can be divided into facets to give a more fine-grained analysis of
someone's personality.

                   Key features of the Big 5 Traits

Big 5 Trait        Definition                           Key Features

     Big 5 Trait                   Definition                        Key Features
Agreeableness     sociable, and to enjoy others; the  Assertive; Active;
Neuroticism       tendency to have a dominant style.  Excitement-seeking; Positive
                  The tendency to agree and go        emotionality
                  along with others rather than to    Trusting; Straightforward; Altruistic;
                  assert one's own opinions and       Compliant; Modest; Tender-minded
                  choices.
                  The tendency to frequently          Anxious; Angry; Depressed;
                  experience negative emotions such   Self-conscious; Impulsive;
                  as anger, worry, and sadness, as    Vulnerable
                  well as being interpersonally
                  sensitive.

An advantage of the five-factor approach is that it is parsimonious. Rather than studying
hundreds of traits, researchers can focus on only five underlying dimensions. The Big Five may
also capture other dimensions that have been of interest to psychologists. For instance, the
trait dimension of need for achievement relates to the Big Five variable of conscientiousness,
and self-esteem relates to low neuroticism. On the other hand, the Big Five factors do not seem
to capture all the important dimensions of personality. For instance, the Big Five do not capture
moral behavior, although this variable is important in many theories of personality. And there is
evidence that the Big Five factors are not exactly the same across all cultures (Cheung & Leung,
1998).

Online Gamers, Shoppers, & the Five Factor Model

                         Studying the personality traits of online gamers can help
                         marketers design strategies that better reach their target
                         audiences.

     A group of researchers in Spain examined online gamer behavior and how
  personality influences self-efficacy (the belief in our own capability to successfully
  accomplish what we set out to do).

     Below is a summary of their research showing how different traits of the Five
  Factor Model influence gaming self-efficacy:

        Conscientiousness: positively associated with task fulfillment and job
           performance. In the context of gaming, it can be assumed that game players
           must be persistent if they are to achieve game goals and be successful.

        Neuroticism: negatively influences self-efficacy. Individuals' psychological
           distress may limit their ability to become skilled and thus obtain the expected
           achievements in a game.

        Extraversion: positively influences self-efficacy. Interacting with other people,
           coupled with a tendency to be sociable, may increase their knowledge of the
           game and their abilities and skills when playing it (Yam, et al., 2017)

        Agreeableness: results are mixed. On the one hand, there is a significant
           relationship between agreeableness and brand loyalty in the case of video
           games (Lin 2010), on the other, there exists a negative effect of agreeableness
           and Internet usage (Landers & Lounsbury, 2006). Overall, Saleem et al (2011)
           find that agreeableness negatively influences self-efficacy.

                                                                            PERSONALITY AND PERSONALITY TRAITS | 207
            Openness: positively influences self-efficacy. Individuals displaying openness
              are more willing to try something new and also possess good imagination. An
              open mind is usually an advantage when solving problems at work and in life.

         Online gamers are expected to display greater self-efficacy if they are organized
      and persistent (conscientious); not worried, nervous and emotionally stable (not
      neurotic); sociable, optimistic and talkative (extrovert); unforgiving, cold and skeptical
      (not agreeable) and curious, creative and imaginative (open).

    How Personality Studies Can Help Marketers

         What are the implications for marketers? The authors of the study share how their
      research can also serve marketing managers of online games:

             Our results reveal how gaming might have practical implications for marketing
             managers. If firms teach players how to play, it could indirectly promote the online
             purchase of related products, which also supports the effectiveness of gamification
             strategies. In this sense, Huotari and Hamari (2012) propose the use of gamification
             strategies to offer a good video game, with added value, thus enhancing the playing
             experience and entailing benefits for both game developers and players alike.
             Keeping in mind that central to the game model is consumer choice, players will
             accept better non-imposed marketing strategies. In this sense, game developers may
             let master players (i.e., that show high gaming efficacy) to exchange information
             (tips, strategies or trick) for extra features with others, making easy microtransaction
             process between consumers (C2C commerce inside the game).

         (As a parent of two children who have both grown up playing Minecraft, I can say
      with certainty that the influence master and expert players have on children is strong!
      My kids can spend hours (no judgement, please) watching YouTube videos of how
      master players build and defend fortresses, uncover hidden treasures, and mine ore.)

         Research also provides evidence about the link between mobile gaming and online
      shopping behavior (Balakrishnan and Griffiths, 2018). Xu, Chen & Santhanam's 2105
      study has found that richer online formats and recommendations throughout video
      games enhance consumers' perceptions about experience products and positively
      affect consumers' intentions to purchase products.

         Recent data (Gaming Industry...2018), from Statista (2019) suggest that video
      gamers conduct in-game purchases, such as upgrades, additional lives, currency,
      personalized avatars, an ad-free experience, unrestricted playing time or special
      items (i.e., famous football players' avatars or skins that modifies the appearance of
      a character or item), and consumer spending on in-game purchases will grow until 32
      billion in 2020. In fact, 4% of global iOS device users and 3% of Android users are
      making in-game purchases per month and ("Mobile Gaming...," 2019).

208 | PERSONALITY AND PERSONALITY TRAITS
   Since users decide to adopt one activity they tend to another similar one (Eastin,
2002). This is why the authors of the study state that:

      Therefore, when consumers exhibit self-efficacy playing a video game, they will
      probably display this ability when purchasing related products. Therefore, we propose
      that video gamers acquire several skills when playing, the fact that allow them to feel
      more self-confident and effective when using online shopping platforms to buy
      games or accessories.

Beyond the Five Factor Model

Despite the popularity of the Five-Factor Model, it is certainly not the only model that exists.
Some suggest that there are more than five major traits, or perhaps even fewer. For example,
the HEXACO model of traits (Ashton & Lee, 2007) is similar to the Big Five, but it posits
slightly different versions of some of the traits, and its proponents argue that one important
class of individual differences was omitted from the Five-Factor Model. The HEXACO adds
Honesty-Humility as a sixth dimension of personality. People high in this trait are sincere, fair,
and modest, whereas those low in the trait are manipulative, narcissistic, and self-centered.
Thus, trait theorists are agreed that personality traits are important in understanding behavior,
but there are still debates on the exact number and composition of the traits that are most
important.

    There are other important traits that are not included in comprehensive models like the Big
Five. Although the five factors capture much that is important about personality, researchers
have suggested other traits that capture interesting aspects of our behavior. Table below
present a few traits that have been studied by researchers.

Machiavellianism      Named after the famous political philosopher, Niccolo Machiavelli, this trait
Need for Achievement  refers to individuals who manipulate the behavior of others, often through
Need for Cognition    duplicity. Machiavellians are often interested in money and power, and
Authoritarianism      pragmatically use others in this quest.
Narcissism
                      Those high in need for achievement want to accomplish a lot and set high
                      standards of excellence for themselves. They are able to work persistently
                      and hard for distant goals. David McClelland argued that economic growth
                      depends in part on citizens with high need for achievement.
                      People in need for cognition find it rewarding to understand things, and are
                      willing to use considerable cognitive effort in this quest. Such individuals
                      enjoy learning, and the process of trying to understand new things.
                      Authoritarians believe in strict social hierarchies, in which they are totally
                      obedient to those above them, and expect complete obedience from their
                      subordinates. Rigid in adherence to rules, the authoritarian personality is
                      very uncomfortable with uncertainty.
                      The narcissistic personality has self-love that is so strong that it results in
                      high levels of vanity, conceit, and selfishness. The narcissistic individual

                      PERSONALITY AND PERSONALITY TRAITS | 209
Self-esteem  often has problems feeling empathetic toward others and grateful to
Optimism     others.
Alexithymia  The tendency to evaluate oneself positively.
             The tendency to expect positive outcomes in the future. People who are
             optimistic expect good things to happen, and indeed they often have more
             positive outcomes, perhaps because they work harder to achieve them.
             The inability to recognize and label emotions in oneself. The individual also
             has a difficult time recognizing emotions in others, and often has
             difficulties in relationships.

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator

Another prominent personality trait model is the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) model.
MBTI is a personality assessment that was developed by Katherine Briggs and her daughter
Isabel Briggs Myers based on the framework of personality theory by Carl C. Jung. The MBTI
is a personality assessment that measures the psychological preferences that influence how
people perceive the world and make decisions with four different facets:

 Extroversion-Introversion (EI): how you get your energy and where you prefer to focus
   your attention

 Sensing-Intuition (SN): how you take in information about the world around you
 Thinking-Feeling (TF): how you like to make decisions
 Judging-Perceiving (JP): how you prefer to organize your life

Based on the assessment on the four facets, each individual falls into one of 16 types of
personalities below.

210 | PERSONALITY AND PERSONALITY TRAITS
                              Figure 1. The 16 personality types based on MBTI

Not all of the above traits are currently popular with scientists, yet each of them has
experienced popularity in the past. Although the Five-Factor Model has been the target of more
rigorous research than some of the traits above, these additional personality characteristics
give a good idea of the wide range of behaviors and attitudes that traits can cover.

The Person-Situation Debate & Alternatives to the Trait
Perspective

The ideas described in this section should probably seem familiar, if not obvious to you. When
asked to think about what our friends, enemies, family members, and colleagues are like,
some of the first things that come to mind are their personality characteristics. We might think
about how warm and helpful our first teacher was, how irresponsible and careless our brother
is, or how demanding and insulting our first boss was. Each of these descriptors reflects a
personality trait, and most of us generally think that the descriptions that we use for individuals
accurately reflect their "characteristic pattern of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors," or in other
words, their personality.

    But what if this idea was wrong? What if our belief in personality traits were an illusion and
people are not consistent from one situation to the next? This was a possibility that shook
the foundation of personality psychology in the late 1960s when Walter Mischel published a
book called Personality and Assessment (1968). In this book, Mischel suggested that if one
looks closely at people's behavior across many different situations, the consistency is really

                                                                                PERSONALITY AND PERSONALITY TRAITS | 211
not that impressive. In other words, children who cheat on tests at school may steadfastly
follow all rules when playing games and may never tell a lie to their parents. In other words,
he suggested, there may not be any general trait of honesty that links these seemingly related
behaviors. Furthermore, Mischel suggested that observers may believe that broad personality
traits like honesty exist, when in fact, this belief is an illusion. The debate that followed the
publication of Mischel's book was called the person-situation debate because it pitted the
power of personality against the power of situational factors as determinants of the behavior
that people exhibit.

    Because of the findings that Mischel emphasized, many psychologists focused on an
alternative to the trait perspective. Instead of studying broad, context-free descriptions, like the
trait terms we've described so far, Mischel thought that psychologists should focus on people's
distinctive reactions to specific situations. For instance, although there may not be a broad and
general trait of honesty, some children may be especially likely to cheat on a test when the risk
of being caught is low and the rewards for cheating are high. Others might be motivated by the
sense of risk involved in cheating and may do so even when the rewards are not very high. Thus,
the behavior itself results from the child's unique evaluation of the risks and rewards present at
that moment, along with her evaluation of her abilities and values. Because of this, the same
child might act very differently in different situations.

    Thus, Mischel thought that specific behaviors were driven by the interaction between very
specific, psychologically meaningful features of the situation in which people found
themselves, the person's unique way of perceiving that situation, and his or her abilities for
dealing with it. Mischel and others argued that it was these social-cognitive processes that
underlie people's reactions to specific situations that provide some consistency when
situational features are the same. If so, then studying these broad traits might be more fruitful
than cataloging and measuring narrow, context-free traits like Extraversion or Neuroticism.

    In the years after the publication of Mischel's (1968) book, debates raged about whether
personality truly exists, and if so, how it should be studied. And, as is often the case, it turns out
that a more moderate middle ground than what the situationists proposed could be reached. It
is certainly true, as Mischel pointed out, that a person's behavior in one specific situation is not
a good guide to how that person will behave in a very different specific situation. Someone who
is extremely talkative at one specific party may sometimes be reticent to speak up during class
and may even act like a wallflower at a different party. But this does not mean that personality
does not exist, nor does it mean that people's behavior is completely determined by situational
factors. Indeed, research conducted after the person-situation debate shows that on average,
the effect of the "situation" is about as large as that of personality traits.

    However, it is also true that if psychologists assess a broad range of behaviors across
many different situations, there are general tendencies that emerge. Personality traits give
an indication about how people will act on average, but frequently they are not so good at
predicting how a person will act in a specific situation at a certain moment in time. Thus, to
best capture broad traits, one must assess aggregate behaviors, averaged over time and across
many different types of situations. Most modern personality researchers agree that there is a

212 | PERSONALITY AND PERSONALITY TRAITS
place for broad personality traits and for the narrower units such as those studied by Walter
Mischel.

Self and Identity

The link between people's personalities and their buying behaviour is somewhat unclear, but
market researchers continue to study it. For example, some studies have shown that "sensation
seekers," or people who exhibit extremely high levels of openness, are more likely to respond
well to advertising that's violent and graphic. The practical problem for firms is figuring out
"who's who" in terms of their personalities. Marketers have had better luck linking people's self-
concept to their buying behaviour. Your self-concept is how you see yourself -- be it positive or
negative. Your ideal self is how you would like to see yourself -- whether it's muscular, more
popular, more eco-conscious, or more conservative.

Self-Concept

Part of what is developing in children as they grow is the fundamental cognitive part of the
self, known as the self-concept. The self-concept is a knowledge representation that contains
knowledge about us, including our beliefs about our personality traits, physical characteristics,
abilities, values, goals, and roles, as well as the knowledge that we exist as individuals.
Throughout childhood and adolescence, the self-concept becomes more abstract and complex
and is organized into a variety of different cognitive aspects of the self, known as self-schema.
Children have self-schemata (plural for schema) about their progress in school, their
appearance, their skills at sports and other activities, and many other aspects. In turn, these
self-schemata direct and inform their processing of self-relevant information (Harter, 1999),
much as we saw schemata in general affecting our social cognition.

Self-Complexity

Although every human being has a complex self-concept, there are nevertheless individual
differences in self-complexity, the extent to which individuals have many different and relatively
independent ways of thinking about themselves (Linville, 1987; Roccas & Brewer, 2002). Some
selves are more complex than others, and these individual differences can be important in
determining psychological outcomes. Having a complex self means that we have a lot of
different ways of thinking about ourselves. For example, imagine a woman whose self-concept
contains the social identities of student, girlfriend, daughter, marketing student, and hockey

                                                                                                               SELF AND IDENTITY | 217
player and who has encountered a wide variety of life experiences. Social psychologists would
say that she has high self-complexity. On the other hand, a man who perceives himself primarily
as either a student or as a member of the theatre ensemble and who has had a relatively narrow
range of life experiences would be said to have low self-complexity. For those with high self-
complexity, the various aspects of the self are separate, as the positive and negative thoughts
about a particular self-aspect do not spill over into thoughts about other aspects.

Ideal Self

The ideal self consists of the attributes that you or someone else would like you to possess. The
slogan "Be All That You Can Be," which for years was used by the U.S. Army to recruit soldiers, is
an attempt to appeal to this self-concept. Presumably, by joining the U.S. Army, you will become
a better version of yourself, which will, in turn, improve your life. Many beauty products and
cosmetic procedures are advertised in a way that's supposed to appeal to the ideal self people
seek. All of us want products that improve our lives.

Self-Awareness

Like any other schema, the self-concept can vary in its current cognitive accessibility. Self-
awareness refers to the extent to which we are currently fixing our attention on our own self-
concept. When our self-concept becomes highly accessible because of our concerns about
being observed and potentially judged by others, we experience the publicly induced self-
awareness known as self-consciousness (Duval & Wicklund, 1972; Rochat, 2009).

    According to self-awareness theory(Duval & Wicklund, 1972), when we focus our attention
on ourselves, we tend to compare our current behaviour against our internal standards.
Sometimes when we make these comparisons, we realize that we are not currently measuring
up. In these cases, self-discrepancy theory states that when we perceive a discrepancy
between our actual and ideal selves, this is distressing to us (Higgins, Klein, & Strauman, 1987).
In contrast, on the occasions when self-awareness leads us to comparisons where we feel
that we are being congruent with our standards, then self-awareness can produce positive
affect (Greenberg & Musham, 1981). Tying these ideas from the two theories together, Philips
and Silvia (2005) found that people felt significantly more distressed when exposed to self-
discrepancies while sitting in front of a mirror. In contrast, those not sitting in front of a mirror,
and presumably experiencing lower self-awareness, were not significantly emotionally affected
by perceived self-discrepancies. Simply put, the more self-aware we are in a given situation, the
more pain we feel when we are not living up to our ideals.

218 | SELF AND IDENTITY
Self-Esteem

Self-esteem refers to the positive (high self-esteem) or negative (low self-esteem) feelings that
we have about ourselves. We experience the positive feelings of high self-esteem when we
believe that we are good and worthy and that others view us positively. We experience the
negative feelings of low self-esteem when we believe that we are inadequate and less worthy
than others.

    Our self-esteem is determined by many factors, including how well we view our own
performance and appearance, and how satisfied we are with our relationships with other people
(Tafarodi & Swann, 1995). Self-esteem is in part a trait that is stable over time, with some people
having relatively high self-esteem and others having lower self-esteem. But self-esteem is also
a state that varies day to day and even hour to hour. When we have succeeded at an important
task, when we have done something that we think is useful or important, or when we feel that
we are accepted and valued by others, our self-concept will contain many positive thoughts
and we will therefore have high self-esteem. When we have failed, done something harmful, or
feel that we have been ignored or criticized, the negative aspects of the self-concept are more
accessible and we experience low self-esteem.

Looking-Glass Self

Our self-concept is also formed through our interactions with others and their reactions to us.
The concept of the looking-glass self explains that we see ourselves reflected in other people's
reactions to us and then form our self-concept based on how we believe other people see
us (Cooley, 1902). This reflective process of building our self-concept is based on what other
people have actually said, such as "You're a good listener," and other people's actions, such as
coming to you for advice. These thoughts evoke emotional responses that feed into our self-
concept. For example, you may think, "I'm glad that people can count on me to listen to their
problems."

  Student Op-Ed: Marketers' Influence on Consumers' Self-Esteem

      Marketers can have a huge impact on a consumer's self-esteem (Solomon, 2014).
      The concept of self-esteem refers to your personal value or the way you view
      yourself (Solomon, 2014). People with low self-esteem have low confidence, and try
      to avoid embarrassment, failure, or rejection (Solomon, 2014). In contrast, people
      with high self-esteem are confident, will take more risks, and are more willing to
      attract attention to themselves (Solomon, 2014). Some marketers may target
      consumers with low self-esteem and use messaging around their products or
      services that promise the benefits of high self-esteem. These tactics are typically
      employed to increase both brand exposure and sales. Repetitive and extensive
      exposure to ads featuring idealized images of happy, attractive people can trigger a

                                                                                                               SELF AND IDENTITY | 219
      process known as social comparison which can have a direct impact on a
      consumer's self-esteem (Solomon, 2014).

         Marketers are advertising to consumers with low self-esteem to increase sales
      and liquidity of the company. The brand Dove created a "Dove Self-Esteem Project"
      which encourages consumers to write about and share with others what their version
      of `real beauty' means (Millard, 2009). While Dove has created this platform,
      presumably to support female consumers in reframing the conversation around body
      positivity, beauty, and self-esteem, the brand continues to position its products as a
      `solution' for those seeking happiness and beauty (Millard, 2009). Moreover, where
      does this leave consumers who don't purchase their products? How can those
      consumers feel anything but inadequate or `not good enough' given the brand is so
      tightly positioned as a means to improving one's quality of life (Millard, 2009)? Since
      the Dove Self-Esteem Project started, product sales have increased: Dove claims
      that consumers' self-esteem also increases when its products are purchased (and
      thereby also decreases when products are not purchased (Millard, 2009)).

         The L'Oral company specifically targets self-esteem by promoting thin models
      with a full face of make-up who state the company's catchphrase, "you're worth it"
      (L'Oral Paris 2018). Despite the brand dedicating a page on its website to promote
      self-worth, once the consumer views the company's ads social comparison can be
      triggered, leading to a decrease in self-esteem unless the product is purchased
      (L'Oral Paris 2018). Moreover, L'Oral claims that their products increase `true
      beauty' and consequently, product sales have increased steadily since the promotion
      of `self-worth' (L'Oral Paris 2018). This gives further evidence to the fact that
      marketers have shifted messages away from product utility towards consumer
      happiness: messages that seek to improve self-esteem by promoting consumers'
      "worth" because they "deserve to feel beautiful" suggest these products are the only
      means to these ends.

         It could very well be that marketers are hoping to improve the self-esteem of their
      consumers, however I am concerned about the possibility that some consumers are
      negatively impacted by messages that suggest only specific products can achieve
      results and give consumers the beauty, confidence, and happiness they might be
      longing for. In addition, I believe marketers have a moral responsibility to reinforce
      that beauty comes from within, not from a jar, tube, or container. It's not honest to
      suggest that a certain product will make you feel or be, your best, authentic self.
      While I am happy to see that Dove has made a self-esteem project for people to
      express themselves and feel heard, it's important to acknowledge that the concept of
      beauty is different for each and every person. In researching this piece, I discovered
      that there is wide criticism of Dove's definition of beauty: it is said to be too narrow

220 | SELF AND IDENTITY
      and ignores the studies which claim that 69 per cent of women agree that they don't
      see themselves reflected in advertising, television or movies (Millard, 2009). My hope
      is that marketers now and in the future will engage more responsibly and create
      more relatable content that inspires everyone and doesn't guilt customers into their
      purchasing decisions.

The Extended Self

Some consumers may either unconsciously or consciously, use their consumption choices--for
examples the brands they favour and purchase--as a way to express who they are, what they
value, and how they want to be perceived. When their sense of self is further defined by
these possessions, we call it the Extended Self. When a consumer selects a particular pair of
sneakers, jeans, or cell phone, they are expressing some sense of "self" and identifying how they
want to stand out from some, or fit in with others. In this manner, the brands we select and the
possessions we showcase reflect both a sense of autonomy (i.e. distinction or uniqueness) and
affiliation (i.e. conformity) (Kleine and Kleine, 1995). The brands we select also communicate
our own values: for example, consumers who choose brands that are "green" (sustainable) may
be expressing a value for environmental conservatism and climate action.

Social Comparison Theory

We also develop our self-concept through comparisons to other people. Social comparison
theory states that we describe and evaluate ourselves in terms of how we compare to other
people. Social comparisons are based on two dimensions: superiority/inferiority and similarity/
difference (Hargie, 2011). In terms of superiority and inferiority, we evaluate characteristics
like attractiveness, intelligence, athletic ability, and so on. For example, you may judge yourself
to be more intelligent than your brother or less athletic than your best friend, and these
judgments are incorporated into your self-concept. This process of comparison and evaluation
isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it can have negative consequences if our reference group isn't
appropriate.

    Reference groups are the groups we use for social comparison, and they typically change
based on what we are evaluating. In terms of athletic ability, many people choose unreasonable
reference groups with which to engage in social comparison. If a man wants to get into better
shape and starts an exercise routine, he may be discouraged by his difficulty keeping up with
the aerobics instructor or running partner and judge himself as inferior, which could negatively
affect his self-concept. Using as a reference group people who have only recently started a
fitness program but have shown progress could help maintain a more accurate and hopefully
positive self-concept.

    We also engage in social comparison based on similarity and difference. Since self-concept
is context specific, similarity may be desirable in some situations and difference more desirable

                                                                                                               SELF AND IDENTITY | 221
in others. Factors like age and personality may influence whether or not we want to fit in or
stand out. Although we compare ourselves to others throughout our lives, adolescent and teen
years usually bring new pressure to be similar to or different from particular reference groups.
Think of all the cliques in high school and how people voluntarily and involuntarily broke off
into groups based on popularity, interest, culture, or grade level. Some kids in your high school
probably wanted to fit in with and be similar to other people in the marching band but be
different from the football players. Conversely, athletes were probably more apt to compare
themselves, in terms of similar athletic ability, to other athletes rather than kids in show choir.
But social comparison can be complicated by perceptual influences. As we learned earlier, we
organize information based on similarity and difference, but these patterns don't always hold
true. Even though students involved in athletics and students involved in arts may seem very
different, a dancer or singer may also be very athletic, perhaps even more so than a member
of the football team. As with other aspects of perception, there are positive and negative
consequences of social comparison.

    We generally want to know where we fall in terms of ability and performance as compared to
others, but what people do with this information and how it affects self-concept varies. Not all
people feel they need to be at the top of the list, but some won't stop until they get the high score
on the video game or set a new school record in a track-and-field event. Some people strive to
be first chair in the clarinet section of the orchestra, while another person may be content to be
second chair. The education system promotes social comparison through grades and rewards
such as honor rolls and dean's lists.

Self-Affirmation Theory

There are certain situations, however, where these common dissonance-reduction strategies
may not be realistic options to pursue. For example, if someone who has generally negative
attitudes toward drug use nevertheless becomes addicted to a particular substance, it will often
not be easy to quit the habit, to reframe the evidence regarding the drug's negative effects, or to
reduce self-awareness. In such cases, self-affirmation theory suggests that people will try to
reduce the threat to their self-concept posed by feelings of self-discrepancy by focusing on and
affirming their worth in another domain, unrelated to the issue at hand. For instance, the person
who has become addicted to an illegal substance may choose to focus on healthy eating and
exercise regimes instead as a way of reducing the dissonance created by the drug use.

  Self-Affirmation in Consumer Behaviour

      How might consumers reconcile their consumption and disposal behavior using self-
      affirmation theory? Many years ago, shortly before having my first child, I had
      planned to only use cloth diapers and not succumb to the convenience of disposable
      diapers. I romanticized about being an "ideal" parent who would make sustainable

222 | SELF AND IDENTITY
 consumer decisions throughout my life as a parent. While my intentions may have
 been honorable, they were also naive: little did I know how the first few days, weeks,
 and even months of parenting could bring on so much stress, chaos, and uncertainty
 (never mind sleep deprivation).

    Deciding to place convenience above all else, I used disposable diapers from day
 one: and while in the back of my mind I felt dissonance about this decision, I reduced
 that dissonance by toilet-training my daughter at an early age (thus ending our
 dependence on a disposable product). I also sought out other acts of sustainability
 (making baby food; buying second hand clothing) to further reduce dissonance.

Lifestyle and
Psychographics

One of the newer and increasingly important set of factors that is being used to understand
consumer behavior is lifestyle. Lifestyle has been generally defined as the activities (or
attitudes), interests, and opinions (AIOs) of the potential customer. It is widely regarded as
means to connecting products offered in the market with targeted lifestyle groups (Sathish &
Rajamohan, 2012) such that a product appeals to the AIOs of the target market. Consumers
are not only asked about products they like, where they live, and what their gender is but also
about what they do--that is, how they spend their time and what their priorities, values, opinions,
and general outlooks on the world are. Where do they go other than work? Who do they like to
talk to? What do they talk about? Researchers hired by Procter & Gamble have gone so far as
to follow women around for weeks as they shop, run errands, and socialize with one another
(Berner, 2006). Other companies have paid people to keep a daily journal of their activities and
routines.

Lifestyle Marketing

In consumer marketing, lifestyle is considered a psychological variable known to influence the
buyer decision process for consumers. Lifestyle can be broadly defined as the way a person
lives. In sociology, a lifestyle typically reflects an individual's attitudes, values, or world view. A
lifestyle is a means of forging a sense of self and to create cultural symbols that resonate with
personal identity.

    Marketing campaigns to reach and persuade consumers are created with the intention to
align the product's position with the target market's lifestyle characteristics. Variables such
as consumers' interest in hunting; their attitude toward climate change; and, their deeply held
opinion on fair-trade products, can therefore be used to both better understand the market and
its behavior, and position products effectively.

    It is the multifaceted aspect of lifestyle research that makes it so useful in consumer
analysis. A prominent lifestyle researcher, Joseph T. Plummer, summarizes the concept as
follows:

                                                                                         LIFESTYLE AND PSYCHOGRAPHICS | 225
      "...lifestyle patterns, combines the virtues of demographics with the richness and dimensionality
      of psychological characteristics....Lifestyle is used to segment the marketplace because it
      provides the broad, everyday view of consumers lifestyle segmentation and can generate
      identifiable whole persons rather than isolated fragments" (Plummer, 1974).

A useful application of the lifestyle concept relates to consumer's shopping orientation.
Different customers approach shopping in very different ways. They have different attitudes
and opinions about shopping and different levels of interest in shopping. Once people know
their alternatives, how do they evaluate and choose among them? In particular, how do people
choose among brands of a product?

Psychographic Segmentation

While demographics are useful, advertisers often need to slice and dice even further. Traditional
demographic segments (such as gender, age, and income) provide only a rough estimate of the
attitudes and desires of different groups, so marketers often give consumer groups labels that
capture something about their lifestyles and motivations as well.

    Psychographic segmentation involves profiling a market segment based on a descriptive
set of characteristics--such as personality, traits, lifestyle, and values. We also use AIO's--to
define a psychographic profile. Most students are familiar with market segmentation as it
relates to geographic (specific place-based marketing) and demographic (specific data
gathered through secondary research sources relating to age, income, education level, family
status, etc.). Psychographic segmentation however, examines consumers in the context of their
motivations, their values, their interests, their passions, their lifestyle choices, and even the kind
of media they consume.

    The following is a review of how marketers segment a market based on demographics,
    geography, behavior, and psychographic information.

          Demographic segmentation: Demographic segmentation divides the market into
             groups based on such variables as age, marital status, gender, ethnic
             background, income, occupation, and education.
             Age, for example, will be of interest to marketers who develop products for
             children, retailers who cater to teenagers, colleges and universities that recruit
             students, and assisted-living facilities that promote services among the elderly.
             W Network targets female viewers, while TeleLatino Network (TLN) networks
             targets Spanish-speaking viewers. When Mazda Canada offers recent college
             and university graduates a $400 bonus toward leasing or buying a new Mazda,
             the company's marketers are segmenting the market according to education
             level.

          Geographic segmentation: Geographic segmentation divides a market according

226 | LIFESTYLE AND PSYCHOGRAPHICS
   to such variables as climate, region, and population density (urban, suburban,
   small-town, or rural)--is also quite common. Climate is crucial for many
   products: try selling snow shovels in Hawaii or above-ground pools in the Yukon.
   Consumer tastes also vary by region. That's why McDonald's caters to regional
   preferences, offering poutine at Canadian locations, whereas in the United States
   you can get a breakfast of Spam, sausage and rice in Hawaii, lobster rolls in New
   England and country ham, biscuits and gravy in the southern states. Outside of
   North America, menus diverge even more widely. You can get a McPaneer Royale
   in India, Mozzarella Dippers in the UK, a prawn burger in Singapore and gazpacho
   in Spain.
   Likewise, differences between urban and suburban life can influence product
   selection. For example, it's a hassle to parallel park on crowded city streets.
   Thus, Toyota engineers have developed a product especially for city dwellers.
   The Japanese version of the Prius, Toyota's hybrid gas-electric car, can
   automatically parallel park itself. Using computer software and a rear-mounted
   camera, the parking system measures the spot, turns the steering wheel, and
   swings the car into the space (making the driver--who just sits there--look like a
   master of parking skills). After its success in the Japanese market, the self-
   parking feature was brought to the United States.

 Behavioural segmentation: Dividing consumers by such variables as attitude
   toward the product, user status, or usage rate is called behavioural
   segmentation. Companies selling technology-based products might segment the
   market according to different levels of receptiveness to technology. They could
   rely on a segmentation scale developed by Forrester Research that divides
   consumers into two camps: technology optimists, who embrace new technology,
   and technology pessimists, who are indifferent, anxious, or downright hostile
   when it comes to technology.
   Some companies segment consumers according to user status, distinguishing
   among nonusers, potential users, first-time users, and regular users of a product.
   Depending on the product, they can then target specific groups, such as first-time
   users. Credit-card companies use this approach when they offer frequent flyer
   miles to potential customers in order to induce them to get their card. Once they
   start using it, they'll probably be segmented according to usage. "Heavy users"
   who pay their bills on time will likely get increased credit lines.

 Psychographic segmentation: Psychographic segmentation classifies
   consumers on the basis of individual lifestyles as they're reflected in people's
   interests, activities, attitudes, and values. Do you live an active life and love the
   outdoors? If so, you may be a potential buyer of hiking or camping equipment or

                                                                              LIFESTYLE AND PSYCHOGRAPHICS | 227
apparel. If you're a risk taker, you might catch the attention of a gambling casino.
The possibilities are limited only by the imagination.

One of the most widely used systems to classify people based on psychographics is the VALS
(Values, Attitudes, and Lifestyles) framework. Using VALS to combine psychographics with
demographic information such as marital status, education level, and income provide a better
understanding of consumers.

The Newest Market Segment You Never Knew Existed: "PANKs"

Consider a relatively new market

segment, Professional Aunt, No Kids (or

"PANKs"--a term coined by Savvy Auntie

founder Melanie Notkin) discussed in a

2018 report by Melanie Notkin, founder of

SAVVY AUNTIE. Notkin's research

provides ample evidence that PANKs are

both a growing and substantial market

segment, mainly characterized by a high

disposable income with considerably        "Professional Aunt, No Kids" is considered a

of their own. Demographic and

psychographic characteristics of PANKs from the report include:

      In the US, there are 18.4 million PANKs aged 20-50 (roughly equals more than a
        quarter of all American women in that age group)

      Four in five PANKs are aged 33-52; half are 38-47 years of age
      Significant social and economic influence
      Close relationships with children of friends and/or relatives
      More likely to be college educated (74 per cent); 3 times as likely to have

        earned a master's degree
      47 per cent of PANKs own their own home
      Affluent and generous gift-givers (collectively spend $61 billion on children in

        their lives, a figure that excludes occasional items and newborn gifts)
      63 per cent have contributed to a niece's or nephew's education

   What are PANKs spending money on? Travel is by far the biggest expense,
followed by food and beverage, entertainment, toys and games, and apparel.

228 | LIFESTYLE AND PSYCHOGRAPHICS
 "Adventure" days and big-ticket gifts also amount to large expenditures by loving
 Aunts.

    Notkin segments PANKs further by identifying, "Aunts by Relations" (93 per cent)
 and "Aunts by Choice" (57 per cent), all of whom rank participation in a child's life of
 high importance. In 2013, Euromonitor reported that as of 2010, 42.6 per cent of
 women in the U.S. between 15-44 were childless (up from 40.1 per cent in 2002):
 while some women are childless by circumstance, many women are holding off
 having children (or choosing not to at all) until later in life.

    Marketers yet to heed Notkin's advice and actively target PANKs are potentially
 ignoring this large and growing market segment. Her recommendations on how to
 engage this market includes:

       Recognizing the value of "Generation PANK" as influential women in children's
         lives

       While they may be secondary caregivers, PANKs are often the primary gift-
         givers

       Education is a priority for PANKs: these highly educated women are also
         contributing to their loved one's future educational needs

       Most PANKs want to be moms one day
    A wise marketer will recognize both the value and potential in a growing and
 substantial market segment, even one that may be dismissed, ignored, or not taken
 seriously by others.

230 | LIFESTYLE AND PSYCHOGRAPHICS
Branding

A brand consists of any name, term, design, style, words, symbols or any other feature that
distinguishes the goods and services of one seller from another. A brand also distinguishes
one product from another in the eyes of the customer. All of its elements (i.e., logo, color,
shape, letters, images) work as a psychological trigger or stimulus that causes an association
to all other thoughts we have about this brand. Jingles, celebrities, and catchphrases are also
oftentimes considered brands.

    The word "brand" is derived from the Old Norse `brand' meaning "to burn," which refers to
the practice of producers burning their mark (or brand) onto their products. Italians are
considered among the first to use brands in the form of watermarks on paper in the 1200s.
However, in mass-marketing, this concept originated in the 19th century with the introduction
of packaged goods.

    During the Industrial Revolution, the production of many household items, such as soap,
was moved from local communities to centralized factories to be mass-produced and sold to
the wider market. When shipping their items, factories branded their logo or insignia on the
barrels used, thereby extending the meaning of "brand" to that of trademark. This enabled the
packaged goods manufacturers to communicate that their products should be trusted as
much as local competitors. Campbell's Soup, Coca-Cola, Juicy Fruit gum, Aunt Jemima, and
Quaker Oats were among the first products to be "branded."

The Coca-Cola logo is an example of a
widely-recognized trademark and global brand.

                                               BRANDING | 231
Branding is crucial to the success of any tangible product. In consumer markets, branding can
influence whether consumers will buy the product. Branding can also help in the development
of a new product by facilitating the extension of a product line or mix, through building on the
consumer's perceptions of the values and character represented by the brand name.

                                   An elegant diamond engagement ring packaged in
                                   a "robin's egg" blue box is representative of a
                                   well-known luxurious jewellery brand retailer.

The goal when developing a brand is to create value. You do that by emulating the
characteristics and values that your customers desire. Branding is present throughout
everything your organization touches--it is not just a logo. Every design shown and
communication made to the consumer are examples of branding.

Branding Attributes

Brands have intrinsic and extrinsic attributes. Intrinsic attributes refer to functional
characteristics of the brand: its shape, performance, and physical capacity (e.g. Gillette razors
shave unwanted hair and are able to do so more closely than most products in their product
class because of their curved shape). Should any of these attributes be changed, they will not
function in the same way or be the same product.

    Examples of extrinsic attributes are features like the price of the Gillette razors, their
packaging, the Gillette brand name, and mechanisms that enable consumers to form
associations that give meaning to the brand. For example, it can appear more desirable
because David Beckham, who is a brand himself, advertises it.

    Some refer to a brand's function as the creation and communication of a multidimensional
character of a product--one that is not easily copied and damaged by competitors' efforts.

    Brands have different elements, namely brand personality (functional abilities), brand skill
(its fundamental traits--e.g. Chanel No 5 is seen as sexy) and brand relationships (with buyers)
or brand magic. These elements are what give the brand added value.

    Marketing and advertising are about selling your products and services. Branding is about
selling everything associated with your organization . The consumer perception of brands
is brand knowledge: brand awareness, recognition and recall, and brand image denote how

232 | BRANDING
consumers perceive a brand based on quality and attitudes towards it and what stays in their
memory.

Successful Brand Strategies

A successful brand can create and sustain a strong, positive, and lasting impression in the
mind of a consumer. Brands provide external cues to taste, design, performance, quality, value,
and prestige if they are developed and managed properly. Brands convey positive or negative
messages about a product, along with indicating the company or service to the consumer,
which is a direct result of past advertising, promotion, and product reputation.

    According to brand experts, marketers should be paying attention to the associations
consumers develop in connection to a brand. Brand associations are considered to be anything
(e.g., sounds, smells, words, and images) that can be linked to a brand and is held in memory by
consumers. Brand associations can be positive or negative depending on a consumer's direct
experiences or impressions of a brand. Low and Lamb Jr (2000) tell us that brand associations
are critical for marketers because they help establish differentiation, market position, and brand
strategies including product line extensions. A successful organization also recognizes that
brand associations are made at each point of contact: customer service calls; greetings from
a receptionist; conversations with a sales person. Each of these touch points leaves a lasting
impression on a consumer and can be held in memory for a long time. For that reason, an
organization's brand strategy should consider the impact employees at all levels will have on
brand associations.

    Learn more about how attributes, benefits, values, culture, personality, and the user all
factored into a brand strategy. The example below has been designed for automobile brand,
Mercedes Benz: how might you apply a different brand to these 6 factors?

                Six Levels of Meaning in a Brand Strategy

          Attributes: A brand's set of attributes communicates to its audience how the
             brand should be perceived and positioned.
             The Mercedes-Benz brand, for example, suggests expensive, well-built, well-
             engineered, durable, high-prestige automobiles.

          Benefits: A brand's set of attributes must be translated into both functional and
             emotional benefits for the consumer.
             For some drivers, purchasing a Mercedes gives them a personal sense of success,
             accomplishment, and pride.

          Values: Consumers seek brands with attributes that align with their own set of
             personal values.
             Mercedes stands for high performance, safety, and prestige.

                                                                                                                           BRANDING | 233
          Culture: A set of brand attributes can communicate and represent a broader set
             of cultural characteristics that are meaningful to consumers.
             Mercedes represents German culture and thereby represents cultural
             characteristics of organization, efficiency, and high quality.

          Personality: Over time, a brand can project its own distinguishable kind of
             personality. Some brands may be "quirky" or "casual," "edgy" or "intense".
             Mercedes' personality may be described as sophisticated, serious, buttoned-up,
             and achievement-oriented.

          User: Every brand is designed with a particular type of user in mind: through its
             various attributes, a brand suggests who that user might be and what makes
             them attracted to the brand.
             A Mercedes-Benz driver strives to be taken seriously in everything they do. They
             approach their work with a growth-mentality and are committed to being
             successful, hard-working, and results-oriented.

Benefits of a Brand

A brand is the personality that identifies a product, service or company (name, term, sign,
symbol, design, or combination thereof); it also represents a relationship to key constituencies:
customers, staff, partners, investors etc. Proper branding can yield higher product sales, and
higher sales of products associated with the brand (or brand association). For example, a
customer who loves Pillsbury biscuits (and trusts the brand) is more likely to try other products
the company offers, such as chocolate chip cookies.

  Why Be Generic When You Can Be Branded?

      Consumers may view branding as an aspect of products or services, as it often
      serves to denote certain attractive qualities or characteristics. From the perspective
      of brand owners, branded products or services also command higher prices. Where
      two products resemble each other, but one of the products has no associated
      branding (such as a generic, store-branded product), people may often select the
      more expensive branded product on the basis of the quality or reputation of the
      brand or brand owner. Benefits of good brand recognition include facilitating of new
      product acceptance, enabling market share penetration by advertising, and resisting
      price erosion.

Some people distinguish the psychological aspect of brand associations (e.g., thoughts,
feelings, perceptions, images, experiences, beliefs, attitudes, etc.) that become tied to the

234 | BRANDING
brand from the experiential aspect--the sum of all points of contact with the brand, otherwise

known as brand experience. Brand experience is a brand's action perceived by a person.

The psychological aspect, sometimes referred to as the brand image, is a symbolic construct

created within the minds of people, consisting of all the information and expectations

associated with a product, service, or company providing them .

Effective branding of a product also enables the consumer

to easily identify the product because the features and

benefits have been communicated effectively. This will

increase the probability that the product will be accessible

and therefore purchased and consumed. Dunkin' Donuts

(rebranded now as just, "Dunkin'"), for example, is a brand that

has an established logo and imagery that is familiar to most

consumers. The vivid colors and image of a DD cup are

easily recognized and distinguished from competitors.

Branding helps create loyalty, decreases the risk of losing

market share to the competition by establishing a differential

advantage, and allow premium pricing that is acceptable by

the consumer because of the perceived value of the brand.

Good branding also allows for effective targeting and

positioning. For example, Adidas is a brand known its

athletic and fashionable clothing, sporting equipment, and The Adidas logo is widely

footwear. Adidas has a global brand community due to its recognized around the world for
                                                                  sports apparel, clothing, and
established global branding that communicates value.              footwear.

Brand Loyalty

In marketing, brand loyalty refers to a consumer's commitment to repurchase or otherwise
continue using a particular brand by repeatedly buying a product or service. The American
Marketing Association ("AMA") defines brand loyalty as: "[t]he situation in which a consumer
generally buys the same manufacturer-originated product or service repeatedly over time rather
than buying from multiple suppliers within the category" (MBN, n.d.). This is expressed as
a form of "habit-buying" where consumers purchase the same brand due to a "lack of
dissatisfaction" (MBN, n.d.). Brand loyalty, however, is not just a form of habit-buying, but also
the result of the relationship consumers build with a brand resulting in repeat and dedicated
purchases that provide a deeper sense of personal fulfillment and satisfaction.

    Aside from a consumer's willingness or even desire to repurchase a brand, true brand loyalty
exists when a consumer is committed to the brand, and when a consumer has a high relative
attitude toward the brand, which is then exhibited through repurchase behavior. For example,
if Micah has brand loyalty to Company A, they will purchase Company A's products even if
Company B's products are cheaper and/or of a higher quality.

    Brand loyalty is viewed as a multidimensional construct, determined by several distinct

                                                                  BRANDING | 235
psychological processes, such as the customers' perceived value, brand trust, satisfaction,
repeat purchase behavior, and commitment. Commitment and repeat purchase behavior are
considered as necessary conditions for brand loyalty, followed by perceived value, satisfaction,
and brand trust.

    Philip Kotler (2016) defines four customer-types that exhibit similar patterns of behavior:

   Hardcore Loyals, who buy the brand all the time;
   Split Loyals, loyal to two or three brands;
   Shifting Loyals, moving from one brand to another;
   Switchers, with no loyalty (possibly "deal-prone," constantly looking for bargains, or "vanity

      prone," looking for something different).

The benefits of brand loyalty are longer tenure (or staying a customer for longer), and lower
sensitivity to price. Recent research found evidence that longer-term customers were indeed
less sensitive to price increases. According to Andrew Ehrenberg, consumers buy "portfolios
of brands." They switch regularly between brands, often because they simply want a change.
Thus, "brand penetration" or "brand share" reflects only a statistical chance that the majority of
customers will buy that brand next time as part of a portfolio of brands. It does not guarantee
that they will stay loyal.

    By creating promotions and loyalty programs that encourage the consumer to take some
sort of action, companies are building brand loyalty by offering more than just an
advertisement. Offering incentives like big prizes creates an environment in which customers
see the advertiser as more than just the advertiser. Individuals are far more likely to come back
to a company that uses interesting promotions or loyalty programs than a company with a
static message of "buy our brand because we're the best."

Brand-Self Congruity

Self-congruity is "the likeliness of comparing oneself with other objects and stimuli" (Liu et al.,
2012, p. 923). It has been widely adopted in brand-related research to help both researchers
and practitioners understand brand purchasing behavior (see Sirgy, 1986; Sirgy et al., 1997; and
Christodoulides and Veloutsou, 2009). Researchers have found that self-congruity has a great
impact on consumers' brand loyalty and positive brand attitude in the context of luxury fashion
brand (Liu et al., 2012)

    Three important brand self-congruity concepts by brand attributes:

 1. Brand Personality Congruity; the likeliness of a consumer's perception of a brand's
      personality compared to that of their own personality.

 2. Brand User Imagery Congruity; the likeliness of a typical user of a brand, as perceived by a
      consumer, and the consumer themselves (Sirgy et al., 1997).

236 | BRANDING
 3. Brand Usage Imagery Congruity. The likeliness of between the typical use of a brand and
      the appropriate situation of using the brand. Liu et al. (2012) provided a great example of
      this: A Channel bag may be perceived appropriate for a formal function (e.g., attending a
      gala) but not for an everyday use.

It is important to note that when it comes to self-congruity, consumers always evaluate based
on their own perceptions--their own perceptions toward the brand usage, the brand image, their
own image, their own personality, etc.

Ideal- vs. Actual-Self Congruence

Consumers may seek self-congruence(congruity) between the brand or product and their
different selves as well. Ideal-self congruence occurs when a consumer seeks the alignment
between their ideal-self (i.e., An idealized version of one's self) and the brand image, or user
imagery. This is often seen during a passage-of-rite. For example, when a newly graduate
aspires to style themselves with brands and outfits that would portrait them as capable,
experienced, and professional (i.e., their ideal social self-image).

                      "Are you Beach Body Ready" Brands attracts consumers by driving the
                      ideal self-congruity.

Actual-self congruence occurs when a consumer pursues the alignment between their actual-
self (i.e., their evaluation of their current self) and the brand image or user imagery. While both
types of congruence motivate consumers, when it comes to fashion ideal-self congruence is a
stronger predictor of status consumption (Kaur and Anand, 2021). Yet it is important to note
that- both types of congruence can influence a consumer at the same time, and they are not
mutually exclusive. For example, a person may be aspired to put on suits to be closer to their

                                                                                                                           BRANDING | 237
ideal-self, but may choose a color that they feel safer to wear and is consistent with their actual-
self.

     Body positivity by ModCloth, aiming to attract consumers with actual self-congruity

Branding doesn't come without controversy. While some brands may prefer to "play it safe,"
other brands recognize the importance of standing up for what is good and humane in the
world. Nike chose to make its views and values very public when the brand aligned itself with
American Civil rights Activist and football quarterback, Colin Kaepernick. Explore the branding
implications of this endorsement more in the student op-ed below.

  Student Op-Ed: Nike's Endorsement of Colin Kaepernick

      Nike is a brand recognized globally. The company is a cultural phenomenon and has
      made a big impact on sports and athletic wear. The Nike "swoosh" can be seen in
      every major league sport. And because of its enormous worldwide influence, being
      chosen to represent the brand is a call that every athlete hopes to receive.

         In 2016, Colin Kaepernick, who was at the time the quarterback for the San
      Francisco 49ers, refused to stand for the American national anthem in protest of
      racial discrimination in America (Mathers, 2019). This led to many other high-profile
      athletes kneeling during the American national anthem, and eventually high school
      students began to as well.

         Controversy followed Kaepernick as the NFL began to voice their disapproval of his
      stance. US President Donald Trump himself took to Twitter to reprimand athletes
      who did not want to stand during the national anthem. Kaepernick continued to
      protest for the rest of the season and was criticized by fans and NFL sponsors alike.
      Though a competent and admired player, in 2017 he was not signed to play for the
      following season.

238 | BRANDING
    In 2018, Nike signed Kaepernick to be the face of its newest, "Just Do It"
 campaign. This was met with significant backlash and many opposing consumers
 took to the internet to show videos of them defacing their Nike apparel. Despite
 some consumer backlash, Nike's stocks went up 5 per cent after signing Kaepernick
 and their online revenue was up by 31 per cent (Kelleher, 2018).

    Undoubtedly Nike took a risk by signing Kaepernick: they knew this endorsement
 deal with alienate a portion of their consumer market. What Nike also knew was that
 this decision would benefit them far more in the long-run by associating the brand
 with an influential public sports figure like Coin Kaepernick.

Chapter Reflections

 1. Find an example of a brand actively targeting the "PANKs" market segment. What features
      exist in this brand's marketing (e.g. commercials, ads, imagery, messaging) indicate that
      this target market consists of professional women without children of their own?

 2. Consider how Dove's video titled "Crown" (featuring Kelly Rowland), shares with us how
      young girls' self-concept is shaped by their physical characteristics--in this case,
      specifically their hair.

 3. Breaking through the media mediocrity that all too often depicts women as subjects of
      sexual desire or commanders of a busy household, JP Morgan delivers a highly-
      contextualized ad that centres tennis champion, equality advocate, business mogul, and
      mom, Serena Williams, that depicts high degrees of self-complexity. Discuss this video in
      the context of "the self" and the message it is sending to the audience.

 4. What does it say about our culture and society when the commercials like the one created
      for Lane Bryant was refused airing on a major network television channel because it was
      deemed "unfit and inappropriate" and had failed to comply with "decency guidelines"?
      Would this be the the case if the models were equally as gorgeous but not plus-sized?
      What connections can we make between this advertisement and what we understand
      about self-esteem?

 5. Car company "Buick" has created a series of advertisements that depict the ongoing
      tension and interaction among our ego, id, and superego. Watch some of these
      commercials and discuss how these Freudian concepts are represented.

 6. In 2019, Peloton released a commercial featuring "Grace from Boston" that proceeded to
      fire up much debate on social media channels. What do experts in psychological science
      have to say about sex roles? Explore this Psychology Today analysis of sex roles in
      advertising and discuss other related themes (e.g. self-esteem) we discuss in consumer
      behavior.

 7. Using Erik Erikson's Psychological Stages of Development, find examples of marketing
      strategies (products and promotions) that align to the different stages.

 8. This chapters explores ideas related to self concept, self esteem, real & ideal selves, and

                                                                                                         CHAPTER REFLECTIONS | 241
      the looking glass self. Each of these impact our decisions as consumers since we are so
      often looking to purchase items that fulfill our sense of "self" and shape our own self
      concept. With that in mind, consider how DOVE engages in advertising that speaks to
      these self-concept terms. What is DOVE's intention in focusing its marketing messages
      on self-concept instead of say, product attributes?

Key Terms and Concepts

          ABCs of Attitudes: The three components to an attitude are, A=Affect (how we
             feel about something); B=Behavior (how we act towards something); and
             C=Cognition (what we think about something).

          Attitudes: The positive or negative, long-lasting evaluations we have regarding
             people and things.

          Balance theory: Fritz Heider's Balance Theory is a framework that can predict
             attitude and behavioral change. In marketing, this framework demonstrates the
             importance of consistency (balance) within the triad, and how consumers will
             seek to harmonize their values, beliefs, and perceptions when they experience
             cognitive inconsistencies.

          Central route to persuasion: This aspect of the Elaboration Likelihood Model
             identifies that messages requiring extensive mental processing are more likely to
             result in long-term attitude changes, especially with an audience who is
             motivated and highly involved with the subject/topic.

          Cognitive dissonance: A type of cognitive inconsistency, this term describes the
             discomfort consumers may feel when their beliefs, values, attitudes, or
             perceptions are inconsistent or contradictory to their original belief or
             understanding. Consumers with cognitive dissonance related to a purchasing
             decision will often seek to resolve this internal turmoil they are experiencing by
             returning the product or finding a way to justify it and minimizing their sense of
             buyer's remorse.

          Descriptive norms: While norms give us a sense of how we might behave in
             accordance with society, descriptive norms refer to our perception of how people
             actually behave.

          Elaboration likelihood model: This models examines two different ways
             persuasion can be achieved (central route; peripheral route) depending on how
             motivated the audience is by the message and how much thinking (mental

                                                                                                   KEY TERMS AND CONCEPTS | 245
             processing) needs to be done with respect to the contents of the message.

          Halo effect: When we experience one positive trait about a person we may
             assume other positive features or traits as well.

          Match-up hypothesis: The degree to which a source and a brand are objectively
             perceived as a "good match" because the source's image and the brand's
             position are a good fit and logically aligned.

          Multi-attribute attitude model: This model provides a framework that can be
             used to measure consumers' attitudes towards specific products or services.
             The model identifies how consumer attitudes are informed by measuring and
             evaluating the attitudes of a product; the beliefs about those attributes; and the
             relative importance we give those attributes.

          Norms: Norms can be considered unspoken rules that members of a society
             follow because they represent what is good and/or right and they inform us on
             how we should behave.

          Peripheral route to persuasion: This aspect of the Elaboration Likelihood Model
             identifies that messages requiring minimal mental processing result in short-
             term attitude changes, especially with an audience who is not motivated and has
             low involvement with the subject/topic.

          Persuasion: In marketing, persuasion is seen a process of creating messages
             that will change the beliefs, attitudes, and/or behaviors of a target audience (e.g.
             consumers).

          Principle of attitude consistency: This theory comes into effect when there is
             strong alignment among the ABC's of attitude: the relationship between what we
             feel (A), think (C), and how we act (B) are consistent and in close relation to one
             another.

          Self-determination theory: This theory examines how our motivations and
             personality (internalized factors) inform our attitudes and behavior in the
             absence of external influences (e.g. subjective norms, which contrasts the theory
             of planned behavior).

          Social norms: Accepted informal group rules and standards that guide our
             behavior. Social norms generalize the accepted way of thinking, feeling, and
             behaving in a way that our groups support.

          Source: In marketing, the source is often depicted as a spokesperson or
             representative of a brand or company and responsible for communicating
             messages about the brand to consumers.

          Source attractiveness: The perceived social value of the source.

246 | KEY TERMS AND CONCEPTS
 Source credibility: The perceived objectivity and trustworthiness of a source.
 Star power: This term speaks to the influence celebrities (and other types of

   famous people, such as athletes) have on our consumer decision making. A
   brand that is promoted and represented by a well-known (and adored celebrity),
   consumers who have a positive attitude towards that celebrity are more likely to
   believe in the brand as well.
 Subjective norms: The belief that you have the support and approval of the
   people important to you to carry out an action or behave in a particular way.
 Theory of planned behavior: This theory suggests that our deep beliefs and
   values play a pivotal role in creating our attitudes and predicting our behavior.
   When we combine a strong attitude with subjective norms and with our belief
   that we can perform a particular behavior, these three things will predict our
   actual behavior.
 Warm-glow effect: The personal satisfaction we feel in engaging in "good acts"
   that help others. This effect may explain why some people behave altruistically
   (in charity of others) but it fails to capture the extent of the impact our actions
   have on others (e.g. whether or not our actions are meaningful and long-lasting).
   For this reason, warm-glow may be described as a sort of "selfish pleasure."

                                                                                       KEY TERMS AND CONCEPTS | 247
248 | KEY TERMS AND CONCEPTS
Understanding Attitudes

Although we might use the term in a different way in our everyday life (e.g., "Hey, he's really got
an attitude!"), social psychologists reserve the term attitude to refer to our relatively enduring
evaluation of something, where the something is called the attitude object. The attitude object
might be a person, a product, or a social group (Albarracn, Johnson, & Zanna, 2005; Wood,
2000).

    When we say that attitudes are evaluations, we mean that they involve a preference for or
against the attitude object, as commonly expressed in terms such as prefer, like, dislike, hate,
and love. When we express our attitudes--for instance, when we say, "I like swimming," "I hate
snakes," or "I love my parents" --we are expressing the relationship (either positive or negative)
between the self and an attitude object. Statements such as these make it clear that attitudes
are an important part of the self-concept.

    Every human being holds thousands of attitudes, including those about family and friends,
political figures, abortion rights, terrorism, preferences for music, and much more. Each of our
attitudes has its own unique characteristics, and no two attitudes come to us or influence us in
quite the same way. Research has found that some of our attitudes are inherited, at least in part,
via genetic transmission from our parents (Olson, Vernon, Harris, & Jang, 2001). Other attitudes
are learned mostly through direct and indirect experiences with the attitude objects (De Houwer,
Thomas, & Baeyens, 2001). We may like to ride roller coasters in part because our genetic
code has given us a thrill-loving personality and in part because we've had some really great
times on roller coasters in the past. Still other attitudes are learned via the media (Hargreaves
& Tiggemann, 2003; Levina, Waldo, & Fitzgerald, 2000) or through our interactions with friends
(Poteat, 2007). Some of our attitudes are shared by others (most of us like sugar, fear snakes,
and are disgusted by cockroaches), whereas other attitudes--such as our preferences for
different styles of music or art--are more individualized.

The Purpose of Attitudes

Human beings hold attitudes because they are useful. Particularly, our attitudes enable us to
determine, often very quickly and effortlessly, which behaviours to engage in, which people to
approach or avoid, and even which products to buy (Duckworth, Bargh, Garcia, & Chaiken, 2002;

                                                                                                 UNDERSTANDING ATTITUDES | 249
Maio & Olson, 2000). You can imagine that making quick decisions about what to avoid or
approach has had substantial value in our evolutionary experience.

    For example:

   Snake = bad  run away
   Blueberries = good  eat

Attitudes are important because they frequently (but not always) predict behavior. If we know
that a person has a more positive attitude toward Frosted Flakes than toward Cheerios, then
we will naturally predict that they will buy more of the former when they get to the market.
If we know that Amara is madly in love with Leila, then we will not be surprised when she
proposes marriage. Because attitudes often predict behavior, people who wish to change
behavior frequently try to change attitudes through the use of persuasive communications.

  Shifting Consumers' Attitudes

      A few years ago, KFC began running ads to the effect that fried chicken was healthy
      -- until the U.S. Federal Trade Commission told the company to stop. Wendy's slogan
      that its products are "way better than fast food" is another example. Fast food has a
      negative connotation, so Wendy's is trying to get consumers to think about its
      offerings as being better.

         An example of a shift in consumers' attitudes occurred when the taxpayer-paid
      government bailouts of big banks that began in 2008 provoked the wrath of
      Americans, creating an opportunity for small banks not involved in the credit bailout
      and subprime mortgage mess. The Worthington National Bank, a small bank in Fort
      Worth, Texas, ran billboards reading: "Did Your Bank Take a Bailout? We didn't."
      Another read: "Just Say NO to Bailout Banks. Bank Responsibly!" The Worthington
      Bank received tens of millions in new deposits soon after running these campaigns
      (Mantone, 2009).

The ABC's of Attitudes

Our attitudes are made up of cognitive, affective, and behavioral components. Consider an
environmentalist's attitude toward recycling, which is probably very positive:

   In terms of affect: They feel happy when they recycle.
   In terms of behavior: They regularly recycle their bottles and cans.
   In terms of cognition: They believe recycling is the responsible thing to do.

250 | UNDERSTANDING ATTITUDES
The image below shows how a person's positive attitude towards composting would be
comprised of a strong alignment among their feelings towards composting ("affect"), their
actions when it comes to composting ("behavior"), and their thoughts about composting
("knowledge").

     An overall positive attitude towards composting is supported by the alignment of our feelings,
     our behaviors, and our thoughts about composting. The ABC's together form the "DNA" of an
     attitude.

Affect, behavior, and cognition can be defined as follows:

                             The ABC's of Attitudes

          Affect: Our feelings and emotions that help us express how we feel about a
             person/event/object

          Behavior: What we intend to do or how we intent to act regarding the person/
             event/object

          Cognition: Our thoughts are beliefs about a person/event/object

Response Hierarchies: Which Comes First?

Although most attitudes are determined by affect, behavior, and cognition, there is nevertheless
variability in this regard across people and across attitudes. Some attitudes are more likely

                                                                                                 UNDERSTANDING ATTITUDES | 251
to be based on feelings, some are more likely to be based on behaviors, and some are more
likely to be based on beliefs. For example, your attitude toward chocolate ice cream is probably
determined in large part by affect--although you can describe its taste, mostly you may just
like it. Your attitude toward your toothbrush, on the other hand, is probably more cognitive
(you understand the importance of its function). Still other of your attitudes may be based more
on behavior. For example, your attitude toward note-taking during lectures probably depends, at
least in part, on whether or not you regularly take notes.

    Thinking, feeling, and doing can happen in any order. Psychologists originally assumed that
we form attitudes through a fixed sequence of these three components: We first think about the
object, then evaluate our feelings about it, and finally take action:

                                      Cognition  Affect  Behavior [C-A-B].
    Research, however, shows that we form attitudes in different sequences based on different
circumstances. If we're not very involved in or don't care much about a purchase, we may just
buy a product on impulse or because we remember a catchphrase about it instead of carefully
evaluating it in relation to other products. In that case, action precedes feeling and thought:

                                      Behavior  Affect  Cognition [B-A-C].
    Conversely, feelings -- rather than thoughts -- may drive the entire decision process; our
emotional reactions may drive us to buy a product simply because we like its name, its
packaging design, or the brand image that ads create. In this case, we see the product, have a
feeling about it, and buy it:

                                      Affect  Behavior  Cognition [A-B-C].

      Involvement Levels and their Response Hierarchies

           Table that lists involvement levels and respective examples

Involvement Level  Example                             Response Hierarchy

High               Vacation, wedding dress, new car C--A--B

Low                Car wash, tin foil, toilet cleaner  B--A--C

(Impulse)          Face mask, candles, computer        A--B--C
                   games

Although most attitudes are determined by affect, behavior, and cognition, there is nevertheless
variability in this regard across people and across attitudes. Some attitudes are more likely
to be based on feelings, some are more likely to be based on behaviors, and some are more
likely to be based on beliefs. For example, your attitude toward chocolate ice cream is probably
determined in large part by affect--although you can describe its taste, mostly you may just
like it. Your attitude toward your toothbrush, on the other hand, is probably more cognitive (you
understand the importance of its function). Still other of your attitudes may be based more on

252 | UNDERSTANDING ATTITUDES
behavior. For example, your attitude toward note-taking during lectures probably depends, at
least in part, on whether or not you regularly take notes.

    Different people may hold attitudes toward the same attitude object for different reasons.
For example, some people vote for politicians because they like their policies, whereas others
vote for (or against) politicians because they just like (or dislike) their public persona. Although
you might think that cognition would be more important in this regard, political scientists have
shown that many voting decisions are made primarily on the basis of affect. Indeed, it is fair
to say that the affective component of attitudes is generally the strongest and most important
(Abelson, Kinder, Peters, & Fiske, 1981; Stangor, Sullivan, & Ford, 1991).

  Not All Attitudes Are The Same

      Attitudes are also stronger when the ABCs of affect, behavior, and cognition all align.
      As an example, many people's attitude toward their own nation is universally positive.
      They have strong positive feelings about their country, many positive thoughts about
      it, and tend to engage in behaviors that support it. The same extends to products that
      are made in our home countries: consumers tend to have a more positive attitude
      towards items that are "made local" and as a result may be more likely to purchase
      them over others.

         Other attitudes are less strong because the affective, cognitive, and behavioral
      components are each somewhat different (Thompson, Zanna & Griffin, 1995). Your
      cognitions toward physical exercise may be positive -- you believe that regular
      physical activity is good for your health. On the other hand, your affect may be
      negative -- you may resist exercising because you prefer to engage in tasks that
      provide more immediate rewards. Consequently, you may not exercise as often as
      you believe you ought to. These inconsistencies among the components of your
      attitude make it less strong than it would be if all the components lined up together.

         Consider making a list of where your consumer-based attitude alignment is strong
      (affect, behavior, and cognition all align) and where your attitude may be inconsistent
      among the ABC's (e.g. affect may be low but cognition is strong).

The Principle of Attitude Consistency

The Principle of attitude consistency (that for any given attitude object, the ABCs of affect,
behavior, and cognition are normally in line with each other) thus predicts that our attitudes (for
instance, as measured via a self-report measure) are likely to guide behaviour. Supporting this
idea, meta-analyses have found that there is a significant and substantial positive correlation
among the different components of attitudes, and that attitudes expressed on self-report
measures do predict behavior (Glasman & Albarracn, 2006).

                                                                                                 UNDERSTANDING ATTITUDES | 253
    Looking at this through the consumer behavior lens, we can use this principle to identify that
if a consumer feels strongly about sustainability in the production, consumption, and disposal
of consumer products, that they will act accordingly: they will buy sustainably produced
products then consume (and dispose of) them in a way that minimizes their negative impact to
land, water, and air.

Normative Influences

Norms can have a powerful influence on consumer attitudes & behavior. Norms define how
to behave in accordance with what a society has defined as good, right, and important, and
most members of the society adhere to them. Formal norms are established, written rules. They
are behaviors worked out and agreed upon in order to suit and serve the most people. Laws
are formal norms, but so are employee manuals, college entrance exam requirements, and "no
running" signs at swimming pools. Formal norms are the most specific and clearly stated of
the various types of norms, and they are the most strictly enforced. But even formal norms are
enforced to varying degrees and are reflected in cultural values.

    For example, money is highly valued in Canada, so monetary crimes are punished. It's
against the law to rob a bank, and banks go to great lengths to prevent such crimes. People
safeguard valuable possessions and install anti-theft devices to protect homes and cars. A
less strictly enforced social norm is speeding when driving. While it's against the law to speed,
driving above the speed limit or with the "flow" of traffic is common practice. And though there
are laws to speeding, there are a range of enforcement in formal norms.

    There are plenty of formal norms, but the list of informal norms -- casual behaviors that are
generally and widely conformed to -- is longer. People learn informal norms by observation,
imitation, and general socialization. Some informal norms are taught directly -- "Kiss your Aunt
Edna" or "Use your napkin" -- while others are learned by observation, including observations of
the consequences when someone else violates a norm.

    Cialdini & Trost (1998) defined social norms as accepted group rules and standards that
guide our behavior without the force of law. We can also think of norms as representing what
we ought to do or the correct thing to do. They are the accepted way of thinking, feeling
and behaving that the group supports. I think for most of us social norms become the most
obvious when someone violates them. Have you ever been somewhere and thought, "I can't
believe that person is doing that! Don't they know that isn't appropriate."? There are many rules
for appropriate behavior in public spaces. Often the groups we belong to and that we value,
socialize us early on what is expected and acceptable ways of thinking and behaving. It is
typically only through violation of norms that we are aware of their existence.

    Subjective norms refer to the degree of social pressure an individual feels regarding the
performance or non-performance of a specific behavior (Ajzen, 1988). Subjective norms are
influenced by ones' perception of the beliefs based on parents, friends, partners, acquaintances
and colleagues. This plays a significant factor in how people are influenced in the way they
perceive behavior and views.

254 | UNDERSTANDING ATTITUDES
    Descriptive norms are defined as, "the perception of what most people do in a given
situation" (Burger, 2021). Most of us, most of the time, are motivated to do the right thing. If
society deems that we put litter in a proper container, speak softly in libraries, and tip our waiter,
then that's what most of us will do. But sometimes it's not clear what society expects of us. In
these situations, we often rely on descriptive norms (Cialdini, Reno, & Kallgren, 1990).

    Researchers have demonstrated the power of descriptive norms in a number of areas.
Homeowners reduced the amount of energy they used when they learned that they were
consuming more energy than their neighbors (Schultz, Nolan, Cialdini, Goldstein, & Griskevicius,
2007). Undergraduates selected the healthy food option when led to believe that other students
had made this choice (Burger et al., 2010). Hotel guests were more likely to reuse their towels
when a hanger in the bathroom told them that this is what most guests did (Goldstein, Cialdini,
& Griskevicius, 2008). And more people began using the stairs instead of the elevator when
informed that the vast majority of people took the stairs to go up one or two floors (Burger &
Shelton, 2011).

  How Descriptive Norms Mislead Us

      It's not always easy to obtain good descriptive norm information, which means we
      sometimes rely on a flawed notion of the norm when deciding how we should
      behave. A good example of how misperceived norms can lead to problems is found
      in research on binge drinking among college students. Excessive drinking is a
      serious problem on many campuses (Mita, 2009). There are many reasons why
      students binge drink, but one of the most important is their perception of the
      descriptive norm. How much students drink is highly correlated with how much they
      believe the average student drinks (Neighbors, Lee, Lewis, Fossos, & Larimer, 2007).

         Unfortunately, students aren't always very good at making this assessment. They
      notice the boisterous heavy drinker at the party but fail to consider all the students
      not attending the party. As a result, students typically overestimate the descriptive
      norm for college student drinking (Borsari & Carey, 2003; Perkins, Haines, & Rice,
      2005). Most students believe they consume significantly less alcohol than the norm,
      a miscalculation that creates a dangerous push toward more and more excessive
      alcohol consumption. On the positive side, providing students with accurate
      information about drinking norms has been found to reduce overindulgent drinking
      (Burger, LaSalvia, Hendricks, Mehdipour, & Neudeck, 2011; Neighbors, Lee, Lewis,
      Fossos, & Walter, 2009).

                                                                                                 UNDERSTANDING ATTITUDES | 255
The Theory of Planned Behavior

Our attitudes are not the only factor that influence our decision to act. The theory of planned
behavior, developed by Martin Fishbein and Izek Ajzen (Ajzen, 1991; Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975),
outlines three key variables that affect the attitude-behavior relationship:

 a. the attitude toward the behavior (the stronger the better)
 b. subjective norms (the support of those we value)
 c. perceived behavioral control (the extent to which we believe we can actually perform the

      behavior).

These three factors jointly predict our intention to perform the behaviour, which in turn predicts
our actual behavior.

  The Theory of Planned Behavior In Action

      The Theory of Planned Behavior helps predict what intentions will turn into actions,
      and the degree of control a person has over what intentions turn into actions (Chan &
      Bishop; Greaves et al.).

         Imagine for a moment that your friend Sharina is trying to decide whether to
      recycle her used laptop batteries or just throw them away.

         a. We know that her attitude toward recycling is positive -- she thinks she should
              do it -- but we also know that recycling takes work. It's much easier to just
              throw the batteries away.

         b. If Sharina feels strongly about the importance of recycling, and if her family
              and friends (external influences in the form of subjective norms) are also in
              favor of recycling, this will factor into her behavioral outcome.

         c. And if Sharina has easy access to a battery recycling facility, then she will
              develop a strong intention to perform the behavior and likely follow through on
              it.

         Let's imagine another example using this model to show how it can predict attitude
      and outcome:

         Jillian is a personal fitness trainer and is now eligible to get a vaccine for Covid-19
      so she can protect herself and stop the spread to her loved ones and community.

         a. Jillian gets a flu shot every year and is an advocate for vaccinations and
              immunization. Throughout flu season and the Coronavirus pandemic, Jillian

256 | UNDERSTANDING ATTITUDES
              always wore a mask in public.
         b. Jillian's doctor, friends, family, and co-workers at the gym are equally as

              attentive to their health and the safety of others and will be getting vaccinated
              as soon as they are eligible. Jillian's community and the majority of people in
              her society all believe in science-based medicine.
         c. It's easy to set up the vaccinate appointment: Jillian goes online, makes the
              reservation, then attends the appointment at the pharmacy just down the
              street from her. Simple.
         Jillian's attitude (a), the subjective norm (b), and the perceived behavioral control
      (c) all support her getting the Covid-19 vaccine much more likely.

Self-Determination & Intrinsic Motivation in Attitudes

The self-determination theory theory describes motivated behavior as part of a continuum
that ranges from autonomous to controlled actions (Huffman, 2014). Unlike the theory of
planned behavior that examines subjective norms (external influences) as a factor to predict
behavior, the self-determination theory focuses on motivation and personality (internal cues) as
predictors to attitude and behavior.

    The theory proposed by Edward Deci and Richard Ryan (2000) states that understanding
motivation requires taking into account three basic human needs:

   autonomy--the need to feel free of external constraints on behavior
   competence--the need to feel capable or skilled
   relatedness--the need to feel connected or involved with others

Another intrinsic motivator is the warm-glow effect, which consists of the personal satisfaction
and altruistic motives that benefit the well-being of others (Abbott et al.). Individuals "feel
good" for partaking in pro-environmental behaviors and continue to repeat the activities
regardless of extrinsic rewards (Abbott et al.). While the warm-glow effect leaves us feeling
personally rewarded for "doing good," there remains much debate about whether each one of
our acts of goodness has a positive and long-lasting impact.

                                                                                                 UNDERSTANDING ATTITUDES | 257
The Four Functional Theories of Attitude

Functional theorists Katz (2008) and Smith, Bruner, & White (1956) addressed the issue of not
knowing which base (affective, cognition or behavior) was most important by looking at how
the person's attitude serves them psychologically. They came up with four different functions
that an attitude might serve:

 1. One of the most beneficial things an attitude can do for us is to make our lives more
      efficient. We do not have to evaluate and process each thing we come into contact with to
      know if it is good (safe) or bad (threatening) (Petty, 1995). This is called the knowledge
      function and allows us to understand and make sense of the world. My attitude towards
      insects is somewhat negative. I tend to have large reactions to bites from them and
      although most do not bite, my immediate reaction is to avoid them if at all possible. In this
      way my attitude keeps me from having to evaluate every type of insect I come into
      contact with. Saving time and allowing me to think of other things in life (Bargh, et
      al.,1992). This example might have prompted you to think that this generalization could
      lead to discrimination and you would be correct. In an attempt to be more efficient, I am
      not stopping and processing every insect I come into contact with and some insects are
      good (safe). We will discuss how this helps explain prejudice and discrimination in a later
      module.

 2. Our attitudes can serve an ego-defensive function which is to help us cover up things that
      we do not like about ourselves or help us to feel better about ourselves. You might think
      cheerleaders are stupid or superficial to protect yourself from feeling badly that you aren't
      a cheerleader. Here you defended against a threatening truth - you aren't a cheerleader
      which you want to be and boosted your self-image by believing that you are better than
      them - you are smart and complex.

 3. We can categorize some of our attitudes as serving as tools that lead us to greater
      rewards or help us to avoid punishments. So, individuals might have developed an attitude
      that having sex with many partners is bad. This has both a knowledge function and a
      utilitarian function by helping people avoid the societal punishment of being called
      promiscuous and then seeking the reward of being the kind of person that someone
      would take home and introduce to their parents.

 4. The final function centers around the idea that some of our attitudes help us express who
      we are to other people, value-expressive function. We see this a lot on social media. If you
      were to examine someone's Facebook or Instagram page you would see that their posts
      are full of their attitudes about life and they intentionally post certain things so that people
      will know who they are as a person. You might post a lot of political things and people
      might see you as a politically engaged person, you might post a lot about the environment
      and people see that you are passionate about this topic. This is who you are.

Cognitive Dissonance

Social psychologists have documented that feeling good about ourselves and maintaining
positive self-esteem is a powerful motivator of human behavior (Tavris & Aronson, 2008). Often,
our behavior, attitudes, and beliefs are affected when we experience a threat to our self-esteem
or positive self-image. Psychologist Leon Festinger (1957) defined cognitive dissonance as
psychological discomfort arising from holding two or more inconsistent attitudes, behaviors,
or cognitions (thoughts, beliefs, or opinions). Festinger's theory of cognitive dissonance states
that when we experience a conflict in our behaviors, attitudes, or beliefs that runs counter to our
positive self-perceptions, we experience psychological discomfort (dissonance). For example,
if you believe smoking is bad for your health but you continue to smoke, you experience conflict
between your belief and behavior.

    When we experience cognitive dissonance, we are motivated to decrease it because it is
psychologically, physically, and mentally uncomfortable. We can reduce cognitive dissonance
by bringing our cognitions, attitudes, and behaviors in line -- that is, making them harmonious.

    This sense of harmony can be achieved in different ways, such as:

   Changing our discrepant behavior (e.g., stop smoking);

   Changing our cognitions through rationalization or denial (e.g., telling ourselves that
      health risks can be reduced by smoking filtered cigarettes);

   Adding a new cognition (e.g., "Smoking suppresses my appetite so I don't become
      overweight, which is good for my health").

Multi-Attribute Attitude Model

Marketers desire the ability to better understand consumers' attitudes towards their products
and services. However, attitudes are complex and a consumer may have a range of attitudes
(favorable and unfavorable) towards a single product or service--not just one. In addition to
the various qualities held by a product or service, consumers are also faced with the added
complexity of seeking approval, whether that comes from friends, family, or society. Attitude
models are designed to help identify the different factors that would influence a consumer's
evaluation of attitude objects.

    Due to the complexity surrounding attitudes, researchers use multi-attribute models to
explain them. Simply put, multi-attribute models say that we form attitudes about a product
based on several attributes of that product, our beliefs about those attributes, and the relative
importance we assign to those attributes.

    The decision to purchase a car like an SUV offers a good illustration of how a multi-attribute
model affects purchase behavior. On the one hand, the styling and stance of a particular
model might evoke feelings of power, confidence, and ruggedness. The vehicle's high ground
clearance and roomy back might be great for the consumer's intended camping trips. On the
other hand, the brand could make the consumer ill at ease -- perhaps a friend had a bad

                                                                                                 UNDERSTANDING ATTITUDES | 259
experience with that car maker. And the more rational side of a consumer might balk at the
high cost and poor gas mileage. Yet the vehicle looks great, so the consumer isn't sure. And,
regardless of their personal feelings about the vehicle, the consumer may also factor in social
pressure: will their friends criticize them as a wasteful gas-guzzler if they buy an SUV instead
of a compact hybrid? Will they buy or won't they? The decision depends on how the buyer
combines and weights these positive and negative attitude components.

     The Multi-Attribute Model can be used to calculate an Attitude Score by evaluating the
     importance of key attributes featured across different products or brands.

A student might have a range of attitudes towards different brands of laptop computers. There
are various features each brand is known for (speed, weight, memory) but in addition to the
functional attributes, a student may also want to evaluate the brand appeal for each one. The
following table provides students with a re-usable template to build their own multi-attribute
model for any range of brands, products, or services they might want to evaluate using this
model.

Changing Attitudes

Every day we are bombarded by advertisements of every sort. The goal of these ads is to
sell us cars, computers, video games, clothes, and even political candidates. The ads appear
on billboards, website popup ads, buses, TV infomercials, and...well, you name it! It's been
estimated that over $500 billion is spent annually on advertising worldwide (Johnson, 2013).

    There is substantial evidence that advertising is effective in changing attitudes. After the
R. J. Reynolds Company started airing its Joe Camel ads for cigarettes on TV in the 1980s,
Camel's share of cigarette sales to children increased dramatically. But persuasion can also
have more positive outcomes. For instance, a review of the research literature indicates that
mass-media anti-smoking campaigns are associated with reduced smoking rates among both
adults and youth (Friend & Levy, 2001). Persuasion is also used to encourage people to donate
to charitable causes, to volunteer to give blood, and to engage in healthy behaviors.

Persuasion

Persuasion has been defined as "the process by which a message induces change in beliefs,
attitudes, or behaviours" (Myers, 2011). Persuasion can take many forms. It may, for example,
differ in whether it targets public compliance or private acceptance, is short-term or long-term,
whether it involves slowly escalating commitments or sudden interventions and, most of all, in
the benevolence of its intentions. When persuasion is well-meaning, we might call it education.
When it is manipulative, it might be called mind control (Levine, 2003).

                                                                                                          CHANGING ATTITUDES | 267
  Marketing Context: The Effective Use of Persuasion by Apple to
  Drive Sales

      On January 9, 2007, Steve Jobs, the enigmatic co-founder and CEO of Apple, Inc.,
      introduced the first iPhone to the world. The device quickly revolutionized the
      smartphone industry and changed what consumers came to expect from their
      phones. In the years since, smartphones have changed from being regarded as
      status symbols (Apple sold close to 1.4 million iPhones during their first year on the
      market) to fairly commonplace and essential tools. One out of every five people in
      the world now owns a smartphone, there are more smartphones in use in the world
      than PCs, and it is difficult for many young people to imagine how anyone ever
      managed to function without them. If you consider the relatively high cost of these
      devices, this transformation has been truly remarkable.

         Much of this shift in attitude can be credited to the impressive use of tactics of
      persuasion employed by smartphone manufacturers like Apple and Samsung. The
      typical marketing campaign for a new model of an iPhone delivers a carefully crafted
      message that cleverly weaves together stories, visuals, and music to create an
      emotional experience for the viewing public. These messages are often designed to
      showcase the range of uses of the device and to evoke a sense of need. Apple also
      strives to form relationships with its customers, something that is illustrated by the
      fact that 86 per cent of those who purchased the iPhone 5S were upgrading from a
      previous model. This strategy has benefited Apple tremendously as it has sold over
      400 million iPhones since 2007, making it one of the wealthiest companies in the
      world.

Elaboration Likelihood Model

An especially popular model that describes the dynamics of persuasion is the elaboration
likelihood model of persuasion (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986). The elaboration likelihood model
considers the variables of the attitude change approach -- that is, features of the source of the
persuasive message, contents of the message, and characteristics of the audience are used
to determine when attitude change will occur. According to the elaboration likelihood model
of persuasion, there are two main routes that play a role in delivering a persuasive message:
central and peripheral (see image below).

268 | CHANGING ATTITUDES
     Persuasion can take one of two paths: Central (where the audience is highly involved, prepared to
     engage in a high level of mental processing, and will experience a long-lasting attitude change),
     or peripheral (where the audience has low involvement, is more in tune with features peripheral
     to the core message, and only experiences a temporary attitude change).

The central route is logic driven and uses data and facts to convince people of an argument's
worthiness. For example, a car company seeking to persuade you to purchase their model will
emphasize the car's safety features and fuel economy. This is a direct route to persuasion that
focuses on the quality of the information. In order for the central route of persuasion to be
effective in changing attitudes, thoughts, and behaviors, the argument must be strong and, if
successful, will result in lasting attitude change.

    The central route to persuasion works best when the target of persuasion, or the audience,
is analytical and willing to engage in processing of the information. From an advertiser's
perspective, what products would be best sold using the central route to persuasion? What
audience would most likely be influenced to buy the product? One example is buying a
computer. It is likely, for example, that small business owners might be especially influenced
by the focus on the computer's quality and features such as processing speed and memory
capacity.

    The peripheral route is an indirect route that uses peripheral cues to associate positivity
with the message (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986). Instead of focusing on the facts and a product's
quality, the peripheral route relies on association with positive characteristics such as positive
emotions and celebrity endorsement. For example, having a popular athlete advertise athletic
shoes is a common method used to encourage young adults to purchase the shoes. This route
to attitude change does not require much effort or information processing. This method of
persuasion may promote positivity toward the message or product, but it typically results in

                                                                                                          CHANGING ATTITUDES | 269
less permanent attitude or behavior change. The audience does not need to be analytical or
motivated to process the message. In fact, a peripheral route to persuasion may not even be
noticed by the audience, for example in the strategy of product placement. Product placement
refers to putting a product with a clear brand name or brand identity in a TV show or movie
to promote the product (Gupta & Lord, 1998). For example, one season of the reality series
American Idol prominently showed the panel of judges drinking out of cups that displayed
the Coca-Cola logo. What other products would be best sold using the peripheral route to
persuasion? Another example is clothing: A retailer may focus on celebrities that are wearing
the same style of clothing.

  Student Op-Ed: How to be a Woman (according to the Susan G.
  Komen Foundation)

      The peripheral route to persuasion, a function of the Elaboration Likelihood Model of
      Persuasion, is a consumer behaviour concept that can explain how the Susan G.
      Komen Foundation ("Komen") and the Avon Foundation for Women ("Avon") attracted
      attention without providing much factual information on their goal: curing breast
      cancer. The peripheral route to persuasion is the cognitive path that consumers take
      when they rely on extraneous information that is not the actual message, such as the
      source of the message, the package it comes in, etc. to make a decision about how
      they feel about that product (Solomon, White & Dahl, 2014). These marketing tactics
      are designed for low-involvement processing, wherein a consumer doesn't think very
      much about a buying decision before making a purchase. The extraneous
      information, or peripheral cues, in the case of the Pink Ribbon Movement is based
      almost exclusively on hyperfemininity and is made to evoke strong emotions of hope
      and fulfillment.

         In the film Pink Ribbons, Inc. (Pool, 2011), we follow Komen, a nonprofit dedicated
      to finding a cure for breast cancer, watching how they raise awareness for their
      cause. Celebrity endorsements are a popular method, using stars like Halle Berry and
      Christie Brinkley to promote their events. And because Komen, as depicted in the
      film, doesn't have a lot of information on how they're actually going to cure breast
      cancer, they capture their audience with the attractiveness of the information source
      and not the information itself. These celebrities, or "sources", fit the archetype of
      what the "ideal" woman should look like, and very specifically they fit the role of what
      a "healthy" woman should look like. And so the Komen uses their star power to not
      only garner attention but also promote a look that follows the brand that they've built.

         Looking at Avon, a nonprofit run by the cosmetics company Avon Products, Inc.,
      we see the same trend of using low-involvement processing. Avon uses this curated
      culture of "sisterhood" to promote their products, relying on the fact that their

270 | CHANGING ATTITUDES
      audience will feel that pressure to show their care for other women and then make
      the connection that supporting women means supporting the use of cosmetics. They
      immerse their message within the context that being pretty is related to being
      healthy. While this has nothing to do with finding a cure for breast cancer, it does the
      job of persuading the consumer to think less and act more by creating a connection
      that is simple and convenient.

         The peripheral route is the path we take when we aren't invested in learning more
      about a product or service we seek to purchase. I think the popularity of the Pink
      Ribbon Movement is brought on through specific marketing that relies on the fact
      that, as a culture, we are obsessed with women's bodies. But we know so little about
      them that there's a limit to how we can help ourselves and other women stay healthy.
      I don't think indifference is the driving factor when it comes to these low-involvement
      purchasing situations, as much as ignorance is.

         I care about finding more information about breast cancer, but I don't know where
      to put that energy because information is genuinely hard to find. Komen and Avon
      provided a place for us to put our anxiety and our grief, provided we buy into the
      shiny, pink package they deliver to us. With public health issues, the messages
      should be informational, educational, and should require a high degree of mental
      processing; but instead The Pink Ribbon Movement hands us an easy-to-read
      instruction manual that is too convenient to resist.

The Source of Persuasion: The Triad of Trustworthiness

Effective persuasion requires trusting the source of the communication. Studies have identified
three characteristics that lead to trust: perceived authority, honesty, and likability.

 1. Perceived Authority: From earliest childhood, we learn to rely on authority figures for
      sound decision making because their authority signifies status and power, as well as
      expertise. These two facets often work together. Authorities such as parents and teachers
      are not only our primary sources of wisdom while we grow up, but they control us and our
      access to the things we want. In addition, we have been taught to believe that respect for
      authority is a moral virtue. As adults, it is natural to transfer this respect to society's
      designated authorities, such as judges, doctors, bosses, and religious leaders. We
      assume their positions give them special access to information and power. Usually we are
      correct, so that our willingness to defer to authorities becomes a convenient shortcut to
      sound decision making. Uncritical trust in authority may, however, lead to bad decisions.
      Uncritical trust in authority can be problematic for several reasons. First, even if the
      source of the message is a legitimate, well-intentioned authority, they may not always be
      correct. Second, when respect for authority becomes mindless, expertise in one domain

                                                                                                          CHANGING ATTITUDES | 271
      may be confused with expertise in general. To assume there is credibility when a
      successful actor promotes a cold remedy, or when a psychology professor offers his
      views about politics, can lead to problems. Third, the authority may not be legitimate. It is
      not difficult to fake a college degree or professional credential or to buy an official-looking
      badge or uniform.

 2. Honesty: Honesty is the moral dimension of trustworthiness. Persuasion professionals
      have long understood how critical it is to their efforts. Marketers, for example, dedicate
      exorbitant resources to developing and maintaining an image of honesty. A trusted brand
      or company name becomes a mental shortcut for consumers. It is estimated that some
      50,000 new products come out each year. Forrester Research, a marketing research
      company, calculates that children have seen almost six million ads by the age of 16. An
      established brand name helps us cut through this volume of information. It signals we are
      in safe territory. "The real suggestion to convey," advertising leader Theodore MacManus
      observed in 1910, "is that the man manufacturing the product is an honest man, and the
      product is an honest product, to be preferred above all others" (Fox, 1997).

 3. Likability: People tend to favor products that are associated with people they like. This is
      the key ingredient to celebrity endorsements. While there are a lot of factors that can
      contribute to likability, being physically attractive is one of the most influential. If we know
      that celebrities aren't really experts, and that they are being paid to say what they're
      saying, why do their endorsements sell so many products? Ultimately, it is because we like
      them. More than any single quality, we trust people we like. The mix of qualities that make
      a person likable are complex and often do not generalize from one situation to another.
      One clear finding, however, is that physically attractive people tend to be liked more. In
      fact, we prefer them to a disturbing extent: Various studies have shown we perceive
      attractive people as smarter, kinder, stronger, more successful, more socially skilled,
      better poised, better adjusted, more exciting, more nurturing, and, most important, of
      higher moral character. All of this is based on no other information than their physical
      appearance (e.g., Dion, Berscheid & Walster, 1972).

When the source appears to have any or all of these characteristics, people not only are more
willing to agree to their request but are willing to do so without carefully considering the facts.
We assume we are on safe ground and are happy to shortcut the tedious process of informed
decision making. As a result, we are more susceptible to messages and requests, no matter
their particular content or how peripheral they may be.

Source Credibility

Source credibility means that consumers perceive the source (or spokesperson) as an expert
who is objective and trustworthy ("I'm not a doctor, but I play one on TV"). A credible source will
provide information on competing products, not just one product, to help the consumer make a
more informed choice. We also see the impact of credibility in Web sites like eBay or Wikipedia

272 | CHANGING ATTITUDES
and numerous blogs, where readers rate the quality of others' submissions to enable the entire
audience to judge whose posts are worth reading.

Source Attractiveness

Source attractiveness refers to the source's perceived social value, not just his or her physical
appearance. High social value comes partly from physical attractiveness but also from
personality, social status, or similarity to the receiver. We like to listen to people who are like
us, which is why "typical" consumers are effective when they endorse everyday products. So,
when we think about source attractiveness, it's important to keep in mind that "attractiveness"
is not just physical beauty. The advertising that is most effective isn't necessarily the one
that pairs a Hollywood idol with a product. Indeed, one study found that many students were
more convinced by an endorsement from a fictional fellow student than from a celebrity. As a
researcher explained, "They [students] like to make sure their product is fashionable and trendy
among people who resemble them, rather than approved by celebrities like David Beckham,
Brad Pitt or Scarlett Johansson. So they are more influenced by an endorsement from an
ordinary person like them" ("Celebrity Ads...," 2007).

    Still, all things equal, there's a lot of evidence that physically attractive people are more
persuasive. Our culture (like many others) has a bias toward good-looking people that teaches
they are more likely to possess other desirable traits as well. Researchers call this the "what is
beautiful is good" hypothesis (Dion et al., 1972).

Match-Up Hypothesis

For celebrity campaigns to be effective, the endorser must have a clear and popular image.
In addition, the celebrity's image and that of the product they endorse should be similar --
researchers refer to this as the match-up hypothesis (Kamins, 1990; Basil, 1994). A market
research company developed one widely used measure called the Q-score (Q stands for quality)
to decide if a celebrity will make a good endorser. The score includes level of familiarity with
a name and the number of respondents who indicate that a person, program, or character is a
favorite (Kahle & Kahle, 2005).

    A good match-up is crucial; fame alone is not enough. The celebrity may bring the brand
visibility, but that visibility can be overshadowed by controversy that the spokesperson can
generate. For example, in 2018, Gal Gadot became a brand ambassador for Huawei and
tweeted a promotional video for the brand's Android cell phone. However, Gal uploaded the
video using "Twitter for iPhone," a competing product for Huawei (Ellevsen, 2018). This raised
controversy and social buzz that cloaked the purpose of the promotional video; to garner
attention for the brand. Similarly, the Beef Board faced negative publicity when its
spokesperson, Cybill Shepherd, admitted she did not like to eat beef. Without question, it helps
when your spokesperson actually uses (or matches up with) the product they are promoting.
In the case of Lance Armstrong, sportswear giant Nike, cycle maker Trek, and Budweiser

                                                                                                          CHANGING ATTITUDES | 273
brewer Anheuser-Busch ended their sponsorships with the cyclist after his admittance of using
unethical performance enhancing means to win (Meyer, 2019).

    Because consumers tend to view the brand through the lens of its spokesperson, an
advertiser can't choose an endorser just based on a whim (or the person's good looks).
Consider Tupperware, which decided to mount an advertising campaign to support its
traditional word-of-mouth and Tupperware party promotional strategies. The brand is 60 years
old and harkens back to 1950s-style June Cleaver moms (A "Leave it to Beaver" reference that
dates too far back for most readers). In its attempt to stay relevant and up-to-date, the company
looked for a modern image of the working mom. Rather than going with a spokesperson like
Martha Stewart, who would reinforce the old image of Tupperware, the company chose Brooke
Shields as their spokesperson. "We've seen her go from a model to an actress to a Princeton
graduate...then be open with issues she's had with depression," said Tupperware Chairman-CEO
Rick Goings. That, he said, meshed perfectly with the company's new "Chain of Confidence"
campaign, which is dedicated to building the self-esteem of women and girls (Neff, 2007).

Celebrity Endorsements

Celebrity endorsements are a frequent feature in commercials aimed at children. The practice
has aroused considerable ethical concern, and research shows the concern is warranted. In
a study funded by the Federal Trade Commission, more than 400 children ages 8 to 14 were
shown one of various commercials for a model racing set. Some of the commercials featured
an endorsement from a famous race car driver, some included real racing footage, and others
included neither. Children who watched the celebrity endorser not only preferred the toy cars
more but were convinced the endorser was an expert about the toys. This held true for children
of all ages. In addition, they believed the toy race cars were bigger, faster, and more complex
than real race cars they saw on film. They were also less likely to believe the commercial was
staged (Ross et al., 1984).

  Star Power & the Halo Effect

      Star Power

         Star power can best be explained like this: if a famous person believes a product is
      good, you can believe it, too. For the advertising to be effective, however, the
      connection between the product and the celebrity should be clear. When Louis
      Vuitton featured Mikhail Gorbachev in an ad in Vogue, the tie was not clear. Why
      would the association with the former Soviet leader who brought an end to
      Communism motivate a consumer to buy a luxury brand bag?

         This framework is effective because celebrities embody cultural meanings -- they
      symbolize important categories such as status and social class (a "working-class

274 | CHANGING ATTITUDES
      hero," such as Peter Griffin on Family Guy), gender (a "tough woman," such as Nancy
      on Weeds), or personality types (the nerdy but earnest Hiro on Heroes). Ideally, the
      advertiser decides what meanings the product should convey (that is, how it should
      position the item in the marketplace) and then chooses a celebrity who embodies a
      similar meaning. The product's meaning thus moves from the manufacturer to the
      consumer, using the star as a vehicle.

         The Halo Effect
         Armed with positive information about a person we then tend to assume other
      positive qualities, called the halo effect (Nisbett & Wilson, 1977). So if a person is
      really nice, we will also assume they are attractive or intelligent. If rude, we will see
      them as unintelligent or unattractive. The halo effect creates a type of cognitive bias
      and marketers know this! If we have a favorable attitude towards a brand's products,
      there's a good chance that same attitude will be extended to the brand's other
      products, or even future product-line extensions. The same can be said about a
      celebrity endorser: if we have a favorable attitude towards a particular celebrity or
      athlete and they endorse a product, there's a good chance we will also have a
      favorable attitude towards the product they are endorsing.

The Balance Theory of Attitudes

Fritz Heider's Balance Theory is a conceptual framework that demonstrates how consistency
as a motivational force predicts attitude change and behavior. The model can be used to
predict the behavior of consumers in situations where a celebrity endorser may be involved. If
the audience (consumers) have a favorable attitude towards a celebrity and perceive that the
celebrity likes a particular brand (communicated through an endorsement deal), the consumer
is more likely to develop a positive attitude towards the brand--thus providing "balance"
between all three components in the triad (the consumer, the celebrity, and the brand). However,
imbalance can occur if a consumer develops a dislike towards the celebrity (e.g. due to
scandal), which could then result in the same negative attitude being extended to the brand if
they continue to maintain positive ties with the celebrity. Many brands will "drop" a celebrity in
order to maintain a positive relationship with consumers.

                                                                                                          CHANGING ATTITUDES | 275
                        The Balance Theory Explained

    The Balance Theory of Attitudes can be explained visually and mathematically:

          In the beginning we have a perfectly balanced and positive relationship between
             all members of the triad. Consumers have a positive attitude towards the athlete
             and the sports brand signs the athlete on to endorse the brand, thereby making it
             possible for consumers to develop a positive attitude towards them.

          When news of a scandal breaks, consumers change from having a positive
             relationship to the athlete to having a negative one. This change now represents
             a triad that is out of balance. Cognitive dissonance tells us that consumers will
             seek to restore balance...but how?

          Balance can be restored for consumers by no longer supporting the sports
             brand. Perhaps they'll even boycott it along with other consumer activitists. This
             can help restore balance and lead to a positive outcome again. This would not be
             good for the brand!

          To avoid losing consumers, the sports brand will "drop" the celebrity athlete and
             cut ties with them. This will maintain a positive relationship with consumers and
             restore balance in the triad. Cognitive dissonance will no longer threaten the
             relationship between consumers and the sports brand.

Barely a day goes by without a story in the news that features a brand or corporation who has
decided to cut ties with a celebrity, an athlete, and even a politician. At the time of writing,
American democracy is being put to the test and finding itself challenged by fascists and
domestic terrorists. On January 6, 2021, the United States Congress experienced an attack by
violent insurgents who attempted, what many believe to have been, a coup or at the very least,
a serious disruption to the democratic process involving the peaceful transition of power and
government from President Donald Trump to President-Elect Joe Biden.

    In the following week, many corporations suspended, recalled, or halted funding to those
politicians who made attempts to disrupt the transition of government. New York Times writers
Andrew Ross Sorkin, Jason Karaian, Michael J. de la Merced, Lauren Hirsch, and Ephrat Livni,
documented and summarized those companies who are "rethinking" their political donations
(2021). Among the most notable corporations who paused all political donations were
Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Citigroup. Those corporations who paused donations to
specific politicians (individuals who voted against certification of the election) included Marriott
and Blue Cross Blue Shield.

    The discussion below serves to highlight how the Balance Theory works in a retail branding
context: however, this framework can be applied to the discussion above as well. Students are
encouraged to come up with their own examples of the Balance Theory in action!

276 | CHANGING ATTITUDES
Warning! Doing Business with Trump Could Hurt Your Bottom Line

  A consumer behavior concept, known as "The Balance Theory of Attitudes", can
  predict why so many brands are "dumping Trump" to save their businesses. Since the
  2016 election of US President Donald Trump, many consumer-based activism
  movements emerged to voice their disapproval of the Republican president who has
  mocked the disabled; called for an illegal "Muslim ban"; threatened to criminalize
  abortion; accused Mexicans of being violent criminals; encouraged harm and
  brutality towards Black Americans; and, perpetuated conspiracy theories about "fake
  news".

     According to Solomon et al (7th ed), the Balance Theory of Attitudes is a model
  that involves a triad that considers the relationship between 3 entities: (1) a person
  and their perception of an (2) attitude object, and some other person or object
  (Solomon, 2017). It matters less if perceptions and attitudes among the individuals
  and objects are negative or positive and more if they are in balance.

     When the triad is imbalanced due to an attitude change (e.g. by consumers), there
  will be a natural draw to remove cognitive dissonance and restore balance by
  changing the nature of one other relationship within the triad. This is how the model
  can be used to predict brand success or brand disassociation.

     After the 2016 Presidential election, an online movement known as
  #GrabYourWallet started exposing those brands who were continuing to choose to
  do business with Trump (grabyourwallet.org, 2017). For example, Nordstrom (a
  popular US department store), Ivanka Trump (daughter to Donald Trump who sells
  women's merchandise), and a fictitious loyal consumer (let's call her "Jennifer")
  demonstrate how the Balance Theory predicts outcomes when attitude change
  occurs.

     Before the election, this triad (Nordstrom, Ivanka, Jennifer) all existed in a positive
  and balanced relationship. Jennifer, an ideal consumer in Nordstrom's perspective,
  had a favorable attitude towards Ivanka Trump which encouraged the department
  store to carry the Trump branded merchandise in its stores.

     Shortly after the election, however, Jennifer's attitude began to change. The violent
  rhetoric and lies made by the US President met with her disapproval and she became
  increasingly concerned about the growing hostilities towards BIPOC (Black,
  Indigenous, and People of Colour). Jennifer reflected on how her behavior as a
  consumer made her complicit (passively supportive) of the President and his family:
  her once favorable attitude towards Ivanka and the Trump clothing line now turned
  sour. Negative. With this change, the triad found itself imbalanced and Nordstrom
  was faced with a big decision: continue to carry Ivanka Trump merchandise and risk

                                                                                                      CHANGING ATTITUDES | 277
      losing loyal consumers like Jennifer, or, dump Trump and maintain a positive
      relationship with its consumers. What was the best course of action for Nordstrom in
      this situation? Knowing that Jennifer represented a majority of its consumer-base,
      Nordstrom had to protect its bottom line and brand reputation.

         So, the Balance Theory of Attitudes reveals to us that the only real option
      Nordstrom had was to drop Ivanka Trump's merchandise from its retail mix. (Which
      is exactly what the mega retailer did.) They weighed the cost of doing business with
      Trump versus the long-term value loyal consumers bring to their bottom line and
      chose to maintain a positive and favorable relationship with Jennifer and convert its
      once positive support for Ivanka Trump into a negative one. And voil, balance
      restored.

         As a consumer I am aware that I am responsible for the purchase decisions I make
      and the impact those decisions have on business, society, and the people I may
      influence around me (my husband, my kids, my students). Given that female
      consumers make up 50% of our consumer economy and are responsible for 80% of
      household purchasing decisions, I recognize that I hold a lot of power. It has taken
      time, but I have evolved to become a much more conscientious consumer: I
      recognize that my consumer decision making reflects the kind of person I wish to be
      -- one who values social justice, equality, sustainability, and equity.

         When a brand stands in direct opposition to consumers' values, the Balance
      Theory of Attitudes will often predict the outcome.

Creatively Persuasive

Beyond endorsements and the use of a source, persuasion can take on other forms and
techniques as well. The following list provides an overview of different ways in which
persuasion is designed to communicate compatibility, necessity, and urgency to consumers.

Reciprocity

"There is no duty more indispensable than that of returning a kindness," wrote Cicero. Humans
are motivated by a sense of equity and fairness. When someone does something for us or gives
us something, we feel obligated to return the favor in kind. It triggers one of the most powerful
of social norms, the reciprocity rule, whereby we feel compelled to repay, in equitable value, what
another person has given to us.

    Gouldner (1960), in his seminal study of the reciprocity rule, found it appears in every
culture. It lays the basis for virtually every type of social relationship, from the legalities of
business arrangements to the subtle exchanges within a romance. A salesperson may offer
free gifts, concessions, or their valuable time in order to get us to do something for them in

278 | CHANGING ATTITUDES
return. For example, if a colleague helps you when you're busy with a project, you might feel
obliged to support her ideas for improving team processes. You might decide to buy more from
a supplier if they have offered you an aggressive discount. Or, you might give money to a charity
fundraiser who has given you a flower in the street (Cialdini, 2008; Levine, 2003).

Social Proof

If everyone is doing it, it must be right. People are more likely to work late if others on their team
are doing the same, to put a tip in a jar that already contains money, or eat in a restaurant that
is busy. This principle derives from two extremely powerful social forces -- social comparison
and conformity. We compare our behavior to what others are doing and, if there is a discrepancy
between the other person and ourselves, we feel pressure to change (Cialdini, 2008).

                       While few people really like to wait in long lines, we might do it
                       anyway in certain situations. If enough people are willing to wait it
                       (usually) is a sign that there is something worth having at the end. A
                       line in front of a restaurant, movie, etc. is social proof that will likely
                       influence other people to try.

The principle of social proof is so common that it easily passes unnoticed. Advertisements,
for example, often consist of little more than attractive social models appealing to our desire
to be one of the group. For example, the German candy company Haribo suggests that when
you purchase their products you are joining a larger society of satisfied customers: "Kids and
grown-ups love it so- the happy world of Haribo". Sometimes social cues are presented with
such specificity that it is as if the target is being manipulated by a puppeteer -- for example, the
laugh tracks on situation comedies that instruct one not only when to laugh but how to laugh.
Studies find these techniques work. Fuller and Skeehy-Skeffington (1974), found that audiences

                                                                                                          CHANGING ATTITUDES | 279
laughed longer and more when a laugh track accompanied the show than when it did not, even
though respondents knew the laughs they heard were connived by a technician from old tapes
that had nothing to do with the show they were watching. People are particularly susceptible
to social proof (a) when they are feeling uncertain, and (b) if the people in the comparison
group seem to be similar to ourselves. As P.T. Barnum once said, "Nothing draws a crowd like a
crowd."

Commitment & Consistency

Westerners have a desire to both feel and be perceived to act consistently. Once we have made
an initial commitment, it is more likely that we will agree to subsequent commitments that
follow from the first. Knowing this, a clever persuasion artist might induce someone to agree to
a difficult-to-refuse small request and follow this with progressively larger requests that were
his target from the beginning. The process is known as getting a foot in the door and then
slowly escalating the commitments.

    Paradoxically, we are less likely to say "No" to a large request than we are to a small request
when it follows this pattern. This can have costly consequences. Levine (2003), for example,
found ex-cult members tend to agree with the statement: "Nobody ever joins a cult. They just
postpone the decision to leave."

A Door in the Face

Some techniques bring a paradoxical approach to the escalation sequence by pushing a
request to or beyond its acceptable limit and then backing off. In the door-in-the-face
(sometimes called the reject-then-compromise) procedure, the persuader begins with a large
request they expect will be rejected. They want the door to be slammed in their face. Looking
forlorn, they now follow this with a smaller request, which, unknown to the customer, was their
target all along.

    In one study, for example, Mowen and Cialdini (1980), posing as representatives of the
fictitious "California Mutual Insurance Co.," asked university students walking on campus if
they'd be willing to fill out a survey about safety in the home or dorm. The survey, students were
told, would take about 15 minutes. Not surprisingly, most of the students declined -- only one
out of four complied with the request. In another condition, however, the researchers door-in-
the-faced them by beginning with a much larger request. "The survey takes about two hours,"
students were told. Then, after the subject declined to participate, the experimenters retreated
to the target request: "...look, one part of the survey is particularly important and is fairly short.
It will take only 15 minutes to administer." Almost twice as many now complied.

"And That's Not All!"

The that's-not-all technique also begins with the salesperson asking a high price. This is
followed by several seconds' pause during which the customer is kept from responding. The

280 | CHANGING ATTITUDES
salesperson then offers a better deal by either lowering the price or adding a bonus product.
That's-not-all is a variation on door-in-the-face. Whereas the latter begins with a request that
will be rejected, however, that's-not-all gains its influence by putting the customer on the fence,
allowing them to waver and then offering them a comfortable way off.

    Burger (1986) demonstrated the technique in a series of field experiments. In one study, for
example, an experimenter-salesman told customers at a student bake sale that cupcakes cost
75 cents. As this price was announced, another salesman held up his hand and said, "Wait a
second," briefly consulted with the first salesman, and then announced ("that's-not-all") that the
price today included two cookies. In a control condition, customers were offered the cupcake
and two cookies as a package for 75 cents right at the onset. The bonus worked magic: Almost
twice as many people bought cupcakes in the that's-not-all condition (73 per cent) than in the
control group (40 per cent).

The Sunk Cost Trap

Sunk cost is a term used in economics referring to nonrecoverable investments of time or
money. The trap occurs when a person's aversion to loss impels them to throw good money
after bad, because they don't want to waste their earlier investment. This is vulnerable to
manipulation. The more time and energy a cult recruit can be persuaded to spend with the
group, the more "invested" they will feel, and, consequently, the more of a loss it will feel to leave
that group. Consider the advice of billionaire investor Warren Buffet: "When you find yourself in
a hole, the best thing you can do is stop digging" (Levine, 2003).

Scarcity & Psychological Reactance

People tend to perceive things as more attractive when their availability is scarce (limited), or
when they stand to lose the opportunity to acquire them on favorable terms (Cialdini, 2008).
Anyone who has encountered a willful child is familiar with this principle. In a classic study,
Brehm and Weinraub (1977), for example, placed two-year-old boys in a room with a pair of
equally attractive toys. One of the toys was placed next to a plexiglass wall; the other was set
behind the plexiglass. For some boys, the wall was one foot high, which allowed the boys to
easily reach over and touch the distant toy. Given this easy access, they showed no particular
preference for one toy or the other. For other boys, however, the wall was a formidable two feet
high, which required them to walk around the barrier to touch the toy. When confronted with this
wall of inaccessibility, the boys headed directly for the forbidden fruit, touching it three times as
quickly as the accessible toy.

    Research shows that much of that two-year-old remains in adults, too. People resent being
controlled. When a person seems too pushy, we get suspicious, annoyed, often angry, and yearn
to retain our freedom of choice more than before. Brehm (1966) labeled this the principle of
psychological reactance.

    The most effective way to circumvent psychological reactance is to first get a foot in the
door and then escalate the demands so gradually that there is seemingly nothing to react

                                                                                                          CHANGING ATTITUDES | 281
against. Hassan (1988), who spent many years as a higher-up in the "Moonies" cult, describes
how they would shape behaviors subtly at first, then more forcefully. The material that would
make up the new identity of a recruit was doled out gradually, piece by piece, only as fast as the
person was deemed ready to assimilate it. The rule of thumb was to "tell him only what he can
accept." He continues: "Don't sell them [the converts] more than they can handle... If a recruit
started getting angry because he was learning too much about us, the person working on him
would back off and let another member move in..."

Chapter Reflections

 1. The Elaboration Likelihood Model ("ELM") also presented as the "Central and Peripheral
      Route to Persuasion" demonstrates the different ways in which consumers process a
      message relative to their involvement: high involvement (central); low involvement
      (peripheral). Read this article published by Odyssey Online titled "An Attempt To
      Understand Why People Support Donald Trump" about how the Central and Peripheral
      Routes to Persuasion provide a basis of understanding related to the outcome of the
      2016 Presidential election. Discuss the similarities between consumer decision making
      and politics with reference to this model.

 2. As we learned in this chapter, changing attitudes can be an uphill battle for marketers.
      Persuasive messaging is one way we can attempt to change consumers' attitudes and
      often behaviour as well. In this video by Boulder Ignite, discuss how Ash Beckham
      successfully persuades her audience to reconsider using the word "gay" as a pejorative in
      our language. What makes Ash a credible "source" in delivering this important message?

 3. After the 2016 US Presidential elections which brought Donald Trump to power, many
      counter-movements were created so voters, consumers, activists, and members of
      society could make their disapproving voices heard. One such movement, known as "Grab
      Your Wallet" (#grabyourwallet) has energized consumers across America (and even into
      Canada) to boycott brands that carry any Trump products--mostly notably was the case
      of Nordstrom's dropping Ivanka Trump's merchandise from their retail stores in early
      2017. The #GrabYourWallet campaign started on social media and now several years
      later, has turned into one of the biggest consumer activism campaigns on record. Using
      this campaign as an example, discuss how the Balance Theory of Attitudes could have
      predicted the demise of the relationship between the "Trump name" and retailers such as
      Nordstrom.

                                                                                                         CHAPTER REFLECTIONS | 285

Learning Objectives

  In this section, we will learn about the key demographic, social, and situational
  influences on consumer decision making.

     Upon completing this section, students should:
      1. Identify the key demographic, social, and situational influences on consumer

           decision making.
      2. Discuss how consumers respond to some of the key influences.
      3. Provide examples of marketing strategies that use external factors to reach

           and influence consumers.
      4. Discuss and give examples of different types of social influences such as

           reference groups and opinion leaders.

Key Terms and Concepts

          Anti-brand community: This term is characterized as a group of individuals who
             are bonded together by their mutual dislike, distrust, and aversion of a brand or
             product.

          Aspirational reference groups: These groups of people are not known to
             consumers personally, but instead represent a set of ideals that others admire
             usually because of their popularity and celebrity status.

          Atmospherics: A situational factor/influence on consumer decision making,
             atmospherics is the sum total of all physical aspects in a retail environment that
             the retailer controls and should monitor to create a pleasing shopping experience
             for customers.

          Brand community: This term is characterized as a group of passionate and
             enthusiastic consumers who are bonded together by their interest in a brand or
             product.

          Conformity: Both social comparison and informational social influence often
             lead to conformity, which is a long-lasting change in beliefs, opinions, and
             behaviors that are consistent with the people around us.

          Crowding: A situational factor/influence on decision making, a crowded store
             may result in a lower number of visitors converting to buyers, but it may also
             create "herd behavior" in which some customers are more likely to purchase
             when part of a crowd.

          Deindividuation: The loss of individual self-awareness and accountability when
             an individual is absorbed into a larger group.

          Discretionary income: Discretionary income represents the amount of money we
             have left over to invest, save, or spend, after paying personal income taxes and
             necessities. Young adults often have to pay necessities like student loans and
             credit card debts, but also may pay less taxes, all of which effects their

                                                                                                   KEY TERMS AND CONCEPTS | 289
             discretionary income. Discretionary income is different than disposable income
             because it takes necessary expenses into consideration.

          Disposable income: Disposable income represents the amount of money we
             have left over to invest, save, or spend, after paying personal income taxes.
             Seniors and retirees typically have more disposable income due to paying lower
             personal income taxes. Discretionary income is derived from disposable income.

          Family lifecycle: The family lifecycle represents the various stages we pass
             through from early adulthood to retirement. At each stage of the lifecycle
             consumer preferences are defined by different needs and wants and influenced
             by different forces.

          Hedonic shopping experience: The family lifecycle represents the various stages
             we pass through from early adulthood to retirement. At each stage of the
             lifecycle consumer preferences are defined by different needs and wants and
             influenced by different forces.

          Heuristics: Also known as "mental shortcuts" or "rules of thumb," heuristics help
             consumers by simplifying the decision-making process.

          Influencer: An influencer is characterized as someone who is well-connected;
             has influence on consumers' decision making; has both reach and impact; and is
             identified as a trendsetter.

          Informational social influence: When we change change our opinions and
             behaviors in order to conform to the people closest to us, we use the term
             "informational social influence". We justify our changed opinions because we
             believe those people have accurate and reliable information that also serves our
             contexts.

          Layout (store layout): An interior variable, the layout refers to the design of the
             space inside a store as well as the placement of displays and other items
             customers come in contact with.

          Location: Store location is a situational factor/influence on decision making.
             Retailers who are located where consumers expect and want them to be, such as
             in high pedestrian traffic zones, tend to enjoy a higher volume of customers.

          Mere exposure: This term describes our preference to like things that we have
             seen more often, or more frequently. Increased and frequent exposure to a
             product may result in our developing a preference for the product that we
             wouldn't otherwise have.

          Non-conformity: This term describes situations where an individual (or group of
             individuals) reject or fail to go along with the rules, laws, and social norms of a

290 | KEY TERMS AND CONCEPTS
   larger group or society.
 Normative social influence: This term best describes situations in which we

   express opinions or take on behaviors that enable us to be accepted by others
   and avoid rejection or social isolation.
 Mood: A situational factor/influence on decision making, a consumer's mood
   expresses a temporary state of mind and feeling at a particular moment. It can
   also be expressed as the predominant emotion we are feeling.
 Opinion leaders: These are people who have the ability to influence others; they
   often set trends and norms that others conform to.
 Private acceptance: This is the result of conformity and is described as a real
   change in an individual's opinions.
 Proximity: The term describes the extent to which someone or something else is
   near to us.
 Reference group: A group of people that is often made up on opinion leaders
   who have influence on the attitudes, opinions, and behaviors of others.
 Social class: A term used to describe groups of people who have the same
   socio-economic status within society. Social class may be measured using
   income, education, and profession; however, classifications can often be
   incorrect because indicators might be misleading (e.g. someone with high
   school education can be a high income earner).
 Social comparison: When we compare our opinions to those of the people
   around us, we are engaging in social comparisons. Informational social influence
   often follows social comparison.
 Social influence: Social influence occurs when our beliefs and behaviors begin to
   match those of the people we're closest to. This may be subtle or it may be
   something we seek out by asking our friends for their opinions.
 Social norms: These are socially accepted beliefs about what we do or should do
   in particular social contexts.
 Time-starved: A term related to the situational factor/influence on decision

Social Influences

The typical outcome of social influence is that our beliefs and behaviours become more similar
to those of others around us. At times, this change occurs in a spontaneous and automatic
sense, without any obvious intent of one person to change the other. Perhaps you learned to
like jazz or rap music because your roommate was playing a lot of it. You didn't really want
to like the music, and your roommate didn't force it on you -- your preferences changed in a
passive way. Robert Cialdini and his colleagues (Cialdini, Reno, & Kallgren, 1990) found that
college students were more likely to throw litter on the ground when they had just seen another
person throw some paper on the ground and were least likely to litter when they had just seen
another person pick up and throw paper into a trash can. The researchers interpreted this as a
kind of spontaneous conformity -- a tendency to follow the behaviour of others, often entirely
out of our awareness. Even our emotional states become more similar to those we spend more
time with (Anderson, Keltner, & John, 2003).

    Influence also sometimes occurs because we believe that other people have valid
knowledge about an opinion or issue, and we use that information to help us make good
decisions. For example, if you take a flight and land at an unfamiliar airport you may follow the
flow of other passengers who disembarked before you. In this case your assumption might be
that they know where they are going and that following them will likely lead you to the baggage
carousel.

  Getting Lost in a Crowd

      Social psychologists are interested in studying self-awareness because it has such
      an important influence on behaviour. People become more likely to violate
      acceptable, mainstream social norms when, for example, they put on a Halloween
      mask or engage in other behaviours that hide their identities. For example, the
      members of the militant white supremacist organization, the Ku Klux Klan, wear
      white robes and hats when they meet and when they engage in violent racist
      behaviour.

         Similarly, when people are in large crowds, such as in a mass demonstration or a

                                                                                                             SOCIAL INFLUENCES | 293
      riot, they may become so much a part of the group that they experience
      deindividuation -- the loss of individual self-awareness and individual accountability
      in groups (Festinger, Pepitone & Newcomb, 1952; Zimbardo, 1969) and become more
      attuned to themselves as group members and to the specific social norms of the
      particular situation (Reicher & Stott, 2011).

         Not all examples of deindividuation cause alarm or concern, however. Consider the
      community-based solution to crime prevention, "Bear Clan Patrol," which is a
      volunteer-run organization with membership in Winnipeg, Calgary, and Edmonton.
      Members provide, "a sense of safety, solidarity and belonging to both its members
      and to the communities they serve" ("Who we are," n.d.). Volunteer patrol teams head
      out into the dark, cold nights to help the most vulnerable living in the community.
      They come armed with care packages; they clean up discarded needles and drug
      paraphernalia; they distribute warm clothing and blankets; and, they provide a set of
      eyes on the streets where a police presence is less likely to serve those living in the
      community.

         The organization was formed in response to the growing number of missing and
      murdered Indigenous women and girls ("MMIWG") in urban and rural areas. The early
      founders of Bean Clan expressed a desire to assume their "traditional responsibility"
      to provide care and support to members of their community through culturally-
      specific approaches to security, safety, and check-ins.

         The Bean Clan patrol groups demonstrate how when a group of like-minded
      individuals come together to address common concerns, their camaraderie provides
      a stronger sense of purpose and energy, possibly more so than when individuals act
      alone.

Influence, Conformity, & Norms

Informational social influence is the change in opinions or behaviour that occurs when we
conform to people who we believe have accurate information. We base our beliefs on those
presented to us by reporters, scientists, doctors, and lawyers because we believe they have
more expertise in certain fields than we have. But we also use our friends and colleagues for
information; when we choose a jacket on the basis of our friends' advice about what looks good
on us, we are using informational conformity -- we believe that our friends have good judgment
about the things that matter to us.

    Informational social influence is often the end result of social comparison, the process of
comparing our opinions with those of others to gain an accurate appraisal of the validity of
an opinion or behaviour (Festinger, Schachter, & Back, 1950; Hardin & Higgins, 1996; Turner,
1991). Informational social influence leads to real, long-lasting changes in beliefs. The result of
conformity due to informational social influence is normally private acceptance: real change in

294 | SOCIAL INFLUENCES
opinions on the part of the individual. We believe that choosing the jacket was the right thing to
do and that the crowd will lead us to the baggage carousel.

    In other cases we conform not because we want to have valid knowledge but rather to meet
the goal of belonging to and being accepted by a group that we care about (Deutsch & Gerard,
1955). When we start smoking cigarettes or buy shoes that we cannot really afford in order to
impress others, we do these things not so much because we think they are the right things to
do but rather because we want to be liked.

    We fall prey to normative social influence when we express opinions or behave in ways that
help us to be accepted or that keep us from being isolated or rejected by others. When we engage
in conformity due to normative social influence we conform to social norms -- socially accepted
beliefs about what we do or should do in particular social contexts (Cialdini, 1993; Sherif, 1936;
Sumner, 1906).

    Although in some cases conformity may be purely informational or purely normative, in
most cases the goals of being accurate and being accepted go hand-in-hand, and therefore
informational and normative social influence often occur at the same time. When soldiers obey
their commanding officers, they probably do it both because others are doing it (normative
conformity) and because they think it is the right thing to do (informational conformity). And
when you start working at a new job you may copy the behaviour of your new colleagues
because you want them to like you as well as because you assume they know how things
should be done. It has been argued that the distinction between informational and normative
conformity is more apparent than real and that it may not be possible to fully differentiate them
(Turner, 1991).

    Non-conformity occurs when an individual or group of individuals fail to confirm to rules,
laws, and social norms. Why would some individuals elect to be non-conformists? The need for
uniqueness is a is seen as a trait or temporary motivation resulting from situational triggers.
Some individuals exhibit a greater need to feel different from others or from the anonymous
majority and sometimes there are situations that create this need to feel unique. One situation
that triggers this is when you feel too similar to others making the major position undesirable.
In this case, you opt for nonconformity (Imhoff, et al., 2009).

More on Conformity

Conformity in general is to change one's behavior to match other's response (Cialdini and
Goldstein, 2004). Influence sometimes occurs because we believe that other people have valid
knowledge about an opinion or issue, and we use that information to help us make good
decisions. When we take our winter coat to school because the weatherman says it's going
to be cold, this is because we think that the weatherman has some good information that we
can use. Informational conformity is the change in opinions or behavior that occurs when we
conform to people whom we believe have accurate information. We base our beliefs on those
presented to us by reporters, scientists, doctors, and lawyers because we believe they have
more expertise in certain fields than we have. But we also use our friends and colleagues for

                                                                                                             SOCIAL INFLUENCES | 295
information; when we choose a prom gown on the basis of our friends' advice about what
looks good on us, we are using informational conformity--we believe that our friends have good
judgment about the things that matter to us.

    Normative conformity occurs when we express opinions or behave in ways that help us to be
accepted or that keep us from being isolated or rejected by others. When we engage in normative
conformity we conform to social norms--socially accepted beliefs about what we do or should
do in particular social contexts (Cialdini, 1993; Sherif, 1936; Sumner, 1906).

    In contrast to informational conformity, in which the attitudes or opinions of the individual
change to match that of the influencers, the outcome of normative conformity often
represents public conformity rather than private acceptance. Public conformity is a superficial
change in behavior (including the public expression of opinions) that is not accompanied by
an actual change in one's private opinion. Conformity may appear in our public behavior even
though we may believe something completely different in private. We may obey the speed limit
or wear a uniform to our job (behavior) to conform to social norms and requirements, even
though we may not necessarily believe that it is appropriate to do so (opinion). We may use
drugs with our friends without really wanting to, and without believing it is really right, because
our friends are all using drugs. However, behaviors that are originally performed out of a desire
to be accepted (normative conformity) may frequently produce changes in beliefs to match
them, and the result becomes private acceptance. Perhaps you know someone who started
smoking to please his friends but soon convinced himself that it was an acceptable thing to do.

    Although in some cases conformity may be purely informational or purely normative, in
most cases the goals of being accurate and being accepted go hand-in-hand, and therefore
informational and normative conformity often occur at the same time. When soldiers obey
their commanding officers, they probably do it both because others are doing it (normative
conformity) and because they think it is the right thing to do (informational conformity). It
has been argued that the distinction between informational and normative conformity is more
apparent than real and that it may not be possible to fully differentiate them (Turner, 1991).

Conformity and Individuality in Fashion

As early as 1983, fashion scholars have found that people change their opinions and buying
behaviors conforming to others, such as peers and fashion experts (Davis & Miller, 1983). They
also found that people conform more to these social influences when evaluating future fashion
trends than present trends. This may imply that consumers may be more likely influenced
in a situation that is less known and certain to them. However, fashion has always been a
way of self-expression and to establishing an identity that can be differentiated from others'.
Therefore, consumers constantly negotiate between individuality and conformity to different
degrees in various contexts, trying to find a comfortable spot on the continuum between
individuality and conformity (Park, 1998). For example, Song et al. (2013) found that
consumers' tendency to conformity versus autonomy in fashion largely depends on how well
they are aware of the situation and their objectives in those situations. A person may be more

296 | SOCIAL INFLUENCES
likely to conform to the norm of dressing up for a presentation because they are aware of
the formality of the situation and their goal is to be evaluated positively. However, in order
to perform well, the person may want to dress comfortably too. Thus, the tension between
autonomy and conformity arise, and the person may start negotiating the garment pieces to
choose that can help this tension.

Reference Groups & Social Identity

Reference groups are groups (social groups, work groups, family, or close friends) a consumer
identifies with and may want to join. A reference group helps shape a person's attitudes and
behaviors. The membership in a social group or a social category is a person's social identity
and is part of their self-concept. The membership of these social categories or social groups
can be formal (e.g., members of a club) or informal (a group of friends who share common
interests), and can range from small units such as a family to large, loosely defined categories,
such ethnicity. People form these social identities often through self-categorization.

Categorization and Comparison

Spontaneously, people categorize people into groups just as we categorize furniture or food
into one type or another. The difference is that we categories ourselves, as self-categorization
theory points out (Turner, 1975). Because the attributes of group categories can be either
good or bad, we tend to favor the groups with people like us and incidentally disfavor the
others. In-group favoritism is an ambiguous form of bias because it disfavors the outgroup
by exclusion. For example, authoritarian leaders tend to allocate more national resources to
members of their own tribe, religious sect, or political party. Through social-categorization and
social identity, people may possess blatant biases (also called "explicit biases") are conscious
beliefs, feelings, and behavior that people are perfectly willing to admit, which express hostility
toward other groups (outgroups) while unduly favoring one's own group (in-group).

Types of Reference Groups

Individuals might identify with many types of reference groups, which are defined by the
connections between their members. These groups fall into two types: primary and secondary.

   Primary groups are small, informal collections of individuals who interact with each other
      in personal, direct, and intimate ways.

   Secondary groups are groups to which individuals feel only limited ties.

                                                                                                             SOCIAL INFLUENCES | 297
                        How Reference Groups Influence Individuals

          Role expectation: The role assumed by a person is nothing more than a
             prescribed way of behaving based on the situation and the person's position in
             the situation. Your reference group determines much about how this role is to be
             performed.
             As a student, you are expected to behave in a certain basic way under certain
             conditions.

          Conformity: Conformity is related to our roles in that we modify our behavior in
             order to coincide with group norms. Norms are behavioral expectations that are
             considered appropriate regardless of the position we hold.

          Group communications through opinion leaders: As consumers, we are often
             seeking out the advice of knowledgeable friends or acquaintances who can
             provide information, give advice, or actually make the decision for us. For some
             product categories there are professional opinion leaders who are quite easy to
             identify. For example, auto mechanics, make-up artists, financial advisers, and
             physicians.

          Word-of-mouth ("WOM") influence: Do you have a good dentist? Where's your
             favorite place to go for Pho? What would be a good "first dance" song for a
             wedding? Who's taken Marketing and which instructor should I get?

Aspirational reference groups, on the other hand, are comprised of those individuals who
consumers may not know personally but admire because of their popularity and notoriety. If
you have ever dreamed of being a professional player of basketball or another sport, you have
an aspirational reference group. These figures hold a sort of power over consumers because
others aspire to be like them or live their kind of lifestyles. Famous athletes, musicians, actors,
and other kinds of public figures can represent aspirational reference groups.

    Reference groups, opinion leaders, and aspirational reference groups are essential concepts
in digital marketing, where consumers tap into a variety of social networks and online
communities. Marketers need to understand which groups/leaders influence their target
segments and who those groups or individuals are. Leaders may be bloggers, individuals with
many followers who post frequently on various social media, and even people who write lots
of online reviews. Then marketing activity can focus on winning over the opinion leaders. If you
manage to get the opinion leaders in your segment to "like" your product, "follow" your brand,
tweet about your news and publish favourable reviews or comments on their blogs, your work
with online reference groups is going well.

  How Proximity & Exposure Influence Consumers

      The degree of influence a reference group may have on a consumer depends on two
      factors: proximity and mere exposure. Proximity, or the extent to which people are
      physically near us, influence the relationships we build. Research has found that we
      are more likely to develop friendships with people who are nearby, for instance, those
      who live in the same dorm that we do, and even with people who just happen to sit
      nearer to us in our classes (Back, Schmukle, & Egloff, 2008).

         Proximity has its effect on liking through the principle of mere exposure, which is
      the tendency to prefer stimuli (including but not limited to people) that we have seen
      more frequently. In the months leading up to the Vancouver Winter Olympics in 2010,
      apparel such as hoodies, toques, and mittens were widely available but hardly seen
      on the streets. After the torch relay came to Vancouver, the infamous "red mittens"
      started making an appearance everywhere: eventually after seeing Olympic apparel
      more and more on TV and around time, consumers were buying anything Olympic
      that they could get their hands on. Just by seeing the items more often consumers
      grew to like them enough to buy them.

Influencers

Opinion leaders are people who influence others. They are not necessarily higher-income or
better educated, but perhaps are seen as having greater expertise or knowledge related to some
specific topic. For example, a local high school teacher may be an opinion leader for parents
in selecting colleges for their children. These people set the trend and others conform to the
expressed behaviour. If a marketer can identify the opinion leaders for a group in the target
market, then effort can be directed toward attracting these individuals. For example, if an ice
cream parlor is attempting to attract the local high school trade, opinion leaders at the school
may be very important to its success.

    An information technology (IT) specialist with a great deal of knowledge about computer
brands is another example of an opinion leader. These people's purchases often lie at the
forefront of leading trends. The IT specialist is probably a person who has the latest and
greatest tech products, and their opinion of them is likely to carry more weight with you than
any sort of advertisement.

    An influencer is a type of opinion leaders, but there is a lack of consensus about what
exactly an influencer is. One writer defines them as "a range of third parties who exercise
influence over the organization and its potential customers" (Peck et al., 1999). Another defines
an influencer as a "third party who significantly shapes the customer's purchasing decision
but may never be accountable for it" (Brown & Hayes, 2008). According to another, influencers
are "well-connected, create an impact, have active minds, and are trendsetters" (Keller & Berry,

                                                                                                             SOCIAL INFLUENCES | 299
2003). And just because an individual has a large number of followers does not necessarily
mean they have a large number of influence over those individuals (Cha et al. & Berinato, 2010).

    Sources of influencers vary. Marketers target easily-identifiable influencers, such as
journalists, industry analysts, and high-profile executives. For most business-to-consumer
(B2C) purchases, influencers may include people known to the purchaser and the retail staff.
In high-value business-to-business (B2B) transactions, influencers may be diverse and might
include consultants, government-backed regulators, financiers, and user communities.

                                       One of the most well-known fashion
                                       influencers and bloggers is Chiara Ferragni.

       As of 2020, Ferragni has 19.3 million followers on Instagram ("Chiara Ferragni,"
    2020). Ferragni started her fashion blog in 2009 and by 2014 her business ventured
    grossed about $8 million. Her list of public appearances and enterprising activities is
    extensive: she modeled for Guess and collaborated with Steve Madden; presented at
    awards shows; walked the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival; was a guest judge on
    Project Runway; became a Pantene "global ambassador;" and, became the subject of a
    Harvard Business School case study!

300 | SOCIAL INFLUENCES
Brand & Anti-Brand Communities

A brand community is a group of consumers who share a set of social relationships based upon
usage or interest in a product. Muniz Jr. and O'Guinn (2001) define a brand community as, "a
specialized, non-geographically bound community, based on a structured set of social relations
among admirers of a brand."

    Unlike other kinds of communities, these members typically don't live near each
other--except when they may meet for brief periods at organized events or brandfests that
community-oriented companies such as Jeep, Saturn, or Harley-Davidson sponsor. These
events help owners to "bond" with fellow enthusiasts and strengthen their identification with
the product as well as with others they meet who share their passion.

  That Time TikTok Users & K-Pop Stans Took on the US President

      Sometimes brand communities engage in the most unanticipated ways. For example,
      in June 2020, a historic merging of two brand communities--TikTok users and fans
      of Korean pop music--took place when they united to prank the US President Donald
      Trump by ruining a scheduled campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma on June 19th.
      TikTok users represent a global community of teens and young adults who use the
      platform for social sharing and commenting on videos. Fans of Korean pop music
      are called "K-Pop Stans" and like their TikTok allies, they know a thing or two about
      working with different platforms' algorithms to boost exposure of their videos. June
      19th marks a special day for Black Americans: it commemorates the 1865
      emancipation of enslaved people in the United States. The day has become known
      as, "Juneteeth," and in 2020, young Americans were enraged that the President had
      scheduled a campaign rally in a southern state on such an important holiday.

         TikTok users and KPop Stans--many of whom were not even old enough to vote at
      the time--joined forces and engaged in a wide-scale activism movement that
      involved creating false reservations for the President's campaign rally tickets. Videos
      were created, shared, and then deleted so members outside of these communities
      had no hint at what was being planned. Soon, the message spread like a wildfire on
      Tiktok--go online, reserve a ticket, don't show up, share with others, delete the
      evidence. Even the media had no idea what all these users were up to.

         Within hours of opening the online ticket registration website, the Trump campaign
      was announcing that over a million seats had been reserved (tickets were free, but
      those reserving had to provide address information which of course was falsified by
      the young activists) and an outdoor overflow area had been secured for what they
      believed to be exceptionally high demand to see the President.

         The Tulsa Fire Department reported after the event that the fire marshal counted

                                                                                                             SOCIAL INFLUENCES | 301
      6,200 scanned tickets in attendance (Lorenz et al., 2020) and the outdoor overflow
      area remained empty. Not only had the young activists foiled the President's plans,
      their reservation information (addresses and zip codes) contaminated the
      Republican Party's Contact List making it impossible to separate the legitimate
      Trump supporters from those masking as one.

         Often we hold a narrow view of what brand communities are and how they interact
      within the group. We tend to also see them as a vehicle for larger marketing
      strategies such as advertising and promotional campaigns to draw more attention to
      a brand. However, the Tulsa event tells us otherwise: a brand community exists to
      serve its people (Fournier & Lee, 2009) and participation in that community isn't just
      about the brand itself. In fact, often, "people are more interested in the social inks
      that come form brand affiliations than they are in the brand themselves. They join
      communities to build new relationsips (Fournier & Lee, 2009).

         In June 2020, TikTok users and K-Pop Stans showed the world how online
      communities can come together to organize, mobilize, and become a powerful force
      for change.

"The antithesis of a brand community," writes Hollenbeck & Zinkhan (2006), "is an anti-brand
community. In the same way that brand communities are forming around commonly used
brands, anti-brand communities are forming around common aversions toward brands." Using
the Internet as a vehicle for widespread communications, organization, and activism, anti-brand
communities are also geographically dispersed. They may oppose specific brands (e.g., AirB&B;
Uber; Starbucks; Facebook; Chick-fil-A), but could also oppose large enterprises and corporate
brands (e.g., Monsanto; Nestle; The Weinstein Company; The Trump Organization; Amazon).

  Anti-Brand Communities & Coronavirus

      At the time of writing, our world is experiencing the Coronavirus global pandemic:
      many of us are either living in quarantine; lock down; spatial isolation; and/or some
      other form of extreme social distancing.

         Before Covid19 dominated our news stories and conversations, large cities across
      North America (and presumably in Europe, Asia, and South America), AirBnb, a short-
      term and "lightly" regulated housing and vacation rental site, had been drawing
      criticism for its negative impact on housing affordability and diminishing supply.
      Now, as we all face the necessity of doing our part to "flatten the curve" by staying
      home (which in some parts of the world has been enforced through law), AirBnb
      draws even more criticism from society: homeless rates in most urban centres are

302 | SOCIAL INFLUENCES
 high because affordability and supply have pushed individuals and families to live in
 shelters, cars, or in over-crowded situations. Will there be an appetite for the AirBnb
 business model post-pandemic? Will we return to how things were, or will the AirBnb
 anti-brand community influence consumer activism that will lead to stricter
 regulations and policies governing short-term rentals?

Chapter Reflections

 1. A powerful tool for marketers is forming and leveraging brand community. A dedicated,
      loyal, and passionate consumer base will rally behind their favourite brand and spread
      their joy and enthusiasm far and wide. (That pays more than any Super Bowl ad or guerilla
      marketing campaign ever will). Explore Harvard Business Review's article titled "Get Brand
      Communities Right." Discuss how marketers should think about leveraging a brand
      community as a business strategy and not just for marketing.

 2. You don't need to look much further than the 2016 US Presidential Election to find a
      perfect example of an anti-brand community. The "Boycott Trump" group provides details
      on the brands (Democratic/Liberal) consumers should avoid due to their support or
      allegiance to Trump. See the Ad Week article titled "This Democratic Super PAC's App
      Identifies Which Brands Anti-Trump Shoppers Should Boycott." and discuss the features
      of this anti-brand community and any other similar anti-brand communities you are
      familiar with.

 3. What can we learn about Aritzia's marketing campaign around the release of the Super
      Puff? Explore Geraldine Sebastian's article, "Super Pumped for the Super Puff: The Rise of
      Aritzia via Social Media" and discuss a range of consumer behaviour concepts covered in
      this textbook so far:
       a. The role of celebrity influencers and specifically Kendall Jenner's paid partnership
            with Aritzia.
       b. How the balance theory of attitudes influences (young/teenage) consumers through
            celebrity endorsements.
       c. Aritzia's product line extension strategy and the launch of Mr. Super Puff.
       d. The role Aritzia plays in fueling fast fashion and how the brand can avoid criticism in
            contributing to consumer capitalism.

  Topic 10. Culture and
               Subcultures

Learning Objectives

  In this section, we will learn about the relationship between culture, subcultures, and
  marketing and ways in which cultural concepts influence consumption.

     Upon completing this section, students should:
      1. Define the terms "culture" and "subculture."
      2. Identify the key characteristics of culture and discuss ways in which it is

           learned and shared.
      3. Explain the meaning of cultural appropriation and provide examples of how

           marketers have appropriated cultural aspects to pursue marketing goals.
      4. Explain the complexities around categorizing gender and ethnic subcultures

           and how marketers can avoid perpetuating stereotypes in marketing activities.

                                                                                                                                          309

Key Terms and Concepts

          Acculturation: The process of adopting and adjusting to a new and often
             prevailing (dominant) cultural environment.

          Assimilation: The voluntary or forceful abandonment of one's own culture,
             namely -- values, customs, traditions, language, and identity -- with the intent to
             adopt those of the prevalent (dominant) culture.

          Biases: Beliefs, feelings, and behavior that express hostility or exclude members
             of groups or entire groups themselves.

          Consumer capitalism: A term that describes a material focus on consumption
             where (corporate) profit maximization is achieved as class structures and
             inequalities are exploited.

          Counterculture: A type of subculture that actively opposes and rejects norms,
             values, and symbols that reflect the larger culture in which it exists.

          Cultural appropriation: When features of a non-dominant culture (fashion,
             artifacts, food, language, etc.) are taken and used without consent, respect, and
             handled inappropriately further entrenching dangerous stereotypes about the
             non-dominant culture. Cultural appropriation also occurs when the dominant
             culture engages in "whitewashing" or exploits the cultural object in order to
             benefit from it while justifying the act as a way to "honor" the less dominant
             culture.

          Cultural norms: A set of standards and often unspoken "rules" that members of
             society collectively agree upon to serve as a basis of what's consider acceptable
             behavior.

          Culture: The sum of learned beliefs, values, and customs that help us know how
             to behave as members of society.

          Customs: A term that describes a traditional and widely accepted way of
             behaving in a given society. Customs have existed for many generations and are

                                                                                                   KEY TERMS AND CONCEPTS | 311

             absorbed by mainstream society (dominant culture).
          Discrimination: A type of behavioral bias that results in the deliberate exclusion
             of others.

             information gets shared, what stories get told, what movies get made, and what
             television shows get produced. Gatekeepers control access to information and
             the dissemination of that information to the public.
          Gender: A social and historical construct resulting in a set of culturally invented
             expectations of a "role" (often male or female) one may assume, learn, and
             perform.
          High culture: A term used to describe cultural experiences, symbols, and
             attitudes that are often associated with wealthy of "high class" members of
             society.

314 | KEY TERMS AND CONCEPTS
Culture Explained

In the previous sections we explored some of the different external factors that influence
consumer decision making, such as demographic, social, and situational. In this section we
take a closer look at another external factor, culture: what it is; how it is defined; how it can
change; and, how culture and marketing influence, inform, and reflect one another.

    Since different cultures have different values, consumers have different buying habits.
Marketing strategies should reflect the culture that is being targeted. The strategy should show
the product or service as reinforcing the beliefs, values and customs of the targeted culture.
Failing to do so can result in lost sales and opportunities.

Culture

Culture is the sum of learned beliefs, values, and customs that regulate the behavior of
members of a particular society. Through our culture, we are taught how to adjust to the
environmental, biological, psychological, and historical parts of our environment. Beliefs and
values are guides of behavior, and customs are acceptable ways of behaving. A belief is
an opinion that reflects a person's particular knowledge and assessment of ("I believe that
..."). Values are general statements that guide behavior and influence beliefs and attitudes
("Honesty is the best policy"). A value system helps people choose between alternatives in
everyday life. Customs are overt modes of behavior that constitute culturally approved ways of
behaving in specific situations. Customs vary among countries, regions, and even families

  Culture, Customs, & the Coronavirus

      In 2020, the Coronavirus and Covid19 spread worldwide causing a global pandemic.
      Social distancing--aka physical distancing--measures were put in place in nearly
      every community, city, and country around the world. While we physically distanced
      ourselves from friends, family, neighbors, and strangers on the street and in grocery
      stores, one had to wonder: "how will certain customs change as a result of the
      pandemic?" Infectious disease experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, then Director of
      the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States, said we

                                                                                                             CULTURE EXPLAINED | 315
      should never return to the custom of "shaking hands" with others. In an interview for
      The Journal (2020), Dr. Fauci said, "[w]hen you gradually come back, you don't jump
      into it with both feet. You say, what are the things you could still do and still approach
      normal? One of them is absolute compulsive hand washing. The other is you don't
      ever shake anybody's hands."

For marketers anywhere in the world, it is essential to develop a strong understanding of the
local culture and its accompanying beliefs, values, and customs. Culture is how people make
sense of their society, its institutions, and social order. Culture frames how and what people
communicate, how they express what is proper and improper, what is desirable and detestable.
Without an understanding of culture, marketers are not really even speaking the right language
to the consumers they want to target. Even if the words, grammar, and pronunciation are
correct, the meaning will be off.

Cultural Norms in Society

Just as culture can be seen in dress and food, it can also be seen in morality, identity, and
gender roles. People from around the world differ in their views of premarital sex, religious
tolerance, respect for elders, and even the importance they place on having fun. Similarly, many
behaviors that may seem innate are actually products of culture. Approaches to punishment,
for example, often depend on cultural norms for their effectiveness. In the United States, people
who ride public transportation without buying a ticket face the possibility of being fined. By
contrast, in some other societies, people caught dodging the fare are socially shamed by having
their photos posted publicly. The reason this campaign of "name and shame" might work in one
society but not in another is that members of different cultures differ in how comfortable they
are with being singled out for attention. This strategy is less effective for people who are not as
sensitive to the threat of public shaming.

There are several features of culture that are central to understanding the uniqueness and
diversity of the human mind:

       1. Versatility: Culture can change and adapt. Someone from the state of Orissa, in India,
            for example, may have multiple identities. She might see herself as Oriya when at
            home and speaking her native language. At other times, such as during the national
            cricket match against Pakistan, she might consider herself Indian. This is known as
            situational identity.

       2. Sharing: Culture is the product of people sharing with one another. Humans
            cooperate and share knowledge and skills with other members of their networks. The
            ways they share, and the content of what they share, helps make up culture. Older
            adults, for instance, remember a time when long-distance friendships were
            maintained through letters that arrived in the mail every few months. Contemporary

316 | CULTURE EXPLAINED
            youth culture accomplishes the same goal through the use of instant text messages
            on smart phones.

       3. Accumulation: Cultural knowledge is cumulative. That is, information is "stored." This
            means that a culture's collective learning grows across generations. We understand
            more about the world today than we did 200 years ago, but that doesn't mean the
            culture from long ago has been erased by the new. For instance, members of the
            Haida culture--a First Nations people in British Columbia, Canada--profit from both
            ancient and modern experiences. They might employ traditional fishing practices and
            wisdom stories while also using modern technologies and services.

       4. Patterns: There are systematic and predictable ways of behavior or thinking across
            members of a culture. Patterns emerge from adapting, sharing, and storing cultural
            information. Patterns can be both similar and different across cultures. For example,
            in both Canada and India it is considered polite to bring a small gift to a host's home.
            In Canada, it is more common to bring a bottle of wine and for the gift to be opened
            right away. In India, by contrast, it is more common to bring sweets, and often the gift
            is set aside to be opened later.

Culture is Learned

It's important to understand that culture is learned. People aren't born using chopsticks or being
good at soccer simply because they have a genetic predisposition for it. They learn to excel
at these activities because they are born in countries like Taiwan, where chopsticks are the
primary eating utensils, or countries like Argentina, where playing soccer is an important part
of daily life. So, how are such cultural behaviors learned? It turns out that cultural skills and
knowledge are learned in much the same way a person might learn to do algebra or knit. They
are acquired through a combination of explicit teaching and implicit learning -- by observing
and copying.

    Cultural teaching can take many forms. It begins with parents and caregivers, because
they are the primary influence on young children. Caregivers teach kids, both directly and by
example, about how to behave and how the world works. They encourage children to be polite,
reminding them, for instance, to say "Thank you." They teach kids how to dress in a way that is
appropriate for the culture. They introduce children to religious beliefs and the rituals that go
with them. They even teach children how to think and feel! Adult men, for example, often exhibit
a certain set of emotional expressions -- such as being tough and not crying -- that provides
a model of masculinity for their children. This is why we see different ways of expressing the
same emotions in different parts of the world.

    In some societies, it is considered appropriate to conceal anger. Instead of expressing their
feelings outright, people purse their lips, furrow their brows, and say little. In other cultures,
however, it is appropriate to express anger. In these places, people are more likely to bare their
teeth, furrow their brows, point or gesture, and yell (Matsumoto, Yoo, & Chung, 2010). Such

                                                                                                             CULTURE EXPLAINED | 317
patterns of behavior are learned. Often, adults are not even aware that they are, in essence,
teaching psychology -- because the lessons are happening through observational learning.

    Let's consider a single example of a way you behave that is learned, which might surprise
you. All people gesture when they speak. We use our hands in fluid or choppy motions -- to
point things out, or to pantomime actions in stories. Consider how you might throw your hands
up and exclaim, "I have no idea!" or how you might motion to a friend that it's time to go.
Even people who are born blind use hand gestures when they speak, so to some degree this
is a universal behavior, meaning all people naturally do it. However, social researchers have
discovered that culture influences how a person gestures. Italians, for example, live in a society
full of gestures. In fact, they use about 250 of them (Poggi, 2002)! Some are easy to understand,
such as a hand against the belly, indicating hunger. Others, however, are more difficult. For
example, pinching the thumb and index finger together and drawing a line backwards at face
level means "perfect," while knocking a fist on the side of one's head means "stubborn."

  Culture: A Learning Process

      The understanding of culture as a learned pattern of views and behaviors is
      interesting for several reasons. First, it highlights the ways groups can come into
      conflict with one another. Members of different cultures simply learn different ways
      of behaving. Modern youth culture, for instance, interacts with technologies such as
      smart phones using a different set of rules than people who are in their 40s, 50s, or
      60s. Older adults might find texting in the middle of a face-to-face conversation rude
      while younger people often do not.

         These differences can sometimes become politicized and a source of tension
      between groups. One example of this is Muslim women who wear a hijab, or head
      scarf. Non-Muslims do not follow this practice, so occasional misunderstandings
      arise about the appropriateness of the tradition. Second, understanding that culture
      is learned is important because it means that people can adopt an appreciation of
      patterns of behavior that are different than their own. For example, non-Muslims
      might find it helpful to learn about the hijab. Where did this tradition come from?
      What does it mean and what are various Muslim opinions about wearing one?

         Finally, understanding that culture is learned can be helpful in developing self-
      awareness. For instance, people from the United States might not even be aware of
      the fact that their attitudes about public nudity are influenced by their cultural
      learning. While women often go topless on beaches in Europe and women living a
      traditional tribal existence in places like the South Pacific also go topless, it is illegal
      for women in some of the United States to do so. These cultural norms for
      modesty--reflected in government laws and policies- also enter the discourse on
      social issues such as the appropriateness of breast-feeding in public. Understanding

      that your preferences are--in many cases--the products of cultural learning might
      empower you to revise them if doing so will lead to a better life for you or others.

Often the differences between cultures can be identified through a closer examination of each
culture's unique practices and beliefs involving symbols, myths, rituals, and rites of passage.

  Symbols, Myths, Rituals & Rites of Passage

      A symbol is an object, word, or action that stands for something else, depending on
      the culture. Everything one does throughout their life is based and organized through
      cultural symbolism, which is when something represents abstract ideas or concepts.
      Symbols can represent a group or organization that one is affiliated with and mean
      different things to different people, which is why it is impossible to hypothesize how
      a specific culture will symbolize something. Some symbols are gained from
      experience, while others are gained from culture. One of the most common cultural
      symbols is language.

         Myths and rituals are the stories and practices that define a culture. A myth is a
      story with symbolic elements that represents a culture's ideals. Each culture creates
      its own stories to help its members understand the world. Many companies (and
      perhaps most advertising agencies) are in a sense in the myth business; they tell us
      stories that we collectively absorb. Some marketers tell these stories more overtly
      than others: Disney stages about 2,000 Cinderella weddings every year; the princess
      bride wears a tiara and rides to the park's lakeside wedding pavilion in a horse-drawn
      coach, complete with two footmen in gray wigs and gold lam pants (Marr, 2007;
      Holson, 2003). And the Shrek movies remind us that even the ugliest suitor can land
      the princess if his heart is in the right place.

         A ritual is a set of multiple symbolic behaviors that occurs in a fixed sequence and
      is repeated periodically (Rook, 1985). We all engage in private consumer rituals,
      whether this involves grooming activities that we perform the same way every
      morning or that obligatory trip to Starbucks on the way to school. Gift-giving is also a
      type of ritual: birthdays, weddings, anniversaries, house-warmings, and even
      Valentine's are examples of celebrations involving gift-giving rituals. And as
      members of a culture we share public rituals such as watching the Olympics, the
      WorldCup, or even tuning in each week to vote on our favorite reality show (such as
      American Idol, or the Voice). Advertisers often create messages that tie in to these
      myths and rituals, such as selling HDTVs for the Super Bowl and Doritos to share
      with your friends as you watch the game.

                                                                                                             CULTURE EXPLAINED | 319
         Beyond observational learning, cultures also use rituals to teach people what is
      important. For example, young people who are interested in becoming Buddhist
      monks often have to endure rituals that help them shed feelings of "specialness" or
      superiority -- feelings that run counter to Buddhist doctrine. To do this, they might be
      required to wash their teacher's feet, scrub toilets, or perform other menial tasks.
      Similarly, many Jewish adolescents go through the process of bar and bat mitzvah.
      This is a ceremonial reading from scripture that requires the study of Hebrew and,
      when completed, signals that the youth is ready for full participation in public
      worship.

         Rites of Passage are a common type of ritual that often taken place to mark a
      significant change or transition in a person's life. These may occur to mark happy
      occasions, such as graduations, weddings, or having children and more sombre
      occasions such as the passing away of a loved one. The rituals surrounding rites of
      passage differ from one culture to another and can even be diverse within a culture.
      Marketers may position their products or services as necessary components to
      accompany a rite of passage: be it a young person's "first shave," a couple's
      engagement announcement, or a family's first pet.

Understanding the changing nature of culture is the first step toward appreciating how it helps
people. The concept of cultural intelligence is the ability to understand why members of other
cultures act in the ways they do. Rather than dismissing foreign behaviors as weird, inferior,
or immoral, people high in cultural intelligence can appreciate differences even if they do not
necessarily share another culture's views or adopt its ways of doing things.

Cultural Gatekeepers

In 1960, journalist A. J. Liebling (1904-1963) wryly observed that "freedom of the press is
guaranteed only to those who own one." Although he may not have put it in those terms,
Liebling was talking about the role of gatekeepers in the media industry, another way in
which cultural values influence mass communication. Gatekeepers are the people who help
determine which stories make it to the public, including reporters who decide what sources
to use, and editors who pick what gets published and which stories make it to the front
page. Media gatekeepers are part of culture and thus have their own cultural values, whether
consciously or unconsciously. In deciding what counts as newsworthy, entertaining, or relevant,
gatekeepers use their own values to create and shape what gets presented to the wider public.

    Observing how distinct cultures and subcultures present the same story can be indicative of
those cultures' various cultural values. Another way to look critically at today's media messages
is to examine how the media has functioned in the world and in your own country during
different cultural periods.

320 | CULTURE EXPLAINED
    Have you ever heard a story in the news -- say a major political or sports headline --
discussed by two (or more) media outlets in a completely opposing manner? Perhaps the
politician or athlete has been applauded by one outlet, and then vilified by another? Media
gatekeepers are part of culture and thus have their own cultural values, whether consciously or
unconsciously. In deciding what counts as newsworthy, entertaining, or relevant, gatekeepers
use their own values to create and shape what gets presented to the wider public. Conversely,
gatekeepers may decide that some events are unimportant or uninteresting to consumers.
Those events may never reach the eyes or ears of a larger public.

    From a market perspective, consider the role of media & entertainment gatekeepers and
the power they possess over what we watch on TV and which movies we see in the theatre. If
gatekeepers green light entertainment that perpetuates gender stereotypes in TV and the white-
washing of historical events in film, what effect does this have on our collective understanding
of culture?

  Representation & Gatekeepers

      In their article, "Cultural stereotypes as gatekeepers: increasing girls' interest in
      computer science and engineering by diversifying stereotypes," Cheryan, Master, and
      Meltzoff (2015) discuss how gatekeepers can have a profound impact on
      representation. Despite having made significant inroads into many traditionally male-
      dominated fields (e.g., biology, chemistry), women continue to be underrepresented
      in computer science and engineering. Computer science and engineering are
      stereotyped in modern American culture as male-oriented fields that involve social
      isolation, an intense focus on machinery, and inborn brilliance. These stereotypes are
      compatible with qualities that are typically more valued in men than women in
      American culture. As a result, when computer science and engineering stereotypes
      are salient, girls report less interest in these fields than their male peers.

         Popular movies and television shows like Real Genius, The Big Bang Theory, and
      Silicon Valley depict computer scientists and engineers as mostly white (and more
      recently Asian) males, socially unskilled, and singularly obsessed with technology.
      Similarly, portrayals of technology companies in popular newspapers and books
      often depict the "startup culture" that infuses some technology and engineering jobs
      (e.g., Guo, 2014; Miller, 2014). This is unfortunate because in reality such portrayals
      depict at best only a small percentage of the jobs in computer science and
      engineering (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2014). Yet high-school students report that
      their ideas about what scientists are like are influenced more by the media than by
      any other source (Steinke et al., 2007). Even brief exposures to television portrayals
      can influence attitudes toward the group portrayed (Weisbuch et al., 2009).

         However, altering these stereotypes--by broadening the representation of the

                                                                                                             CULTURE EXPLAINED | 321
      people who do this work, the work itself, and the environments in which it
      occurs--significantly increases girls' sense of belonging and interest in the field.
      Academic stereotypes thus serve as gatekeepers, driving girls away from certain
      fields and constraining their learning opportunities and career aspirations.

Acculturation, Assimilation, & Multiculturalism

There is tremendous ethnic, linguistic, and cultural diversity throughout Canada and the United
States, largely resulting from a long history and ongoing identification as a "nation of
immigrants" that attracted millions of newcomers from every continent. Still, elected officials
and residents ardently disagree about how the United States should approach this diversity
and incorporate immigrant, ethnic, and cultural minority groups into the larger framework of
American society.

    The fundamental question is whether cultural minority groups should be encouraged to
forego their ethnic and cultural identities and acculturate to the values, traditions, and customs
of mainstream culture or should be allowed and encouraged to retain key elements of their
identities and heritages. This is a highly emotional question. Matters of cultural identity are
often deeply personal and associated with strongly held beliefs about the defining features of
their countries' national identities.
Assimilation encourages and may even demand that members of ethnic and immigrant
minority groups abandon their native customs, traditions, languages, and identities as quickly
as possible and adopt those of mainstream society--"When in Rome, do as the Romans do."
Advocates of assimilation generally view a strong sense of national unity based on a shared
linguistic and cultural heritage as the best way to promote a strong national identity and
avoid ethnic conflict. They point, for example, to ethnic warfare and genocide in Rwanda and
the former Yugoslavia during the 1990s and to recent independence movements by French
Canadians in Quebec and in Scotland as evidence of negative consequences of groups
retaining a strong sense of loyalty and identification with their ethnic or linguistic communities.
The "English as the Official Language" movement in the United States is another example.
People are concerned that U.S. unity is weakened by immigrants who do not learn to speak
English. In recent years, the U.S. Census Bureau has identified more than 300 languages spoken
in the United States. In 2010, more than 60 million people representing 21 per cent of the total
U.S. population spoke a language other than English at home and 38 million of those people
spoke Spanish.

  Cultural Concepts in Everyday Marketing

      In marketing, when a product becomes removed or disassociated with its original
      ethnic group, we call this process de-ethnicization. These items become absorbed
      by a mainstream or dominant culture, much in the way bagels, pasta, and yoga have.

         Belk, Wallendorf, & Sherry (1991) write that, "for many people, consumption has
      become a vehicle for achieving transcendent experiences." Whether we are adorning
      ourselves with tattoos that carry meaning, symbol, and significance or bidding on a
      limited pair of custom Nike sneakers, consumer behavior has deep roots in sacred
      consumption practices. While sacralization describes the process of everyday
      objects, people, or events developing sacred status (the locks of hair from my baby's
      first haircut; the collar that belonged to my first pet; and, my grandmother's Scrabble
      board that I inherited are all sacred items to me), de-sacralization describes the
      opposite of that. We see the erasure of sacred symbolism, or the de-sacralization of
      objects, people, or events, occur when sacred items become absorbed and
      commercialized in pop culture and the greater consumer culture.

         Consider the over-hyped consumerism surrounding Halloween and Christmas. I
      once went to a (fabulous) brewery in the town Haarlem (The Netherlands) that used
      to be a former church! The term we apply to consumer objects and events are
      ordinary and absent of any sacred meaning or association is profane. Profane
      consumption is a term used to describe the kinds of purchases we make that are
      part of our everyday lives. Renewing my gym membership, attending a professional
      workshop, or picking up take-out on the way home from work are examples of
      profane consumption.

Multiculturalism takes a different view of assimilation, arguing that ethnic and cultural diversity
is a positive quality that enriches a society and encouraging respect for cultural differences.
The basic belief behind multiculturalism is that group differences, in and of themselves, do
not spark tension, and society should promote tolerance for differences rather than urging
members of immigrant, ethnic, and cultural minority groups to shed their customs and
identities. Vivid examples of multiculturalism can be seen in major cities across the United
States, such as New York, where ethnic neighborhoods such as Chinatown and Little Italy
border one another, and Los Angeles, which features many diverse neighborhoods, including
Little Tokyo, Koreatown, Filipinotown, Little Armenia, and Little Ethiopia.

    The ultimate objective of multiculturalism is to promote peaceful coexistence while allowing
each ethnic community to preserve its unique heritage and identity. Multiculturalism is the
official governmental policy of Canada; it was codified in 1988 under the Canadian
Multiculturalism Act, which declares that "multiculturalism reflects the cultural and racial

                                                                                                             CULTURE EXPLAINED | 323

society to preserve, enhance, and share their cultural heritage."

  Student Op-Ed: America, If You Had to Pick...The Statue of Liberty
  or a Bottle of Coke?

      Coca-Cola's unrivaled and global success is primarily due to its ability to establish
      itself as an American cultural symbol. Solomon (2017, p.429) defines a symbol as an
      "object that represents something else" or a physical manifestation of a set of
      beliefs. In the case of Coca-Cola, the brand has long represented the western notions
      of freedom and individuality and is, to date, synonymous with American culture.

         Coca-Cola's integration into mass culture in the U.S.A. speaks to its prominence
      and popularity within American culture. Consider the fact that in 1986 Atlanta, a
      parade was held to celebrate a joint-centennial of Coca-Cola and the Statue of
      Liberty (Lilienheim Angelico, 1998, Part III, 2:42--3.10). Furthermore, during the 1996
      Atlanta Olympic games torch rally, the brand is displayed alongside and is in equal
      proportion to the Olympic rings (Lilienheim Angelico, 1998, Part III, 4:44 - 4:51). In
      both instances, Coca-Cola is positioned as a wholly celebrated American symbol of
      freedom and the American dream, one which is worthy of the world's attention. Not
      only does this signify the weight that the brand carries but it also demonstrates how
      a brand can establish its longevity by weaving itself into national culture.

         Aside from its global recognition as an American symbol, Coca-Cola soon became
      a fortress brand, which Solomon (2017) defines as a brand that becomes embedded
      in our everyday life. In the same way that tea was a household drink in China, England
      or India or wine in Italy, Coca-Cola was a staple drink at dinner tables in the U.S.A.
      (Lilienheim Angelico, 1998, Part III, 3:52 - 4:18). According to the documentary, the
      average family in 1978 Rome, Georgia alone consumed 3,200 bottles of coke a year
      (Lilienheim Angelico, 1998, Part II, 14:05- 14:45).

         If making your mark on the world stage or anchoring your product into a daily ritual
      wasn't enough to transform a brand into a global corporate giant, try shifting an
      entire culture. Brands are constantly shaped by cultural values and norms, however,
      the circular nature of this relationship also means that some brands have the power
      to influence culture and impact a society's value system. Haddon Sundblom's
      interpretation of St. Nicolas as an old, stout, and jolly man in a "Coca-Cola red" suit in
      a 1931 advertisement soon became the widely-accepted image of the holiday figure
      known today (Lilienheim Angelico, 1998, Part I, 21:15 - 21:46). Although, it originated
      as a concept for Coca-Cola's marketing, this image of Santa is one that is now
      ingrained in western culture.

324 | CULTURE EXPLAINED
    While it is impressive that Coca-Cola has reached this status, I can't help but think
 of the immense influence that brands like Coca-Cola have on our lives and our
 culture, whether we know it or not. I was extremely shocked and a little disappointed
 to discover the origin story of the modern version of Santa Claus. The values of
 authenticity and tradition that I once attributed to the Christmas holiday seem to
 have disappeared now that I know the figure central to the holiday was but a mere
 character in a Coca-Cola advertisement. I understand that brands operate as
 capitalist entities in order to survive but it is concerning when their conscious
 marketing efforts inadvertently shift behaviours within culture or erode rich traditions
 and practices altogether.

Culture and Marketing

For as long as marketing has been a practiced profession, marketers have been creating
stereotypes and perpetuating the wrongful depictions of gender and ethnic sub-cultures within
a dominant Euro-Western context. An important theme in this book is the relationship between
marketing and culture: this book seeks to identify how these two influence and inform one
another. When marketers create products that draw on inaccurate stereotypes what impact do
these have on society's perspectives and understanding of non-dominant cultures in Canada
and the United States?

Bias, Stereotypes & Discrimination

People are often biased against others outside of their own social group, showing prejudice
(emotional bias), stereotypes (cognitive bias), and discrimination (behavioral bias). In the past,
people used to be more explicit with their biases, but during the 20th century, when it became
less socially acceptable to exhibit bias, such things like prejudice, stereotypes, and
discrimination became more subtle (automatic, ambiguous, and ambivalent). In the 21st
century, with social group categories even more complex, biases may be transforming yet
again.

                                 Whether we are aware of it or not (and usually we're
                                 not), we sort the world into "us" and "them" categories.

                                                                                                     CULTURE AND MARKETING | 329
Understanding Bias

Most people like themselves well enough, and most people identify themselves as members
of certain groups but not others. Logic suggests, then, that because we like ourselves, we
therefore like the groups we associate with more, whether those groups are our hometown,
school, religion, gender, or ethnicity. Liking yourself and your groups is human nature. The larger
issue, however, is that own-group preference often results in liking other groups less. And
whether you recognize this favortism as wrong, this trade-off is relatively automatic, that is,
unintended, immediate, and irresistible.

  The Implications of Own-Group Preference

      How might own-group preference influence the decisions we make as consumers?
      Perhaps it causes us to become loyal to particular brands or companies while
      completely omitting others from consideration? It may even influence us to the
      extent that we'll pay more for an item -- looking past the more reasonably-priced
      generic option -- to ensure that brand association reinforces our preferences. The
      role of own-group preference plays into our own self-concept which often informs
      our consumer decision making.

         Own-group preference also influences our purchasing behaviors by holding us
      back from making excessive "impulse" buys: due to our need for extensive
      evaluation, we may require more time to ensure our decision is both informed and
      aligned with how we perceive ourselves as consumers and how we want others to
      perceive us. Brands play a powerful role in distinguishing us not only as individual
      consumers, but also as members of larger consumer groups.

Stereotypes in Marketing

It should come as no surprise that cultural stereotypes (the positive or negative beliefs that
we hold about the characteristics of a racial or ethnic group) inform societal views in a way
that does real harm to those affected. Stereotypes (historical and contemporary) have played a
significant role in shaping peoples' attitudes towards others. Stereotypes are deeply embedded
within many structures of our society such as education and entertainment. When stereotypes
are used repeatedly in advertisements, television shows, Hollywood movies, and even depicted
on cereal boxes, a young mind grows to accept them as reality. This reality not only shapes
one's attitude, it directly effects how an adult judges and behaves towards others. Teachers,
law makers, artists, religious leaders, designers, politicians, movie makers, and marketers have
all had their attitudes shaped by stereotypes: over time, they accepted these stereotypes as
an accurate reflection of the past and a indisputable image of society today. When we fail to
address stereotypes we fail every member of our societies.

330 | CULTURE AND MARKETING
    For this reason, the interconnection between marketing and culture is often easier to see
than to break. More often than not, the burden of ending the creation and perpetuation of
stereotypes falls to those targeted by the stereotyping. Everyone has a moral responsibility to
call out stereotyping and seize to benefit and profit from it.

  Stereotypes in Advertising

      Advertisements have a long history of relying on stereotypical characters to promote
      products. For many years Aunt Jemima sold pancake mix and Rastus was a grinning
      Black chef who pitched Cream of Wheat hot cereal. The Gold Dust Twins were Black
      urchins who peddled a soap powder for Lever Brothers and Pillsbury hawked
      powdered drink mixes using characters such as "Injun Orange" and "Chinese
      Cherry"--who had buck teeth.

         These negative depictions began to decline in the 1960s as the civil rights
      movement gave more power to racialized groups and their rising economic status
      began to command marketers' respect. Frito-Lay responded to protests by the
      Hispanic community and stopped using the "Frito Bandito" character in 1971, and
      Quaker Foods gave Aunt Jemima a makeover in 1968 (plaid headband) and in 1989
      (pearl earrings and a lace collar) (Hsu, 2020; Westerman, 1989). As part of its fiftieth-
      anniversary celebration for Crest toothpaste, Procter & Gamble reintroduced its
      "Crest Kid," who first appeared in 1956 as a "white bread," apple-cheeked girl painted
      by artist Norman Rockwell. It's telling that the new Crest Kid is Cuban American.

         Similarly, a recent campaign gives a radical makeover to the Black Uncle Ben
      character who appeared on rice packages for more than sixty years dressed as a
      servant. (White Southerners once used "uncle" and "aunt" as honorary names for
      older African Americans because they refused to address them as "Mr." and "Mrs.")
      The character is remade as Ben (just Ben), an accomplished businessman with an
      opulent office who shares his "grains of wisdom" about rice and life on the brand's
      web site (Elliot, 2007).

         In 2020, the Aunt Jemima brand was in the spotlight again and called out for its
      continued use of both a racist name and imagery. This time, a TikTok video that went
      viral brought attention to the brand's racist history and Quaker Oats (owned by
      PepsiCo since 2001) announced that it would retire the name and change the
      packaging (Hsu, 2020).

         These positive steps are motivated by both good intentions and pragmatism.
      Ethnic consumers spend more than $600 billion a year on products and services.
      Immigrants make up 10 per cent of the U.S. population, and California is less than

                                                                                                     CULTURE AND MARKETING | 331
      half white. Advertisers and their agencies couldn't ignore this new reality even if they
      wanted to.

Cultural Appropriation

Cultural appropriation is defined as "the taking--from a culture that is not one's own--of
intellectual property, cultural expressions or artifacts, history and ways of knowledge." (Ziff
& Rao, 1997, p.1). There is increasing evidence that a culture's aspects are "borrowed" by
outsiders that cause profound offense to insiders (Rogers, 2006; Young, 2005).

Sanga Song and Nokyeon Kim (2020) conducted qualitative research to understand students'
perceptions and experiences with cultural appropriation and how they can be better informed
through education. A total of 116 business students from the midwest (USA) participated
in their study which involved discussion forum questions & answers and some follow-up
interviews. Below are some of the findings from their research.

   Recognizing & understanding: The respondents defined cultural appropriation as follows:
      (1) done by outsiders, (2) for their personal interest, (3) in an inappropriate or
      disrespectful way, (4) without knowing the background of the culture, and (5) without
      permission or acknowledgment. A lack of credit or appreciation of the original culture is
      the main issue of cultural appropriation (Rogers, 2006). Respondents also pointed out
      that, as opposed to cultural appreciation, which embraces the history behind a specific
      ritual or belief and cherishes it respectively, cultural appropriation takes artifacts or
      cultural property without permission to exploit it in ways that are disapproved.

   Applying & analyzing: Respondents shared various examples of cultural appropriation
      they experienced in their daily lives. Examples included sports teams (e.g., Washington
      Redskins) using Native American tribal names or images as mascots, fashion brands
      (e.g., Gucci, Marc Jacobs) showcasing white models wearing Sikh turbans or faux
      dreadlocks, computer games (e.g., Far Cry 3, Overwatch) inspired by Maori and Samoan
      cultures, and white artists in historically African American music genres (e.g., Hip-Hop,
      Reggae, R&B). Respondents also identified several instances of cultural appropriation
      from celebrity cases (e.g., Kim Kardashians' cornrows, Katy Perry's geisha costume,
      Rhianna's chola makeup, Zac Efron's dreadlocks) to ordinary people wearing Navajo
      headdresses or henna tattoos at music festivals or Native American Halloween
      costumes. This could be harmful, as they misrepresent or create racial stereotypes of
      already marginalized or colonized cultures (Rogers, 2006).

   Evaluating & creating: To avoid appropriating or misrepresenting a culture or community,
      respondents indicated that education is the most important. Respondents suggested that
      marketers or designers should research the history of a culture before deciding to use its
      elements. Respondents also recommended that working with diverse groups at school or

332 | CULTURE AND MARKETING
      at work would be helpful in understanding and experiencing different cultures. Testing a
      design or advertisement with people of diverse backgrounds before releasing it to the
      public was also recommended.

Cultural Appropriation & Indigenous Mascots

In 2018, Teen Vote writer Heather Davidson wrote an op-ed entitled, "How Racism Against
Native People Is Normalized, From Mascots to Costumes" bringing this important topic into
the spotlight once again. First Nations, Mtis, and Inuit Peoples have been raising this issue
for a long time, but often their explanations have either gone ignored or unheard. Davidson, a
Dena'ina Athabascan and Unangan (Aleutian) who lives in California made clear in her piece
that Indigenous Mascots and Native costumes are more than an act of ignorance -- they are an
act of colonial violence.

    Cultural appropriation occurs when, "our images, symbols, and cultures are used as
commodities and novelties. Natives are used as logos, from butter packaging to cigarettes to
baking soda to clothing. Natives are used as Halloween costumes. Native tribe names are used
by the U.S. military as names for weapons. Native tribe names are used as names for vehicles.
Natives are used as mascots for spots teams" (Davidson, 2018).

    Cultural appropriation is a form of racism that has become "normalized," argues Davidson.
Settler Canadians and Americans have become so conditioned to seeing appropriated images
and hearing appropriated names that we often fail to identify it and call it out. In 2019, Mariah
Gladstone, Amskapiikuni, Tsalagi (Blackfeet, Cherokee) wrote a Twitter thread about the harm
behind the use of Native mascots in sports and how their use exasperates racism. Mariah and
I transformed her thread into the piece below so students could better understand how cultural
appropriation is a harmful practice that must end.

  The Problems with Indigenous Mascots

      Feeling the need to make a Twitter thread on WHY Native mascots are harmful (and
      no, it's not about our delicate little feelings). The following is a summary on some of
      the actual effects of these mascots.

         Clinical psychologist Michael Friedman, the author of, "The Harmful Psychological
      Effects of the Washington Football Mascot" stated in his report that, "[a] series of
      studies show that if Native Americans are shown images of stereotypical Native
      American mascots...self-esteem goes down, belief in community goes down, belief in
      achievement goes down, and mood goes down" (Friedman, n.d.).

         Friedman's study also gives evidence to how Native mascots exacerbates racism.
      "Similarly, if someone who is non-Native American sees a stereotypical image of a

                                                                                                     CULTURE AND MARKETING | 333
      Native American mascot, their association with the Native American community also
      gets worse" (Friedman, n.d.).

         Beyond the studies, we also recognize that the representation of Native people as
      mascots is often homogenous (presents all tribes as interchangeable), historical
      (pre-1900 at least), and highly stereotyped. The result of such displays are the
      perception that all Indigenous nations have the same cultural identifiers, that we
      exist only in the past, and that we are "savage," warlike, or stoic (see: Noble Indian
      trope).

         When young people (both Native and non-Native) are exposed to these images,
      they internalize their idea of what Native people are supposed to be. Clearly, the
      belief in homogeneous Indian figures harms our representation and challenges our
      ability to communicate issues facing our specific communities. Obviously, it also
      contributes to other cultural mishmashes (see: Victoria Secret model w/ headdress,
      leopard print, turquoise). The general concept of Native People as existing only in the
      past is something I find especially damaging. It is perpetuated across media,
      including the textbooks. In fact... "A staggering 87 per cent of references to American
      Indians in all 50 states' academic standards portray them in a pre-1900 context"
      (Wade, 2017).

         What effect does this have on us now? Great question! Obviously it means that
      Native issues are ignored. Few individuals have Indigenous issues on their radar at
      all. Thanks to Michael Friedman's report and Lisa Wade's examination of the effects
      of Indigenous erasure in our school system, the data tell us that when Indigenous
      issues are acknowledged, people are inclined to think of us in a negative light. Which
      brings me to that pesky notion that we are "savage." Or silent. Or spiritual and talk to
      wolves and eagles. These are all hurdles to gaining traction when first we must
      dismantle stereotypes about ourselves.

         In 2013, NPR's Tell Me More host Michel Martin spoke with Michael Friedman and
      NPR science correspondent Shankar Vedantam about the research Friedman
      conducted regarding the impacts of Indigenous mascots. "[The data help] us get
      past what's been a constant refrain in the debate over these mascots. One side says,
      `Look, we're offended.' The other side says, `Look, we don't mean to give any offense.'
      And you end up with a he-said, she-said battle of opinions" ("Can a Mascot," 2013).

         Vedantam goes on to say that, "[t]he data seem to show at a pretty general level
      that there is a disconnect between how people think about these issues consciously
      and unconsciously." You can have a positive view of Native mascots but
      unconsciously they are still causing harm. In summary, this isn't about our delicate
      snowflake dispositions, but rather, the actual measurable harm that Native mascots
      have on our communities. No amount of "get over it" will change that. Now that

                               racism and racist beliefs by non-Indigenous people.

Capitalism & Consumer Culture

Brands fulfill consumers' needs and wants above and beyond providing a mere utilitarian
function. The branding and advertising industry is based on not only satisfying consumers'
needs and wants, but also fabricating them when they don't exist (consider the cola market
and Chia Pets). Branding allows competitors to differentiate one another based on positioning,
status, uniqueness, values, personality, image, and other non-tangible qualities.

    While consumerism is defined as a social practice and process of consuming goods that
are intended for exchange (Ertman & Williams, 2005), consumer capitalism is, "a particular
type of society permeated with unjust class structures and social lives dominated by consumer
lifestyles, wherein a person's well-being and happiness depend, to a large extent on their
consumption habits (Bauman, 2005, 2007, 2009)." Quentin Wheeler-Bell (2014) explains further
that consumer capitalism is tied to profit maximization and the reconfiguring of social spaces
such as schools, the Internet, media outlets, and even the body.

    Consumer capitalism is most evident in the changes we see in consumer behaviour and
mass marketing (or advertising) over the last century. The emphasis change has gone from
consumer "needs" to consumer "wants" and beyond that, an anticipation of how those wants
will further evolve. Marketers anticipate these wants by designing and launching brands that
become the "next best thing" and a "solution to a problem" you never knew you had in the first
place.

336 | CULTURE AND MARKETING
    Consumer capitalism combines profit maximization with a consumer's self-concept in the
practice of marketing beauty, diet, and fashion products that encourage buyers to (re)create
their identities. Wheeler-Bell calls this the "pleasurable, expressive and performative aspect of
the consumer" an integral part of the capitalism structure. We see this same type of consumer
culture play out in the environmental movement where consumers purchase products to
support their own identity and consumer narrative of being "environmental conscious" or "free-
trade" supportive when the very system in which they consume is structured on inequality,
exploitation, and profit maximization.

    In actuality, consumer capitalism lures consumers into making purchases that reinforce
narratives that can be racist (the "Noble Savage"), normalize racial segregation ("ethnically
correct Barbie dolls"), and exasperate inequalities ("Darjeeling Tea"). Explore these topics more
in the pieces below.

  The Myth of the Ecologically Noble Savage

      The image of the noble savage developed many centuries ago in Western culture.
      From the beginning of European exploration and colonialism, Europeans described
      the "natives" they encountered primarily in negative terms, associating them with
      sexual promiscuity, indolence, cannibalism, and violence. The depictions changed as
      Romantic artists and writers rejected modernity and industrialization and called for
      people to return to an idealized, simpler past. That reactionary movement also
      celebrated Indigenous societies as simple people living in an Eden-like state of
      innocence. French painter Paul Gauguin's works depicting scenes from his travels to
      the South Pacific are typical of this approach in their celebration of the colorful,
      easygoing, and natural existence of the natives. The continuing influence of these
      stories is evident in Disney's portrayal of Pocahontas and James Cameron's 2009
      film Avatar in which the primitive Na`vi are closely connected to and defenders of an
      exotic and vibrant natural world. Cameron's depiction, which includes a sympathetic
      anthropologist, criticizes Western capitalism as willing to destroy nature for profit.

         Despite its positive portrayals of Indigenous groups, the idea of the ecologically
      noble savage tends to treat Indigenous Peoples as an imagined "Other" constructed
      as the opposite of Western culture rather than endeavoring to understand the world
      views and complexities of Indigenous cultures. Similarly, a naive interpretation of
      Indigenous environmentalism may merely project an imaginary Western ideal onto
      another culture rather than make a legitimate observation about that culture on its
      own terms.

                                                                                                     CULTURE AND MARKETING | 337
  Transforming Barbie Dolls

                              Ethnically correct dolls and toys have often reinforced
                              segregation and haven't address systemic problems
                              involving race and class.

         Consumers in capitalist systems continuously attempt to reshape the meaning of
      the commodities that businesses brand, package, and market to us. The
      anthropologist Elizabeth Chin conducted ethnographic research among young
      African American children in a poor neighborhood of New Haven, Connecticut,
      exploring the intersection of consumption, inequality, and cultural identity. Chin
      specifically looked at "ethnically correct" Barbie dolls, arguing that while they may
      represent some progress in comparison to the past when only white Barbies were
      sold, they also reinforce outdated understandings of biological race and ethnicity.
      Rather than dismantling race and class boundaries, the "ethnic" dolls create
      segregated toy shelves that in fact mirror the segregation that young black children
      experience in their schools and neighborhoods.

         The young black girls that Chin researched were unable to afford these $20 brand-
      name dolls and typically played with less expensive, generic Barbie dolls that were
      white. The girls used their imaginations and worked to transform their dolls by giving
      them hairstyles like their own, braiding and curling the dolls' long straight hair in
      order to integrate the dolls into their own worlds. A quick perusal of the Internet
      reveals numerous tutorials and blogs devoted to black Barbie hair styling,
      demonstrating that the young New Haven girls are not the only ones working to
      transform these store-bought commodities in socially meaningful ways.

Darjeeling Tea

                          Colonialism created unequal systems around the world and
                          consumer capitalism may not benefit those most impact by
                          colonial systems.

     The anthropologist Sarah Besky researched Darjeeling tea production in India to
  better understand how consumer desires are mapped onto distant locations. In India,
  tea plantation owners are attempting to reinvent their product for 21st century
  markets through the use of fair-trade certification and Geographical Indication Status
  (GI). GI is an international property-rights system, regulated by the World Trade
  Organization, that legally protects the rights of people in certain places to produce
  certain commodities. For example, bourbon must come from Kentucky, Mezcal can
  only be produced in certain parts of Mexico, and sparkling wine can only be called
  champagne if it originated in France.

     Similarly, in order to legally be sold as "Darjeeling tea," the tea leaves must come
  from the Darjeeling district of the Indian state of West Bengal. Besky explores how
  the meaning of Darjeeling tea is created through three interrelated processes: (1)
  extensive marketing campaigns aimed at educating consumers about the unique
  Darjeeling taste, (2) the application of international law to define the geographic
  borders within which Darjeeling tea can be produced, and (3) the introduction of tea
  plantation-based tourism.

     What the Darjeeling label hides is the fact that tea plantations are highly unequal
  systems with economic relationships that date back to the colonial era: workers
  depend upon plantation owners not just for money but also for food, medical care,
  schools, and housing. Even when we pay more for Darjeeling tea, the premium price
  is not always returned to the workers in the form of higher wages. Bescky's research
  shows how capitalism and market exchange shapes the daily lives of people around
  the world.

                                                                                                 CULTURE AND MARKETING | 339
The work of a conscientious and responsible marketer is rarely seen in popular Hollywood
films and HBO television series. There is an excess of glam, glitz, and spontaneous creativity,
which seduces the young copy writer or designer into the industry that is measure by market
share, profits, and share value. Both on and off-screen, there is a real representation problem in
marketing and advertising. The industry is dominated by straight, white, men who have shaped
our cultural and understanding of cultural norms through marketing imagery and messages.
Female, BIPOC, disabled, and transgender consumers (just to name a few) are absent from the
creative briefs and market research which lead to further representation problems.

    Try to examine the work of marketers outside of a capitalism framework: who is doing the
work, who is getting hurt by the work, and who is most benefiting from the work? Marketing
educators have a duty to emphasize to our students that the work of marketers should be
considered a privilege, not a right. If we take our work seriously and engage in it more
responsibly, there should be no excuses for perpetuating stereotypes, exploiting inequalities,
and leading with bias.

Gender: A Cultural and
Marketing Perspective

Racial stereotypes are not the only issue facing consumers today: the use of gender
stereotypes in marketing and advertising are also in need of elimination. The wrongful depiction
of genders has manifested into systemic discrimination; prolific inequality and inequity; and
profoundly negative effects on self-esteem and self-worth. Whether the marketing examples
depict rape culture, hyper-sexualized girls, or toxic masculinity, gender stereotypes are shaping
attitudes and informing judgements and behavior. Gender, as we've come to understand it, is in
fact merely a fabricated identity!

    The terms sex and gender are frequently used interchangeably, though they have different
meanings. In this context, sex refers to the biological category of male or female, as defined
by physical differences in genetic composition and in reproductive anatomy and function.
On the other hand, gender refers to the cultural, social, and psychological meanings that are
associated with masculinity and femininity (Wood & Eagly, 2002). You can think of "male" and
"female" as distinct categories of sex (a person is typically born a male or a female), but
"masculine" and "feminine" as continuums associated with gender (everyone has a certain
degree of masculine and feminine traits and qualities).

    Beyond sex and gender, there are a number of related terms that are also often
misunderstood. Gender roles are the behaviors, attitudes, and personality traits that are
designated as either masculine or feminine in a given culture. It is common to think of gender
roles in terms of gender stereotypes, or the beliefs and expectations people hold about the
typical characteristics, preferences, and behaviors of men and women. A person's gender
identity refers to their psychological sense of being male or female. In contrast, a
person's sexual orientation is the direction of their emotional and erotic attraction toward
members of the opposite sex, the same sex, or both sexes.

                                                              GENDER: A CULTURAL AND MARKETING PERSPECTIVE | 343
  Gender, Identity, & Sex

      Historically, the terms gender and sex have been used interchangeably. Because of
      this, gender is often viewed as a binary - a person is either male or female - and it is
      assumed that a person's gender matches their biological sex. This is not always the
      case, however, and more recent research has separated these two terms. While the
      majority of people do identify with the gender that matches their biological sex
      (cisgender), an estimated 0.6% of the population identify with a gender that does not
      match their biological sex (transgender; Flores, Herman, Gates, & Brown, 2016). For
      example, an individual who is biologically male may identify as female, or vice versa.

         In addition to separating gender and sex, recent research has also begun to
      conceptualize gender in ways beyond the gender binary. Genderqueer or gender
      nonbinary are umbrella terms used to describe a wide range of individuals who do
      not identify with and/or conform to the gender binary. These terms encompass a
      variety of more specific labels individuals may use to describe themselves. Some
      common labels are genderfluid, agender, and bigender. An individual who is
      genderfluid may identify as male, female, both, or neither at different times and in
      different circumstances. An individual who is agender may have no gender or
      describe themselves as having a neutral gender, while bigender individuals identify
      as two genders.

         It is important to remember that sex and gender do not always match and that
      gender is not always binary; however, a large majority of prior research examining
      gender has not made these distinctions. As such, the following sections will discuss
      gender as a binary.

The Enculturation Process

We now understand that cultures, not nature, create the gender ideologies that go along with
being born male or female and the ideologies vary widely, cross-culturally. What is considered
"man's work" in some societies, such as carrying heavy loads, or farming, can be "woman's
work" in others. What is "masculine" and "feminine" varies: pink and blue, for example, are
culturally invented gender-color linkages, and skirts and "make-up" can be worn by men, indeed
by "warriors."

    Masculinity studies goes beyond men and their roles to explore the relational aspects of
gender. One focus is the enculturation processes through which boys learn about and learn
to perform "manhood." Many U.S. studies (and several excellent videos, such as Tough Guise
by Jackson Katz), have examined the role of popular culture in teaching boys our culture's key
concepts of masculinity, such as being "tough" and "strong," and shown how this "tough guise"
stance affects men's relationships with women, with other men, and with societal institutions,

344 | GENDER: A CULTURAL AND MARKETING PERSPECTIVE
reinforcing a culture of violent masculinity. Sociologist Michael Kimmel has further suggested
that boys are taught that they live in a "perilous world" he terms "Guyland."

Smoking Advertisements and Women

In 1968, a cigarette company in the United States
decided to target women as tobacco consumers
and used a clever marketing campaign to entice
them to take up smoking. "You've come a long
way, baby!" billboards proclaimed. Women,
according to the carefully constructed rhetoric, had
moved away from their historic oppressed status
and could -- and should -- now enjoy the full
complement of twentieth-century consumer
pleasures. Like men, they deserved to enjoy
themselves and relax with a cigarette.

The campaigns were extremely successful;

within several years, smoking rates among women

had increased dramatically. But had women really

come a long way? We now know that tobacco             Marketing to women has often been

(including in vaporized form) is a highly addictive   out-dated and out-of-touch
                                                      reflecting a male dominance in the
substance and that its use is correlated with a host advertising industry.

of serious health conditions. In responding to the

marketing rhetoric, women moved into a new sphere of bodily pleasure and possibly

enjoyed increased independence, but they did so at a huge cost to their health. They

also succumbed to a long-term financial relationship with tobacco companies who

relied on addicting individuals in order to profit. Knowing about the structures at work

behind the scenes and the risks they took, few people today would agree that

women's embrace of tobacco represented a huge step forward.

   Perhaps saying "You've come a long way, baby!" with the cynical interpretation with
which we read it today can serve as an analogy for our contemporary explorations of
gender and culture. Certainly, many women in the United States today enjoy
heightened freedoms. We can travel to previously forbidden spaces, study disciplines
long considered the domain of men, shape our families to meet our own needs, work
in whatever field we choose, and, we believe, live according to our own wishes. But
we would be naive to ignore how gender continues to shape, constrain, and inform
our lives. The research and methods of anthropology can help us become more
aware of the ongoing consequences of our gendered heritage and the ways in which

GENDER: A CULTURAL AND MARKETING PERSPECTIVE | 345
      we are all complicit in maintaining gender ideologies that limit and restrict people's
      possibilities.

         By committing to speak out against subtle, gender-based discrimination and to
      support those struggling along difficult paths, today's anthropologists can emulate
      pioneers such as Franz Boas and Margaret Mead, who sought to fuse research and
      action. May we all be kinder to those who differ from the norm, whatever that norm
      may be. Only then will we all -- women, men and those who identify with neither
      category -- have truly come a long way. (But we will leave the infantilizing "baby" to
      those tobacco companies!)

Gender Stereotyping

How do our gender roles and gender stereotypes develop and become so strong? Many of our
gender stereotypes are so strong because we emphasize gender so much in culture (Bigler &
Liben, 2007). For example, males and females are treated differently before they are even born.
When someone learns of a new pregnancy, the first question asked is "Is it a boy or a girl?"
Immediately upon hearing the answer, judgments are made about the child: Boys will be rough
and like blue, while girls will be delicate and like pink.

    Different treatment by gender begins with parents. A meta-analysis of research from the
United States and Canada found that parents most frequently treated sons and daughters
differently by encouraging gender-stereotypical activities (Lytton & Romney, 1991). Fathers,
more than mothers, are particularly likely to encourage gender-stereotypical play, especially in
sons. Children do a large degree of socializing themselves. By age 3, children play in gender-
segregated play groups and expect a high degree of conformity. Children who are perceived
as gender atypical (i.e., do not conform to gender stereotypes) are more likely to be bullied
and rejected than their more gender-conforming peers. Gender stereotypes typically maintain
gender inequalities in society.

    How does marketing contribute to gender stereotypes, and thus gender inequalities in
society? Well, have you been to a children's toy store recently? There is a clear delineation
between "girls'" toys and "boys'" toys when you walk down the aisles. How do children's toys
reinforce stereotypes and contribute to enculturation? Explore the op-ed below to learn more
about how sex-typed products work against gender equality.

346 | GENDER: A CULTURAL AND MARKETING PERSPECTIVE
Student Op-Ed: Child's Play Solving Adult Problems

  Despite the recent promising efforts to dispel ancient gender norms, there is one
  place you're bound to find them ever present. If you haven't been inside a toy store
  lately, prepare yourself for a clear delineation between the genders. Sex-typed
  children's toys simply reinforce already entrenched gender roles and stereotypes,
  which only confine play and restrict imagination. According to Solomon (2017), these
  are toys with masculine or feminine attributes that align with and reinforce gender
  archetypes, which may influence children to form identities that fit these molds. On
  the other hand, gender-non-specific toys foster agency and collaboration and
  encourage children to create and imagine freely.

     In an episode of Abstract; The Art of Design, Cas Holman, the inventor of
  Rigamajig and Geemo, states that the toys in the market are too prescribed; they
  underestimate how sophisticated children are and restrict play to the confines of a
  gender binary (Chai Vasarhelyi, 2019). The need for toys to be sorted by gender
  illustrates the concept of uncertainty avoidance, which Solomon (2017) regards as
  society's intolerance and avoidance of uncertainty and ambiguity. However, Holman
  stands in opposition to this need for predictability. She contends that deep learning
  takes place when children discover something on their own, without the aid of color-
  coding or rigid instructions (Chai Vasarhelyi, 2019). This is a part of Holman's greater
  philosophy: "Easy is boring" (Chai Vasarhelyi, 2019, 41:53). Most toy manufacturers
  today make toys that do not encourage critical thinking; typically, there is only one
  way to play with these toys, which children find boring after a while (Chai Vasarhelyi,
  2019). According to the designer, it is "not something children get something out of"
  (Chai Vasarhelyi, 2019, 12:22).

     Sex-typed toys expose children to gender stereotypes, reinforce binary role playing
  and fail to foster collaborative and imaginative play among different genders. In
  many cultures where a gender binary is fundamental to identity formation, children
  grow up adhering to enacted norms. These might prescribe what boys and girls
  should and should not do, thereby defining children's abilities and the expectations
  placed upon them. In fulfilling these roles, children receive positive reinforcement
  and encouragement to maintain these identities as they mature. Here, the notion of
  enculturation also comes into effect, which refers to the processes of learning the
  beliefs and behaviours embedded within a dominant culture (Solomon, 2017).
  Holman states that children, through play, learn to be either hyper-masculine or
  hyper-feminine because those are the only options available (Chai Vasarhelyi, 2019).
  The designer condemns this - "There are children who like pink, and children who
  like blue. Why have we assigned that to boys and girls? It's absurd" (Chai Vasarhelyi,
  2019, 28:34). Note the themes of violence and power that can be attributed to G.I.

                                                           GENDER: A CULTURAL AND MARKETING PERSPECTIVE | 347
      Joe advertisements, which rely on production elements such as rock music, bold
      color tones, and a narrator using his lowest, `manliest' voice to present a hyper-
      masculine model of a man. Conversely, the use of pink tones in Barbie ads, the focus
      on appearance and servitude, as well as the sexualization of the doll create norms
      for what it is to be a girl in western society.

         Holman argues that toys should encourage learning and creativity rather than
      assigning roles. She believes that good toys help children grow to become good
      people (Chai Vasarhelyi, 2019). In this sense, gender-non-specific toys help children
      develop a sense of agency; they are free to form and execute their own ideas, which
      encourages deep learning (Chai Vasarhelyi, 2019). Based on children's reactions to
      playing with Rigamajig, a giant wooden construction set, Holman concludes that
      children appreciate being entrusted with responsibility; they are playing with real
      material and are free to build something larger than themselves (Chai Vasarhelyi,
      2019). These open-ended toys encourage thinking outside gender archetypes and
      foster collaboration and team building from an early age (Chai Vasarhelyi, 2019).
      According to Holman, "if we can play together, we can live together" (Chai Vasarhelyi,
      2019, 43:31).

         Growing up, I would sneak over to my neighbor's home and play with her giant
      Barbie collection. We would build homes out of Lego and create a whole imaginary
      life. I also vividly remember, my parents forbidding me to play with dolls because,
      "that's not what boys do." That was the first time I noticed the different expectations
      placed on boys and girls. More so than playing with dolls, I enjoyed the time I spent
      with my neighbor. Looking back, I smile thinking about the imaginative stories we
      used to create and the mini-plays we'd put on for anyone we could perform to. For
      this reason, I think it's incredibly important that children have as many options as
      possible to play and collaborate together, rather than separately. The hyper-
      masculine and hyper-feminine notions of what it is to be a boy and a girl, simply
      perpetuate stereotypes and contribute to gender inequality. The variation in
      personalities, preferences, and ideas among children is far too complex to fit into
      these limited binary selection of mainstream toys today. Gender-non-specific toys, on
      the other hand, encourages limitless play, unbounded by the confines of gender
      norms. As a result, it fosters valuable life-long skills like creativity, agency and,
      collaboration.

Subcultures

A subculture is a group of people who share a set of secondary values, such as
environmentalists. Many factors can place an individual in one or several subcultures. People
of a subculture are part of a larger culture but also share a specific identity within a smaller
group.

                   Important Factors Comprising "Subculture"

          Material Culture: People with similar income may create a subculture. The poor,
             the affluent, and the white-collar middle class are examples of material
             subcultures.

          Social Institutions: Those who participate in a social institution may form a
             subculture. Examples include participation in marriage, parenthood, a retirement
             community, or the army.

          Belief System: People with shared beliefs may create a subculture, such as a
             religious group or political party. For example, traditional Amish do not use
             electricity and automobiles.

          Aesthetics: Artistic people often form a subculture of their own associated with
             their common interests, such as art, music, dance, drama, and folklore.

          Language: People with similar dialects, accents, and vocabulary can form a
             subculture. Southerners and Northerners are two traditional categories in the
             U.S.

Thousands of subcultures exist within Canada and the United States. Ethnic and racial groups
share the language, food, and customs of their heritage. Other subcultures are united by shared
experiences. Biker culture revolves around a dedication to motorcycles. Some subcultures
are formed by members who possess traits or preferences that differ from the majority of
a society's population. The body modification community embraces aesthetic additions to
the human body, such as tattoos, piercings, and certain forms of plastic surgery. In Canada

                                                                                                                      SUBCULTURES | 351
and the United States, adolescents often form subcultures to develop a shared youth identity.
Alcoholics Anonymous offers support to those suffering from alcoholism. But even as
members of a subculture band together, they still identify with and participate in the larger
society.

Consumption Subcultures

     College and university-aged students represent both an age-cohort and a subculture who may
     share similar consumption needs and wants.

Subcultures, such as college students, can develop in response to people's interests,
similarities, and behaviors that allow marketing professionals to design specific products for
them. You have probably heard of the "sneakerhead" subculture; hip-hop subculture; people who
in engage in extreme types of sports such as helicopter skiing; or, those who play the fantasy
game Dungeons and Dragons.

    Many people might be surprised to know that the Hipster subculture dates back to the early
1900's and is a unique subculture that has evolved over the last century.

  The Evolution of American Hipster Subculture

      Skinny jeans, chunky glasses, and T-shirts with vintage logos--the American hipster
      is a recognizable figure in the modern United States. Based predominately in
      metropolitan areas, sometimes clustered around hotspots such as the Williamsburg
      neighborhood in New York City, hipsters define themselves through a rejection of the
      mainstream. As a subculture, hipsters spurn many of the values and beliefs of U.S.
      culture and prefer vintage clothing to fashion and a bohemian lifestyle to one of
      wealth and power. While hipster culture may seem to be the new trend among young,
      middle-class youth, the history of the group stretches back to the early decades of
      the 1900s.

                                                                                                                      SUBCULTURES | 353
   Where did the hipster culture begin? In the early
1940s, jazz music was on the rise in the United
States. Musicians were known as "hepcats" and
had a smooth, relaxed quality that went against
upright, mainstream life. Those who were "hep" or
"hip" lived by the code of jazz, while those who
were "square" lived according to society's rules.
The idea of a "hipster" was born.

The hipster movement spread, and young people,

drawn to the music and fashion, took on attitudes

and language derived from the culture of jazz.        In the 1940s, U.S. hipsters were
Unlike the vernacular of the day, hipster slang was   associated with the "cool" culture
purposefully ambiguous. When hipsters said, "It's     of jazz.

cool, man," they meant not that everything was good, but that it was the way it was.

   By the 1950s, the jazz culture was winding down and many traits of hepcat culture
were becoming mainstream. A new subculture was on the rise. The "Beat
Generation," a title coined by writer Jack Kerouac, were anti-conformist and anti-
materialistic. They were writers who listened to jazz and embraced radical politics.
They bummed around, hitchhiked the country, and lived in squalor.

   The lifestyle spread. College students, clutching copies of Kerouac's On the Road,
dressed in berets, black turtlenecks, and black-rimmed glasses. Women wore black
leotards and grew their hair long. Herb Caen, a San Francisco journalist, used the
suffix from Sputnik 1, the Russian satellite that orbited Earth in 1957, to dub the
movement's followers "Beatniks." As the Beat Generation faded, a new, related
movement began. It too focused on breaking social boundaries, but it also advocated
freedom of expression, philosophy, and love. It took its name from the generations
before; in fact, some theorists claim that Beats themselves coined the term to
describe their children. Over time, the "little hipsters" of the 1970s became known
simply as "hippies."

   Today's generation of hipsters rose out of the hippie movement in the same way
that hippies rose from Beats and Beats from hepcats. Although contemporary
hipsters may not seem to have much in common with 1940s hipsters, the emulation
of nonconformity is still there. In 2010, sociologist Mark Greif set about investigating
the hipster subculture of the United States and found that much of what tied the
group members together was not based on fashion, musical taste, or even a specific
point of contention with the mainstream. "All hipsters play at being the inventors or
first adopters of novelties," Greif wrote. "Pride comes from knowing, and deciding,
what's cool in advance of the rest of the world. Yet the habits of hatred and

354 | SUBCULTURES
      accusation are endemic to hipsters because they feel the weakness of everyone's
      position--including their own" (Greif 2010). Much as the hepcats of the jazz era
      opposed common culture with carefully crafted appearances of coolness and
      relaxation, modern hipsters reject mainstream values with a purposeful apathy.

         Young people are often drawn to oppose mainstream conventions, even if in the
      same way that others do. Ironic, cool to the point of non-caring, and intellectual,
      hipsters continue to embody a subculture, while simultaneously impacting
      mainstream culture.

Subcultures, according to social media expert Scott Huntington, are often targeted to generate
revenue, explaining that, "it's common to assume that subcultures aren't a major market for
most companies. Online apps for shopping, however, have made significant strides. Take Etsy,
for example. It only allows vendors to sell handmade or vintage items, both of which can
be considered a rather "hipster" subculture. However, retailers on the site made almost $900
million in sales" (Post, n.d.).

Race & Ethnicity as Subcultures

When subcultures are discussed in the context of race and ethnicity it's important to first
understand these concepts clearly.

    The terms race and ethnicity are similar and there is a degree of overlap between them. The
average person frequently uses the terms "race" and "ethnicity" interchangeably as synonyms
and anthropologists also recognize that race and ethnicity are overlapping concepts. Both
race and ethnic identity draw on an identification with others based on common ancestry and
shared cultural traits. A race is a social construction that defines groups of humans based
on arbitrary physical and/or biological traits that are believed to distinguish them from other
humans. An ethnic group, on the other hand, claims a distinct identity based on cultural
characteristics and a shared ancestry that are believed to give its members a unique sense
of peoplehood or heritage. The cultural characteristics used to define ethnic groups vary;
they include specific languages spoken, religions practiced, and distinct patterns of dress,
diet, customs, holidays, and other markers of distinction. In some societies, ethnic groups are
geographically concentrated in particular regions, as with the Kurds in Turkey and Iraq and the
Basques in northern Spain.

    Many individuals view their ethnicity as an important element of their personal and social
identity. Numerous psychological, social, and familial factors play a role in ethnicity, and ethnic
identity is most accurately understood as a range or continuum populated by people at every
point. One's sense of ethnicity can also fluctuate across time. Children of Korean immigrants
living in an overwhelmingly white town, for example, may choose to self-identify simply as
"American" during their middle school and high school years to fit in with their classmates and

                                                                                                                      SUBCULTURES | 355
then choose to self-identify as "Korean," "Korean American," or "Asian American" in college or
later in life as their social settings change or from a desire to connect more strongly with their
family history and heritage. Do you consider your ethnicity an important part of your identity?
Why do you feel the way you do?

    A few traditions, such as favorite family recipes or distinct customs associated with the
celebration of a holiday, that originated in their homelands may be retained by family members
across generations, reinforcing a sense of ethnic heritage and identity today. More recent
immigrants are likely to retain more of the language and cultural traditions of their countries
of origin. Non-European immigrants groups from Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Latin America,
and the Caribbean also experience significant linguistic and cultural losses over generations,
but may also continue to self-identify with their ethnic backgrounds if they do not feel fully
incorporated into U.S, society because they "stick out" physically from Euro-American society
and experience prejudice and discrimination. Psychological, sociological, and anthropological
studies have indicated that retaining a strong sense of ethnic pride and identification is
common among ethnic minorities in the United States and other nations as a means of coping
with and overcoming societal bigotry.

  "Dude, what are you?!"

      Justin D. Garcia is an author and professor of Cultural Anthropology. In his chapter,
      "Race and Ethnicity" which is featured in the open publication, Perspectives: An Open
      Invitation to Cultural Anthropology, he writes about his own personal experiences
      (and professional fascination) with presumptive conclusions regarding his race and
      ethnicity. Below is an exert from that chapter.

             Throughout my life, my physical appearance has provided me with countless unique
             and memorable experiences that have emphasized the significance of race and
             ethnicity as socially constructed concepts in America and other societies. My
             fascination with this subject is therefore both personal and professional; a lifetime of
             questions and assumptions from others regarding my racial and ethnic background
             have cultivated my interest in these topics. I noticed that my perceived race or
             ethnicity, much like beauty, rested in the eye of the beholder as individuals in different
             regions of the country (and outside of the United States) often perceived me as
             having different specific heritages. For example, as a teenager living in York County,
             Pennsylvania, senior citizens and middle-aged individuals usually assumed I was
             "white," while younger residents often saw me as "Puerto Rican" or generically
             "Hispanic" or "Latino." When I lived in Philadelphia, locals mostly assumed I was
             "Italian American," but many Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, and Dominicans, in the City of
             Brotherly Love often took me for either "Puerto Rican" or "Cuban."

                I have a rather ambiguous physical appearance--a shaved head, brown eyes, and a
             black mustache and goatee. Depending on who one asks, I have either a "pasty white"
             or "somewhat olive" complexion, and my last name is often the single biggest factor

356 | SUBCULTURES
             that leads people on the East Coast to conclude that I am Puerto Rican. My
             experiences are examples of what sociologists Michael Omi and Howard Winant
             (1986) referred to as "racial commonsense"--a deeply entrenched social belief that
             another person's racial or ethnic background is obvious and easily determined from
             brief glances and can be used to predict a person's culture, behavior, and personality.
             Reality, of course, is far more complex. One's racial or ethnic background cannot
             necessarily be accurately determined based on physical appearance alone, and an
             individual's "race" does not necessarily determine his or her "culture," which in turn
             does not determine "personality." Yet, these perceptions remain.

High Culture & Pop Culture

Do you prefer listening to opera or hip hop music? Do you like watching horse racing or
NASCAR? Do you read books of poetry or celebrity magazines? In each pair, one type of
entertainment is considered high-brow and the other low-brow. Sociologists use the term high
culture to describe the pattern of cultural experiences and attitudes that exist in the highest
class segments of a society. People often associate high culture with intellectualism, political
power, and prestige. In America, high culture also tends to be associated with wealth. Events
considered high culture can be expensive and formal--attending a ballet, seeing a play, or
listening to a live symphony performance.

    The term popular culture refers to the pattern of cultural experiences and attitudes that exist
in mainstream society. Popular culture events might include a parade, a soccer (football) game,
or the season finale of a television show. Rock and pop music--"pop" is short for "popular"--are
part of popular culture. Popular culture is often expressed and spread via commercial media
such as radio, television, movies, the music industry, publishers, and corporate-run websites.
Popular culture is known and accessible to most people: you can share a discussion of favorite
football teams with a new coworker or comment on Game of Thrones (or another popular
show) when making small talk in line at the grocery store. But if you tried to launch into a
deep discussion on the classical Greek play Antigone, few members of society today would be
familiar with it.

    Although high culture may be viewed as superior to popular culture, the labels of high culture
and popular culture vary over time and place. Shakespearean plays, considered pop culture
when they were written, are now part of our society's high culture. Five hundred years from now,
will our descendants associate Breaking Bad with the cultural elite?

                                                                                                                      SUBCULTURES | 357
  Influences in "Pop" Culture

      Anthropologists sometimes turn to unconventional information sources as they
      explore gendered culture, including popular television commercials. Interestingly, the
      2015 Super Bowl commercials produced for the Always feminine product brand also
      focused on gender themes in its #Likeagirl campaign, which probed the damaging
      connotations of the phrases "throw like a girl" and "run like a girl" by first asking boys
      and girls to act out running and throwing, and then asking them to act out a girl
      running and throwing. A companion clip further explored the negative impacts of
      anti-girl messages, provoking dialogue among Super Bowl viewers and in social
      media spaces (though, ironically, that dialogue was intended to promote
      consumption of feminine products). As the clips remind us, while boys and men play
      major roles in perceptions related to gender, so do the women who raise them, often
      reinforcing gendered expectations for play and aspiration. Of course, women, like
      men, are enculturated into their culture's gender ideology. Both girls and boys -- and
      adults -- are profoundly influenced by popular culture.

Counterculture

Sociologists distinguish subcultures from countercultures, which are a type of subculture that
rejects some of the larger culture's norms and values. In contrast to subcultures, which operate
relatively smoothly within the larger society, countercultures might actively defy larger society
by developing their own set of rules and norms to live by, sometimes even creating communities
that operate outside of greater society.

  Counterculture in the USA: 1950's-1970's

      In the United States, the counterculture of the 1960s became identified with the
      rejection of conventional social norms of the 1950s. Counterculture youth rejected
      the cultural standards of their parents, especially with respect to racial segregation
      and initial widespread support for the Vietnam War.

         As the 1960s progressed, widespread tensions developed in American society that
      tended to flow along generational lines regarding the war in Vietnam, race relations,
      sexual mores, women's rights, traditional modes of authority, and a materialistic
      interpretation of the American Dream. Hippies became the largest countercultural
      group in the United States. The counterculture also had access to a media eager to
      present their concerns to a wider public. Demonstrations for social justice created
      far-reaching changes affecting many aspects of society.

         The counterculture in the United States lasted from roughly 1964 to 1973 --

358 | SUBCULTURES
 coinciding with America's involvement in Vietnam -- and reached its peak in 1967,
 the "Summer of Love. " The movement divided the country: to some Americans,
 these attributes reflected American ideals of free speech, equality, world peace, and
 the pursuit of happiness; to others, the same attributes reflected a self-indulgent,
 pointlessly rebellious, unpatriotic, and destructive assault on America's traditional
 moral order.

    The counterculture collapsed circa 1973, and many have attributed its collapse to
 two major reasons: First, the most popular of its political goals -- civil rights, civil
 liberties, gender equality, environmentalism, and the end of the Vietnam War -- were
 accomplished. Second, a decline of idealism and hedonism occurred as many
 notable counterculture figures died, the rest settled into mainstream society and
 started their own families, and the "magic economy" of the 1960s gave way to the
 stagflation of the 1970s.

Fashion and Political
Consumerism

   Political consumerism refers to consumer
choices influenced by political or ethical
considerations, with the aim to challenge
objectionable institutional or market practices
(Micheletti, 2003; Stolle et al., 2005). This can
take the form of boycotting--avoiding certain
products, brands, or stores--or buycotting,
which involves deliberately purchasing from
brands or stores, that align with a specific
cause. As social media has grown, so has
political consumerism. Today, networks of Rana Plaza Collapse that Killed more than 1100
like-minded individuals use social platforms to apparel manufacturing workers
share information and promote alternative
consumption choices that reflect their values (Bossy, 2014).

    Political consumerism is often described as "individualized collective action" because it is
driven by personal values while contributing to broader societal goals. For instance, a consumer
might individually adopt a plastic-free lifestyle, refusing to purchase plastic products as a
personal contribution to the fight against climate change. Others may join organized
movements that collectively make ethical consumption choices and advocate for systemic
change. Political consumerism is closely linked to civic engagement, which addresses public
concerns, compared to traditional political participation, and its goals can vary widely. These
may include supporting local businesses, reducing food waste, or advocating for human rights.

                                                                                                     POLITICAL CONSUMERISM | 361
                             Protesters at the Rana Plaza site

Fashion serves as a powerful arena for political consumerism in two key ways. First, consumers
can influence fashion industry practices by demanding change through their consumption
choices. A striking example is the Fashion Revolution movement, which emerged after the 2013
Rana Plaza disaster in Bangladesh, where over 1,100 garment workers lost their lives while
producing clothing for brands like Dior and Saint Laurent. In response, consumers took to social
media to demand greater transparency and ethical accountability and boycotted fast fashion
brands that failed to meet ethical standards.

                           Fashion Revolution #FashRev is a consumer movement in
                           response to the Rana Plaza collapse.

Second, fashion itself can be used as a tool for advocacy. Clothing choices can send powerful

362 | POLITICAL CONSUMERISM
messages about identity, values, and causes. For example, during the women's suffrage
movement, women make fashion and even anti-fashion consumption choices by rejecting
restrictive clothing as an act of defiance against gender norms. Similarly, wearing the six-
stripe rainbow flag has become a widely recognized symbol of LGBTQ rights. Through both
consumption and self-expression, political consumerism continues to shape the fashion
industry and its role in social change.
