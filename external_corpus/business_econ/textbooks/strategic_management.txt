Why do some companies outperform others? In a dynamic and competitive busi-
ness environment, the answer to this question can be the difference between
success and failure. Firms that are successful generally have a strategic man-
agement process that helps them set goals and execute on a clear vision.

This textbook offers an introduction to the key topics and themes of strategic
management. The authors draw on examples of familiar companies and person-
alities to illustrate the different strategies used by today's firms - and how they
go about implementing those strategies. Students will learn hot to conduct a
case analysis, measure organizational performance, and conduct external and
internal analyses. In short, they will understand how organizations operate at the
strategic level to be successful.

Strategic Management is intended for a wide range of business students
including those majoring in marketing, management, business administration,
accounting, finance, real estate, business information technology, and hospi-
tality and tourism. It is ideal for a senior capstone course in an undergraduate
business program. It is available online for free in multiple formats and also as
affordable print editions.

Introduction

Goals for this Book

This textbook is intended for seniors in undergraduate business programs taking a capstone course in strategic
management. Most business school students begin with a broad introductory business course before
concentrating on courses in their major. This textbook and corresponding course, MGT 4394 "Strategic
Management," are designed for the other end of the business curriculum. More specifically, the goal is to
refocus business students from their major at the end of their time in school and help them understand
how businesses become successful by leveraging their competitive advantages. While it is true that strategic
management functions are typically the purview of senior leadership in a company, newly minted business
graduates and their employers directly benefit when new employees understand their role in helping their
organization to strategically achieve its goals.

About this Book

The book begins with a general introduction to the key themes and topics of strategic management. In the
chapters that follow students first learn how to conduct a case analysis, measure organizational performance,
and conduct external and internal analyses. Next they learn the various strategies used by firms: business/
competitive level, corporate level, international, and innovation strategies. The final two chapters focus on
implementing strategy and corporate ethics. Ethical considerations are integrated throughout the textbook.

Target Audience

This textbook is intended for a wide range of business students including those majoring in marketing,
management, business administration, accounting, finance, real estate, business information technology, and
hospitality and tourism. Ideally, students in each of these majors will take a strategic management course
during their final semester before graduation. This book will guide them through this course as they prepare to
transition from the classroom to a competitive business marketplace.

The vignettes, illustrations, and examples use companies and personalities that today's student would be
familiar with. The pictures in the book should add interest to the student.

Major terms that students need to know are hyperlinked with definitions. These terms and definitions are also
provided in a glossary at the end of the book.

Textbook Development

Strategic Management is an adaptation of a previously published textbook (more on this below). A group of six
strategic management instructors in the Pamplin College of Business at Virginia Tech were involved in deeply
adapting, revising, supplementing, and developing that work into the textbook you are now reading. Kennedy,
who had taught the course multiple times and served as the course coordinator, took the role of primary
contributor and chief textbook reviser. The other five, all Ph.Ds in strategy or a related field, served as editors.

2 | Introduction
In addition, the Research and Editorial Assistant, a recent Pamplin graduate provided a student perspective
on the text, and the Design Specialist, a graduating senior, re-worked illustrations and created new figures to
make them more presentable to students. The team of six editors revised the outline of the original textbook,
deciding which topics to add and which ones to delete. After solidifying the outline, the lead author deleted
extraneous content, composed new content, and updated content as needed. The five editors then made
suggestions on content, format, illustrations, grammar, etc. Finally, the Assistant Director of Open Education in
the University Libraries at Virginia Tech guided the book through the development and production processes
leading up to its publication by Virginia Tech Publishing. Multiple staff formatted the text in Pressbooks, offered
feedback to the editorial team, and provided copy editing and proofreading. The resulting book has been
published in both online versions (Pressbooks, ePub, and PDF) and printable on-demand versions.

Attribution and Scope of Revision

This textbook is adapted from the openly licensed textbook Mastering Strategic Management
(https://dx.doi.org/10.24926/8668.1401) published in 2011 under a Creative Commons Attribution
NonCommercial ShareAlike 3.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0) licence, revised and
hosted by the University of Minnesota Libraries Publishing Service in 2015. The 2011 version of the book
was written by two authors who held administrative and leadership roles at major U.S. universities. It was
published in 2011 by a publisher who requested that neither the authors nor publisher receive attribution. This
new version uses much of the same content and structure of the 2011 and 2015 versions, with the following
significant changes:

   Alignment of book to learning outcomes
   Updated examples and illustrations
   Addition of linked section-level videos
   Re-ordering of some chapters
   Addition of Chapter 5: Synthesis of Strategic Issues and Analysis" on the SWOT framework and strategic

      issues.
   Additional mini-case studies on The Bottom of the Pyramid and COVID-19

A more detailed list of changes is available in the book's Version Notes at the end of the book.

The revision process involved adding content in certain areas while removing dated or less relevant content to
better align with learning objectives. We also gave the book a general refresh by adding illustrations, examples,
and applications from companies and brands more relatable to today's students.

Strategy instructors collaborated to determine which content to supplement or delete. This coordinated effort
from diverse perspectives provides more consistency among instructors in teaching the content of the course.

An additional goal of the editorial team was to provide an affordable alternative to existing expensive strategic
management textbooks. The ever-increasing costs of a college education convinced us that a strong, no-cost
textbook would benefit not only Virginia Tech students but students at other colleges and universities as well.

                                                                                                                                                       Introduction | 3
Impact

Our hope for this textbook is that it will enlighten and prepare students for entering the business world. After
reading it they should come away with a much better grasp of the ways that organizations operate at the
strategic level to be successful. Not only will they be better accountants, or whatever their particular major is,
they will be better prepared as employees, especially as they rise in responsibility and take on more strategic
roles in their organizations. Ultimately, we hope they will become better critical thinkers and have the ability to
analyze the full range of situations they will face in their professional lives.
Also, it is hoped that instructors in other colleges and universities will appreciate the content and structure of
this textbook and adopt it for their students, providing a textbook solution for them at no cost.

1.1 Introduction

Successful organizations have found that a strategic management process helps them achieve their goals
within a dynamic and competitive environment. Strategic management is a comprehensive process designed
for firms to best use their resources and capabilities to provide superior firm performance. Analysis of the
external, competitive, and internal environments help shape the strategies that a firm pursues to be successful.
Strategies are broad goals that, as accomplished, help the organization move forward toward its vision.
Strategy formation goes back to ancient times, particularly used in warfare. Although not perfect, the strategic
management process creates a framework for an organization to look outside of itself and set a course for
success. The remaining chapters in this textbook walk students through this framework, providing tools for

                                                                                                        Chapter 1: Mastering Strategy: Art and Science | 7
diagnosing the external, competitive, and internal environments to the development and implementation of
strategies. The process should always be performed with a framework of corporate ethics and values to limit
the temptation to cross the line where an organization should not go.

                Figure 1.1: Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla

Will Tesla Make It?

On January 7, 2020, Tesla Inc. became the most valuable US automaker in history. Valued at $81.39 billion, Tesla
passed Ford Motor Company as most valuable. Approximately two weeks later, Tesla passed Volkswagen to
become the second most valuable car company worldwide. Still well behind Toyota, which has a $233 billion
market capitalization, Tesla's growth is unprecedented in the automotive industry. Can Tesla become number
one worldwide?
Despite tremendous growth, Tesla has its share of problems as well. Its founder, Elon Musk, tweeted that
the company's stock price was too high; sending the stock tumbling, the Model 3 lost Consumer Reports
recommendations, and COVID-19 shutdowns of factories slowed production. These problems raise serious
questions. Will Elon's Twitter use continue to cause problems? Are the quality problems going to tank Tesla's
growth? Can Tesla emerge from the COVID-19 shutdown successfully?
The company faces stiff competition from automakers attempting to regain their footholds in a highly
aggressive market. Competitors are attempting to compete in the same areas as Tesla. Porsche's Taycan, a Tesla
competitor, got a huge win with a purchase from Bill Gates. As competitors continue to develop autonomous
capabilities and better electric batteries, will Tesla continue to dominate US auto markets?

1.2 What is Strategic Management?

Defining Strategic Management

Issues such as those currently faced by Tesla are the focus of strategic management because they help answer
the key question examined by strategic management--"Why do some firms outperform other firms?" More
specifically, strategic management examines how actions and events involving top executives (such as Elon
Musk), firms (Tesla), and industries (the electric car market) influence a firm's success or failure. Strategic
management involves the utilization or planned allocation of resources to implement major initiatives taken by
executives on behalf of stakeholders to improve performance of firms in an environment. Formal tools exist for

                                                                                                        Chapter 1: Mastering Strategy: Art and Science | 9
understanding these relationships, and many of these tools are explained and applied in this book. But formal
tools are not enough; creativity is just as important to strategic management. Mastering strategy is therefore
part art and part science.
This introductory chapter is intended to enable students to understand what strategic management is and
why it is important. Because strategy is a complex concept, we begin by explaining what strategy is. Types of
strategies and the history and critique of strategic management are introduced. Lastly, students are presented
with the process of strategic management that firms use.

                Figure 1.2: Strategic management within a firm is accomplished by a team of senior people.

Defining strategy is not simple. Strategy is a complex concept that involves many different processes and
activities within an organization. It involves goals and objectives that an organization needs to achieve to be
successful in the marketplace. The development of these goals, however, requires a strategic management
process to be done correctly and thoroughly.
A strategy is typically a higher level, broad goal, without a lot of specifics. It is long-term in nature. It provides
the direction that an organization wants to move toward to be more successful. New or revised strategies may
be developed as a result of changes in the business environment, such as what happened during the COVID-19
pandemic. Firms also routinely revise or create new strategies, often annually, by assessing and reacting to
external and competitive forces and to maximize organizational performance. By identifying their resources
and capabilities, firms attempt to deploy these through strategies that will give them a competitive advantage,
so consumers will buy their product or service instead of a competitor's.

   Key Takeaway

          Strategic management focuses on firms and the different strategies that they use to become and
             remain successful. Firms develop strategies, or longer range goals, to achieve success in the
             competitive marketplace. In the dynamic environment in which firms exist, firms may alter their
             strategies as conditions change.

1.3 Intended, Emergent, and Realized Strategies

A few years ago, a consultant posed a question to thousands of executives: "Is your industry facing overcapacity
and fierce price competition?" All but one said "yes." The only "no" came from the manager of a unique
operation--the Panama Canal! This manager was fortunate to be in charge of a venture whose services are
desperately needed by shipping companies and that offers the only simple route linking the Atlantic and Pacific
Oceans. The canal's success could be threatened if transoceanic shipping were to cease or if a new canal were
built. Both of these possibilities are extremely remote, however, so the Panama Canal appears to be guaranteed
to have many customers for as long as anyone can see into the future.
When an organization's environment is stable and predictable, strategic planning can provide enough of a
strategy for the organization to gain and maintain success. The executives leading the organization can simply
create a plan and execute it, and they can be confident that their plan will not be undermined by changes
over time. But as the consultant's experience shows, only a few executives--such as the manager of the
Panama Canal--enjoy a stable and predictable situation. Because change affects the strategies of almost all
organizations, understanding the concepts of intended, emergent, and realized strategies is important (Table
1.1). Also relevant are deliberate and unrealized strategies. The relationships among these five concepts are
presented in Figure 1.3, "A Model of Intended, Deliberate, and Realized Strategy" (Mintzberg & Waters, 1985).

                Figure 1.3: A Model of Intended, Deliberate, and Realized Strategy

Intended Strategy

An intended strategy is the strategy that an organization hopes to execute. Intended strategies are usually
described in detail within an organization's strategic plan. When a strategic plan is created for a new venture,
it is called a business plan. As an undergraduate student at Yale in 1965, Frederick Smith had to complete a
business plan for a proposed company as a class project. His plan described a delivery system that would gain

                                                                                                       Chapter 1: Mastering Strategy: Art and Science | 13
efficiency by routing packages through a central hub and then pass them to their destinations. A few years later,
Smith started Federal Express (Funding Universe, n.d.), a company whose strategy closely followed the plan laid
out in his class project. FedEx has achieved a ranking among the World's Most Admired Companies according
to Fortune magazine. Certainly, Smith's intended strategy has worked out far better than even he could have
dreamed (Donahoe, 2011; Memphis Business Journal, 2011).

Emergent Strategy

Emergent strategy has also played a role at Federal Express. An emergent strategy is an unplanned strategy
that arises in response to unexpected opportunities and/or challenges. Sometimes emergent strategies result
in disasters. In the mid-1980s, FedEx deviated from its intended strategy's focus on package delivery to
capitalize on an emerging technology: facsimile (fax) machines. The firm developed a service called ZapMail that
involved documents being sent electronically via fax machines between FedEx offices and then being delivered
to customers' offices. FedEx executives hoped that ZapMail would be a success because it reduced the delivery
time of a document from overnight to just a couple of hours. Unfortunately, the ZapMail system had many
technical problems that frustrated customers. Even worse, FedEx failed to anticipate that many businesses
would simply purchase their own fax machines. ZapMail was shut down, and FedEx lost hundreds of millions of
dollars following its failed emergent strategy. In retrospect, FedEx made a costly mistake by venturing outside
of the domain that was central to its intended strategy: package delivery (Funding Universe, n.d.).

Emergent strategies can also lead to tremendous success. Southern Bloomer Manufacturing Company was
founded to make underwear for use in prisons and mental hospitals. Many managers of such institutions believe
that the underwear made for retail markets by companies such as Calvin Klein and Hanes is simply not suitable
for the people under their care. Instead, underwear issued to prisoners needs to be sturdy and durable to
withstand the rigors of prison activities and laundering. To meet these needs, Southern Bloomers began selling
underwear made of heavy cotton fabric.

An unexpected opportunity led Southern Bloomer to go beyond its intended strategy of serving institutional
needs for durable underwear. Just a few years after opening, Southern Bloomer's performance was excellent. It
was servicing the needs of about 125 facilities, but unfortunately, this was creating a vast amount of scrap fabric.
An attempt to use the scrap as stuffing for pillows had failed, so the scrap was being sent to landfills. This was
not only wasteful but also costly.

One day, co-founder Don Sonner visited a gun shop with his son. Sonner had no interest in guns, but he quickly
spotted a potential use for his scrap fabric during this visit. The patches that the gun shop sold to clean the
inside of gun barrels were of poor quality. According to Sonner, when he "saw one of those flimsy woven
patches they sold that unraveled when you touched them, I said, "Man, that's what I can do" with the scrap
fabric. Unlike other gun-cleaning patches, the patches that Southern Bloomer sold did not give off threads
or lint, two by-products that hurt guns' accuracy and reliability. The patches quickly became popular with
the military, police departments, and individual gun enthusiasts. Before long, Southern Bloomer was selling
thousands of pounds of patches per month. A casual trip to a gun store unexpectedly gave rise to a lucrative
emergent strategy (Wells, 2002).

14 | Chapter 1: Mastering Strategy: Art and Science
Realized Strategy

A realized strategy is the strategy that an organization actually follows. Realized strategies are a product of a
firm's intended strategy (i.e., what the firm planned to do), the firm's deliberate strategy (i.e., the parts of the
intended strategy that the firm continues to pursue over time), and its emergent strategy (i.e., what the firm did
in reaction to unexpected opportunities and challenges). In the case of FedEx, the intended strategy devised by
its founder many years ago--fast package delivery via a centralized hub--remains a primary driver of the firm's
realized strategy. For Southern Bloomers Manufacturing Company, realized strategy has been shaped greatly
by both its intended and emergent strategies, which center on underwear and gun-cleaning patches.

In other cases, firms' original intended strategies are long forgotten. An unrealized strategy refers to the
abandoned parts of the intended strategy. When aspiring author David McConnell was struggling to sell his
books, he decided to offer complimentary perfume as a sales gimmick. McConnell's books never did escape the
stench of failure, but his perfumes soon took on the sweet smell of success. The California Perfume Company
was formed to market the perfumes; this firm evolved into the personal care products juggernaut known today
as Avon. For McConnell, his dream to be a successful writer was an unrealized strategy, but through Avon,
a successful realized strategy was driven almost entirely by opportunistically capitalizing on change through
emergent strategy.

Strategy at the Movies

The Social Network

Did Harvard University student Mark

Zuckerberg set out to build a billion-dollar

company with more than 2.6 billion active

users? Not hardly. As shown in 2010's The

Social Network, Zuckerberg's original concept

in 2003 had a dark nature. After being dumped

by his girlfriend, a bitter Zuckerberg created a

website called "FaceMash" where the

attractiveness of young women could be voted

on. This evolved first into an online social

network called TheFacebook that was for           Figure 1.4: The Social Network demonstrates how founder

       way we speak, such as the word friend being used as a verb. Ironically, Facebook's emphasis on
       connecting with existing and new friends is about as different as it could be from Zuckerberg's
       original mean-spirited concept. Certainly, Zuckerberg's emergent and realized strategies turned
       out to be far nobler than the intended strategy that began his adventure in entrepreneurship.

   Key Takeaway

          Most organizations create intended strategies that they hope to follow to be successful. Over
             time, however, changes in an organization's situation give rise to new opportunities and
             challenges. Organizations respond to these changes using emergent strategies. Realized
             strategies are a product of both intended and realized strategies.

   Exercises

         1. What is the difference between an intended and an emergent strategy?
        2. Can you think of a company that seems to have abandoned its intended strategy? Why do you

             suspect it was abandoned?
        3. Would you describe your career strategy in college to be more deliberate or emergent? Why?

1.4 The History of Strategic Management

Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
- George Santayana, The Life of Reason
Santayana's quote has strong implications for strategic management. The history of strategic management can
be traced back several thousand years. Great wisdom about strategy can be acquired by understanding the past,
but ignoring the lessons of history can lead to costly strategic mistakes that could have been avoided. Certainly,
the present offers very important lessons; businesses can gain knowledge about what strategies do and do not
work by studying the current actions of other businesses. But this section discusses two less obvious sources of
wisdom: (1) strategy in ancient times and (2) military strategy. This section also briefly traces the development
of strategic management as a field of study.

Strategy in Ancient Times

Perhaps the earliest-known discussion of strategy is offered in the Old Testament of the Bible (Bracker,
1980). Approximately 3,500 years ago, Moses faced quite a challenge after leading his fellow Hebrews out of
enslavement in Egypt. Moses was overwhelmed as the lone strategist at the helm of a nation that may have
exceeded one million people. Based on advice from his father-in-law, Moses began delegating authority to other
leaders, each of whom oversaw a group of people. This hierarchical delegation of authority created a command
structure that freed Moses to concentrate on the biggest decisions and helped him implement his strategies
(Table 1.2 "Strategy in Ancient Times"). Similarly, the demands of strategic management today are simply too

                                                                                                       Chapter 1: Mastering Strategy: Art and Science | 17
much for a chief executive officer (the top leader of a company) to handle alone. Many important tasks are thus
entrusted to vice presidents and other executives.

In ancient China, strategist and philosopher Sun Tzu offered thoughts on strategy that continue to be studied
carefully by business and military leaders today. Sun Tzu's best-known work is The Art of War. As this title
implies, Sun Tzu emphasized the creative and deceptive aspects of strategy.

   Strategic management borrows many ideas from ancient uses of strategy over time. The following anecdotes
     provide a few notable examples of historical actions that remain relevant for the study of modern strategy.
    Indeed, the Greek verb strategos means "army leader" and the idea of stratego ( from which we get the word

              strategy) refers to the idea of destroying one's enemies through the effective use of resources.

                                                             Table 1.2 Strategy in Ancient Times

 1491 BC:
 Moses uses hierarchical delegation of authority during the exodus from Egypt. Dividing a large set of people into smaller
 groups creates a command structure that enables strategies to be implemented.

 500 BC:
 Sun Tzu's The Art of War provides a classic handbook on military strategy with numerous business applications, such as
 the idea "to win without fighting is the best." This type of approach was used by businesses, such as Gap Inc. when they
 decided to create their own stores rather than competing for shelf space for their clothing within traditional department
 stores.

 70 BC:
 Roman poet Virgil tells the story of the Trojan horse, a classic strategic ploy where the Greek forces hid a select number
 of soldiers in a large wooden horse that the Trojan army took into their heavily guarded city gates. Once inside the city,
 Greek soldiers were able to open the gates and allow in reinforcements which eventually led to the end of the war.

 c. 530:
 King Arthur rules Britain. Legend says he made his famed round table so that no one, including him, would be seen as
 above the others. His mission to find the Holy Grail serves as an exemplar for the importance of the central mission to
 guide organizational actions.

One of Sun Tzu's ideas that has numerous business applications is that winning a battle without fighting is
the best way to win. Apple's behavior in the personal computer business offers a good example of this idea in
action. Many computer makers such as Toshiba, Acer, and Lenovo compete with one another based primarily
on price. This leads to price wars that undermine the computer makers' profits. In contrast, Apple prefers to
develop unique features for its computers, features that have created a fiercely loyal set of customers. Apple
boldly charges far more for its computers than its rivals charge for theirs. Apple does not even worry much
about whether its computers' software is compatible with the software used by most other computers. Rather
than fighting a battle with other firms, Apple wins within the computer business by creating its own unique
market and by attracting a set of loyal customers. Sun Tzu would probably admire Apple's approach.

Perhaps the most famous example of strategy in ancient times revolves around the Trojan horse. According
to legend, Greek soldiers wanted to find a way to enter the gates of Troy and attack the city from the inside.
They devised a ploy that involved creating a giant wooden horse, hiding soldiers inside the horse, and offering
the horse to the Trojans as a gift. The Trojans were fooled and brought the horse inside their city. When night
arrived, the hidden Greek soldiers opened the gates for their army, leading to a Greek victory. In modern times,

18 | Chapter 1: Mastering Strategy: Art and Science
the term Trojan horse refers to gestures that appear on the surface to be beneficial to the recipient but that
mask a sinister intent. Computer viruses also are sometimes referred to as Trojan horses.

A far more noble approach to strategy than the Greeks' is attributed to King Arthur of Britain. Unlike the
hierarchical approach to organizing Moses used, Arthur allegedly considered himself and each of his knights to
have an equal say in plotting the group's strategy. Indeed, the group is thought to have held its meetings at a
round table so that no voice, including Arthur's, would be seen as more important than the others. The choice
of furniture in modern executive suites is perhaps revealing. Most feature rectangular meeting tables, perhaps
signaling that one person--the chief executive officer--is in charge.

Another implication for strategic management offered by King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table
involves the concept of mission. Their vigorous search to find the Holy Grail (the legendary cup used by Jesus
and his disciples at the Last Supper) serves as an exemplar for the importance of a central mission to guide
organizational strategy and actions.

Lessons Offered by Military Strategy

Key military conflicts and events have shaped the understanding of strategic management (Table 1.3). Indeed,
the word strategy has its roots in warfare. The Greek verb strategos means "army leader" and the idea of
stratego (from which we get the word strategy) refers to defeating an enemy by effectively using resources
(Bracker, 1980).

A book written nearly five hundred years ago is still regarded by many as an insightful guide for conquering and
ruling territories. Niccol Machiavelli's 1532 book The Prince offers clever recipes for success to government
leaders. Some of the book's suggestions are quite devious, and the word Machiavellian is used today to refer to
acts of deceit and manipulation.

Two wars fought on American soil provide important lessons about strategic management. In the late 1700s,
the American Revolution pitted the American colonies against mighty Great Britain. The Americans relied on
nontraditional tactics, such as guerilla warfare and the strategic targeting of British officers. Although these
tactics were considered by Great Britain to be barbaric, they later became widely used approaches to warfare.
The Americans owed their success in part to help from the French navy, illustrating the potential value of
strategic alliances.

Nearly a century later, Americans turned on one another during the Civil War. After four years of hostilities, the
Confederate states were forced to surrender. Historians consider the Confederacy to have had better generals,
but the Union possessed greater resources, such as factories and railroad lines. As many modern companies
have discovered, sometimes good strategies simply cannot overcome a stronger adversary.

                                                                                                       Chapter 1: Mastering Strategy: Art and Science | 19
                                Two wars fought on Russian soil also offer insights. In the 1800s, a powerful
                                French invasion force was defeated in part by the brutal nature of Russian winters.
                                In the 1940s, a similar fate befell German forces during World War II. Against the
                                advice of some of his leading generals, Adolf Hitler ordered his army to conquer
                                Russia. Like the French before them, the Germans were able to penetrate deep
                                into Russian territory. As George Santayana had warned, however, the forgotten
                                past was about to repeat itself. Horrific cold stopped the German advance. Russian
                                forces eventually took control of the combat, and Hitler committed suicide as the
                                Russians approached the German capital, Berlin.

Figure 1.5: General Hannibal    Five years earlier, Germany ironically had benefited from an opponent ignoring
from Carthage, who led his      the strategic management lessons of the past. In ancient times, the Romans had
troops on elephants to cross    assumed that no army could cross a mountain range known as the Alps. An enemy

                                caught Roman forces unprepared. French commanders made a similar bad
                                assumption in 1940. When Germany invaded Belgium (and then France) in 1940, its
                                strategy caught French forces by surprise.

The top French commanders assumed that German tanks simply could not make it through a thickly wooded
region known as the Ardennes Forest. As a result, French forces did not bother preparing a strong defense
in that area. Most of the French army and their British allies instead protected against a small, diversionary
force that the Germans had sent as a deception to the north of the forest. German forces made it through the
forest, encircled the allied forces, and started driving them toward the ocean. Many thousands of French and
British soldiers were killed or captured. In retrospect, the French generals had ignored an important lesson of
history: do not make assumptions about what your adversary can and cannot do. Executives who make similar
assumptions about their competitors put their organizations' performance in jeopardy.

 Strategic management often borrows lessons as well as metaphors from classic military strategy. For example,
major business decisions are often categorized as "strategic" while more minor decisions (such as small changes
in price or the opening of a new location) are referred to as "tactical" decisions. Here are a few select examples of

                           classic military strategies that hold insights for strategic decisions today.

Strategic Management as a Field of Study

Universities contain many different fields of study, including physics, literature, chemistry, computer science,
and engineering. Some fields of study date back many centuries (e.g., literature), while others (such as computer
science) have emerged only in recent years. Strategic management has been important throughout history, but
the evolution of strategic management into a field of study has mostly taken place over the past century. A few
of the key business and academic events that have helped the field develop are discussed next.

The ancient Chinese strategist Sun Tzu made it clear that strategic management is partially art. But it is
also part science. Major steps toward developing the scientific aspect of strategic management were taken
in the early twentieth century by Frederick W. Taylor. In 1911, Taylor published The Principles of Scientific
Management. The book was a response to Taylor's observation that most tasks within organizations were
organized haphazardly. Taylor believed that businesses would be much more efficient if management principles
were derived through scientific investigation. In The Principles of Scientific Management, Taylor stressed how
organizations could become more efficient through identifying the "one best way" of performing important
tasks. Implementing Taylor's principles was thought to have saved railroad companies hundreds of millions of
dollars. Although many later works disputed the merits of trying to find the "one best way," Taylor's emphasis
on maximizing organizational performance became the core concern of strategic management as the field
developed.

Also in the early twentieth century, automobile maker Henry Ford emerged as one of the pioneers of strategic
management among industrial leaders. At the time, cars seemed to be a luxury item for wealthy people. Ford
adopted a unique strategic perspective, however, and boldly offered the vision that he would make cars the
average family could afford. Building on ideas about efficiency from Taylor and others, Ford organized assembly

                                                                                                       Chapter 1: Mastering Strategy: Art and Science | 21
lines for creating automobiles that lowered costs dramatically. Despite his wisdom, Ford also made mistakes.
Regarding his company's flagship product, the Model T, Ford famously stated, "Any customer can have a car
painted any color that he wants so long as it is black." When rival automakers provided customers with a variety
of color choices, Ford had no choice but to do the same.

The acceptance of strategic management as a

necessary element of business school programs took a

major step forward in 1959. A widely circulated report

created by the Ford Foundation recommended that all

business schools offer a capstone course. The goal of

this course would be to integrate knowledge across

different business fields such as marketing, finance,

and accounting to help students devise better ideas for

addressing complex business problems. Rather than

seeking a "one best way" solution, as advocated by

Taylor and Harvard's business policy course, this

capstone course would emphasize students' critical

thinking skills in general and the notion that multiple  Figure 1.6: The Model T Ford, the first production car
ways of addressing a problem could be equally            produced on an assembly line.

successful in particular. The Ford Foundation report was a key motivator that led US universities to             create

strategic management courses in their undergraduate and master of business administration programs.

Although strategy has been important throughout history, strategic management as a field of study has largely
developed over the past century. Below are a few key business and academic events that have helped the field
evolve.

1962  Sam Walton opens the first Wal-Mart in Arkansas, relying on a strategy that emphasized low prices and high levels of
1980  customer service.
      The Strategic Management Journal is created.

1995 The launch of Amazon.com by founder Jeff Bezos is perhaps the pivotal event in creating internet-based commerce.

2001 Enron Corporation declares bankruptcy after a series of disclosures reveal that the firm's stellar performance had been
          a product of fraud and corruption.

2005 Thomas Friedman's book The World is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century suggests that many advantages
          that firms in developed countries like the United States take for granted are disappearing.

2010  Walmart becomes the largest company in the world.
2018  Apple becomes the first company to be worth $1 trillion.
2020  Walmart is still the highest revenue producing company in the world.

In 1962, business and academic events occurred that seemed minor at the time but that would later give rise
to huge changes. Building on the business savvy that he had gained as a franchisee, Sam Walton opened the
first Walmart in Rogers, Arkansas. Relying on a strategy that emphasized low prices and high levels of customer
service, Walmart grew to 882 stores with a combined $8.4 billion dollars in annual sales by 1985. A decade later,
sales reached $93.6 billion across nearly 3,000 stores. In 2010, Walmart was the largest company in the world.
In recent years, Walmart has arguably downplayed customer service in favor of cutting costs. Time will tell
whether deviating from Sam Walton's original strategic positioning will hurt the company.

Two pivotal events that firmly established strategic management as a field of study took place in 1980. One
was the creation of the Strategic Management Journal. The introduction of the journal offered a forum for
researchers interested in building knowledge about strategic management. Much like important new medical
findings that appear in the Journal of the American Medical Association and The New England Journal of Medicine,
the Strategic Management Journal publishes path breaking insights about strategic management.

The second pivotal event in 1980 was the publication of Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing
Industries and Competitors by Harvard professor Michael Porter. This book offers concepts such as five forces
analysis and generic strategies that continue to strongly influence how executives choose strategies more than
thirty years after the book's publication. Given the importance of these concepts, both five forces analysis and

                                                                                                      Chapter 1: Mastering Strategy: Art and Science | 23
generic strategies are discussed in detail in Chapter 3 "Evaluating the External Environment" and Chapter 6
"Selecting Business-Level Strategies", respectively.

Many consumers today take web-based shopping for granted, but this channel for commerce was created
recently. The 1995 launch of Amazon by founder Jeff Bezos was perhaps the pivotal event in creating internet-
based commerce. In pursuit of its vision "to be earth's most customer-centric company," Amazon has diversified
far beyond its original focus on selling books and has evolved into a dominant retailer. Powerful giants have
stumbled badly in Amazon's wake. Sears had sold great varieties of goods (even including entire houses) through
catalogs for many decades, as had JCPenney. Neither firm created a strong online sales presence to keep pace
with Amazon, and both eventually dropped their catalog businesses. As often happens with old and large firms,
Sears and JCPenney were outmaneuvered by a creative and versatile upstart.

Ethics have long been an important issue within the strategic management field. Attention to the need for
executives to act ethically when creating strategies increased dramatically in the early 2000s when a series
of companies such as Enron Corporation, WorldCom, Tyco, Qwest, and Global Crossing were found to have
grossly exaggerated the strength of their performance. After a series of revelations about fraud and corruption,
investors in these firms and others lost billions of dollars, tens of thousands of jobs were lost, and some
executives were sent to prison.

Like ethics, the implications of international competition are of central interest to strategic management.
Provocative new thoughts on the nature of the international arena were offered in 2005 by Thomas L. Friedman.
In his book The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century, Friedman argues that many of the
advantages that firms in developed countries such as the United States, Japan, and Great Britain take for
granted are disappearing. One implication is that these firms will need to improve their strategies if they are to
remain successful.

Looking to the future, it appears likely that strategic management will prove to be more important than ever.
In response, researchers who are interested in strategic management will work to build additional knowledge
about how organizations can maximize their performance. Executives will need to keep track of the latest
scientific findings. Meanwhile, they also must leverage the insights that history offers on how to be successful
while trying to avoid past mistakes.

   Key Takeaway

          Although strategic management as a field of study has developed mostly over the last century,
             the concept of strategy is much older. Understanding strategic management can benefit greatly
             by learning the lessons that ancient history and military strategy provide.

1.5 Contemporary Critique of Strategic Management

This book focuses attention on the widely accepted approaches that frame the contemporary practice and
understanding of strategic management. The field of strategic management has always had its critics, and,
as with any academic discipline, this criticism has challenged the field to adapt and improve over time. Over
time, both practitioners and scholars have voiced concerns about various areas of the strategic management
process, and this section summarizes the general critiques to deepen your own ability to critically consider the
processes of strategic management in your own organizations and career.
The kinds of concerns about strategic management differ depending upon who is voicing them. From the

                                                                                                      Chapter 1: Mastering Strategy: Art and Science | 25
perspective of firm managers or executives, commonly expressed concerns target the high levels of investment
required in order to get more benefit than cost from an effective strategic management process. For strategic
management to be done well, it is typically a complex process that is high in cost, time, and difficulty (Cameron,
2019; Katsanos, 2019). Further, some decision makers are skeptical of the ability of strategic management to
achieve its goal: to accurately anticipate an unknown future (Cameron, 2019; Llopis, 2019). Some critics go so far
as to suggest that committing to a strategy may limit a firm's ability to respond to a changing environment when
companies "make future decisions on obsolete data" (Cameron, 2019). In the opening paragraph of Michael
Raynor's bestselling book The Strategy Paradox, he says:

"Most strategies are built on specific beliefs about the future. Unfortunately, the future is deeply unpredictable.
Worse, the requirements of breakthrough success demand implementing strategy in ways that make it
impossible to adapt should the future not turn out as expected. The result is the Strategy Paradox: strategies
with the greatest possibility of success also have the greatest possibility of failure" (2007, p. 1).

In his book, Mr. Raynor goes on to discuss that survivorship bias is an issue because the strategies of firms
that survive are evaluated more than those that fail. The issue of survivorship bias also is a research area
within the field of strategic management. Additionally, other strategy scholars raise concerns about how the
dominant approaches to strategic management reinforce existing assumptions about power and inequalities
within organizations (e.g., affecting gender, race, etc.) and in the global market (i.e., reproducing the same
"winners" and "losers") (Knights & Morgan, 1991; Levy et al., 2011; Montgomery et al., 1989).

Some critiques focus on the inadequacies of specific strategic tools or theories. For example, some scholars
challenge existing firm-level, resource-based approaches for its inability to adequately assess and capture
changing contexts and capabilities (resource-based approaches are introduced in Chapter 5) (Bromiley &
Fleming, 2002; Teece, 2019). Finally, the field of strategic management has been critiqued for being too
concerned with achieving immediate, business "results" (Montgomery et al., 1989), and at other times, for not
being attuned enough to the real-time, practical needs of business (Pricop, 2012).

It is evident that there are plenty of reasons to think critically about how a firm's decision makers choose to
engage in their strategic management processes. Ultimately, responsibility for determining a firm's strategic
approach is left to the discretion of the firm's executive team. While the theories, tools, and resources
introduced throughout this text are well-researched, time-tested, and best practices in the field of strategic
management, no approach is perfect, nor is it intended to be.

1.6 Understanding the Strategic Management Process

Strategic management is a process that involves building a careful understanding of how the world is changing,
as well as a knowledge of how those changes might affect a particular firm. CEOs, such as late Apple founder
Steve Jobs, must be able to carefully manage the possible actions that their firms might take to deal with
changes that occur in their environment. We present a model of the strategic management process in Figure 1.7,
"Overall Model of the Strategic Management Process". This model also guides our presentation of the chapters

                Figure 1.7: Overall Model of the Strategic Management Process

The strategic management process begins with an understanding of strategy and performance. As we have
noted in this introductory chapter, strategic management is both an art and a science, and it involves multiple
conceptualizations of the notion of strategy drawn from recent and ancient history. In Chapter 2 "Assessing
Organizational Performance", we focus on how the organization's mission and vision shape the development of
the firm's strategy. Consequently, how managers understand and interpret the performance of their firms is
often central to understanding strategy.

28 | Chapter 1: Mastering Strategy: Art and Science
Environmental and internal scanning is the next stage in the process. Managers must constantly scan the
external environment for trends and events that affect the overall economy, and they must monitor changes
in the particular industry in which the firm operates. For example, Apple's decision to create the iPhone
demonstrates its ability to interpret that traditional industry boundaries that distinguished the cellular phone
industry and the computer industry were beginning to blur. At the same time, firms must evaluate their
own resources to understand how they might react to changes in the environment. For example, intellectual
property is a vital resource for Apple. Between 2008 and 2010, Apple filed more than 350 cases with the US
Patent and Trademark Office to protect its use of such terms as apple, pod, and safari (Apple Inc.).

A classic management tool that incorporates the idea of scanning elements both external and internal to
the firm is SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis. Strengths and weaknesses are
assessed by examining the firm's internal resources, while opportunities and threats refer to external events
and trends. The value of SWOT analysis parallels ideas from classic military strategists such as Sun Tzu, who
noted the value of knowing yourself as well as your opponent. Chapter 3 "Evaluating the External Environment"
examines the topic of evaluating the external environment in detail, and Chapter 4 "Evaluating the Internal
Environment" presents concepts and tools for managing firm resources. Synthesizing the information gained in
the external and internal analysis into a SWOT framework is addressed in Chapter 5. The SWOT is then used to
formulate the strategic issue(s) that the firm must deal with as it formulates strategies.

Strategy formulation is the next step in the strategic

management process. This involves developing specific

strategies and actions. Certainly, part of Apple's

success is due to the unique products it offers the

market, as well as how these products complement one

another. A customer can buy an iPod that plays music

from iTunes--all of which can be stored in Apple's Mac

computer (Inside CRM Editors, n.d.). In Chapter 6

"Selecting Corporate-Level Strategies" focuses on selecting corporate-level strategies, and Chapter 9

"Competing in International Markets" presents possibilities for firms competing in international markets.

Strategy implementation is the final stage of the process. One important element of strategy implementation

entails crafting an effective organizational structure and corporate culture. For example, part of Apple's success

is due to its consistent focus on innovation and creativity that Steve Jobs described as similar to that of a start-

up. Chapter 10 "Executing Strategy through Organizational Design" offers ideas on how to manage these

elements of implementation. The final chapter explores how to lead an ethical organization through corporate

governance, social responsibility, and sustainability.

   Key Takeaway

          Strategic management is a process that requires the ability to manage change. Consequently,
             executives must be careful to monitor and to interpret the events in their environment, to take
             appropriate actions when change is needed, and to monitor their performance to ensure that
             their firms are able to survive and, it is hoped, thrive over time.

1.7 Conclusion

This chapter provides an overview of strategic management and strategy. Ideas about strategy span many
centuries, and modern understanding of strategy borrows from ancient strategies as well as classic military
strategies. You should now understand that there are numerous ways to conceptualize the idea of strategy, and
that effective strategic management is needed to ensure the long-term success of firms. The study of strategic
management provides tools to effectively manage organizations, but it also involves the art of knowing how
and when to apply creative thinking. Knowledge of both the art and the science of strategic management is
needed to help guide organizations as their strategies emerge and evolve over time. Such tools will also help
you effectively chart a course for your career as well as to understand the effective strategic management of
the organizations for which you will work.

   Learning Objectives

     After reading this chapter, you should be able to understand and articulate answers to the following
     questions:

         1. What are organizational vision, mission, values, and goals, and why are they important to
             organizations?

        2. How should executives analyze the performance of their organization?
        3. What is competitive advantage and how is it calculated?

2.1 Introduction

The foundation of strategic management is for an organization to answer three questions:
 1. Where are we?
2. Where are we going?
3. How are we going to get there?

Organizations answer the first question by assessing their organization. Often this is by looking at financial
data, reviewing historical trends, and comparing the financial performance to other benchmarks such as
industry averages or competitors' performance. But financial indicators are not the only assessment measures
to determine where a company is in relation to the marketplace. Other organizational performance indicators
are also reviewed, such as quality measures, productivity measures, human resource indicators such as staff
satisfaction and retention rates, and customer satisfaction and retention. A multitude of different measures
from different perspectives allow a firm to determine how it is doing.
32 | Chapter 2: Assessing Organizational Performance
Organizational leadership provides the answer to the second question; where are we going? In collaboration
with other stakeholders, leadership sets the vision for the firm. The vision is what the organization aspires to
be, that big goal it wants to accomplish. The vision is developed within the organization's mission: its purpose
for being. The vision must also be aligned with the organization's core values: the principles that are important
as it carries out its mission and vision.

The third question, how are we going to get there, speaks to the heart of strategic management. An organization
develops strategies to work toward achieving its vision. These are developed after much assessment is
performed to determine the best road map to advance the organization in the marketplace.

2.2 Vision, Mission, and Goals

Questions Are Brewing at Starbucks

March 30, 2011, marked the fortieth anniversary

of Starbucks's first store opening for business

in Seattle, Washington. From its humble

beginnings, Starbucks grew to become the

largest coffeehouse company in the world

while stressing the importance of both

financial and social goals. As it created

thousands of stores across dozens of countries,

the company navigated many interesting

periods. The last few years were a particularly

fascinating era.                                  Figure 2.1: Starbucks's global empire includes this store in
In early 2007, Starbucks appeared to be very      Seoul, South Korea

successful, and its stock was worth more than

$35 per share. By 2008, however, the economy was slowing, competition in the coffee business was

heating up, and Starbucks's performance had become disappointing. In a stunning reversal of

fortune, the firm's stock was worth less than $10 per share by the end of the year. Anxious

stockholders wondered whether Starbucks's decline would continue or whether the once high-

flying company would return to its winning ways.

Riding to the rescue was Howard Schultz, the charismatic and visionary founder of Starbucks who

                                                  Chapter 2: Assessing Organizational Performance | 33
       had stepped down as chief executive officer eight years earlier. Schultz again took the helm and
       worked to turn the company around by emphasizing its mission statement: "to inspire and nurture
       the human spirit--one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time" (Starbucks). About a
       thousand under-performing stores were shut down permanently. Thousands of other stores closed
       for a few hours so that baristas could be retrained to make inspiring drinks. Food offerings were
       revamped to ensure that coffee--not breakfast sandwiches--were the primary aroma that tantalized
       customers within Starbucks's outlets.
       By the time Starbucks's fortieth anniversary arrived, Schultz had led his company to regain
       excellence, and its stock price was back above $35 per share. In March 2011, Schultz summarized
       the situation by noting that "over the last three years, we've completely transformed the company,
       and the health of Starbucks is quite good. But I don't think this is a time to celebrate or run some
       victory lap. We've got a lot of work to do" (Starbucks, 2011). Schultz retired a second time in 2017
       and was replaced by the COO, Kevin Johnson. Starbucks has continued its dominance, opening its
       30,000th store in March, 2019, in Shenzhen, China. During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020,
       Starbucks and Johnson were praised on how the organization handled the crisis. Phase 1: Mitigate
       and Contain, was implemented, limiting access to only drive-thru and delivery. Employees were
       paid whether they worked or not. Then Phase 2: Monitor and Adapt was implemented, with the
       gradual reopening of stores. The decision to open stores was made locally, not by corporate
       headquarters. Johnson emphasized the principles of prioritizing the health and well-being of its
       staff and customers and playing a positive and constructive role with the communities and
       government officials where they serve.

The Importance of Vision

"Vision animates, inspires, transforms purpose into action." - Warren Bennis

Knowledge, skills, and abilities separate effective strategic leaders like Howard Schultz from poor strategic
leaders. One of them is the ability to inspire employees to work hard to improve their organization's
performance. Effective strategic leaders are able to convince employees to embrace lofty ambitions and move
the organization forward. In contrast, poor strategic leaders struggle to rally their people and channel their
collective energy in a positive direction.

As the quote from Warren Bennis suggests, a vision is one key tool available to executives to inspire the people
in an organization (Table 2.1). An organization's vision describes what the organization hopes to become in the
future and helps guide its strategies. Well-constructed visions clearly articulate an organization's aspirations.
Avon's vision is "to be the company that best understands and satisfies the product, service, and self-fulfillment
needs of women--globally." This brief yet powerful statement emphasizes several aims that are important to
Avon, including excellence in customer service, empowering women, and the intent to be a worldwide player.
Like all good visions, Avon sets a high standard for employees to work collectively toward. Perhaps no vision
captures high standards better than that of aluminum maker Alcoa. This firm's very ambitious vision is "to be
the best company in the world--in the eyes of our customers, shareholders, communities and people." By making
clear their aspirations, Alcoa's executives hope to inspire employees to act in ways that help the firm become
the best in the world.

The results of a survey of 1,500 executives illustrates that creating an inspiring vision creates a tremendous
challenge for executives. When asked to identify the most important characteristics of effective strategic
leaders, 98% of the executives listed "a strong sense of vision" first. Meanwhile, 90% of the executives also
expressed serious doubts about their own ability to create a vision (Quigley, 1994). Not surprisingly, many
organizations do not have formal visions. Many organizations that do have vision statements find that
employees do not embrace and pursue the visions. Having a well-formulated vision employees embrace can
therefore give an organization an edge over its rivals.

That aspirational goal of what the company wants to become is the driver for the strategies that are developed.
Accomplishing the strategies and goals drives the organization toward achieving its vision. Thus, there should
be alignment between the vision of the company, its mission, values, structure, culture, and the strategies
its leaders' select. As discussed in later chapters, for example, certain structures are better for achieving
organizational objectives.

   An organization's vision describes what the organization hopes to become in the future. Visions highlight the
 values and aspirations that lay at the heart of the organization. Although vision statements have the potential to
 inspire employees, customers, and other stakeholders, vision statements are relatively rare and good visions are

                    even rarer. Some of the visions being pursued by businesses today are offered below.

                                                                                                  Chapter 2: Assessing Organizational Performance | 35

Mission Statements

In working to turn around Starbucks, Howard Schultz sought to renew Starbucks's commitment to its mission
statement: "to inspire and nurture the human spirit--one person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time."
A mission such as Starbucks's states the reasons for an organization's existence, its purpose. Well-written
mission statements effectively capture an organization's identity and provide answers to the fundamental
question "Who are we?". While a vision looks to the future, a mission captures the key elements of the
organization's past and present (Table 2.2).

Organizations need support from their key stakeholders, such as employees, owners, suppliers, and customers,
if they intend to be successful. A mission statement should explain to stakeholders why they should support
the organization by making clear what important role or purpose the organization plays in society. Google's
mission, for example, is "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful."
Google pursued this mission in its early days by developing a very popular internet search engine. The firm
continues to serve its mission through various strategic actions, including offering its internet browser, Google
Chrome, to the online community, providing free e-mail via its Gmail service, and making books available online
for browsing.

The organization's mission is an umbrella under which all strategic management functions occur. If strategies
and goals do not align with the firm's mission, purpose, and vision, they need to be dropped, modified, or the
mission needs to be revised.

    While a vision describes what an organization desires to become in the future, an organization's mission is
  grounded in the past and present. A mission outlines the reasons for the organization's existence and explains
  what role it plays in society. A well-written mission statement captures the organization's identity and helps to
  answer the fundamental question of "Who are we?". As a practical matter, a mission statement explains to key

     stakeholders why they should support the organization. The following examples illustrate the connections
                                   between organizations and the needs of their key stakeholders.

Mission statements are often short and concise. Years ago, mission statements might have been several
paragraphs long. The problem that companies encountered was that employees could not remember or
verbalize the mission. In the evolution of mission statements, they have become short and easier to remember.
Knowing and living their organization's mission helps employees' engagement and satisfaction.

Figure 2.2: Many consider Abraham Lincoln to     One of Abraham Lincoln's best-known statements is that "a house
have been one of the greatest strategic leaders  divided against itself cannot stand." This provides a helpful way of
in modern history.                               thinking about the relationship between vision and mission.
                                                 Executives ask for trouble if their organization's vision and mission
                                                 are divided by emphasizing different domains. Some universities,
                                                 for example, have fallen into this trap. Many large public universities
                                                 were established in the late 1800s with missions that centered on
                                                 educating citizens. As the twentieth century unfolded, however,
                                                 creating scientific knowledge through research became
                                                 increasingly important to these universities. Many university
                                                 presidents responded by creating visions centered on building the
                                                 scientific prestige of their schools. This created a dilemma for
                                                 professors: should they devote most of their time and energy to
                                                 teaching students, as the mission required, or on their research
                                                 studies, as ambitious presidents demanded via their visions? Some
                                                 universities continue to struggle with this trade-off today and
                                                 remain houses divided against themselves. In short, an organization
                                                 is more effective to the extent that its vision and its mission target
                                                 employees' effort in the same direction.

Pursuing the Vision and Mission through SMART Goals

An organization's vision and mission offer a broad, overall sense of the organization's direction. To work toward
                                                                                                  Chapter 2: Assessing Organizational Performance | 37
achieving these overall aspirations, organizations also need to create goals--narrower targets that should
provide clear and tangible guidance to employees as they perform their work on a daily basis. The most effective
goals are those that are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-bound. An easy way to remember
these dimensions is to combine the first letter of each into one word: SMART (Table 2.3). Employees are put in
a good position to succeed to the extent that an organization's goals are SMART.

While missions and visions provide an overall sense of the organization's direction, goals are narrower aims that
    should provide clear and tangible guidance to employees. The most effective goals are those that are SMART

(specific, measurable, attainable , realistic, and time-bound). SMART goals help provide clarity, transparency, and
  accountability. As detailed below, one SMART goal is Coca-Cola's aim to "improve our water efficiency by 20%,
                                                        compared with a baseline year."

                                                               Table 2.3 Creating SMART Goals

 S Specific: Coca-Cola is seeking to improve its water efficiency by a specific amount--20%. In contrast, goals such as
       "do your best" are vague, making it difficult to decide if a goal is actually reached.

 M Measurable: Water efficiency can be calculated, so Coca-Cola is able to track its progress relative to its 20% target.
       If progress is slow, more resources can be devoted to achieving the goal.

 A Attainable: A series of research studies have established that performance is strongest when goals are challenging
       but attainable. Reaching a 20% improvement will require aggressive work by Coke, but the goal can be reached.
       Realistic: If Coca-Cola's water efficiency goal was 95% improvement, Coca-Cola's employees will probably react with

 R surprise. Reaching a goal must be feasible in order for employees to embrace it. Unrealistic goals make most people
       give up and basing goals on impossible clichs, such as "give 110%" creates confusion.
       Time-bound: Coca-Cola is seeking to achieve its 20% improvement. Some universities, such as Texas Tech

 T University, provide incentives, including preferred scheduling for students who sign contracts agreeing to graduate
       on a four-year schedule. Deadlines such as these are motivating and they create accountability.

Many of the principles for effective organizational vision, missions, and goals apply to individuals too. Here are
some ideas that might help you think differently about your own aspirations and how you are working to reach

                                                                        them.

            For example, meeting a goal of "write a page every day" might prevent panic the night before an important

            Creating challenging, but attainable educational goals (e.g. maintaining a 3.5 GPA) is likely to lead to
            higher performance than minimal goals (e.g., pass all my classes).
            To better understand your prospects in the job market, consider researching what kinds of jobs are
            common for your major and experience level.
            Time management is a challenge in today's world. If you tend to procrastinate, setting interim deadlines
            for yourself might help you to stay on schedule.

(Amos, 2010). Time will tell whether these goals inspire the scientific community and the country in general

(Table 2.4).

Corporate Values

In addition to constructing vision and mission statements, firms also develop corporate value statements.
These are explicit principles that the company endorses and lives by, and expects their employees to embrace.
Values related to integrity, diversity, and customer service are often seen on company websites. An information
technology company might include innovation as one of its values. Manufacturers may also have sustainability
or ecology related values.

Why are values statements important for a firm? They demonstrate to their employees and other stakeholders
the important principles that the organization lives by. Employees who do not uphold corporate values may see
their employment short-lived at the company. Values also show customers and potential customers what the
firm stands for. Some customers may choose a company based on how its values resonate with theirs.

What do values statements have to do with strategic management? An organization should seriously consider
their values statement when developing its strategies and goals. If a potential strategy conflicts with one of its
values, they need to drop or modify that strategy to ensure the company conforms to their corporate values as
they move their organization forward.

   Key Takeaway

          Strategic leaders need to ensure that their organizations have four types of aims. A vision states
             what the organization aspires to become in the future. A mission reflects the organization's past
             and present by stating why the organization exists and what role it plays in society. Goals are the
             more specific aims that organizations pursue to reach their visions and missions. The best goals
             are SMART: specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-bound. Corporate values are key
             principles that a company endorses and lives by.

2.3 Assessing Organizational Performance

Organizational Performance: A Complex Concept

Organizational performance refers to how well an organization is doing to reach its vision, mission, and goals.
Assessing organizational performance is a vital aspect of strategic management. Executives must know how
well their organizations are performing to figure out what strategic changes, if any, to make. Performance is a
very complex concept, however, and a lot of attention needs to be paid to how it is assessed.
To illustrate this complexity, consider a scenario: suppose that we offered a $10 bet on a coin toss. If it lands
on heads, you win $50. If it lands on tails, you lose your $10 bet. If you lost, was the decision a bad one? Well,
of course not. You had a 50% chance of winning $50 and a 50% chance of losing $10. In this case, the expected
value (EV) of your bet would be $20, ($50 * 50%) - ($10 * 50%). Thus, the decision to bet was a good one, but still
led to a poor outcome (or performance). In short, while one can generally expect good decisions to lead to good
performance, it is not always the case. The point of this scenario is to highlight that there are situations where
good strategies lead to bad outcomes, especially when low probability crises occur. In the case of COVID-19,
for example, solid strategies selected several years ago could lead to poor performance because of unexpected
conditions.
Two important considerations are (1) performance measures and (2) performance benchmarks (Figure 2.5). A
performance measure is a metric by which an organization's progress can be gauged. Most executives examine
measures such as profits, stock price, and sales in an attempt to better understand how well their organizations
are competing in the market. But these measures provide just a glimpse of organizational performance.
Performance benchmarks are also needed to assess whether an organization is doing well. A performance
benchmark is used to make sense of an organization's standing compared to its own or a competitor's financial
measures and/or performance indicators. Suppose, for example, that a firm has a profit margin of 20% in 2019.
This sounds great on the surface, but suppose that the firm's profit margin in 2018 was 35% and that the average
profit margin across all firms in the industry for 2019 was 40%. Viewed relative to these two benchmarks, the
firm's 2019 performance is cause for concern.

                                                           benchmarks is valuable because different measures

                                                           and benchmarks provide different information about

                                                           men and the elephant--popularized in Western

                                                           cultures through a poem by John Godfrey Saxe in the

                                                           nineteenth century--is useful for understanding the

                                                           complexity associated with measuring organizational

                                                           performance. As the story goes, six blind men set out

                                                           to "see" what an elephant was like. The first man

                                                           touched the elephant's side and believed the beast to

                                                           be like a great wall. The second felt the tusks and

trunk. The fifth, examining an ear, thought it was like a fan. The sixth, touching the tail, thought it was like a

rope. If the men failed to communicate their different impressions they would have all been partially right but

wrong about what ultimately mattered. The point is, an organization must consider organizational performance

from various and multiple perspectives to achieve an accurate assessment.

This story parallels the challenge involved in understanding the multidimensional nature of organization
performance because different measures and referents may tell a different story about the organization's
performance. For example, Fortune 500 lists the largest US firms in terms of sales. These firms are generally
not the strongest performers in terms of growth in stock price, however, in part because they are so big
that making major improvements is difficult. During the late 1990s, a number of internet-centered businesses
enjoyed exceptional growth in sales and stock price but reported losses rather than profits. Many investors in
these firms who simply fixated on a single performance measure--sales growth--absorbed heavy losses when
the stock market's attention turned to profits and the stock prices of these firms plummeted.

The number of performance measures and referents that are relevant for understanding an organization's
performance can be overwhelming. For example, a study of what performance metrics were used within
restaurant organizations' annual reports found that 788 different combinations of measures and referents were
used within this one industry in a single year (Short & Palmer, 2003). Thus executives need to choose a rich yet
limited set of performance measures and referents to focus on.

The Balanced Scorecard

To organize performance measures, Professor Robert Kaplan and Professor David Norton of Harvard University
developed a tool called the balanced scorecard. Using the scorecard helps managers resist the temptation
to fixate on financial measures and instead monitor a diverse set of important measures (Table 2.7). Indeed,
the idea behind the framework is to provide a "balance" between financial measures and other measures that
are important for understanding organizational activities that lead to sustained, long-term performance. The
balanced scorecard recommends that managers gain an overview of the organization's performance by tracking

44 | Chapter 2: Assessing Organizational Performance
a small number of key measures that collectively reflect four perspectives: (1) financial, (2) customer, (3) internal
business process, and (4) staff learning and growth (Kaplan & Norton, 1992).

         Because the concept of organizational performance is multidimensional, wise managers realize that
 understanding organizational performance is like flying a plane. Pilots must be on track in terms of altitude, air
speed, and oil pressure and make sure they have enough gas to finish their flight plan. For tracking organizational

       performance, assessing how the organization is doing financially is just a starting point. The "balanced
    scorecard" encourages managers to also monitor how well the organization is serving customers, managing
internal activities, and setting the stage for future improvements. This provides a fast but comprehensive view of
 the organization. As shown below, monitoring these four dimensions can also help individuals assess themselves.

                     often more important than formal
                     training.

Financial Measures

Financial measures of performance relate to organizational effectiveness and profits. Examples include
financial ratios such as return on assets, return on equity, and return on investment. Other common financial
measures include profits and stock price. Such measures help answer the key question, "How do we look to
shareholders?"

Financial performance measures are commonly articulated and emphasized within an organization's annual
report to shareholders. To provide context, such measures should be objective and be coupled with meaningful
referents, such as the firm's past performance. For example, Starbucks's 2019 annual report highlights the firm's
performance in terms of net revenue, operating income, and cash flow over a five-year period.

There are three approaches that organizations use to perform quantitative analysis: financial, market-based,
and general.

                                                                                                  Chapter 2: Assessing Organizational Performance | 45
Financial Analysis: This is basically ratio analysis; being able to make "apple to apple" comparisons between
firms or annual trends that account for variable volumes, sales, expenses, and profits. Using ratios allows a
direct comparison no matter the size of the firm. Table 2.8 provides basic financial ratios organizations use to
compare against benchmarks.

Market-Based Analysis: This analysis helps determine how the firm compares to its competitors in the market.
there are two measures to analyze a firm's position in the market:

1. Market Share = Firm's Total Product Revenue / Total Revenue in the industry or market

This measures the percentage of the market that a firm has. For example, if Apple's revenue from selling iPhones
is 25% of all the revenue generated from smartphone sales, Apple's market share is 25%.

2. Price-Earnings (PE) Ratio = Stock price / Earnings per Share (EPS)

The Price-Earnings Ration determines how much it costs to invest in the company to receive $1.00 in earnings.
For example, if one share of stock costs $10, and it produces $2 annually in earnings, the PE ratio is 5, meaning
it costs a $5 investment in this company to receive $1 in earnings. The lower the PE ratio, the better, as far as

46 | Chapter 2: Assessing Organizational Performance
a simple interpretation goes. However, a higher PE Ratio may indicate the market's belief that the company is a
strong performer and will be growing the stock price.

General Quantitative Analysis: There are other types of data sets that can provide useful information. For
example, trend analysis is used to determine how much volumes are changing each year, or extrapolate
economic data to make predictions. There most likely is industry-specific data to analyze and use as a
comparison for firms.

Performance Indicators: As referenced earlier, financial measures alone will not provide sufficient insight
into a firm's performance. While financial measures always have operational relevance, other performance
indicators often provide strategic insight that may not be evident from the financial picture. This section
provides some examples of the other kinds of performance measures helpful in strategic management.

Customer Measures

Customer measures of performance relate to customer attraction, satisfaction, and retention. These measures
provide insight to the key question "How do customers see us?" Examples might include the number of new
customers, customer satisfaction, and the percentage of repeat customers.

Starbucks realizes the importance of repeat customers and has taken a number of steps to satisfy and to
attract regular visitors to their stores. For example, Starbucks rewards regular customers through a rewards
program that allows customers to redeem the points they have accumulated for free drinks, bakery items, or
merchandise. They also offer all customers free Wi-Fi access (Miller, 2010). Often, firms need external measures
about their customers as well. For example, demographic data, taste preferences, or social trends.

Internal Business Process Measures

Internal business process measures of performance relate to organizational efficiency. These measures help
answer the key question "What must we excel at?" Examples include the time it takes to manufacture the
organization's goods or deliver a service. Another example of this type of measure is the time it takes to create
a new product and bring it to market. Productivity and quality data are other measures often targeted for
improvement.

Organizations such as Starbucks realize the importance of such efficiency measures for the long-term success
of its organization. For this reason, Starbucks carefully examines its processes with the goal of decreasing order
fulfillment time. In one example, Starbucks efficiency experts challenged their employees to assemble a Mr.
Potato Head to understand how work could be done faster (Jargon, 2009). The aim of this exercise was to help
Starbucks employees in general match the speed of the firm's high performers, who boast an average time per
order of twenty-five seconds.

                                                                                                  Chapter 2: Assessing Organizational Performance | 47
Learning and Growth Measures

Learning and growth measures of performance relate to the future. Such measures provide insight to ask the
question, "Can we continue to improve and create value?" Learning and growth measures focus on innovation
and proceed with an understanding that strategies change over time. Consequently, developing new ways to
add value will be needed as the organization continues to adapt to an evolving environment. Employees may
need additional training and skills to make a strategy achievable, or the firm may need to hire for the needed
skills. An example of a learning and growth measure is the number of new skills learned by employees every
year.
One way Starbucks encourages its employees to learn skills that may benefit both the firm and individuals in
the future is through its tuition reimbursement program. Employees who have worked with Starbucks for more
than a year are eligible. Starbucks hopes that the knowledge acquired while earning a college degree might
provide employees with the skills needed to develop innovations that will benefit the company in the future.
Another benefit of this program is that it helps Starbucks reward and retain high-achieving employees.

Measuring Performance Using the Triple Bottom Line

Ralph Waldo Emerson once noted, "Doing well is the result of doing good. That's what capitalism is all about."
While the balanced scorecard provides a popular framework to help executives understand an organization's
performance, other frameworks highlight areas such as social responsibility. One such framework, the triple
bottom line, emphasizes the three P's: people (making sure that the actions of the organization are socially
responsible), planet (making sure organizations act in a way that promotes environmental sustainability),
and traditional organization profits. This notion was introduced in the early 1980s but did not attract much
attention until the late 1990s.

              Figure 2.5: The triple bottom line emphasizes the three Ps of people (social concerns), planet
              (environmental concerns), and profits (economic concerns).

In the case of Starbucks, the firm has made clear the importance it attaches to the planet by creating an
environmental mission statement ("Starbucks is committed to a role of environmental leadership in all facets
48 | Chapter 2: Assessing Organizational Performance
of our business") in addition to its overall mission (Starbucks, 2011). In terms of the "people" dimension of the
triple bottom line, Starbucks strives to purchase coffee beans harvested by farmers who work under humane
conditions and are paid reasonable wages. The firm works to be profitable as well.

   Key Takeaway

          Organizational performance is a multidimensional concept, and wise managers rely on multiple
             measures of performance when gauging the success or failure of their organizations. The
             balanced scorecard provides a tool to help executives gain a general understanding of their
             organization's current level of achievement across a set of four important dimensions. The triple
             bottom line provides another tool to help executives focus on performance targets beyond
             profits alone. This approach stresses the importance of social (people) and environmental
             (planet) outcomes, as well as profit.

2.4 Competitive Advantage

While accounting measures and stock market returns provide a sense of how well a firm is performing, these
indicators may not be ideal if the intent is to understand which firms perform well systematically over the long
term. One limitation of those indicators is that they may reflect random perturbations in market outcomes. A
firm may have a stroke of good luck that leads it to capture exceptional profits, even if the strategic position
of its business is poor. A firm may also have a stroke of bad luck that leads it to have underwhelming profits,
even if the strategic position of its business is healthy. A second limitation of these indicators is that firms are
not always attempting to carry profits on their books. For example, there are several publicly traded firms that
rarely earn profits but are considered healthy, and even thriving, because they use much of their "would be"
profits to invest in further improving their businesses.
At a conceptual level, strategic management scholars are often less concerned with specific accounting and
stock market performance indicators and more concerned with the idea of competitive advantage. Before
offering a formal definition of competitive advantage, it is useful to recall the more familiar concept of economic
value creation. Economic value creation (EVC) is the difference between what a customer is willing to pay (WTP)
for a product and the cost incurred to produce the product.

                                                                EVC = WTP - Cost
The customer's WTP is also referred to as their reserve price--the maximum they are willing to pay for the

50 | Chapter 2: Assessing Organizational Performance
product. In this equation, cost reflects the cost incurred by the producer, rather than the cost to the consumer
of purchasing the product, which is referred to instead as the price of the product.
Economic value creation may vary across firms. Firms that sell the same product may each incur a different
cost of production. Further, consumers may be willing to pay one price when purchasing the good from one
firm, but willing to pay another price when purchasing the good from the firm's competitor. This all implies that
the economic value created will differ from firm to firm.
With this in mind, we can now say that a firm has a competitive advantage over a competitor if it has a larger
economic value creation than that competitor. For example, if we have two firms, A and B, A has a competitive
advantage over B if the economic value created by A exceeds the economic value created by B. The magnitude
of A's competitive advantage is given by the difference between the economic value created by each firm.
The concept of competitive advantage is useful for several reasons. First, unlike measures such as profits and
stock price, competitive advantage does not change based on random perturbations. If a firm's competitive
advantage increases, that means that either its economic value creation increased, or its competitor's economic
value creation decreased. These changes, in turn, reflect relative shifts in the cost structure, or relative shifts in
consumers' willingness to pay. Second, the notion of competitive advantage better reflects the strategic health
of firms that reinvest in their business, and therefore are healthy, but do not observe profits. For instance, if
firm A earns a profit of $100, but then re-invests $98 of that profit into the business to improve the product,
then the accounting profits are $2, but the actual health of the company may have improved because the
consumers willingness to pay for the product may have increased. Such a firm would still display a large
economic value creation measure, and therefore may still hold a competitive advantage.

2.5 Conclusion

This chapter explains several challenges that executives face in attempting to lead their organizations
strategically. Executives must ensure that their organizations have visions, missions, values, and goals in place
that help move these organizations forward. Measures and indicators for assessing performance must be
thoughtfully chosen. A Balanced Scorecard is a tool that firms can use to measure their progress. When
executives succeed at leading strategically, an organization has an excellent chance of gaining a competitive
advantage and achieve of success.

   Learning Objectives

     After reading this chapter, you should be able to understand and articulate answers to the following
     questions:

         1. What is the macro environment and why is it important to organizations?
        2. How is the PESTEL framework used to evaluate the external environment?
        3. How is the Porter's Five Forces tool used to perform a competitive analysis of an industry?
        4. What are strategic groups and how are they useful to evaluating the competitive environment?

3.1 Introduction

Businesses operate within an external macro-environment that affects the likelihood of their overall success or
failure. Forces beyond the control of businesses can hinder the growth of a business or perhaps be harnessed
to propel it forward. Strategic management requires that these external and competitive forces be evaluated,
so that opportunities may be leveraged and threats may be mitigated as strategies are developed to improve
the success of the firm.
This chapter will introduce three tools that help firms assess different perspectives of their competitive
environment. The PESTEL framework (Political, Economic, Socio-cultural, Environmental/Ecological, and
Legal) evaluates the macro-environment through the evaluation of six external forces. The competitive
environment of the industry also must be evaluated through Porter's Five Forces tool. Finally, Strategic Group
Mapping helps executives understand how their firm relates to other competitors in the market, and which are

                                                                                                    Chapter 3: Evaluating the External Environment | 53
their most direct competitors. Once this external analysis is complete, a firm can determine the true strategic
issue(s) it faces and can develop strategies to work on strategic issues that move the firm forward toward
accomplishing its vision.

Panera Bread: Riding the Trends

                Figure 3.1: Panera Bread took advantage of some external forces to expand rapidly.

Founded in 1981 in Boston, Panera Bread was originally a single shop called the Cookie Jar. The following year, its
founder, Ron Shaich, merged with Au Bon Pain, a struggling French Bakery in the US. They began to sell soups
and fresh sandwiches, at a time when most lunch options were fast food or sit-down restaurants. Shaich sensed
two socio-cultural emerging trends in the 1990's. One was the movement toward healthy eating. The other
was the public's desire for what would become the "fast casual" restaurant where customers could order at the
counter, get their meal quickly, have better food choices than fast food, and dine in an atmosphere conducive
to having meetings with friends or business associates. Starbucks helped to stimulate the popularity of the fast
casual boom. Shaich sold off Au Bon Pain and focused on building a brand of chain restaurants called Panera
Bread.
By 2010 there was a new Panera Bread opening every three days. Staying ahead of the technological forces
54 | Chapter 3: Evaluating the External Environment
in the industry, Shaich implemented digital ordering, a loyalty program, and a catering and delivery service.
The industry has adopted many of Panera Bread's innovations. By 2017, it had become one of America's most
successful restaurant chains and had expanded into Canada. Panera now has over 2000 locations, over 100,000
employees, and its stock is one of the best performers in the industry. Shaick was able to take advantage of
emerging trends in the US environment to build a very successful business.

3.2 The Relationship between an Organization and its Environment

What Is the Environment?

For any organization, the environment consists of the set of external conditions and forces that have the
potential to influence the organization. In the case of Panera Bread, for example, the environment contains its
customers, its rivals such as Chipotle and Starbucks, social trends such as the shift in society toward healthier
eating, political entities such as the US Congress, and many additional conditions and forces.
It is useful to break the concept of the competitive environment for a business down into two components: the
general environment and its industry. The general environment, or macro-environment, includes overall trends
and events in society such as social trends, technological trends, demographics, and economic conditions. The
industry, or competitive environment, consists of multiple organizations that collectively compete with one
another by providing similar goods, services, or both.
Every action that an organization takes, such as raising its prices or launching an advertising campaign, creates
some degree of change in the world around it. Most organizations are limited to influencing their industry.
Subway's move to cut salt in its sandwiches, for example, may lead other fast-food firms to revisit the amount
of salt contained in their products. A few organizations wield such power and influence that they can shape

                                                                                                    Chapter 3: Evaluating the External Environment | 55
some elements of the general environment. For instance, McDonalds's transition to cage free eggs by 2030 may
impact the entire US supply chain for eggs because McDonalds alone purchases approximately 4% of all eggs
produced annually, but only 10% of the eggs produced in 2018 were cage free. However, most organizations
simply react to major technological trends, for example, the actions of firms such as Intel, Microsoft, and Apple
help create these trends. Some aspects of the general environment, such as demographics, simply must be
taken as a given by all organizations. Overall, the environment has a far greater influence on most organizations
than most organizations have on the environment.

Why Does the Environment Matter?

Understanding the environment that surrounds an organization is important to the executives in charge of the
organizations. There are several reasons for this. First, the environment provides resources that an organization
needs in order to create goods and services. In the seventeenth century, British poet John Donne famously
noted that "no man is an island." Similarly, it is accurate to say that no organization is self-sufficient. As the
human body must consume oxygen, food, and water, an organization needs to take in resources such as labor,
money, and raw materials from outside its boundaries. Panera Bread, for example, simply would cease to exist
without the employees that operate its stores, the suppliers that provide food and other necessary inputs, and
the customers who provide Panera Bread with money through purchasing its products. An organization cannot
survive without the support of its environment.

Second, the environment is a source of opportunities
and threats for an organization. Opportunities are
events and trends that create chances to improve an
organization's performance level. In the late 1990s, for
example, the trends toward obesity in the US and the
need for healthy eating helped Panera Bread position
itself as a healthy alternative to traditional fast-food
restaurants. Threats are events and trends that may
undermine an organization's performance. Panera
Bread faces a threat from some upstart restaurant
chains. Saladworks, for example, offers a variety of
salads that contain fewer than five hundred calories.
Noodles and Company offers a variety of sandwiches, Figure 3.2: Natural disasters devastate many organizations.
pasta dishes, and salads that contain fewer than four
hundred calories. These two firms are much smaller than Panera Bread, but they could grow to become
substantial threats to Panera's positioning as a healthy eatery. Panera Bread and other firms must deal with the
uncertainty and other impacts of COVID with could threaten this industry for a long period.

Executives also must realize that virtually any environmental trend or event is likely to create opportunities
for some organizations and threats for others. This is true even in extreme cases. In addition to horrible
human death and suffering, the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan devastated many organizations,
ranging from small businesses that were simply wiped out to corporate giants such as Toyota, whose

56 | Chapter 3: Evaluating the External Environment
manufacturing capabilities were undermined. As odd as it may seem, however, these tragic events also opened
up significant opportunities for other organizations. The rebuilding of infrastructure and dwellings requires
concrete, steel, and other materials. Japanese concrete manufacturers, steelmakers, and construction
companies benefited in the wake of this tragedy.
Third, the environment shapes the various strategic decisions that executives make as they attempt to lead
their organizations to success. The environment often places important constraints on an organization's goals,
for example. A firm that sets a goal of increasing annual sales by 50% might struggle to achieve this goal during
an economic recession or if several new competitors enter its market. Environmental conditions also need
to be taken into account when examining whether to start doing business in a new country, acquire another
company, or launch an innovative product, to name just a few.

   Key Takeaway

          An organization's environment is a major consideration in strategic assessment. The
             environment is the source of resources that the organization needs. It provides opportunities
             and threats, and it influences the various strategic decisions that executives must make.

3.3 Evaluating the General Environment

The Elements of the General Environment: PESTEL Analysis

An organization's environment includes factors that it can readily affect as well as factors that largely lay beyond
its influence. The latter set of factors are said to exist within the general environment. Executives must track
trends and events as they evolve and try to anticipate the implications of these trends and events because the
general environment often has a substantial influence on an organization's level of success.
PESTEL analysis is one important tool that executives can rely on to organize factors within the general
environment and to identify how these factors influence industries and the firms within them. PESTEL is
an acronym, meaning it is an abbreviation formed from the initial letters of other words. PESTEL reflects
the names of the six segments of the general environment: (1) political, (2) economic, (3) socio-cultural, (4)
technological, (5) environmental, and (6) legal. Wise executives carefully examine each of these six segments to
identify major opportunities and threats and then adjust their firms' strategies accordingly (Table 3.1).
Before applying the PESTEL framework, it is important to identify which industry is being evaluated. For
example, for using this tool for Panera Bread, what industry is Panera Bread in? If the food service industry
is selected, then this includes all types of restaurants, from McDonalds to expensive, five-star restaurants.
The food service industry also includes hospital and university cafeterias and catering services. To provide a
more accurate assessment for Panera Bread, a smaller segment of the food service industry should be chosen.
How about the restaurant industry? This is still too broad. Picking a segment of the restaurant industry, the
fast casual restaurant industry, is the most helpful to analyze using PESTEL. To help determine what industry
to select, ask "Who does the company directly compete against, head to head?" In this case, Panera Bread
competes head to head with other fast casual restaurants. McDonalds, for example, competes head to head
with other fast food restaurants in the fast food restaurant industry.

   Examining the general environment involves gaining an understanding of key factors and trends in broader
 society. PESTEL analysis is a popular framework for organizing these factors and trends and isolating how they

   influence industries and the firms within them. Below we describe each of the six dimensions associated with
              PESTEL analysis: political, economic, socio-cultural, technological, environmental, and legal.

58 | Chapter 3: Evaluating the External Environment
                                                                 Table 3.1 PESTEL Framework
 P Political factors include elements such as tax policies, changes in trade restrictions and tariffs, and the stability of

      governments.
 E Economic factors include elements such as interest rates, inflation rates, gross domestic product, unemployment

      rates, levels of disposable income, and the general growth or decline of the economy.
 S Socio-cultural factors include trends in demographics such as population size, age, and ethnic mix, as well as

      cultural trends such as attitudes toward obesity and consumer activism.
 T Technological factors include, for example, changes in the rate of new product development, increases in

      automation, and advancements in service industry delivery.
 E Environmental factors, also called ecological factors, include, for example, natural disasters, global warming,

      pollution, and weather patterns.
 L Legal factors include laws involving issues such as employment, health and safety, discrimination, and antitrust.

P is for "Political"

The political segment centers on the role of governments in shaping business. This segment includes elements
such as tax policies, changes in trade restrictions and tariffs, and the stability of governments (Table 3.2).
Stated differently, the political segment consists of the way that the government is involved in the economy
or an industry. Immigration policy is an aspect of the political segment of the general environment that offers
important implications for many different organizations. For example, how to approach migrant labor in the
United States has been a hotly debated dilemma. Some hospital executives have noted that immigrants lacking
legal status put a strain on the healthcare system because these immigrants seldom can pay for medical
services, and hospitals by law cannot turn them away from emergency rooms. However, many industries, such
as hospitality, construction, and agriculture to name a few, rely heavily on migrant labor in its many forms, so
political forces directly impact an industry's ability to thrive.

  Examples of several key trends representing political factors in the general environment are illustrated below.

                                                                    Table 3.2 Political Factors
 The extent to which companies developing clean energy sources should be subsidized by the government versus being
 left on their own to compete with providers of traditional energy sources is currently a hotly contested political issue.

 The use of child labor was once commonplace in the United States. Now, firms face political scrutiny when using
 overseas suppliers that employ child labor.

 The word tariff is derived from an Arabic word meaning "fees to be paid." By levying tariffs and implementing other trade
 restrictions, governments can--to some extent--protect domestic firms from international competition.
 The stability of the US government provides a source of confidence for foreign firms who want to do business in the
 United States. Countries that face frequent regime change and political turmoil have a harder time attracting foreign
 investments.
 One of the most important duties of elected officials in the United States is to debate and set new tax policies.

                                                                                                    Chapter 3: Evaluating the External Environment | 59

For example, farmers argue that the current US immigration policy is harmful because it impedes their ability
to reliably get the work visas necessary each year to employ the critical mass of migrant labor required to
effectively and affordably harvest their crops. In particular, if farmers were forced to employ only workers
with preexisting legal status, the cost of produce would increase substantially because of a rise in the cost
of wages and the inevitable labor shortage to harvest the crops. Restaurant chains such as Panera would pay
higher prices for lettuce, tomatoes, and other perishables. As a result, Panera would have to decide whether to
absorb these costs or pass them along to customers by charging more for sandwiches. Overall, any changes in
immigration policy will have implications for hospitals, farmers, restaurants, and many other industries.

E is for "Economic"

The economic segment centers on the economic conditions within which organizations operate. It includes
elements such as interest rates, inflation rates, gross domestic product, unemployment rates, levels of
disposable income, and the general growth or decline of the economy (Table 3.3). The world-wide economic
crisis of 2020 created by COVID-19 had a tremendous negative effect on a vast array of organizations. Rising
unemployment discouraged consumers from purchasing expensive, nonessential goods such as automobiles
and television sets. Some businesses that were forced to close drained all their resources and were never able
to reopen.

One way to determine if the economic force is strong or weak in an industry is to ask, "If the economy drops, is
60 | Chapter 3: Evaluating the External Environment
this industry affected?" If the answer is yes, then the economic force is moderate, if not strong. In the hospital
industry, for example, the economic force is weak, as a dropping economy does not have much impact on
hospitals. People still need and use healthcare services in a poor economy, paid mostly by insurance.

  Examples of several key trends representing economic factors in the general environment are illustrated below.
                                                                   Table 3.3 Economic Factors

 The unemployment rate is the percentage of the labor force actively looking for employment within the last four weeks.
 During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the United States suffered through an unemployment rate of approximately
 25%. In 2020, the unemployment rate hit about 15% due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the highest since the Great
 Depression (The Washington Post, 2020).
 Housing starts is an economic indicator that measures the number of houses, apartments, and condos on which new
 construction has been started. Because construction involves a wide array of industries--concrete, steel, wood, drywall,
 plumbing, banks, and many others--housing starts are a carefully watched measure of economic conditions.
 Gross domestic product (GDP) refers to the market value of goods and services within a country produced in a given
 time period and serves as a rough indicator of a country's standard of living. The United States has a larger GDP than
 China, but China has enjoyed a much higher rate of GDP growth in recent years.
 The Federal Reserve System, commonly referred to as "The Fed", is the United States' central banking system. The Fed
 attempts to strengthen the economy through its decisions, such as setting short-term interest rates.
 Discretionary income refers to the amount of money individuals have to spend after all necessary bills are paid. As
 discretionary income increases, firms such as boutique clothing retailers that sell nonessential goods and services are
 more likely to prosper.
Some businesses, however, actually prospered during the COVID-19 crisis. Retailers that offer deep discounts,
such as Dollar General and Walmart, enjoyed an increase in their customer base as consumers sought to find
ways to economize. Grocery stores like Kroger and providers of personal protective equipment (PPE) also saw
their sales increase significantly.

                Figure 3.4: Decisions about interest rates made by the Federal Reserve create opportunities for some
                organizations and threats for others.

                                                                                                     Chapter 3: Evaluating the External Environment | 61
S is for "Socio-cultural"

A generation ago, ketchup was an essential element of every American pantry and salsa was a relatively
unknown product. Today, however, food manufacturers sell more salsa than ketchup in the United States. This
change reflects the socio-cultural segment of the general environment. Socio-cultural factors include trends in
demographics such as population size, age, and ethnic mix, as well as cultural trends such as attitudes toward
obesity and consumer activism (Table 3.4). The exploding popularity of salsa and other Hispanic foods reflects
the increasing number of Latinos in the United States, as well as the growing acceptance of Latino food by other
ethnic groups.

    Examples of several key trends representing social factors in the general environment are illustrated below.

                                                               Table 3.4 Socio-cultural Factors
 The rise of upscale cupcake outlets reflects a current trend in American eateries: pricey specialty stores are very popular
 among some consumers.
 In the 1800s, most American couples raised many children. Farmers, for example, took this approach because of the high
 infant mortality rate, and children provided an important source of labor that small, family farms needed in order to
 operate. Today, most families are smaller.
 The obesity rate in America, in 2020 was 40%, up from 30.5% in 2000, due in part to the increasing prevalence of
 fast-food restaurants and the popularity of sedentary activities such as playing video games (Galvin, 2020).
 Hemline theory contends that women's skirt lengths predict stock market increases and declines. The idea was born in
 the 1920s when economist George Taylor noticed that many women raised their skirts to reveal their silk stockings when
 times were good, but lowered their skirts to hide the fact that they weren't wearing stockings when times were tough.
 The tendency to collect material items while being reluctant to throw them away has led to a rise in self-storage outlets
 as well as awareness of a hoarding epidemic.

Sometimes changes in the social segment arise from unexpected sources. Before World War II, the American
workforce was overwhelmingly male. When millions of men were sent to Europe and Asia to fight in the war,
however, organizations had no choice but to rely heavily on female employees. At the time, the attitudes of
many executives toward women were appalling. Consider, for example, some of the advice provided to male
supervisors of female workers in the July 1943 issue of Transportation Magazine:

   Older women who have never contacted the public have a hard time adapting themselves and are inclined
      to be cantankerous and fussy. It's always well to impress upon older women the importance of friendliness
      and courtesy.

   General experience indicates that "husky" girls--those who are just a little on the heavy side--are more
      even tempered and efficient than their underweight sisters.

   Give every girl an adequate number of rest periods during the day. You have to make some allowances for
      feminine psychology. A girl has more confidence and is more efficient if she can keep her hair tidied, apply
      fresh lipstick and wash her hands several times a day.

62 | Chapter 3: Evaluating the External Environment
The tremendous contributions of female workers during the war
contradicted these awful stereotypes. The main role of women who
assembled airplanes, ships, and other war materials was to support
the military, of course, but their efforts also changed some male
executives' minds about what females could accomplish within
organizations if provided with opportunities. When men returned
from the war, women were largely displaced from their jobs.
Inequities in the workplace are still pervasive today, but modern
attitudes among men toward women in the workplace are much
more enlightened than they were in 1943. Nevertheless, as a
strategic decision maker, it is important to note that socio-cultural
trends like these take many decades to change significantly.

The trend toward widespread acceptance of women into the US            Figure 3.5: Women's immense contributions to

other restaurants benefit when the scarceness of time leads dual
income families to purchase take-out meals rather than cook at

English-speaking college graduates each year than does the United States.

T is for "Technological"

The technological segment centers on improvements in products and services that are provided by science.
Relevant factors include, for example, changes in the rate of new product development, increases in
automation, and advancements in service industry delivery (Table 3.5). One key feature of the modern era is
the ever-increasing pace of technological innovation. In 1965, Intel co-founder Gordon E. Moore offered an
idea that has come to be known as Moore's law. Moore's law suggests that the performance of microcircuit
technology roughly doubles every two years. This law has been very accurate in the decades since it was
offered.

    Examples of several key trends representing technological factors in the general environment are illustrated
                                                                         below.

                                                                Table 3.5 Technological Factors
 The adoption rate of new technology is closely monitored by market research firms. The internet reached 50 million
 users in 4 years. To reach the same number of users took 13 years for TV and 38 years for radio.
 Online shopping has transformed the retail market. Failure to successfully compete against Amazon has forced
 long-stable retailers like Sears, JCPennys, KMart, and Neiman Marcus to close stores or shut down all together.
 The dramatic changes in the video game industry over the past 25 years highlight the need to constantly adapt to
 technological factors to maintain market leadership. Once-mighty Atari has given way to current leaders Sony,
 Nintendo, and Microsoft.
 The popularity of smartphones has greatly changed how some businesses operate.
 The marketing of many products and services has been transformed because of social media.

                                                                              One implication of Moore's law is that over time
                                                                              electronic devices can become smaller but also more
                                                                              powerful. This creates important opportunities and
                                                                              threats in a variety of settings. Consider, for example,
                                                                              photography. Just a decade ago, digital cameras were
                                                                              popular and rather inexpensive. With the exception of
                                                                              high-end and action cameras, cell phone cameras have
                                                                              largely replaced digital cameras, which had replaced
                                                                              film cameras the decade before.

one hundred times faster, one hundred times lighter, and ten
times less expensive than a "portable" computer built in the
1980s.

64 | Chapter 3: Evaluating the External Environment
E is for "Environmental" or "Ecological"

The environmental segment involves the physical and ecological conditions within which organizations
operate. It includes factors such as natural disasters, pollution levels, global warming, and weather patterns
(Table 3.6). The threat of pollution, for example, has forced municipalities to treat water supplies with
chemicals. These chemicals increase the safety of the water but detract from its taste. This has created
opportunities for businesses that provide better-tasting water. Rather than consume cheap but bad-tasting tap
water, many consumers purchase bottled water. Global warming has created the need to restrict greenhouse
gases by reducing the burning of fossil fuels. The electric car industry is a result of this environmental force.
Most all automobile manufacturers have electric cars as part of their product lines.

  Examples of several key trends representing environmental/ecological factors in the general environment are
                                                                  illustrated below.

                                                               Table 3.6 Environmental Factors
 The Subaru automotive plant in Lafayette, Indiana was the first auto manufacturing facility to achieve zero landfill status.
 The increased number of solar energy companies and use of solar panels is a direct result of climate change.
 Individuals embracing the three Rs of green living--reduce, reuse, recycle--has fueled new business concepts such as
 Recycle Match, a firm that brings together waste products with businesses that need those materials.
 Concern about the environmental effects of burning fossil fuels has contributed to the growing popularity of electric
 scooters.
 The increase in the number of food cooperatives reflects growing interest in sustainable, natural foods that are
 produced with a high degree of social responsibility.

                                                             As is the case for many companies, bottled water

                                                             producers not only have benefited from the general

                                                             environment but also have been threatened by it. Some

                                                             estimates are that 80% of plastic bottles end up in

                                                             landfills. This has led some socially conscious

                                                             consumers to become hostile to bottled water.

                                                             Meanwhile, water filtration systems offered by Brita

                                                             and other companies are a cheaper way to obtain clean

                                                             and tasty water. Such systems also hold considerable

                                                             appeal for individuals who feel the need to cut personal

                                                             expenses due to economic conditions. In sum, bottled

water to combat pollution, but are faced with threats from the socio-cultural segment, the social conscience of

some consumers, and the economic segment, the financial concerns of other consumers. The ecological trend

toward reducing greenhouse gases and global warming, has also created opportunities for Elon Musk and Tesla

on several fronts. Companies that produce solar panels, lithium-ion batteries, and electric cars are ventures

Musk has started, leveraging the ecological forces that makes these products more and more desirable.

L is for "Legal"

The legal segment centers on how the courts and laws influence business activity. Examples of important legal
factors include employment laws, health and safety regulations, discrimination laws, and antitrust laws (Table
3.7).

Some people confuse the political factors with legal ones. The key distinction is that political factors are
related to the interactions and relationship between businesses and the government whereas legal factors are
the boundary parameters of business activities. For example, a government policy such as a trade restriction
between countries would constitute a political factor, not a legal one. Similarly, a law requiring employees to be
paid overtime past 40 hours would be a legal factor, not a political one.

Intellectual property rights are a particularly daunting aspect of the legal segment for many organizations.
When a studio such as Pixar produces a movie, a software firm such as Adobe revises a program, or a video
game company such as Activision devises a new game, these firms are creating intellectual property. Such
firms attempt to make profits by selling copies of their movies, programs, and games to individuals. Piracy of
intellectual property--a process wherein illegal copies are made and sold by others--poses a serious threat to
such profits. Law enforcement agencies and courts in many countries, including the United States, provide
organizations with the necessary legal mechanisms to protect their intellectual property from piracy.

     Examples of several key trends representing legal factors in the general environment are illustrated below.

                                                                      Table 3.7 Legal Factors
 Electronic recycling laws are creating opportunities for "green collar jobs." A Missouri law, for example, requires
 computer electronic equipment manufacturers to develop and implement recycling plans.
 The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 limits cartels and monopolies in the United States. Senator John Sherman was the
 principal author of this legislation.
 In the United States, it is illegal to discriminate against anyone based on age, race, religion, sex or disability.
 The role of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is to prevent work-related injuries, diseases, and
 fatalities by enforcing standards for workplace safety and health.
 Laws requiring that nutrition information must appear on the packaging of most food products are intended to protect
 consumers and help them make informed choices.

In other countries, such as China, piracy of intellectual property is quite common. Three other general
environment segments play a role in making piracy a major concern. First, in terms of the socio-cultural
segment, China is the most populous country in the world. Second, in terms of the economic segment, China's
affluence is growing rapidly. Third, in terms of the technological segment, rapid advances in computers and
communication have made piracy easier over time. Taken together, these various general environment trends
lead piracy to be a major source of angst for firms that rely on intellectual property to deliver profits.

Key Takeaway

     PESTEL is a framework that reflects general environmental factors--political, economic, socio-
        cultural, technological, environmental, and legal--that can impact an organization either
        positively or negatively. In many cases, executives can prevent negative outcomes and leverage
        positive forces by performing a PESTEL analysis to diagnose where in the general environment
        important opportunities and threats arise.

                                                                                              Chapter 3: Evaluating the External Environment | 67

3.4 Evaluating the Industry

The Purpose of Five Forces Analysis

Understanding the dynamics that shape how much profit potential exists within an industry is key to knowing
   how likely a particular firm is to succeed within the industry. There are five key forces that determine the

 profitability of a particular industry. Taken together, all five forces indicate the attractiveness of an industry.
    Attractive industries--those with favorable conditions--are more likely to experience higher profitability.

                                         Table 3.8 Porter's Five Forces

Industry Analysis: Porter's Five Forces

Threat of potential entrants are firms that are not currently considered viable competitors in the industry but that may
become viable competitors in the future. For example, Tesla Motors' production of electric vehicles poses a threat to
displace the traditional powers in the auto industry, and Chinese automakers are rumored to be eyeing the US market.

Bargaining power of suppliers to the auto industry include firms such as Lear Corporation who produces auto interior
systems.
Rivalry of industry competitors in the auto industry include firms such as Ford, Fiat Chrysler, and GM.

Bargaining power of buyers are those firms that buy directly from the industry such as automobile dealerships.
Automakers also have to pay careful attention to end users, of course, such as individual drivers and rental car agencies.

Threat of substitutes for the auto industry's products include bicycles and mass transit. Luckily for automakers
competing in the US market, Americans are notoriously reluctant to embrace these substitutes.

Visit the executive suite of any company and the chances are very high that the chief executive officer and her
vice presidents are relying on Five Forces Analysis to understand their industry. Introduced more than thirty
years ago by Professor Michael Porter of the Harvard Business School, Five Forces Analysis has long been and
remains perhaps the most popular analytical tool in the business world (Table 3.8).

                                         Chapter 3: Evaluating the External Environment | 69
                Figure 3.10: Porter's Five Forces

The purpose of Five Forces Analysis is to identify how much profit potential exists in an industry. To do so,
Five Forces Analysis considers the interactions among the competitors in an industry, potential new entrants
to the industry, substitutes for the industry's offerings, suppliers to the industry, and the industry's buyers
(Porter, 1979). If none of these five forces works to undermine profits in the industry, then the profit potential is
very strong. If all the forces work to undermine profits, then the profit potential is very weak. Most industries
lie somewhere in between these extremes. This could involve, for example, all five forces providing firms
with modest help or two forces encouraging profits while the other three undermine profits. Once executives
determine how much profit potential exists in an industry, they can then decide what strategic moves to make
to be successful. If the situation looks bleak, for example, one possible move is to exit the industry.

The Rivalry among Competitors in an Industry

The competitors in an industry are firms that produce similar products or services. Competitors use a variety
of moves such as advertising, new offerings, and price cuts to try to outmaneuver one another to retain existing
buyers and to attract new ones. Because competitors seek to serve the same general set of buyers, rivalry can
become intense (Table 3.9). Subway faces fierce competition within the restaurant business, for example. This is
illustrated by a quote from the man who built McDonald's into a worldwide icon. Former CEO Ray Kroc allegedly
once claimed that "if any of my competitors were drowning, I'd stick a hose in their mouth." While this sentiment

70 | Chapter 3: Evaluating the External Environment

                                                                          Table 3.9 Rivalry

Understanding the intensity of rivalry among an industry's competitors is important because the degree of
intensity helps shape the industry's profit potential. Of particular concern is whether firms in an industry
compete based on price. When competition is bitter and cutthroat, the prices competitors charge--and their
profit margins--tend to go down. If, on the other hand, competitors avoid bitter rivalry, then price wars can be
avoided and profit potential increases.

Every industry is unique to some degree, but there are some general characteristics that help to predict the
likelihood that fierce rivalry will erupt. Rivalry tends to be fierce, for example, to the extent that the growth rate
of demand for the industry's offerings is low (because a lack of new customers forces firms to compete more for
existing customers), fixed costs in the industry are high (because firms will fight to have enough customers to
cover these costs), competitors are not differentiated from one another (because this forces firms to compete
based on price rather than based on the uniqueness of their offerings), and exit barriers in the industry are high
(because firms do not have the option of leaving the industry gracefully). Exit barriers can include emotional
barriers, such as the bad publicity associated with massive layoffs, or more objective reasons to stay in an
industry, such as a desire to recoup considerable costs that might have been previously spent to enter and
compete.

Industry concentration is an important aspect of competition in many industries. Industry concentration is the
extent to which a small number of firms dominate an industry (Table 3.10). Among circuses, for example, the
four largest companies collectively own 89% of the market. Meanwhile, these companies tend to keep their
competition rather polite. Their advertising does not lampoon one another, and they do not put on shows in
the same city at the same time. This does not guarantee that the circus industry will be profitable; there are
four other forces to consider as well as the quality of each firm's strategy. But low levels of rivalry certainly help
build the profit potential of the industry.

In contrast, the restaurant industry is fragmented, meaning that the largest rivals control just a small fraction of
the business and that a large number of firms are important participants. Rivalry in fragmented industries tends
to become bitter and fierce. Quiznos, a chain of sub shops that is roughly 15% the size of Subway, has directed
some of its advertising campaigns directly at Subway, including one depicting a fictional sub shop called "Wrong
Way" that bore a strong resemblance to Subway.

Within fragmented industries, it is almost inevitable that over time some firms will try to steal customers from
other firms, such as by lowering prices, and that any competitive move by one firm will be matched by others.
In the wake of Subway's success in offering foot-long subs for $5, for example, Quiznos has matched Subway's
price. Such price jockeying is delightful to customers, of course, but it tends to reduce prices, and profit
margins) within an industry. Indeed, Quiznos later escalated its attempt to attract budget-minded consumers
by introducing a flatbread sandwich that cost only $2. Overall, when choosing strategic moves, Subway's
presence in a fragmented industry forces the firm to try to anticipate not only how fellow restaurant giants
such as McDonald's and Burger King will react but also how smaller sub shop chains like Quiznos and various
regional and local players will respond.

    Industry concentration refers to the extent to which large firms dominate an industry. Buyers and suppliers
generally have more bargaining power when they are from concentrated industries. This is because the firms that

    do business with them have fewer options when seeking buyers and suppliers. One popular way to measure
      industry concentration is via the percentage of total industry output that is produced by the four biggest

  competitors. Below are examples of industries that have high (80%-100%), medium (50%-79%), and low (below
                                                          50%) levels of concentration.

The Threat of Potential New Entrants to an Industry

Competing within a highly profitable industry is desirable, but it can also attract unwanted attention from
outside the industry. Potential new entrants to an industry are firms that do not currently compete in the
industry but may in the future (Table 3.11). New entrants tend to reduce the profit potential of an industry by
increasing its competitiveness. If, for example, an industry consisting of five firms is entered by two new firms,
this means that seven rather than five firms are now trying to attract the same general pool of customers. Thus,
executives need to analyze how likely it is that one or more new entrants will enter their industry as part of
their effort to understand the profit potential that their industry offers.

                                                            New entrants can join the fray within an industry in
                                                            several different ways. New entrants can be start-up
                                                            companies created by entrepreneurs, foreign firms
                                                            that decide to enter a new geographic area, supplier
                                                            firms that choose to enter their customers' business,
                                                            or buyer firms that choose to enter their suppliers'
                                                            business. The likelihood of these four paths being
                                                            taken varies across industries. Restaurant firms such as
                                                            Subway, for example, do not need to worry about their
                                                            buyers entering the industry because they sell directly
                                                            to individuals, not to firms. It is also unlikely that
                                                            Subway's suppliers, such as farmers, will make a big
                                                            splash in the restaurant industry.

Also, competitors based overseas sometimes enter Subway's core US market. In February 2011, Australia-based

Oporto opened its first US store in California (Odell, 2011). Oporto operates more than 130 chicken burger

restaurants in its home country. But Oporto didn't survive in the US, and closed its US stores in 2013.

Every industry is unique to some degree, but some general characteristics help to predict the likelihood
that new entrants will join an industry. New entry is less likely, for example, to the extent that existing
competitors enjoy economies of scale (because new entrants struggle to match incumbents' prices), capital
requirements to enter the industry are high (because new entrants struggle to gather enough cash to get
started), access to distribution channels is limited (because new entrants struggle to get their offerings to
customers), governmental policy discourages new entry, differentiation among existing competitors is high
(because each incumbent has a group of loyal customers that enjoy its unique features), switching costs are high
(because this discourages customers from buying a new entrant's offerings), expected retaliation from existing
competitors is high, and cost advantages independent of size exist.

                                                            Chapter 3: Evaluating the External Environment | 73
 The Great Wall of China effectively protected China against potential raiders for centuries. The metaphor of a
high wall as a defense against potential entrants is a key element in Porter's Five Forces model. Industries with
higher barriers to entry are in a safer defensive position than industries with lower barriers. Below we describe

                     several factors that make it difficult for would-be invaders to enter an industry.

Economies of scale                                  Table 3.11 New Entrants
                        As the number of customers a firm serves increases, the cost of serving each customer

Differentiation         The more expensive it is to enter a business, the less likely a new firm is to attempt to enter
                        it. When these capital requirements are substantial, as in the automobile and many other
Switching costs         manufacturing industries, existing competitors have less fear of new firms entering their
                        market. It is simply very difficult to gather up enough cash to enter certain businesses.
Expected retaliation    The ability to get goods and services to customers can pose a significant challenge to
                        would-be newcomers. In the auto industry, for example, a new firm would struggle to match
Cost advantages         the network of dealerships enjoyed by Ford, GM, and other automakers.
independent of size     Decisions made by governments can deter or encourage potential new entrants. In 2009, the
                        US government kept GM afloat via a massive infusion of cash. Had GM been left to die
                        instead, this could have opened the door for a new company to enter the industry, perhaps
                        by buying some of GM's factories.
                        Automakers spend millions of dollars each year on advertising in order to highlight the
                        unique features of their cars. A new entrant would struggle to match the differentiation that
                        years of advertising have created for various brands.
                        Switching costs endured by consumers are one of the challenges facing the makers of
                        alternative fuel vehicles. A massive number of gas stations and repair shops are in place to
                        support gasoline-powered cars, but few facilities can recharge or fix electric cars. At
                        present, few consumers are willing to live with the significant hassles and inconvenience
                        that arise when purchasing an alternative fuel vehicle.
                        New firms must be concerned about whether current industry members will aggressively
                        respond to them entering the market. If a firm succeeded in entering the automobile
                        business, for example, existing companies might slash their prices in order to keep their
                        market share intact.
                        Proprietary technology, access to raw materials, and desirable geographic location are all
                        examples of cost advantages not directly associated with size and economies of scale. In the
                        auto industry, the decades of engineering experience possessed by the major auto markers
                        is an example of such an advantage. A new entrant would struggle to duplicate this
                        know-how at any price.

The Threat of Substitutes for an Industry's Offerings

Executives need to take stock not only of their direct competition but also of players in other industries that
can steal their customers. Substitutes are offerings that differ from the goods and services provided by the
competitors in an industry but that fill similar needs to what the industry offers (Table 3.12). How strong of a
threat substitutes are depends on how effective substitutes are in serving an industry's customers.

At first glance, it could appear that the satellite television business is a tranquil one because there are only
two significant competitors in the US: DIRECTV and DISH Network. These two industry giants, however, face a

74 | Chapter 3: Evaluating the External Environment
daunting challenge from substitutes. The closest substitute for satellite television is provided by cable television
firms, such as Comcast and Charter Communications. DIRECTV and DISH Network also need to be wary of
streaming video services, such as Netflix, and video rental services, such as Redbox. The availability of viable
substitutes places stringent limits on what DIRECTV and DISH Network can charge for their services. If the
satellite television firms raise their prices, customers will be tempted to obtain video programs from alternative
sources. This limits the profit potential of the satellite television business.

In other settings, viable substitutes are not available, and this helps an industry's competitors enjoy profits.
Like light bulbs, candles can provide lighting within a home. Few consumers, however, would be willing to use
candles instead of light bulbs. Candles simply do not provide as much light as light bulbs. Also, the risk of
starting a fire when using candles is far greater than the fire risk of using light bulbs. Because candles are a
poor substitute, light bulb makers such as Sylvania and Phillips do not need to fear candle makers stealing their
customers and undermining their profits.

Figure 3.12: Few consumers would be willing to  The dividing line between which firms are competitors and
substitute candles for light bulbs.             which firms offer substitutes is a challenging issue for
                                                executives. Most observers would agree that, from Subway's
                                                perspective, sandwich maker Quiznos should be considered a
                                                competitor and that grocery stores such as Kroger offer a
                                                substitute for Subway's offerings. But what about full-service
                                                restaurants, such as Ruth's Chris Steak House, and "fast
                                                casual" outlets, such as Panera Bread? Whether firms such as
                                                these are considered competitors or substitutes depends on
                                                how the industry is defined. Under a broad
                                                definition--Subway competes in the restaurant
                                                business--Ruth's Chris and Panera should be considered
                                                competitors. Under a narrower definition--Subway competes
                                                in the sandwich business--Panera is a competitor and Ruth's
                                                Chris is a substitute. Under a very narrow definition--Subway
                                                competes in the sub sandwich business--both Ruth's Chris
                                                and Panera provide substitute offerings. Thus clearly defining
                                                a firm's industry is an important step for executives who are

A substitute teacher is a person who fills in for a teacher. Some substitute teachers are almost as good as the "real"
  teacher while others are woefully inadequate. In business, the competitors in an industry not only must watch
  each other, they must keep an eye on firms in other industries whose products or services can serve as effective
      substitutes for their offerings. In some cases, substitutes are so effective that they are said to "disrupt" the
    industry, meaning they kill most or all industry demand. Below we note a number of effective substitutes for
                                                               particular industries.

 Emails and faxes are less expensive substitutes for some of the US Postal Service's offerings. Meanwhile, text messages
 can serve as substitutes for many emails.
 Typewriting classes were once common in schools. But once personal computers and printers became widely accepted,

 Railroads once held almost a monopoly position on freight transportation. However, the rise of the trucking industry
 reduced demand for the railroad industry's services.
 DIRECTV's commercials compare the firm's offerings not only to what its fellow satellite television provider DISH
 Network provides but also to the offerings of a close substitute--cable television companies.

The Power of Suppliers to an Industry

Suppliers provide inputs that the firms in an industry need to create the goods and services that they in turn sell
to their buyers. A variety of supplies are important to companies, including raw materials, financial resources,
and labor (Table 3.13). For restaurant firms such as Subway, key suppliers include such firms as Sysco that bring
various foods to their doors, restaurant supply stores that sell kitchen equipment, and employees that provide
labor.

The relative bargaining power between an industry's competitors and its suppliers help shape the profit
potential of the industry. If suppliers have greater leverage over the competitors than the competitors have over
the suppliers, then suppliers can increase their prices over time. This cuts into competitors' profit margins and
makes them less likely to be prosperous. On the other hand, if suppliers have less leverage over the competitors
than the competitors have over the suppliers, then suppliers may be forced to lower their prices over time. This
strengthens competitors' profit margins and makes them more likely to be prosperous. Thus when analyzing
the profit potential of their industry, executives must carefully consider whether suppliers have the ability to
demand higher prices.

Every industry is unique to some degree, but some general characteristics help to predict the likelihood that
suppliers will be powerful relative to the firms to which they sell their goods and services. Suppliers tend to be
powerful, for example, to the extent that the suppliers' industry is dominated by a few companies, if it is more
concentrated than the industry that it supplies and/or if there is no effective substitute for what the supplier
group provides. These circumstances restrict industry competitors' ability to shop around for better prices and
put suppliers in a position of strength.

Supplier power is also stronger to the extent that industry members rely heavily on suppliers to be profitable,
industry members face high costs when changing suppliers, and suppliers' products are differentiated. Finally,
suppliers possess power to the extent that they have the ability to become a new entrant to the industry if they
wish. This is a strategy called forward vertical integration. Ford, for example, used a forward vertical integration
strategy when it purchased rental car company and Ford customer, Hertz. A difficult financial situation forced
Ford to sell Hertz for $5.6 billion 11 years later. But before rental car companies such as Avis and Thrifty drive too

hard of a bargain when buying cars from an automaker, their executives should remember that automakers are
much bigger firms than are rental car companies. The executives running the automaker might simply decide
that they want to enjoy the rental car company's profits themselves and acquire the firm.

      A number of characteristics that impact the power of suppliers to a given industry are illustrated below.

When dealing with a large company, a small supplier can get squashed like a bug on a windshield.

As depicted in the 2008 movie Flash of Genius, Kearns dreamed of manufacturing the wipers and
selling them to Detroit automakers. Rather than buy the wipers from Kearns, Ford replicated the
design. An angry Kearns then spent many years trying to hold the firm accountable for infringing
on his patent. Kearns eventually won in court, but he paid a terrible personal price along the way,

including a nervous breakdown and estrangement from his family. Kearns's lengthy battle with Ford
illustrates the concept of bargaining power that is central to Porter's Five Forces model. Even
though Kearns created an exceptional new product, he had little leverage when dealing with a
massive, well-financed automobile manufacturer.

The Power of an Industry's Buyers

Buyers purchase the goods and services that the firms in an industry produce (Table 3.14). For Panera Bread and
other restaurants, buyers are individual people. In contrast, the buyers for some firms are other firms rather
than end users. For Procter & Gamble, for example, buyers are retailers such as Walmart and Target who stock
Procter & Gamble's pharmaceuticals, hair care products, pet supplies, cleaning products, and other household
goods on their shelves.

                                          time. This weakens competitors' profit margins and makes them less
                                          likely to be prosperous. Walmart furnishes a good example. The
                                          mammoth retailer is notorious among manufacturers of goods for
                                          demanding lower and lower prices over time (Bianco & Zellner, 2003). In
                                          2008, for example, the firm threatened to stop selling compact discs if
                                          record companies did not lower their prices. Walmart has the power to
                                          insist on price concessions because its sales volume is huge. Compact
                                          discs make up a small portion of Walmart's overall sales, so exiting the
                                          market would not hurt Walmart. From the perspective of record
                                          companies, however, Walmart is their biggest buyer. If the record
                                          companies were to refuse to do business with Walmart, they would miss
                                          out on access to a large portion of consumers.

                                          On the other hand, if buyers have less leverage over the competitors than
                                          the competitors have over the buyers, then competitors can raise their
                                          prices and enjoy greater profits. This description fits the textbook

industry quite well. College students are often dismayed to learn that an assigned textbook costs $150 or
more. Historically, textbook publishers have been able to charge high prices because buyers had no leverage.
A student enrolled in a class must purchase the specific book that the professor has selected. Used copies are
sometimes a lower-cost option, but textbook publishers have cleverly worked to undermine the used textbook
market by releasing new editions after very short periods of time.

Of course, the presence of a very high profit industry is attractive to potential new entrants. Firms such as, the
publisher of this book, have entered the textbook market with lower-priced offerings. Time will tell whether
such offerings bring down textbook prices. Like any new entrant, upstarts in the textbook business must prove
that they can execute their strategies before they can gain widespread acceptance. Overall, when analyzing the
profit potential of their industry, executives must carefully consider whether buyers have the ability to demand
lower prices. In the textbook market, buyers do not.

        A number of characteristics that impact the power of buyers to a given industry are illustrated below.

                                              Table 3.14 Power of Buyers

Every industry is unique to some degree, but some general characteristics help to predict the likelihood that
buyers will be powerful relative to the firms from which they purchase goods and services. Buyers tend to be
powerful, for example, to the extent that there are relatively few buyers compared with the number of firms
that supply the industry, the industry's goods or services are standardized or undifferentiated, buyers face little
or no switching costs in changing vendors, the good or service purchased by the buyers represents a high
percentage of the buyer's costs, and the good or service is of limited importance to the quality or price of the
buyer's offerings.

                                              Chapter 3: Evaluating the External Environment | 79
Finally, buyers possess power to the extent that they have the ability to become a new entrant to the industry if
they wish. This strategy is called backward vertical integration. DIRECTV used to be an important customer of
TiVo, the pioneer of digital video recorders. This situation changed, however, when executives at DIRECTV grew
weary of their relationship with TiVo. DIRECTV then used a backward vertical integration strategy and started
offering DIRECTV-branded digital video recorders. Profits that used to be enjoyed by TiVo were transferred at
that point to DIRECTV.

Interpreting the Five Forces

When using Porter's Five Forces tool, it is important to note the strength of each of the five forces that
are analyzed. The forces are typically ranked as Strong/High, Moderate/Medium, or Weak/Low. If these
competitive forces within an industry are high, then the profit potential in that industry is low. Strong forces
indicate high competition for the profits within that industry, making it a less desirable industry to be in.
Conversely, if the forces within an industry are generally weak, this indicates a stronger potential for profit and
a desirable industry to be in. A mixture of strong and weak forces means there is profit potential, but there
exist competitive forces within the industry that can dilute the profit potential. Upon doing Porter's Five Forces
Analysis, companies should make an informed decision on entering that market, and how they might compete,
given the various strengths of the forces.

The Limitations of Five Forces Analysis

Five Forces Analysis is useful, but it has some limitations too. The description of Five Forces Analysis provided
by its creator, Michael Porter, seems to assume that competition is a zero-sum game, meaning that the amount
of profit potential in an industry is fixed. One implication is that if a firm is to make more profit, it must take
that profit from a rival, a supplier, or a buyer. In some settings, however, collaboration can create a larger pool
of profit that benefits everyone involved in the collaboration. In general, collaboration is a possibility that Five
Forces Analysis tends to downplay. The relationships among the rivals in an industry, for example, are depicted
as adversarial. In reality, these relationships are sometimes adversarial and sometimes collaborative. General
Motors and Toyota compete fiercely all around the world, for example, but they also have worked together in
joint ventures. Similarly, Five Forces Analysis tends to portray a firm's relationships with its suppliers and buyers
as adversarial, but many firms find ways to collaborate with these parties for mutual benefit. Indeed, concepts
such as just-in-time inventory systems depend heavily on a firm working as a partner with its suppliers and
buyers.

Key Takeaway

     "How much profit potential exists in our industry?" is a key question for executives. Five Forces
        Analysis provides an answer to this question. It does this by considering the interactions among
        the competitors in an industry, potential new entrants to the industry, substitutes for the
        industry's offerings, suppliers to the industry, and the industry's buyers.

3.5 Mapping Strategic Groups

Understanding Strategic Groups

The analysis of the strategic groups in an industry can offer important insights to executives. Strategic groups
are sets of firms that follow similar strategies to one another (Hunt, 1972; Short et al., 2007). More specifically,
a strategic group consists of a set of industry competitors that have similar characteristics to one another but
differ in important ways from the members of other groups (Table 3.15).
Understanding the nature of strategic groups within an industry is important for at least three reasons. First,
emphasizing the members of a firm's group is helpful because these firms are usually its closest rivals. When
assessing their firm's performance and considering strategic moves, the other members of a group are often
the best referents for executives to consider. In some cases, one or more strategic groups in the industry are
irrelevant. Subway, for example, does not need to worry about competing for customers with the likes of Ruth's
Chris Steak House and P. F. Chang's. This is partly because firms confront mobility barriers that make it difficult
or illogical for a particular firm to change groups over time. Because Subway is unlikely to offer a gourmet steak
as well as the experience offered by fine dining outlets, they can largely ignore the actions taken by firms in
that restaurant industry strategic group.
Second, the strategies pursued by firms within other strategic groups highlight alternative paths to success.
A firm may be able to borrow an idea from another strategic group and use this idea to improve its situation.
During the recession of the late 2000s, mid-quality restaurant chains such as Applebee's and Chili's used a
variety of promotions such as coupons and meal combinations to try to attract budget-conscious consumers.
Firms such as Subway and Quiznos that already offered low-priced meals still had an inherent price advantage
over Applebee's and Chili's, however: there is no tipping expected at the former restaurants, but there is at
the latter. It must have been tempting to executives at Applebee's and Chili's to try to expand their appeal to
budget-conscious consumers by experimenting with operating formats that do not involve tipping.

                                                                                                    Chapter 3: Evaluating the External Environment | 83
                Figure 3.15: Strategic groups are sets of firms that follow similar strategies. Understanding the nature of
                strategic groups within an industry is important in part because the members of a firm's group are
                usually that firm's closest rivals. Below we illustrate several strategic groups in the restaurant industry.

Third, the analysis of strategic groups can reveal gaps in the industry that represent untapped opportunities.
Within the restaurant business, for example, it appears that no national chain offers both very high quality
meals and a very diverse menu. Perhaps the firm that comes the closest to filling this niche is the Cheesecake
Factory, a chain of approximately 150 outlets whose menu includes more than 200 lunch, dinner, and dessert
items. Ruth's Chris Steak House already offers very high quality food; its executives could consider moving
the firm toward offering a very diverse menu as well. This would involve considerable risk, however. Perhaps
no national chain offers both very high quality meals and a very diverse menu because doing so is extremely
difficult. Nevertheless, examining the strategic groups in an industry with an eye toward untapped
opportunities offers executives a chance to consider novel ideas.

                                                              example, it could be the number of routes flown. It can

the strategic group map, the natural groupings of the companies can be determined and circled. The stiffest

competition in the industry typically happens within each strategic group. Profitability between each group

often varies. It is generally difficult to move from one group to another, as mobility barriers exist hindering the

ability of a firm to impact the chosen competitive factors being measured.

3.6 Conclusion

This chapter explains several considerations for examining the external environment that executives must
monitor to lead their organizations strategically. Executives must be aware of trends and changes in the general
environment, as well as the condition of their specific industry, as elements of both have the potential to
change considerably over time. While PESTEL analysis provides a useful framework to understand the general
environment, Porter's five forces is helpful to make sense of an industry's profit potential and competitive
environment. Strategic groups are valuable for understanding close competitors that affect a firm more than
other industry members. When executives carefully monitor their organization's environment using these tools,
they greatly increase the chances of their organization being successful.

   Learning Objectives

     After reading this chapter, you should be able to understand and articulate answers to the following
     questions:

         1. What is the Resource-Based View and why is it important to organizations?
        2. How is the VRIO tool applied to strategic resources?
        3. In what ways can intellectual property serve as a value-added resource for organizations?
        4. What are isolating mechanisms and how can they contribute to a firm's competitive advantage?
        5. How can the Value Chain be applied to achieve a competitive advantage?

4.1 Introduction

In addition to evaluating the external environment of a firm and the industry in which it operates, strategic
management requires that a firm conduct an internal assessment of its resources and capabilities. This further
helps the firm answer the question "Where are we?" before setting strategies for reaching the goals and vision
of the organization. Part of this assessment is the organizational performance evaluation discussed in Chapter 2
that deals primarily with financial and other quantitative information. This helps the firm determine where it is
in comparison with its competitors. Next, the firm needs to look inside to see how it can achieve a competitive
advantage over its rivals, so customers will buy what the firm has to sell instead of buying from competitors.
One method of internal assessment is using the Resource-Based View. This model examines any resources and/
or capabilities of the firm that may provide a competitive advantage. The VRIO framework is used to evaluate
each resource or capability to determine what type, if any, of competitive advantage it brings. If a resource
or capability cannot be imitated by a competitor, then that resource may create a sustained competitive

88 | Chapter 4: Evaluating the Internal Environment
advantage. Patents or isolating mechanisms can reduce or eliminate temporarily the opportunity for a rival to
imitate.
Another tool used for internal assessment is Value Chain Analysis. Each element of a firm's primary and
supportive activities are examined to see if it can provide a competitive advantage over its rivals. Weaknesses
that are identified can be addressed to improve organizational performance.
Once the external and internal assessments are complete, the firm can use the most relevant information to
develop a SWOT analysis and identify the most pressing strategic issue(s) the firm must address, as discussed
in Chapter 5.

                                                                                                     Chapter 4: Evaluating the Internal Environment | 89

    Southwest Airlines: Let Your LUV Flow

                                       Figure 4.1: Southwest Airlines marked forty-seven consecutive
                                       profitable years in 2019

       In 1971, a new firm named Southwest Airlines opened for business by offering flights between
       Houston, San Antonio, and its headquarters at Love Field in Dallas. From its initial fleet of three
       airplanes and three destinations, Southwest has grown to operate hundreds of airplanes in scores
       of cities. Despite competing in an industry that is infamous for bankruptcies and massive financial
       losses, Southwest marked its forty-seventh profitable year in a row in 2019.
       Why has Southwest succeeded while many other airlines have failed? Historically, the firm has
       differed from its competitors in a variety of important ways. Most large airlines use a "hub and
       spoke" system. This type of system routes travelers through a large hub airport on their way from
       one city to another. Many Delta passengers, for example, end a flight in Atlanta and then take a
       connecting flight to their actual destination. The inability to travel directly between most pairs of
90 | Chapter 4: Evaluating the Internal Environment
       cities adds hours to a traveler's itinerary and increases the chances of luggage being lost. In
       contrast, Southwest does not have a hub airport; preferring instead to connect cities directly. This
       makes flying on Southwest attractive to many travelers.
       Southwest has also been more efficient than its rivals. While most airlines use a variety of different
       airplanes, Southwest operates only one type of jet: the Boeing 737. This means that Southwest can
       service its fleet much more efficiently than can other airlines. Southwest mechanics need only the
       know-how to fix one type of airplane, for example, while their counterparts with other firms need a
       working knowledge of multiple planes. Southwest also gains efficiency by not offering seat
       assignments in advance, unlike its competitors. This makes the boarding process move much faster,
       meaning that Southwest's jets spend more time in the air transporting customers (and making
       money) and less time at the gate relative to its rivals' planes.
       Organizational culture is the dimension along which Southwest perhaps has differed most from its
       rivals. The airline industry as a whole suffers from a reputation for mediocre (or worse) service and
       indifferent (sometimes even surly) employees. In contrast, Southwest enjoys strong loyalty and a
       sense of teamwork among its employees.
       One tangible indicator of this culture is Southwest's stock ticker symbol. Most companies choose
       stock ticker symbols that evoke their names. Ford's ticker symbol is F, for example, and Walmart's
       symbol is WMT. When Southwest became a publicly traded company in 1977, executives chose LUV
       as its ticker symbol. LUV pays a bit of homage to the firm's humble beginnings at Love Field. More
       important, however, LUV represents the love that executives have created among employees,
       between employees and the company, and between customers and the company. This "LUV affair"
       has long been and remains a huge success. As recently as March 2011, for example, Southwest was
       ranked fourth on Fortune magazine's World's Most Admired Company list.
       In early 2020, the US and the world were hit by the coronavirus pandemic. The number of airline
       passengers dropped by over 90% during the peak months early in the pandemic. Southwest
       implemented cost saving measures, but still lost $94 million in the first quarter (PRNewswire, 2020).
       Known for its efficiency, how can Southwest drive down costs to reflect the new reality of less air
       travel and lower volumes for years to come? Where in its value chain can it not only trim costs but
       reinvent itself as a more cost effective organization? What resources and capabilities does the
       airline have to help it re-tool and not only survive the crisis, but come out a sustainable winner for
       the future?

   According to resource-based theory, organizations that own "strategic resources" have important competitive
   advantages over organizations that do not. Some resources, such as cash and trucks, are not considered to be
     strategic resources because an organization's competitors can readily acquire them. Instead, a resource is
 strategic to the extent that it is valuable, rare, difficult to imitate, and organized to capture value. Consider how

                           Southwest Airlines's organizational culture serves as a strategic resource.

competitive advantage.                               customer service attention and actions.

Important Points to Remember:

1. Resources such as Southwest's culture that reflect all four qualities--valuable, rare, difficult to imitate, and
     organized to capture value--are ideal because they can create sustained competitive advantages. A
     resource that has three or less of the qualities can provide an edge in the short term, but competitors can
     overcome such an advantage eventually.

2. Firms often bundle together multiple resources and strategies (that may not be unique in and of
     themselves) to create uniquely powerful combinations. Southwest's culture is complemented by
     approaches that individually could be copied--the airline's emphasis on direct flights, its reliance on one
     type of plane, and its unique system for passenger boarding--in order to create a unique business model in
     which effectiveness and efficiency is the envy of competitors.

3. Satisfying only one or two of the valuable, rare, difficult-to-imitate, organized to capture value criteria
     will likely only lead to competitive parity or a temporary advantage.

  Resources and capabilities are the basic building blocks that organizations use to create strategies. These two
                       building blocks are tightly linked--capabilities from using resources over time.

      Resources can be divided into two main types: tangible and intangible. While resources refer to what an
organization owns, capabilities refer to what the organization can do. More specifically, capabilities refer to the

   firm's ability to bundle, manage, or otherwise exploit resources in a manner that provides added value and,
                                                  hopefully, advantage over competitors.

 Resources
 Tangible resources are resources that can be readily seen, touched, and quantified. Physical assets such as a firm's
 property, plant, and equipment are considered to be tangible resources, as is cash.
 Intangible resources are quite difficult to see, touch, or quantify. Intangible resources include, for example, the
 knowledge and skills of employees, a firm's reputation, and a firm's culture. In a nod to Southwest Airlines' outstanding
 reputation, the firm ranks eighth in Fortune magazine's 2018 list of the "World's Most Admired Companies."
 Capabilities
 A dynamic capability exists when a firm is skilled at continually updating its array of capabilities to keep pace with
 changes in its environment. Coca-Cola, for example, has an uncanny knack for building new brands and products as the
 soft drink market evolves. Not surprisingly, this firm ranks among the top twelve in Fortune's "World's Most Admired
 Companies" for 2020.

Resources and Capabilities

The tangibility of a firm's resources is an important consideration within resource-based theory. Tangible
resources are resources that can be readily seen, touched, and quantified. Physical assets such as a firm's
property, plant, and equipment, as well as cash, are considered to be tangible resources. In contrast, intangible
resources are quite difficult to see, to touch, or to quantify. Intangible resources include, for example, the
knowledge and skills of employees, a firm's reputation, brand name, exclusive rights to intellectual property,
leadership traits of executives, and a firm's culture. In comparing the two types of resources, intangible
resources are more likely to meet the criteria for strategic resources (i.e., valuable, rare, difficult-to-imitate,
and organized to capture value) than are tangible resources. Executives who wish to achieve long-term
competitive advantages should therefore place a premium on trying to nurture and develop their firms'
intangible resources.

Capabilities are another key concept within resource-based theory. An effective way to distinguish resources
and capabilities is this: resources refer to what an organization owns, capabilities refer to what the organization
can do (Table 4.2). Capabilities tend to arise over time as a firm takes actions that build on its strategic
resources. Southwest Airlines, for example, has developed the capability of providing excellent customer
service by building on its strong organizational culture. Capabilities are important in part because they are
how organizations capture the potential value that resources offer. Customers do not simply send money to an
organization because it owns strategic resources. Instead, capabilities are needed to bundle, to manage, and
otherwise to exploit resources in a manner that provides value added to customers and creates advantages over
competitors.

Some firms develop a dynamic capability. This means that a firm has a unique ability to create new capabilities.
Said differently, a firm that enjoys a dynamic capability is skilled at continually updating its array of capabilities
to keep pace with changes in its environment. Coca-Cola has an uncanny knack for building new brands and
products as the soft-drink market evolves. Not surprisingly, Coca-Cola ranks among the top twelve in Fortune's
"World's Most Admired Companies" for 2020.

VRIO: Four Characteristics of Strategic Resources

                              Figure 4.3: The VIRO Framework
Resource-based theory can be confusing because the term resources is used in many different ways within
everyday common language. It is important to distinguish strategic resources from other resources. To most
individuals, cash is an important resource. Tangible goods such as one's car and home are also vital resources.

                                                                                                     Chapter 4: Evaluating the Internal Environment | 95
When analyzing organizations, however, common resources such as cash and vehicles are not considered
to be strategic resources. Resources such as cash and vehicles are valuable, of course, but an organization's
competitors can readily acquire them. Thus an organization cannot hope to create an enduring competitive
advantage around common resources.

Southwest Airlines provides an illustration of resource-based theory in action. Resource-based theory
contends that the possession of strategic resources provides an organization with a golden opportunity to
develop competitive advantages over its rivals (Table 4.1). These competitive advantages in turn can help the
organization enjoy strong profits (Barney, 1991; Wernerfelt, 1981).

A strategic resource is an asset that is valuable, rare, difficult to imitate, and organized to capture value (Barney,
1991; Chi, 1994). A resource is valuable to the extent that it helps a firm create strategies that capitalize on
opportunities and ward off threats. Southwest Airlines' culture fits this standard well. Most airlines struggle to
be profitable, but Southwest makes money virtually every year. One key reason is a legendary organizational
culture that inspires employees to do their very best. This culture is also rare in that strikes, layoffs, and poor
morale are common within the airline industry. Southwest embraces a culture of fun for both its customers and
employees. Most other airlines do not have this philosophy.

Competitors have a hard time duplicating resources that are difficult to imitate. Some difficult to imitate
resources are protected by various legal means, including trademarks, patents, and copyrights. Other resources
are hard to copy because they evolve over time and they reflect unique aspects of the firm. Southwest's culture
arose from its very humble beginnings. The airline had so little money that at times it had to temporarily
"borrow" luggage carts from other airlines and put magnets with the Southwest logo on top of the rivals' logo.
Southwest is a "rags to riches" story that has evolved across several decades. Other airlines could not replicate
Southwest's culture, regardless of how hard they might try, because of Southwest's unusual history.

A resource is organized to capture value when the firm has organizational systems, processes, and structure
in place to capitalize on the resource for a competitive advantage. This may provide bargaining power for the
firm in the marketplace. A key benefit of Southwest's culture is that it leads employees to treat customers well,
which in turn creates loyalty to Southwest among passengers. This customer loyalty is why many passengers
choose Southwest over other airlines.

The key to using the Resource Based View is to evaluate a firm's resources and capabilities using the VRIO
framework decision tree.

Note that the decision tree is used to assess resources and capabilities, NOT a firm's products, services, or
the firm itself. The evaluation occurs within the industry of the firm being evaluated. Using Southwest Airlines
culture as the resource to evaluate with VRIO:

 1. Is Southwest's culture valuable? If not, all the effort to develop it is a waste of resources and a competitive
      disadvantage. If yes, go to number 2.

2. Is Southwest's culture rare within the airline industry? If not, then this resource only provides Southwest
      competitive parity. It does not help or hurt Southwest competitively. If yes, go to number 3.

3. In the airline industry, is Southwest's culture hard to imitate? If not then culture provides Southwest with
      a temporary competitive advantage over its rivals, but competitors can imitate it. If yes, go to number 4.

96 | Chapter 4: Evaluating the Internal Environment
4. Has Southwest organized this resource of culture to capture value? If not, then it still only provides a
     temporary competitive advantage. If yes, then Southwest's culture is providing a sustained competitive
     advantage.

For the company culture resource of Southwest Airlines, a yes can be answered for each of the four steps,
providing a sustained competitive advantage for this organization. As can be seen from its exceptional
organizational performance over many years when compared to other airlines, VRIO shows that company
culture is one reason why it is more successful than its competitors.

           Figure 4.4 The VRIO Framework Decision Matrix: Southwest's Company Culture

Valuable?         Rare?         Difficult to imitate?  Organized to capture Competitive
Yes               Yes           Yes
                                                       value?  Advantage

                                                               Sustained
                                                       Yes     Competitive
                                                               Advantage

As another example, what about Southwest Airlines' capability to arrive on time at a much higher rate than the
industry average? What kind of competitive advantage, if any, does this capability provide?
Capability: High on-time arrival

                               Figure 4.5 VRIO Analysis of On-Time Arrival Capability of Southwest Airlines

Valuable?  Rare?  Difficult to  Organized to Capture Value?    Competitive Advantage?
                  Imitate?

Yes        Yes    No                                           Temporary Competitive Advantage

In the case of on-time arrival capability, Southwest Airline enjoys a temporary competitive advantage (the third
line), but it is not that difficult for rivals to imitate this ability. In working through the decision tree, once a no
is obtained, there is no need to continue through the tree.

Ideally, a firm will its own resources, like Southwest's culture, that embrace the four VRIO qualities shown in
Table 4.1. If so, these resources can provide not only a competitive advantage but also a sustained competitive
advantage--one that will endure over time and help the firm stay successful far into the future. Resources that
do not have all four qualities can still be very useful, but they are unlikely to provide long-term advantages. A
resource that is valuable and rare but that can be imitated, for example, might provide an edge in the short
term, but competitors can eventually overcome such an advantage.

                                                       Chapter 4: Evaluating the Internal Environment | 97

Capability                                                  capture value?  Implication

Resource-based theory also stresses the merit of an old saying: the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
Specifically, it is important to recognize that strategic resources can be created by taking several strategies and
resources that each could be copied and bundling them together in a way that cannot be copied. For example,
Southwest's culture is complemented by approaches that individually could be copied--the airline's emphasis
on direct flights, its reliance on one type of plane, and its unique system for passenger boarding--to create a
unique business model whose performance is without peer in the industry.

On occasion, events in the environment can turn a common resource into a strategic resource. Consider, for
example, a very generic commodity: water. Humans simply cannot live without water, so water has inherent
value. Also, water cannot be imitated (at least not on a large scale), and no other substance can substitute for
the life-sustaining properties of water. Despite having three of the four properties of strategic resources, water
in the United States has remained cheap; however, this may be changing. Major cities in hot climates such as
Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and Atlanta are confronted by dramatically shrinking water supplies. As water becomes
more and more rare, landowners in Maine stand to benefit. Maine has been described as "the Saudi Arabia of
water" because its borders contain so much drinkable water. It is not hard to imagine a day when companies
in Maine make huge profits by sending giant trucks filled with water south and west or even by building water
pipelines to service arid regions.

    Strategy at the Movies

       That Thing You Do! [02:48]
       How can the members of an organization reach success "doing that thing they do"? According to
       resource-based theory, one possible road to riches is creating--on purpose or by accident--a unique
       combination of resources. In the 1996 movie That Thing You Do!, unwittingly assembling a unique
       bundle of resources leads a 1960s band called The Wonders to rise from small-town obscurity to
       the top of the music charts. One resource is lead singer Jimmy Mattingly, who possesses immense

98 | Chapter 4: Evaluating the Internal Environment
  musical talent. Another is guitarist Lenny Haise, whose fun attitude reigns in the enigmatic
  Mattingly. Although not a formal band member, Mattingly's girlfriend Faye provides emotional
  support to the group and even suggests the group's name. When the band's usual drummer has to
  miss a gig due to injury, the door is opened for charismatic drummer Guy Patterson, whose energy
  proves to be the final piece of the puzzle for The Wonders.
  Despite Mattingly's objections, Guy spontaneously adds an up-tempo beat to a sleepy ballad called
  "That Thing You Do!" during a local talent contest. When the talent show audience goes crazy in
  response, it marks the beginning of a meteoric rise for both the song and the band. Before long,
  The Wonders perform on television and "That Thing You Do!" is a top-ten hit record. The band's
  magic vanishes as quickly as it appeared, however. After their bass player joins the Marines, Lenny
  elopes on a whim, and Jimmy's diva attitude runs amok, the band is finished and Guy is left to
  "wonder" what might have been. That Thing You Do! illustrates that while bundling resources in a
  unique way can create immense success, preserving and managing these resources over time can
  be very difficult.

Key Takeaway

     Resource-based theory suggests that tangible or intangible resources that are valuable, rare,
        difficult to imitate, and organized to capture value best position a firm for long-term success.
        These strategic resources can provide the foundation to develop firm capabilities that can lead
        to superior performance over time. Capabilities are needed to bundle, to manage, and otherwise
        to exploit resources in a manner that provides added value to customers and creates advantages
        over competitors. The VRIO tool can be used to determine if resources or capabilities are
        valuable, rare, difficult-to-imitate, and organized to capture value, and thereby understand what
        type of competitive advantage they offer to a firm.

4.4 Intellectual Property & Isolating Mechanisms

Intellectual Property

Defining Intellectual Property

The inability of competitors to imitate a strategic resource is a key to leveraging the resource to achieve
long-term competitive advantages. Companies are clever, and effective imitation is often very possible. But
resources that involve intellectual property reduce or even eliminate this risk. As a result, developing
intellectual property is important to many organizations.

Intellectual property refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions, artistic products, and symbols. The
four main types of intellectual property are patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets (Table 4.5). If
a piece of intellectual property is also valuable, rare, difficult to imitate, and organized to capture value, it
constitutes a strategic resource. Even if a piece of intellectual property does not meet all four criteria for
serving as a strategic resource, it can be bundled with other resources and activities to create a resource.

The term intellectual property refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions, artistic products, and symbols.
 Some forms of intellectual property are protected by law while others can best be defended by surrounding them

                                                                      in secrecy.

                                Table 4.5 Intellectual Property

Types of Intellectual Property

Patents protect inventions from direct imitation for a limited period of time. Within the pharmaceutical industry, patents
protect the new drugs created by firms such as Merck and Pfizer for up to twenty years. If a new drug gains acceptance
in the market, its patent creates a window of opportunity for the patent holder to enjoy excellent profits.

Trademarks are phrases, pictures, names, or symbols used to identify a particular organization. McDonald's golden
arches, the phrase "Intel Inside," and the brand name Virginia Tech are examples of trademarks.

Copyrights provide exclusive rights to the creators of original artistic works such as books, movies, songs, and
screenplays. Sometimes copyrights are sold and licensed. The late pop star Michael Jackson bought the rights to The
Beatles' music catalog and later licensed songs to Target and other companies for use in television advertisements.
Trade secrets refer to formulas, practices, and designs that are central to a firm's business and that remain unknown to
competitors. One famous example is the blend of eleven herbs and spices used in Kentucky Fried Chicken's original
recipe chicken. KFC protects this secret by having multiple suppliers each produce a portion of the herb and spice blend;
no one supplier knows the full recipe.

A variety of formal and informal methods are available to protect a firm's intellectual property from imitation by
rivals. Some forms of intellectual property are best protected by legal means, while defending others depends
on surrounding them in secrecy. This can be contrasted with Southwest Airlines's well-known culture, which

                                Chapter 4: Evaluating the Internal Environment | 101
rivals are free to attempt to copy if they wish. Southwest's culture thus is not intellectual property, although
some of its complements such as Southwest's logo and unique color schemes are.

Patents

   Patents protect inventions from direct imitation for a limited period of time. Some examples and key issues
                                               surrounding patents are illustrated below.

                                                                        Table 4.6 Patents
Examples of Patents
To earn a patent from the US Patent and Trademark Office, an inventor must demonstrate that an invention is new, non
obvious, and useful.
Perhaps the greatest inventor in history was Thomas Edison, who was awarded over one thousand patents.
As several different inventors raced to create a workable system for voice transmission over wires, Alexander Graham
Bell was awarded a patent for the telephone in 1876.
Apple and Samsung began suing each other in 2011 for patent infringement, with numerous court cases and appeals. The
multiple lawsuits were finally settled in 2018, with a jury awarding Apple $539 million (Reuters, 2018).

Patents are legal decrees that protect inventions from

direct imitation for a limited period of time (Table 4.6).

Obtaining a patent involves navigating a challenging

process. To earn a patent from the US Patent and

Trademark Office, an inventor must demonstrate that

an invention is new, non-obvious, and useful. If the

owner of a patent believes that a company or person

has infringed on the patent, the owner can sue for

damages. Patenting an invention is important because

patents can fuel enormous profits. Imagine, for

example, the potential for lost profits if the Slinky had

not been patented. Shipyard engineer Richard James

came up with the idea for the Slinky by accident in 1943

while he was trying to create springs for use in ship       Figure 4.7: Patenting inventions such as the Slinky helps
instruments. When James accidentally tipped over one        ensure that the invention is protected from imitation.

of his springs, he noticed that it moved downhill in a

captivating way. James spent his free time perfecting the Slinky and then applied for a patent in 1946. To date,

more than three hundred million Slinkys have been sold by the company that Richard James and his wife Betty

created.

Trademarks

Trademarks are phrases, pictures, names, or symbols used to identify a particular organization (Table 4.7).
Trademarks are important because they help an organization stand out and build an identity in the marketplace.
Some trademarks are so iconic that almost all consumers recognize them, including McDonald's golden arches,
the Nike swoosh, and Apple's outline of an apple.

Other trademarks help rising companies carve out a unique niche for themselves. For example, French shoe
designer Christian Louboutin has trademarked the signature red sole of his designer shoes. Because these
shoes sell for many hundreds of dollars via upscale retailers such as Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue,
competitors would love to copy their look. Thus, legally protecting the distinctive red sole from imitation helps
preserve Louboutin's profits.

Trademarks are important to colleges and universities.

Schools earn tremendous sums of money through

royalties on t-shirts, sweatshirts, hats, backpacks, and

other consumer goods sporting their names and logos.

On any given day, there are probably several students

in your class wearing one or more pieces of clothing

featuring your school's insignia; your school benefits

every time items like this are sold. Schools' trademarks

are easy to counterfeit, however, and the sales of

counterfeit goods take money away from colleges and

universities. Not surprisingly, many schools fight to

protect their trademarks. Virginia Tech filed a lawsuit

in 2011 against a new local business called Hokie Real

Estate, claiming trademark infringement. Virginia Tech    Figure 4.8: Fashionistas instantly recognize the trademark red
had received a legal trademark for its nickname Hokies.   sole of Christian Louboutin's high-end shoes.

Hokie Real Estate prevailed, as there were a number of

other businesses in the locality also using the Hokie name.

An organization's trademarks consist of phrases, pictures, names, or symbols that are closely associated with the
              organization. Some examples and key issues surrounding trademarks are illustrated below.

                                                                     Table 4.7 Trademarks
Examples of Trademarks
To be fully protected in the United States, a trademark must be registered with the United States Patent and Trademark
Office. A capital R with a circle around it denotes a registered trademark.
As part of the punishment for German aggression during World War I, German drug maker Bayer lost its trademark on
"Aspirin" in France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Today, Bayer still retains its trademark in
Germany, Canada, Mexico and dozens of other countries.
Many small companies use their founders' name as the basis for a trademarked company name.
The distinctive pattern of clothing retailer Burberry Ltd. is an example of a trademark that does not involve words or
symbols.

                                                             Chapter 4: Evaluating the Internal Environment | 103
Copyrights

 The rights of creators of original artistic works such as books, movies, songs, and screenplays are protected by
                copyrights. Some examples and key issues surrounding copyrights are illustrated below.

                                                                      Table 4.8 Copyrights
Examples of Copyrights
Illegal downloads of music are copyright infringements. In spite of laws and increased enforcement, millions of songs are
obtained illegally.
Today's cheesy television ads aimed at inventors follow a long tradition of companies offering to help individuals
copyright their ideas--for a small fee, of course.
The presence of the copyright symbol tells consumers that they are not allowed to duplicate the product that carries the
copyright.
A painting such as Johannes Vermeer's "Girl with a Pearl Earring" enters the public domain (i.e., is not subject to
copyright) one hundred years after its creator's death.
When it became apparent that The Verve's 1997 hit single "Bittersweet Symphony" duplicated a Rolling Stones song, The
Verve was forced to give up the copyright for the song.

Copyrights provide exclusive rights to the creators of      Figure 4.9: He looks calm here, but the licensing of a
original artistic works such as books, movies, songs,       copyrighted song for a car commercial enraged rock legend
and screenplays for an author's lifetime plus 70 years      Jim Morrison.
(Figure 4.8). Sometimes copyrights are sold and
licensed. In the late 1960's, Buick thought it had an
agreement in place to license the number one hit,
"Light My Fire" by The Doors, for a television
advertisement until the band's volatile lead singer Jim
Morrison loudly protested what he saw as mistreating
a work of art. Classic rock by The Beatles has been used
in television ads in recent years. After the late pop star
Michael Jackson bought the rights to the band's music
catalog, he licensed songs to Target and other
companies. Some devoted music fans consider such
ads to be abominations, perhaps proving the merit of
Morrison's protest decades ago.

Over time, piracy has become a huge issue for the owners of copyrighted works. In China, millions of pirated
DVDs are sold each year, and music piracy is estimated to account for at least 95% of music sales. This piracy
deprives movie studios, record labels, and artists of millions of dollars in royalties. In response to the damage
piracy has caused, the US government has pressed its Chinese counterpart and other national governments to
better enforce copyrights.

Trade Secrets

Trade secrets refer to formulas, practices, and designs that are central to a firm's business and that remain
unknown to competitors (Table 4.9). Trade secrets are protected by laws on theft, but once a secret is revealed,
it cannot be a secret any longer. This leads firms to rely mainly on silence and privacy rather than the legal
system to protect trade secrets.

Trade secrets are formulas, practices, and designs that are central to a firm's business and that remain unknown
  to competitors. Everyone loves a good mystery, so it is no surprise that legends have arisen around some trade
                   secrets. Some examples and key issues surrounding trade secrets are illustrated below.

                                                                     Table 4.9 Trade Secrets

 Examples of Trade Secrets
 Low-end fast food chain Long John Silver's considers its "crumblies" (small bits of fried batter) to be a trade secret, but
 would anyone really want to solve the mystery?
 In 2006, Pepsi was offered a chance to buy a stolen copy of Coca-Cola's secret recipe. An FBI sting was created and the
 thieves were arrested.
 WD-40 was developed to repel water and prevent corrosion, but it was later found to have over two thousand uses.
 Creating WD-40 took a lot of work: the product's unusual name stands for "Water Displacement, 40th attempt." Despite
 being created in 1953, the formula for making WD-40 remains unknown outside the company that sells it.
 FarmVille creator Zynga alleged in a lawsuit that Disney had lured away Zynga employees to work for Disney and then
 urged the employees to turn over a secret "playbook" that described Zynga's strategy. The case was settled out of court
 in late 2010.
 In a 1995 episode of the hit comedy Seinfeld, a very successful but mean-spirited restaurateur nicknamed the "Soup
 Nazi" saw his business collapse when his secret recipes were revealed to customers. Individuals could now make
 delicious soups at home rather than endure the Soup Nazi's verbal abuse when buying soup.

Some trade secrets have become legendary, perhaps

because a mystique arises around the unknown. One

famous example is the blend of eleven herbs and spices

used in Kentucky Fried Chicken's original recipe

chicken. KFC protects this secret by having multiple

suppliers each produce a portion of the herb and spice

blend; no one supplier knows the full recipe. The

formulation of Coca-Cola is also shrouded in mystery.

In 2006, Pepsi was approached by shady individuals

who were offering a chance to buy a stolen copy of

Coca-Cola's secret recipe. Pepsi wisely refused. An FBI

sting was used to bring the thieves to justice. The soft-  Figure 4.10: The recipe for Dr Pepper is a secret dating back to
drink industry has other secrets too. Dr Pepper's          the 1880s.

recipe remains unknown outside the company.

Although Coke's formula has been the subject of greater speculation, Dr Pepper is actually the original secret

soft drink; it was created a year before Coca-Cola.

Isolating Mechanisms

The goal of a firm is to have a sustained competitive advantage, whereby a resource or capability of the firm
provides a competitive edge for a long time. The length of time a firm can maintain a sustained competitive
advantage depends on the industry. A company in a fast-moving industry, such as information technology or
fast fashion, may be quite satisfied if they can hold a competitive advantage for a year. A sustained competitive
advantage in another type of industry, like feminine hygiene that does not have such frequent changes may last
much longer. No firm is able to keep a sustained competitive advantage indefinitely. The competition is always
attempting to gain its own competitive advantage.
If a firm can prevent a competitor from imitating the resource or capability that gives it a competitive
advantage, it is able to sustain that advantage longer. This strategy is called isolating mechanisms. A patent,
for example, is a legal way to prevent imitation. Sometimes a competitor is able to "re-engineer" the patented
concept by making slight changes, working around the patent to imitate the idea without infringing on the
patent. There are other isolating mechanisms a firm may be able to employ to lessen the likelihood of imitation
by a competitor. These other isolating mechanisms are Social Complexity, Path Dependence, and Causal
Ambiguity.

Social Complexity

The interrelationships within a firm, along with relationships within or across a business process, can be
difficult to imitate. For example, key relationships that members of a firm have with a supplier of a key strategic
resource create a condition that a competitor cannot duplicate. This social complexity creates a barrier to
imitation and can prolong a competitive advantage possessed by an organization. Social complexity might
arise through certain customer relationships or with key political figures, provided they can help the firm's
competitive position. For example, a CEO of a firm in the defense industry may cultivate relationships with key

106 | Chapter 4: Evaluating the Internal Environment
members of Congress that help bring business to that firm, at the expense of the competition (in this example,
this might be called collusion, but that is a story for another day, and Chapter 11 on corporate ethics).

Path Dependence

The path that a firm takes over time to achieve the point of a competitive advantage may also provide a barrier
to imitation. Decisions made in the past that brought a firm to its current position may make it very difficult
for other firms to imitate. The accumulated learning and experience gained along the historical path are not
easily duplicated. This path dependence can serve as an isolating mechanism to block competitors from gaining
the same position in the market. Warby Parker, for example, made a decision early in its development to build
relationships with a variety of suppliers and to use the "buy one, give one" strategy, where a pair of glasses is
given away to someone in need for every pair sold. This decision and path created loyal suppliers and customers
within the online eye wear industry, and a copycat strategy by a competitor would likely be cost prohibitive.

Causal Ambiguity

The third isolating mechanism, causal ambiguity, means the reason for achieving a competitive advantage is
not apparent. The cause for success is obscure and not understood well. Because the firm itself does not really
know why it has achieved success, it is quite difficult for a competitor to replicate it. For example, why does
Netflix still enjoy immense popularity in spite of numerous streaming competitors? In 2020 Netflix had a market
penetration of 54%, while Amazon Prime is a distant second at 30% (Roxorough, 2019). Is it because they were
the first mainline streaming service? Is it related to CEO Reed Hastings? Does content make a big difference?
Competitors find it difficult to duplicate Netflix's success model because it is not clear what has caused it.
It was noted earlier in this chapter that intangible resources are usually more valuable than tangible ones in
the context of sustained competitive advantage. The reason for this is due, in part, to the isolating mechanisms
discussed above. Physical resources tend to be in abundance and are far easier to obtain. So, if two firms
have the same physical resources, then there is little to no differentiation. The key distinction that firms can
make is how they use those physical resources in their value chain. The intangible resources including skills,
knowledge, or brand name used to capitalize on physical resources are far more likely to produce an advantage
for firms than simply possessing a physical resource alone. In this way, firms such as Nike can capitalize on
marketing and their brand to sell shoes at a premium when their shoes have few physical differences from
their competitors. In some cases, a manufacturing facility may very well produce the same product for multiple
companies (e.g., t-shirts). In such cases the difference to consumers is the brand.

                                                                                                    Chapter 4: Evaluating the Internal Environment | 107
   Key Takeaway

          Intellectual property can serve as a strategic resource for organizations. While some sources of
             intellectual property such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights can receive special legal
             protection, trade secrets provide competitive advantages by simply staying hidden from
             competitors.

          Utilizing isolating mechanisms strategically is a way for organizations to prevent imitation and
             maintain their competitive advantage.

4.5 Value Chain

  Figure 4.11: Adding Value within a Value Chain.
110 | Chapter 4: Evaluating the Internal Environment
Elements of the Value Chain

When executives choose strategies, an organization's resources and capabilities should be examined alongside
consideration of its value chain. A value chain charts the path by which products and services are created and
eventually sold to customers (Porter, 1985). The term value chain reflects the fact that, as each step of this
path is completed, the product becomes more valuable than it was at the previous step (Table 4.10). Within the
lumber business, for example, value is added when a tree is transformed into usable wooden boards; the boards
created from a tree can be sold for more money than the price of the tree.

The Value Chain is used as an internal assessment tool to help a firm determine where it might be able to
achieve a competitive advantage. In which areas of the primary and secondary activities is the firm particularly
strong? Can that activity be leveraged to provide a competitive advantage over its rivals? Resources and/
or capabilities within that activity can be evaluated using the VRIO framework to determine what type
of competitive advantage they provide. For example, Netflix was the first firm to leverage its technology
development support activity to bring high quality movies to customers through streaming. Being the first
mover in this industry gave Netflix a foothold and reputation in this industry, and others have not been
able to catch up. When using this tool for internal assessment, each activity of the Value Chain should be
examined for its potential to achieve a competitive advantage. Conversely, weak activities in the Value Chain
are opportunities to improve organizational performance. The overall intent of the Value Chain is to produce a
profit margin for the firm.

Figure 4.12: The Value Chain

                              Chapter 4: Evaluating the Internal Environment | 111
Value chains include both primary and secondary activities. Primary activities are actions that are directly
involved in creating and distributing goods and services. Consider a simple illustrative example: doughnut
shops. Doughnut shops transform basic commodity products such as flour, sugar, butter, and grease into
delectable treats. Value is added through this process because consumers are willing to pay much more for
doughnuts than they would be willing to pay for the underlying ingredients.

There are five primary activities. Inbound logistics refers to the arrival of raw materials. Although doughnuts
are seen by most consumers as notoriously unhealthy, the Doughnut Plant in New York City has carved out a
unique niche for itself by obtaining organic ingredients from a local farmer's market. Operations refers to the
actual production process, while outbound logistics tracks the movement of a finished product to customers.
Referring back to Southwest Airlines, one of Southwest Airlines' unique capabilities is moving passengers more
quickly than its rivals. This advantage in operations is based in part on Southwest's reliance on one type of
airplane (which speeds maintenance) and its avoidance of advance seat assignments (which accelerates the
passenger boarding process).

Attracting potential customers and convincing them to make purchases is the domain of marketing and sales.
For example, people cannot help but notice Randy's Donuts in Inglewood, California, because the building has
a giant doughnut on top of it. Finally, service refers to the extent to which a firm provides assistance to their
customers. Voodoo Donuts in Portland, Oregon, has developed a clever website (voodoodoughnut.com) that
helps customers understand their uniquely named products, such as the Voodoo Doll, the Texas Challenge, the
Memphis Mafia, and the Dirty Snowball.

Secondary activities are not directly involved in the evolution of a product, but instead provide important
underlying support for primary activities. Firm infrastructure refers to how the firm is organized and led by
executives. The effects of this organizing and leadership can be profound. For example, Ron Joyce's leadership
of Canadian doughnut shop chain Tim Hortons was so successful that Canadians consume more doughnuts per
person than all other countries. In terms of resource-based theory, Joyce's leadership was clearly a valuable and
rare resource that helped his firm prosper.

Human resource management is also important. Human resource management involves the recruitment,
training, and compensation of employees. A recent research study used data from more than twelve thousand
organizations to demonstrate that the knowledge, skills, and abilities of a firm's employees can act as a
strategic resource and strongly influence the firm's performance (Crook et al., 2011). Certainly, the unique
level of dedication demonstrated by employees at Southwest Airlines has contributed to that firm's excellent
performance over several decades.

Technology refers to the use of computerization and telecommunications to support primary activities.
Although doughnut making is not a high-tech business, technology plays a variety of roles for doughnut shops,
such as allowing customers to pay using credit cards.

Procurement is the process of negotiating for and purchasing raw materials. Large doughnut chains such as
Dunkin' and Krispy Kreme can gain cost advantages over their smaller rivals by purchasing flour, sugar, and
other ingredients in bulk. Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines has gained an advantage over its rivals by using futures
contracts within its procurement process to minimize the effects of rising fuel prices.

112 | Chapter 4: Evaluating the Internal Environment
Sometimes competitive advantage is achieved from the support activities of a firm as opposed to the primary
activities. Superior technology development or human resource management can produce a temporary if not
a sustained competitive advantage. A strong research and development arm in a pharmaceutical company can
develop medications that are patented and cannot be imitated. Incentives to staff such as those provided by 3M
and Google to be creative and develop new products have resulted in a competitive advantage.

   Key Takeaway

          The value chain provides a useful tool for managers to examine systematically where value may
             be added to their organizations. This tool is useful in that it examines key elements in the
             production of a good or service, as well as areas in which value may be added in support of those
             primary activities.

             would you seek to improve first?

        2. What local business in your town could be improved most dramatically by applying the value
             chain? Would improvements of primary or support activities help to improve this firm most?

4.6 Conclusion

This chapter explains key issues that executives face in managing resources to keep their firms competitive.
Resource-based theory argues that firms will perform better when they assemble resources that are valuable,
rare, difficult-to-imitate, and organized to capture value. When executives can successfully bundle
organizational resources into unique capabilities, the firm is more likely to enjoy lasting success. Different
forms of intellectual property--which include patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets--may also
serve as strategic resources for firms. Examining a firm's resources can be aided by the value chain, a tool that
systematically examines primary and secondary activities in the creation of a good or service.

   Learning Objectives

     After reading this chapter, you should be able to understand and articulate answers to the following
     questions:

         1. How is the SWOT framework developed and used for determining strategic issues and
             strategies?

        2. What is a strategic issue and how is it identified and expressed?

5.1 Introduction

The last three chapters have dealt with assessing organizational performance, external analysis of the industry,
and competitive environments of a firm, and analyzing the internal environment of an organization. What
happens to all information that is obtained as a result of all these evaluations? The SWOT framework helps to
pull the most important information into a format that can then be used in strategic management to determine
the strategic issue the firm needs to address and resolve by consolidating a summary of the other analyses
into one framework. The SWOT framework is also helpful in the next phase of strategic management, setting
strategies.
A strategic issue is the primary matter faced by an organization that must be addressed for the organization to
survive, excel, or achieve a major strategic initiative. The strategic issue defines what the organization needs
to address and resolve to move the organization forward toward success by analyzing the data and information
from the internal and external assessments as presented in the SWOT. Once the strategic issue is defined,
strategies can be developed that address and resolve the strategic issue and propel the organization toward

116 | Chapter 5: Synthesis of Strategic Issues and Analysis
accomplishing its vision. The next chapter discusses how basic business level strategies are developed. The
development of the firm's strategic issue is discussed in greater detail later in this chapter.

5.2 SWOT Framework

 Chess master Bruce Pandolfini has noted the similarities between business and chess. In both arenas, you must
 understand your own abilities as well as your flaws. You must also know your opponents, try to anticipate their
  moves, and deal with considerable uncertainty. A very popular management tool that incorporates the idea of
understanding the elements internal and external to the firm is SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and
threats) analysis. Strengths and weaknesses are assessed by examining the firm, while opportunities and threats

   refer to external events and trends. These ideas can be applied to individuals too. Below are examples of each

Porter's Five Forces analysis examines the situation
faced by the competitors in an industry. Strategic
groups analysis narrows the focus by centering on
subsets of these competitors whose strategies are
similar. SWOT analysis takes an even narrower focus by
centering on an individual firm. Specifically, SWOT
analysis is a tool that considers a firm's strengths and
weaknesses along with the opportunities and threats
that exist in the firm's environment (Table 4.12).

markets have presented potentially lucrative opportunities to Subway and other restaurant chains such as
McDonald's and KFC. Meanwhile, Subway's strengths include a well-established brand name and a simple
business format that can easily be adapted to other cultures. In considering the opportunities offered by
overseas markets and Subway's strengths, it is not surprising that entering and expanding in different countries
has been a key element of Subway's strategy in recent years. Indeed, Subway in 2020 had operations in 111
nations.

The SWOT framework is developed by synthesizing the information developed from the external, competitive,
and internal assessments. The most important information from these assessments is pulled into the SWOT
framework. Once complete, the SWOT is helpful in determining the strategic issue facing the organization.
SWOT is also beneficial is developing the strategies for the firm.

SWOT analysis is helpful to executives, and it is used within most organizations. Important cautions need to
be offered about SWOT analysis, however. First, in laying out each of the four elements of SWOT, internal and
external factors should not be confused with each other. It is important not to list strengths as opportunities,
for example, if executives are to succeed at matching internal and external concerns during the idea generation
process. Internal environment assessment tools such as VRIO and Value Chain Analysis can lead to
organizational strengths and weaknesses. Using external environment analysis tools like PESTEL and Porter's
Five Forces help to determine opportunities and threats. Second, opportunities should not be confused with
strategic moves designed to capitalize on these opportunities. In the case of Subway, it would be a mistake to
list "entering new countries" as an opportunity. Instead, untapped markets are the opportunity presented to
Subway, and entering those markets is a way for Subway to exploit the opportunity. Finally, and perhaps most
important, the results of SWOT analysis should not be overemphasized. SWOT analysis is a relatively simple
tool for understanding a firm's situation. As a result, SWOT is best viewed as a brainstorming technique for
generating creative ideas, not as a rigorous method for selecting strategies. Thus the ideas produced by SWOT
analysis offer a starting point for executives' efforts to craft strategies for their organization, not an ending
point. The SWOT framework is also very helpful in determining the strategic issue facing the firm that will need
to be addressed and resolved through the strategies that are developed.

               Table 5.2 SWOT Analysis for Subway in 2020

In addition to organizations, individuals can benefit from applying SWOT analysis to their personal situation. A
college student who is approaching graduation, for example, could lay out her main strengths and weaknesses
and the opportunities and threats presented by the environment. Suppose, for instance, that this person enjoys
and is good at helping others (a strength) but also has a rather short attention span (a weakness). Meanwhile,

118 | Chapter 5: Synthesis of Strategic Issues and Analysis
opportunities to work at a rehabilitation center or to pursue an advanced degree are available. Our hypothetical
student might be wise to pursue a job at the rehabilitation center, where her strength at helping others would
be a powerful asset, rather than entering graduate school, where a lot of reading is required and her short
attention span could undermine her studies.

   Key Takeaway

          Executives using SWOT analysis compare internal strengths and weaknesses with external
             opportunities and threats to generate ideas about how their firm might become more successful.
             Ideas that allow a firm to leverage its strengths, mitigate or resolve its weaknesses, capitalize on
             opportunities, and protect itself against threats are particularly helpful.

5.3 Strategic Issue Identification

So, what happens in strategic management once all the external and internal analysis is done and the SWOT
framework is complete? Is it time to start developing strategies? No, not yet. One more thing needs to happen:
defining the strategic issue or issues the firm needs to be sure to address.

What is a strategic issue? First, it is an issue, something that needs to be addressed and resolved. Second,
it is strategic. It is a long-term issue whose resolution will help move the organization toward its vision.
Resolving the strategic issue will have a major impact on the direction and success of the firm (Ambler, 2020).
The strategic issue is derived from the facts and data provided by the external and internal analysis and its
synthesis through the SWOT framework. The business decision makers do not define the strategic issue(s)
at the beginning of the strategic management process, through a hunch or guess, but after the analysis is
completed. Once defined, the strategic issue helps drive the strategies that the organization develops and
pursues. A strategic issue, when identified correctly and used effectively, becomes the strategic focus of
the organization. In this process, more than one strategic issue may surface. Generally, decision makers will
condense these into a single statement, or deal with less important strategic issues when establishing strategies
or lower order goals.

The word "issue" often connotes a negative situation that a firm may be facing. For example, Southwest Airlines
was faced with much lower passenger volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic that started in 2020.
However, the Subway example discussed at the beginning of this chapter demonstrates that the strategic issue
was framed as capitalizing on an opportunity--how to move into untapped international markets.

Ideally, the strategic issue is reduced to one concise sentence, so that it is easily captured and understood.
Amplifying information may be provided to further explain the situation and justify the choice of the strategic
issue. Often, the strategic issue starts with the word how. In the Southwest Airlines example, the strategic
issue could be: "How does Southwest Airlines adjust to long-term, lower passenger volumes and remain the
preferred, low-cost leader in the industry?" For Subway, it may have been "How does Subway enter untapped
international markets?" Once defined, these companies would develop strategies that move their organization
towards its vision, while addressing the strategic issue.

120 | Chapter 5: Synthesis of Strategic Issues and Analysis
                Figure 5.2: The Planning Team

The strategic issue will change over time, as the external, competitive and internal dynamics change. For
organizations working through the strategic management process, defining the strategic issue may not be
simple. The planning team members may interpret data differently or through the lens of their own perspective.
The CFO may see the strategic issue in financial terms, the marketing director as a marketing issue, and the
human resources director as an issue with manpower and training. One process organizations can use to
determine the strategic issue is for planning team members to study the data from the analysis and each draft
and share their idea of the strategic issue. The team then has a process to prioritize these, dropping some,
combining some, until they arrive at a consensus on the wording of the strategic issue (Ambler, 2020).

   Key Takeaway

          It is important to define the strategic issue of an organization using the information and data
             from the external and internal analysis and the SWOT framework. The strategic issue sets the
             strategic focus for the development of strategies. The strategies will address and attempt to
             resolve the strategic issue and move the organization toward accomplishing its vision.

5.4 Conclusion

In the analysis stage of the strategic management process, the final phase is to apply the SWOT framework
to consolidate a "snapshot" of the internal and external analysis conducted and identify the key strategic
issue(s). The SWOT pulls together the important information from the external and internal analysis and
the organizational performance assessment and displays it in an organized framework. The strengths and
weaknesses are internal to the organization, and the opportunities and threats are external to the firm.
The information and data from the assessments and SWOT are then used to formulate the strategic issue(s).
What needs to be addressed and resolved to move the organization forward toward success and its vision?
Strategies are then developed that address the resolution of the strategic issue and advance the organization,
as discussed in the next chapter.

   Learning Objectives

     After reading this chapter, you should be able to understand and articulate answers to the following
     questions:

         1. Why is an examination of generic strategies valuable?
        2. What are the four main generic strategies?
        3. What is a best-cost strategy?
        4. What does it mean to be "stuck in the middle"?

6.1 Introduction

Within the strategic management framework, an organization must define and continue to improve its generic,
business-level strategy. A generic, business-level strategy is also called its generic competitive strategy,
because it defines how a firm competes head-to-head against similar products and services in the marketplace.
According to Michael Porter, a firm may pursue one of five generic/competitive business-level strategies.
These are broad cost leadership, broad differentiation, focused cost leadership, focused differentiation, and
best cost strategies. An important point of distinction is that business level strategies are viewed from the
perspective of which consumer(s) are being targeted. It may be tempting to view business-level strategies in

124 | Chapter 6: Selecting Business-Level Strategies
terms of the product lines, but the key point is to evaluate the business-level based on to whom the strategy
appeals. In this way, a firm can target a broad audience with a single or a few products.

There are two primary decisions in a generic business strategy. Will the intent of the strategy be on a broad or
focused target audience, and simultaneously, does the firm organize around a cost or differentiation approach?
If selecting a broad cost leadership or broad differentiation strategy, the target market for the product or
service is broad, meaning most people who buy within that industry. If the strategy is focused, that target
market is narrow, a niche market, and not meant for most people in the industry. A strategy of broad cost
leadership offers the lowest price in the market for that product or service. It appeals particularly to price
sensitive customers. Firms pursuing a broad differentiation strategy offer something unique that differentiates
their product or service from others. Typically this uniqueness adds cost and value to the product or service,
allowing the company to charge more. If the strategy is focused cost leadership, then the firm attempts
to provide the lowest cost to a narrow, niche target market. Focused differentiation provides unique or
differentiated products or services to a narrow, niche target market. The fifth generic business-level strategy
is called best cost, where the firm attempts to offer a hybrid of both lower cost and differentiated products
or services, combining the two basic strategies. A firm pursuing this strategy must be careful to perform both
strategies well, or risk not performing either well, and therefore becoming "stuck in the middle," and losing
customers to the competition.

Once a firm establishes its overall generic business-level strategy, the strategic management process helps
the firm to continuously improve upon that strategy. The organizational performance, external, and internal
assessments, and the development of the strategic issue(s) through the SWOT analysis are then used to plot
strategies for the firm to achieve its vision through its business-level strategy.

The Competition Takes Aim at Target

On January 13, 2011, Target Corporation

announced its intentions to operate stores

outside the United States for the first time. The

plan called for Target to enter Canada by

purchasing existing leases from a Canadian

retailer and then opening 100 to 150 stores in

2013 and 2014 (Target, 2011). The chain already    Figure 6.1: Inside of a Target store
included more than 1,700 stores in forty-nine

states. Given the close physical and cultural

ties between the United States and Canada, entering the Canadian market seemed to be a logical

move for Target.

                                                   Chapter 6: Selecting Business-Level Strategies | 125
       In addition to making its initial move beyond the United States, Target had several other sources of
       pride. The company claimed that 96% of American consumers recognized its signature logo,
       surpassing the percentages enjoyed by famous brands such as Apple and Nike. In 2020, Fortune
       magazine ranked Target twenty-second on its list of the "World's Most Admired Companies." But
       not all had been well with Target (Fortune, 2020). They pulled out of Canada in 2015 after just two
       years and $2 billion in losses. Concern also surrounded Target's possible vulnerability to
       competition within the retail industry (Peterson, 2015). Since its creation in the early 1960s, Target
       executives had carved out a lucrative position for the firm. Target offers relatively low prices on
       brand name consumer staples such as cleaning supplies and paper products, but it also offers chic
       clothing and household goods. This unique combination helps Target to appeal to fairly affluent
       customers. Perhaps the most tangible reflection of Target's upscale position among large retailers
       is the tendency of some customers to jokingly pronounce its name as if it were a French boutique:
       "Tar-zhay."
       Target's lucrative position was far from guaranteed, however. Indeed, a variety of competitors
       seemed to be taking aim at Target. Retail chains such as Kohl's and Old Navy offered fashionable
       clothing at prices similar to Target's. Discounters like T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, and Ross offered
       designer clothing and chic household goods for prices that often were lower than Target's.
       Closeout stores such as Big Lots offered a limited selection of electronics, apparel, and household
       goods but at deeply discounted prices. All these stores threatened to steal business from Target.
       Walmart was perhaps Target's most worrisome competitor. After some struggles in the 2000s, the
       mammoth retailer's performance was strong enough that it ranked consistently above Target on
       Fortune's list of the "World's Most Admired Companies" (eighteenth vs. twenty-second in 2020).
       Walmart also was much bigger than Target. The resulting economies of scale meant that Walmart
       could undercut Target's prices anytime it desired. Just such a scenario had unfolded before. A few
       years ago, Walmart's victory in a price war over Kmart led the latter into bankruptcy.
       One important difference between Kmart and Target is that Target is viewed by consumers as
       offering relatively high-quality goods. But this difference might not protect Target. Although
       Walmart's products tended to lack the chic appeal of Target's, Walmart had begun offering better
       products during the recession of the late 2000s in an effort to expand its customer base. If Walmart
       executives chose to match Target's quality while charging lower prices, Target could find itself
       without a unique appeal for customers. As 2020 continued, a big question loomed: could Target
       maintain its unique appeal to customers or would the competitive arrows launched by Walmart and
       others force Target's executives to quiver?

6.2 Understanding Business-Level Strategy through "Generic Strategies"

Why Examine Generic Strategies?

Business-level strategy addresses the question of how a firm will compete in a particular industry (Table 6.1).
This seems to be a simple question on the surface, but it is actually quite complex. The reason is that there
are a great many possible answers to the question. Consider, for example, the restaurants in your town or city.
Chances are that you live fairly close to some combination of McDonald's, Subway, Chili's, Applebee's, Panera
Bread Company, dozens of other national brands, and a variety of locally based eateries that have just one
location. Each of these restaurants competes using a business model that is at least somewhat unique. When an
executive in the restaurant industry analyzes her company and her rivals, she needs to avoid getting distracted
by all the nuances of different firm's business-level strategies and losing sight of the big picture.
The solution is to think about business-level strategy in terms of generic strategies. A generic business-
level strategy is a general way of positioning a firm within an industry. Focusing on generic strategies allows
executives to concentrate on the core elements of firms' business-level strategies. The most popular set of
generic strategies is based on the work of Professor Michael Porter of the Harvard Business School and
subsequent researchers that have built on Porter's initial ideas (Porter, 1980; Williamson & Zeng, 2009).

                                                                                                     Chapter 6: Selecting Business-Level Strategies | 127
 Firms compete on two general dimensions--the source of competitive advantage (cost or differentiation) and the
scope of operations (broad or narrow). Four possible generic business-level strategies emerge from these decisions.

             An example of each generic business-level strategy from the retail industry is illustrated below.

                                                             Table 6.1 Business-Level Strategies
 Competitive Advantage: Cost
 Broad Target Market: Walmart's cost leadership strategy depends on attracting a large customer base and keeping prices
 low by buying massive quantities of goods from suppliers.
 Narrow Target Market: In using a focused cost leadership, Dollar General does not offer a full array of consumer goods,
 but those that it does offer are priced to move.
 Competitive Advantage: Differentiation
 Broad Target Market: Nordstrom builds its differentiation strategy around offering designer merchandise and providing
 exceptional service.

 Narrow Target Market: Anthropologie follows a focused differentiation strategy by selling unique (and pricey) women's
 apparel, accessories, and home furnishings.

According to Porter, two competitive dimensions are the keys to business-level strategy. The first dimension
is a firm's source of competitive advantage. This dimension involves whether a firm tries to gain an edge on
rivals by keeping costs down or by offering something unique in the market. The second dimension is a firms'
scope of operations. This dimension involves whether a firm tries to target customers in general or whether
it seeks to attract just a narrow segment of customers. Four generic business-level strategies emerge from
these decisions: (1) broad cost leadership, (2) broad differentiation, (3) focused cost leadership, and (4) focused
differentiation. In rare cases, firms are able to offer both low prices and unique features that customers find
desirable. These firms are following a best-cost strategy. Firms that are not able to offer low prices or appealing
unique features are referred to as "stuck in the middle."
Understanding the differences that underlie generic strategies is important because different generic
strategies offer different value propositions to customers. A firm focusing on cost leadership will have a
different value chain configuration than a firm whose strategy focuses on differentiation. For example,
marketing and sales for a differentiation strategy often requires extensive effort while some firms that follow
cost leadership such as Waffle House are successful with limited marketing efforts. This chapter presents
each generic strategy and the "recipe" generally associated with success when using that strategy. When firms
follow these recipes, the result can be a strategy that leads to superior performance. But when firms fail to
follow logical actions associated with each strategy, the result may be a value proposition configuration that is
expensive to implement and that does not satisfy enough customers to be viable.

128 | Chapter 6: Selecting Business-Level Strategies
                Figure 6.2: Analyzing generic strategies enhances the understanding of how firms compete at the
                business level.

Limitations of Generic Strategies

Examining business-level strategy in terms of generic strategies has limitations. Firms that follow a particular
generic strategy tend to share certain features. For example, one way that cost leaders generally keep costs
low is by not spending much on advertising. Not every cost leader, however, follows this path. While cost
leaders such as Waffle House spend very little on advertising, Walmart spends considerable money on print
and television advertising despite following a cost leadership strategy. Thus a firm may not match every
characteristic that its generic strategy entails. Indeed, depending on the nature of a firm's industry, tweaking
the recipe of a generic strategy may be essential to cooking up success.

                                                                                                     Chapter 6: Selecting Business-Level Strategies | 129

   Key Takeaway

          Business-level strategies examine how firms compete in a given industry. Firms derive such
             strategies by executives making decisions about whether their source of competitive advantage
             is based on price or differentiation and whether their scope of operations targets a broad or
             narrow market.

        2. What are the limitations of examining firms in terms of generic strategies?
        3. Create a new framework to examine generic strategies using different dimensions than the two

             offered by Porter's framework. What does your approach offer that Porter's does not?

6.3 Cost Leadership

      Firms that compete based on price and target a broad target market are following a broad cost leadership
          strategy. Several examples of firms pursuing a broad cost leadership strategy are illustrated below.
                                                                    Table 6.2 Cost Leadership

 Examples of Firms Pursuing a Broad Cost Leadership Strategy
 Despite its name, Dunkin' Donuts makes more money selling inexpensive coffee than it does from selling donuts. The
 coffee is often advertised as costing under a dollar, making Dunkin' Donuts a low-priced alternative to Starbucks.
 Supercuts's website makes clear their longstanding cost leadership strategy by noting, "A Supercut is a haircut that has
 kept people looking their best, while keeping money in their pockets, since 1975."
 Payless ShoeSource is a discount retailer that sells inexpensive shoes for men, women, and children. However, they filed
 for bankruptcy in 2020 and closed all their stores, only operating their overseas stores. Super Shoes survives as a low
 cost leader.
 Little Debbie snack cakes began when O. D. McKee started selling treats for five cents each in the early 1930s. Little
 Debbie cakes cost a lot more than five cents today, but they remain cheaper than similar offerings from Entenmann's,
 Tastykake, and other snack cake rivals.

The Nature of the Cost Leadership Strategy

It is tempting to think of cost leaders as companies that sell inferior, poor-quality goods and services for rock-
bottom prices. This is not necessarily true, but some companies get this reputation. K-Mart, for example, had
been a successful discount department store with a cost leadership strategy. As Walmart competed head to
head with K-Mart, however, and offered higher quality products at the same or lower prices than its rivals, K-
Mart was doomed. Its reputation for cheap, inferior products and its inability to win a price war with Walmart
pushed K-Mart into bankruptcy.
In contrast to firms such as K-Mart, cost leaders can be very successful. A firm following a cost leadership
strategy offers products or services with acceptable quality and features to a broad set of customers at a low
price (Table 6.2). Super Shoes, for example, sells name-brand shoes at inexpensive prices. Little Debbie snack

                                                                                                      Chapter 6: Selecting Business-Level Strategies | 131
cakes offer another example. The brand was started in the 1930s when O. D. McKee began selling sugary treats
for five cents. Most consumers today would view the quality of Little Debbie cakes as a step below similar
offerings from Entenmann's, but enough people believe that they offer acceptable quality that the brand is still
around eight decades after its creation.

Perhaps the most famous cost leader is Walmart, which has used a cost leadership strategy to become the
largest company in the world. The firm's advertising slogans such as "Always Low Prices" and "Save Money. Live
Better" communicate Walmart's emphasis on price slashing to potential customers. Meanwhile, Walmart has
the broadest customer base of any firm in the United States. Approximately one hundred million Americans
visit a Walmart in a typical week (Zimmerman & Hudson, 2006). Incredibly, this means that roughly one-third
of Americans are frequent Walmart customers. This huge customer base includes people from all demographic
and social groups within society.

Cost leaders tend to share some important characteristics. The ability to charge low prices and still make a
profit is challenging. Cost leaders manage to do so by emphasizing efficiency. At Waffle House restaurants,
for example, customers are served cheap eats quickly to keep booths available for later customers. As part
of the effort to be efficient, most cost leaders spend little on advertising, market research, or research and
development. Waffle House, for example, limits its advertising to billboards along highways. Meanwhile, the
simplicity of Waffle House's menu requires little research and development.

Many cost leaders rely on economies of scale to achieve efficiency. Economies of scale are created when the
costs of offering goods and services decreases as a firm is able to sell more items. This occurs because expenses
are distributed across a greater number of items. Walmart spent approximately $3.5 billion on advertising in
2019 (Guttmann, 2019). This is a huge number, but Walmart is so large that its advertising expenses equal just
a tiny fraction of its sales. Also, cost leaders are often large companies, which allows them to demand price
concessions from their suppliers. Walmart is notorious for squeezing suppliers such as Procter & Gamble to sell
goods to Walmart for lower and lower prices over time. The firm passes some of these savings to customers in
the form of reduced prices in its stores.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Cost Leadership

Each generic strategy offers advantages that firms can potentially leverage to enhance their success as well
as disadvantages that may undermine their success. In the case of cost leadership, one advantage is that cost
leaders' emphasis on efficiency makes them well positioned to withstand price competition from rivals (Table
6.3). Kmart's ill-fated attempt to engage Walmart in a price war ended in disaster, in part because Walmart was
so efficient in its operations that it could live with smaller profit margins far more easily than Kmart could.

132 | Chapter 6: Selecting Business-Level Strategies
Using a cost leadership strategy offers firms important advantages and disadvantages. Below, table 6.3 illustrates
                                      a few examples in relation to entertainment and leisure.

                                                        Table 6.3 Executing a Low-Cost Strategy
Advantages
High profits can be enjoyed if a cost leader has a high market share. An example is Kampgrounds of America, a chain of
nearly 500 low cost camping franchises in the United States.
Low-cost firms such as many municipal golf courses can withstand price wars because high-priced competitors will not
want to compete directly with a more efficient rival.
Disadvantages
If perceptions of quality become too low, business will suffer.
Large volumes of sales are a must because margins are slim.
The need to keep expenses low might lead cost leaders to be late in detecting key environment trends.
Low-cost firms' emphasis on efficiency makes it difficult for them to change quickly if needed.

Beyond existing competitors, a cost leadership strategy also creates benefits relative to potential new entrants.
Specifically, the presence of a cost leader in an industry tends to discourage new firms from entering the
business because a new firm would struggle to attract customers by undercutting the cost leaders' prices. Thus,
a cost leadership strategy helps create barriers to entry that protect the firm--and its existing rivals--from new
competition.

In many settings, cost leaders attract a large market
share because a large portion of potential customers
find paying low prices for goods and services of
acceptable quality to be very appealing. This is
certainly true for Walmart, for example. The need for
efficiency means that cost leaders' profit margins are
often slimmer than the margins enjoyed by other firms.
However, cost leaders' ability to make a little bit of
profit from each of a large number of customers means
that the total profits of cost leaders can be substantial.

In some settings, the need for high sales volume is a       Figure 6.3: Challenging a cost leader in a price war may end

Highly fragmented markets and markets that involve a

lot of brand loyalty may not offer much of an opportunity to attract a large segment of customers. In both the

soft drink and cigarette industries, for example, customers appear to be willing to pay a little extra to enjoy the

brand of their choice. Lower-end brands of soda and cigarettes appeal to a minority of consumers, but famous

brands such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Marlboro, and Camel still dominate these markets. A related concern is that

achieving a high sales volume usually requires significant upfront investments in production and/or

distribution capacity. Not every firm is willing and able to make such investments.

                                                            Chapter 6: Selecting Business-Level Strategies | 133
Due to the need for cost leaders to have high volumes and slim margins, a focused cost leadership strategy
is difficult to achieve. By definition, a focused approach is directed at a narrow, niche segment of the market.
This means lower volumes, therefore contrary to the normal cost leadership strategy. An example would be an
Hispanic grocery store in Northern Virginia serving the niche market of Hispanics living there, that uses a cost
leadership strategy to compete against the other Hispanic grocery stores.
Cost leaders tend to keep their costs low by minimizing advertising, market research, and research and
development, but this approach can prove to be expensive in the long run. A relative lack of market research
can lead cost leaders to be less skilled than other firms at detecting important environmental changes.
Meanwhile, downplaying research and development can slow cost leaders' ability to respond to changes once
they are detected. Lagging rivals in terms of detecting and reacting to external shifts can prove to be a deadly
combination that leaves cost leaders out of touch with the market and out of answers.

6.4 Differentiation

   Firms that compete on uniqueness and target a broad market are following a differentiation strategy. Several
                          examples of firms pursuing a differentiation strategy are illustrated below.
                                                                    Table 6.4 Differentiation

 Examples of Firms Pursuing a Differentiation Strategy
 Although salt is a commodity, Morton has differentiated its salt by building a brand around its iconic umbrella girl and its
 trademark slogan of "When it rains, it pours."
 FedEx's former slogan "When it absolutely, positively has to be there overnight" highlights the commitment to very
 speedy delivery that differentiates them from competitors such as UPS and the US Postal Service.
 Offerings such as Hot Wheels cars and the Barbie line of dolls highlight toy maker Mattel's differentiation strategy. Both
 are updated regularly to reflect current trends and tastes.
 Nike differentiates its athletic shoes through its iconic "swoosh" as well as an intense emphasis on product innovation
 through research and development. Nike also differentiates their athletic brand through their marketing strategy of
 highlighting social justice issues regardless of potential public controversy.
 The Walt Disney Company has developed incomparable customer service standards ("the happiest place on earth") and
 numerous well-known characters such as Mickey Mouse, the Little Mermaid, and Captain Jack Sparrow that help
 differentiate their movies, theme parks, and merchandise.

                                                     The Nature of the Differentiation Strategy

                                                     A famous clich contends that "you get what you pay for." This
                                                     saying captures the essence of a differentiation strategy. A firm
                                                     following a differentiation strategy attempts to convince
                                                     customers to pay a premium price for its goods or services by
                                                     providing unique and desirable features (Table 6.4). The message
                                                     that such a firm conveys to customers is that you will pay a little
                                                     bit more for our offerings, but you will receive a good value
                                                     overall because our offerings provide something special.

                                                     result will be, well, unhappy campers. Coleman's sleeping bags,

lanterns, and stoves are renowned for their reliability and durability. Cheaper brands are much more likely to

have problems. Lovers of the outdoors must pay more to purchase Coleman's goods than they would to obtain

lesser brands, but having equipment that you can count on to keep you warm and dry is worth a price premium
in the minds of most campers.

Successful use of a differentiation strategy depends on not only offering unique features but also
communicating the value of these features to potential customers. As a result, advertising in general and brand
building in particular are important to this strategy. Few goods are more basic and generic than table salt. This
would seemingly make creating a differentiated brand in the salt business next to impossible. Through clever
marketing, however, Morton Salt has done so. Morton has differentiated its salt by building a brand around its
iconic umbrella girl and its trademark slogan of "When it rains, it pours." Would the typical consumer be able to
tell the difference between Morton Salt and cheaper generic salt in a blind taste test? Not a chance. Yet Morton
succeeds in convincing customers to pay a little extra for its salt through its brand-building efforts.

FedEx and Nike are two other companies that have done well at communicating to customers that they
provide differentiated offerings. FedEx's former slogan "When it absolutely, positively has to be there overnight"
highlights the commitment to speedy delivery that sets the firm apart from competitors such as UPS and the
US Postal Service. Nike differentiates its athletic shoes and apparel through its iconic "swoosh" logo as well as
an intense emphasis on product innovation through research and development.

Developing a Differentiation Strategy at Express Oil Change

Express Oil Change and Service Centers is a
chain of auto repair shops that stretches from
Florida to Texas. Based in Birmingham,
Alabama, the firm has more than 170 company-
owned and franchised locations under its
brand. Express Oil Change tries to provide a
unique level of service, and the firm is content
to let rivals offer cheaper prices. We asked an
Express Oil Change executive about his firm
(Ketchen & Short, 2010).

       Don Larose, Senior Vice President of Franchise Development:
       Every good business sector is competitive. The key to our success is to be more convenient and
       provide a better overall experience for the customer. Express Oil Change and Service Centers
       outperform the industry significantly in terms of customer transactions per day and store sales, for
       a host of reasons.
       In terms of customer convenience, Express Oil Change is faster than most of our competitors--we
       do a ten-minute oil change while the customer stays in the car. Mothers with kids in car seats
       especially enjoy this feature. We also do mechanical work that other quick lube businesses don't do.
       We change and rotate tires, do brake repairs, air conditioning, tune ups, and others. There is no
       appointment necessary for many mechanical services like tire rotation and balancing, and checking
       brakes. So, overall, we are more convenient than most of our competitors.
       In terms of staffing our stores, full-time workers are all that we employ. Full-time workers are
       better trained and typically have less turnover. They therefore have more experience and do better
       quality work.
       We think incentives are very important. We use a payroll system that provides incentives to the
       store staff on how many cars are serviced each day and on the total sales of the store, rather than
       on increasing the average transactions by selling the customer items they did not come in for,
       which is what most of the industry does. We don't sell customers things they don't yet need, like air
       filters and radiator flushes. We focus on building trust, by acting with integrity, to get the customer
       to come back and build the daily car count. This philosophy is not a slogan for us. It is how we
       operate with every customer, in every store, every day.
       The placement of our outlets is another key factor. We place our stores in A-caliber retail locations.
       These are lots that may cost more than our competitors are willing or able to pay. We get what we
       pay for though; we have approximately 41% higher sales per store than the industry average.

       Question:
       What is the strangest interaction you've ever had with a potential franchisee?
       Larose:
       I once had a franchisee candidate in New Jersey respond to a request by us for proof of his liquid
       assets by bringing to the interview about $100,000 in cash to the meeting. He had it in a bag, with
       bundles of it wrapped in blue tape. Usually, folks just bring in a copy of a bank or stock statement.
       Not sure why he had so much cash on hand, literally, and I didn't want to know. He didn't become a
       franchisee.

138 | Chapter 6: Selecting Business-Level Strategies
     A differentiation strategy offers important advantages and disadvantages for firms that adopt it. Below we
               illustrate a few examples in relation to an often differentiated product--women's handbags.

                                                     Table 6.5 Executing a Differentiation Strategy

 Advantages
 Buyer loyalty is common among handbag buyers. Many individuals enjoy seeing--and being seen with--a designer logo on
 the products they buy such as the iconic C that is shown on Coach bags.
 Chanel enjoys strong margins because their well-known name allows them to charge a premium for their handbags.

 Disadvantages
 Less expensive bags from retailers such as Target provide enough of a trendy look to satisfy many price-sensitive buyers.
 These individuals will choose to save their money by avoiding expensive bags from top-end designers.
 Imitations may steal customers, such as is common with knock-off handbags sold by street vendors.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Differentiation

Each generic strategy offers advantages that firms can potentially leverage to enjoy strong performance, as
well as disadvantages that may damage their performance. In the case of differentiation, a key advantage is that
effective differentiation creates an ability to obtain premium prices from customers (Table 6.5). This enables a
firm to enjoy strong profit margins. Coca-Cola, for example, currently enjoys a profit margin of approximately
33%, meaning that about 33 cents of every dollar it collects from customers is profit. In comparison, Walmart's
cost leadership strategy delivered a margin of under 4% in 2010.

In turn, strong margins mean that the firm does not need to attract huge numbers of customers to have a good
overall level of profit. Luckily for Coca-Cola, the firm does attract a great many buyers. Overall, the firm made
a profit of just under $9.0 billion on sales of just over $37.3 billion in 2019. Interestingly, Walmart's profits were
only 2.4 times higher ($22.0 billion) than Coca-Cola's while its sales volume ($514.4 billion) was 13.8 times higher
than Coca-Cola's (Walmart, 2019; Coca Cola, 2019). This comparison of profit margins and overall profit levels
illustrates why a differentiation strategy is so attractive to many firms.

To the extent that differentiation remains in place over time, buyer loyalty may be created. Loyal customers
are very desirable because they are not price sensitive. In other words, buyer loyalty makes a customer unlikely
to switch to another firm's products if that firm tries to steal the customer away through lower prices. Many
soda drinkers are fiercely loyal to Coca-Cola's products. Coca-Cola's headquarters are in Atlanta, and loyalty
to the firm is especially strong in Georgia and surrounding states. Pepsi and other brands have a hard time
convincing loyal Coca-Cola fans to buy their beverages, even when offering deep discounts. This helps keep
Coca-Cola's profits high because the firm does not have to match any promotions that its rivals launch to keep
its customers.

Meanwhile, Pepsi also has attracted a large set of brand-loyal customers that Coca-Cola struggles to steal. This
enhances Pepsi's profits. In contrast, store-brand sodas such as Sam's Choice, which is sold at Walmart, seldom
attract loyalty. As a result, they must be offered at very low prices to move from store shelves into shopping
carts.

                                                                                                     Chapter 6: Selecting Business-Level Strategies | 139
Beyond existing competitors, a differentiation strategy also creates benefits relative to potential new entrants.
Specifically, the brand loyalty that customers feel to a differentiated product makes it difficult for a new entrant
to lure these customers to adopt its product. A new soda brand, for example, would struggle to take customers
away from Coca-Cola or Pepsi. Thus, a differentiation strategy helps create barriers to entry that protect the
firm and its industry from new competition.

The big risk when using a differentiation strategy is that customers will not be willing to pay extra to obtain the
unique features that a firm is trying to build its strategy around. Department store Dillard's stopped carrying
men's sportswear made by Nautica because the seafaring theme of Nautica's brand had lost much of its cache
among many men (Kapner, 2007). Because Nautica's uniqueness had eroded, Dillard's believed that space in its
stores that Nautica had been occupying could be better allocated to other brands.

In some cases, customers may simply prefer a cheaper alternative. For example, products that imitate the look
and feel of offerings from Ray-Ban, Gucci, and Patagonia are attractive to many value-conscious consumers.
Firms such as these must work hard at product development and marketing to ensure that enough customers
are willing to pay a premium for their goods rather than settling for knockoffs.

In other cases, customers desire the unique features that a firm offers,   Figure 6.6: Firms following a

scenario when executives tried to follow a differentiation strategy in
the personal computer market. The strategy had worked for IBM in
other areas. Specifically, IBM had enjoyed a great deal of success in the
mainframe computer market by providing superior service and
charging customers a premium for their mainframes. A business owner
who relied on a mainframe to run her company could not afford to have
her mainframe out of operation for long. Meanwhile, few businesses
had the skills to fix their own mainframes. IBM's message to customers
was that they would pay more for IBM's products but that this was a
good investment because when a mainframe needed repairs, IBM
would provide faster and better service than its competitors could. The
customer would thus be open for business again very quickly after a
mainframe failure.

This positioning failed when IBM used it in the personal computer
market. Rivals such as Dell were able to offer service that was just as good as IBM's while also charging lower
prices for personal computers than IBM charged. From a customer's perspective, a person would be foolish to
pay more for an IBM personal computer since IBM did not offer anything unique. IBM steadily lost market share
as a result. IBM's struggles led it to sell its personal computer business to Lenovo. The firm is still successful,
however, within the mainframe market where its offerings remain differentiated.

   Key Takeaway

          Differentiation can be an effective business-level strategy to the extent that a firm offers unique
             features that convince customers to pay a premium for their goods and services. As with other
             business-level strategies, there are advantages and disadvantages in pursuing a differentiation
             strategy.

6.5 Focused Cost Leadership and Focused Differentiation

Companies that use a cost leadership strategy and those that use a differentiation strategy share one important
characteristic: both groups try to be attractive to customers in general. These efforts to appeal to broad
markets can be contrasted with strategies that involve targeting a relatively narrow niche of potential
customers. These latter strategies are known as focus strategies (Porter, 1980).

The Nature of the Focus Cost Leadership Strategy

Figure 6.7: Redbox machines are available nationwide.  Focused cost leadership is the first of two focus strategies.
                                                       A focused cost leadership strategy requires competing
                                                       based on price to target a narrow market (Table 6.6). A firm
                                                       that follows this strategy does not necessarily charge the
                                                       lowest prices in the industry. Instead, it charges low prices
                                                       relative to other firms that compete within the target
                                                       market. Redbox, for example, uses vending machines placed
                                                       outside grocery stores and other retail outlets to rent DVDs
                                                       of movies for $1. There are ways to view movies even
                                                       cheaper, such as through the flat-fee streaming video
                                                       subscriptions offered by Netflix. But among firms that rent
                                                       actual DVDs, Redbox offers unparalleled levels of low price
                                                       and high convenience.

                                                           Firms that compete based on price and target a narrow
                                                           market are following a focused cost leadership strategy.
                                                       Several examples of firms pursuing a focused cost leadership

                                                                            strategy are illustrated below.

                                                            Table 6.6 Focused Cost Leadership
Example of Firms Pursuing a Focused Cost Leadership Strategy
Redbox rents DVDs and video games through vending machines for only $1.
Papa Murphy's targets its inexpensive take-and-bake pizzas at value-conscious families. Because the pizzas are baked at
home rather than in the store, Papa Murphy's is permitted to accept food stamps. This allows the firm to attract
customers that might not otherwise be able to afford a restaurant-quality pizza.
Claire's nearly 3,000+ locations target young women with inexpensive jewelry, accessories, and ear piercings. The
strategy has worked: Claire's has over three thousand locations and has stores in 95% of US shopping malls.
Providing indoor seating creates expenses for fast food restaurants. Checkers Drive In keeps its costs low by not offering
indoor seating. Checkers targets drive-thru customers and offers them big burgers at rock-bottom prices.

Another important point is that the nature of the narrow target market varies across firms that use a focused
cost leadership strategy. In some cases, the target market is defined by demographics. Claire's, for example,

                                                       Chapter 6: Selecting Business-Level Strategies | 143
seeks to appeal to young women by selling inexpensive jewelry, accessories, and ear piercings. Claire's use of
a focused cost leadership strategy has been very successful; the firm has more than three thousand locations
and has stores in 95% of US shopping malls.

In other cases, the target market is defined by the sales channel used to reach customers. Most pizza shops
offer sit-down service, delivery, or both. In contrast, Papa Murphy's sells pizzas that customers cook at home.
Because these inexpensive pizzas are baked at home rather than in the store, the law allows Papa Murphy's to
accept food stamps as payment. This allows Papa Murphy's to attract customers that might not otherwise be
able to afford a prepared pizza. In contrast to most fast-food restaurants, Checkers Drive In is a drive-through-
only operation. To serve customers quickly, each store has two drive-thru lanes: one on either side of the
building. Checkers saves money in a variety of ways by not offering indoor seating to its customers--Checkers's
buildings are cheaper to construct, its utility costs are lower, and fewer employees are needed. These savings
allow the firm to offer large burgers at very low prices and still remain profitable.

The Nature of the Focused Differentiation Strategy

Focused differentiation is the second of the two focused strategies. A focused differentiation strategy requires
offering unique features that fulfill the demands of a narrow market (Table 6.7). As with a focused low-cost
strategy, narrow markets are defined in different ways in different settings. Some firms using a focused
differentiation strategy concentrate their efforts on a particular sales channel, such as selling over the internet
only. Others target particular demographic groups. One example is Breezes Resorts, a company that caters to
couples without children. The firm operates seven tropical resorts where vacationers are guaranteed that they
will not be annoyed by loud and disruptive children.

    Firms that compete based on uniqueness and target a narrow market are following a focused differentiation
         strategy. Several examples of firms pursuing a focused differentiation strategy are illustrated below.

                                                              Table 6.7 Focused Differentiation
 Examples of Firms Pursuing a Focused Differentiation Strategy
 Whole Foods Market focuses on selling natural and organic products. The supermarket's reputation for high prices has
 led to a wry nickname--"Whole Paycheck"--but a sizable number of consumers are willing to pay a premium in order to
 feel better about the food they are buying. Amazon, a broad cost leader, owns Whole Foods.
 At Build-A-Bear Workshop, customers enjoy an interactive process of designing and assembling teddy bears.
 Build-A-Bear customers are willing to pay a premium price because they receive a unique, hands-on experience rather
 than simply buying a stuffed toy.
 You can buy a cinnamon roll cheaper elsewhere, but Cinnabon's pricey pastries are so delicious that sugar-obsessed
 snackers line up to buy them. Perhaps in a nod to Cinnabon's strategy, the brand is owned by a parent company named
 Focus Brands.
 The dedication of Mercedes-Benz to cutting-edge technology, styling, and safety innovations has made the firm's
 vehicles prized by those who are wealthy enough to afford them.

While a differentiation strategy involves offering unique features that appeal to a variety of customers, the
need to satisfy the desires of a narrow market means that the pursuit of uniqueness is often taken to the

144 | Chapter 6: Selecting Business-Level Strategies
proverbial "next level" by firms using a focused differentiation strategy. Thus the unique features provided by
firms following a focused differentiation strategy are often specialized.
When it comes to uniqueness, few offerings can top Kopi Luwak coffee beans. High-quality coffee beans often
sell for $10 to $15 a pound. In contrast, Kopi Luwak coffee beans sell for hundreds of dollars per pound (Cat's
Ass Coffee, n.d.). This price is driven by the rarity of the beans and their rather bizarre nature. As noted in an
article in the New York Times, these beans are found in the droppings of the civet, a nocturnal, furry, long-tailed
catlike animal that prowls Southeast Asia's coffee-growing lands for the tastiest, ripest coffee cherries. The
civet eventually excretes the hard, indigestible innards of the fruit--essentially, incipient coffee beans--though
only after they have been fermented in the animal's stomach acids and enzymes to produce a brew described
as smooth, chocolaty and devoid of any bitter aftertaste (Onishi, 2010).
Although many consumers consider Kopi Luwak to be disgusting, a relatively small group of coffee enthusiasts
has embraced the coffee, making it a profitable product. This illustrates the essence of a focused differentiation
strategy--effectively serving the specialized needs of a niche market can create great riches.
Larger niches are served by Whole Foods Market and Mercedes-Benz. Although most grocery stores devote
a section of their shelves to natural and organic products, Whole Foods Market works to sell such products
exclusively. For customers, the large selection of organic goods comes at a steep price. Indeed, the
supermarket's reputation for high prices has led to a wry nickname--"Whole Paycheck"--but a sizable number
of consumers are willing to pay a premium to feel better about the food they buy.

                Figure 6.8: Janis Joplin's musical tribute to Mercedes-Benz underscores the allure of the brand.

The dedication of Mercedes-Benz to cutting-edge technology, styling, and safety innovations has made the
firm's vehicles prized by those who are rich enough to afford them. This appeal has existed for many decades. In
1970, acid-rocker Janis Joplin recorded a song called "Mercedes Benz" that highlighted the automaker's allure.

                                                                                                     Chapter 6: Selecting Business-Level Strategies | 145
Since then Mercedes-Benz has used the song in several television commercials. Here is Joplin's song "Mercedes

    Developing a Focused Differentiation Strategy at Augustino LoPrinzi
    Guitars and Ukuleles

       Augustino LoPrinzi Guitars and Ukuleles in Clearwater, Florida, builds high-end custom
       instruments. The founder of the company, Augustino LoPrinzi, has been a builder of custom guitars
       for five decades. While a reasonably good mass-produced guitar can be purchased elsewhere for a
       few hundred dollars, LoPrinzi's handmade models start at $1,100, and some sell for more than
       $10,000. The firm's customers have included professional musicians such as Dan Fogelberg, Leo
       Kottke, Herb Ohta (Ohta-San), Lyle Ritz, Andrs Segovia, and B. J. Thomas. Their instruments can be
       found at http://www.augustinoloprinzi.com. We asked Augustino about his firm (Short, 2007).
       Question:
       Were there other entrepreneurial opportunities you considered before you began making guitars?
       Augustino Loprinzi:
       I originally thought of pursuing a career in commercial art, but I found my true love was in classical
       guitar building. I was trained by my father to be a barber from a very young age, and after my term
       in the service, I opened a barbershop.
       Question:
       What is the most expensive guitar you've ever sold?
       Loprinzi:
       $17,500.
       Question:
       How old were you when you started your first business in the guitar industry?
       Loprinzi:
       I was in my early twenties.
       Question:
       How did you get your break with more famous customers?
       Loprinzi:
       I think word of mouth had a lot to do with it.

146 | Chapter 6: Selecting Business-Level Strategies
       Question:
       You have been active in Japan. Do the preferences of Japanese customers differ from those of
       Americans?
       Loprinzi:
       Yes. The Japanese want only high-end instruments. Aesthetics are very important to the Japanese
       along with high-quality materials and workmanship. The US market seems to care in general less
       about ornamentation and more about quality workmanship, tone, and playability.
       Question:
       How do you stay ahead in your industry?
       Loprinzi:
       Always try to stay abreast on what the music industry is doing. We do this by reading several music
       industry publications, talking with suppliers, and keeping an eye on the trends going on in other
       countries because usually they come full circle. Also, for the past several years by following the
       internet forums and such has been extremely beneficial.

Advantages and Disadvantages of the Focused Strategies

Each generic strategy offers advantages that firms can potentially leverage to enhance their success as well
as disadvantages that may undermine their success. In the case of focus differentiation, one advantage is that
very high prices can be charged. Indeed, these firms often price their wares far above what is charged by firms
following a differentiation strategy (Table 6.8). Recreational Equipment Inc. (REI), for example, commands a
hefty premium for its outdoor sporting goods and clothes that feature name brands, such as The North Face
and Marmot. Nat Nast's focused differentiation strategy centers on selling men's silk camp shirts with a 1950s
retro flair. These shirts retail for more than $100. Focused cost leaders such as Checkers Drive In do not charge
high prices like REI and Nat Nast do, but their low cost structures enable them to enjoy healthy profit margins.
A second advantage of using a focus strategy is that firms often develop tremendous expertise about the goods
and services that they offer. In markets such as camping equipment where product knowledge is important,
rivals and new entrants may find it difficult to compete with firms following a focus strategy.

                                                                                                     Chapter 6: Selecting Business-Level Strategies | 147
 Using one of the focus strategies offers firms important advantages and disadvantages. Below we illustrate a few
             examples in relation to an industry where many different types of focus exist--sporting goods.
                                                            Table 6.8 Executing a Focus Strategy

 Advantages
 High prices can be charged. Recreational Equipment Incorporated (REI), for example, commands a premium for their
 outdoor sporting goods and clothes that feature name brands such as The North Face and Marmot.
 Firms using a focused strategy often develop great expertise about the good or service being sold. Thus, customers may
 gravitate toward a specialty camping shop in order to learn how to best take advantage of limited vacation time.
 Disadvantages
 Limited demands exist for specialized goods and services, so every potential sale counts.
 The area of focus may be taken over by others or even disappear over time. Many gun stores went out of business after
 large retailers such as Walmart started carrying an array of firearms.
 Other firms may provide an even narrower focus. An outdoor sporting goods store, for example, might lose business to a
 store that focuses solely on ski apparel because the latter can provide more guidance about how skiers can stay warm
 and avoid broken bones.
In terms of disadvantages, the limited demand available within a niche can cause problems. First, a firm could
find its growth ambitions stymied. Once its target market is being well served, expansion to other markets
might be the only way to expand, and this often requires developing a new set of skills. Also, the niche could
disappear or be taken over by larger competitors. Many gun stores have struggled and even gone out of
business since Walmart and sporting goods stores such as Academy Sports and Bass Pro Shops have started
carrying an impressive array of firearms.

                                             Figure 6.9: In contrast to tacky Hawaiian souvenirs, the
                                             quality of Kamaka ukuleles makes them a favorite of ukulele
                                             phenom Jake Shimabukuro and others who are willing to pay
                                             $1,000 or more for a high-end instrument.

148 | Chapter 6: Selecting Business-Level Strategies
Finally, damaging attacks may come not only from larger firms but also from smaller ones that adopt an even
narrower focus. A sporting goods store that sells camping, hiking, kayaking, and skiing goods, for example,
might lose business to a store that focuses solely on ski apparel because the latter can provide more guidance
about how skiers can stay warm and avoid broken bones.

    Strategy at the Movies

       Zoolander
       One man's trash is another man's fashion? That's what fashion mogul Jacobim Mugatu was counting
       on in the comedy Zoolander. In his continued effort to be the most cutting-edge designer in the
       fashion industry, Mugatu developed a new line of clothing inspired "by the streetwalkers and hobos
       that surround us." His new product line, Derelicte, characterized by dresses made of burlap and
       parking cones and pants made of garbage bags and tin cans, was developed for customers who
       valued the uniqueness of his...eclectic design. Emphasizing unique products is typical of a company
       following a differentiation strategy; however, Mugatu targeted a very specific set of customers. Few
       people would probably be enticed to wear garbage for the sake of fashion. By catering to a niche
       target market, Mugatu went from a simple differentiation strategy to a focused differentiation.
       Mugatu's Derelicte campaign in Zoolander is one illustration of how a particular firm might develop
       a focused differentiation strategy.

   Key Takeaway

          Focus strategies can be effective business-level strategies to the extent that a firm can match
             their goods and services to specific niche markets. As with the other business-level strategies,
             there are advantages and disadvantages to focus strategies.

6.6 Best-Cost Strategy

Firms that charge relatively low prices and offer substantial differentiation are following a best-cost strategy. This
strategy is difficult to execute, but it is also potentially very rewarding. Several examples of firms pursuing a best-
cost strategy are illustrated below.

                                                                  Table 6.9 Best-Cost Strategy
 Examples of Firms Pursuing a Best-Cost Strategy
 Southwest Airlines provides low cost flights to vacation destinations such as San Antonio, San Diego, and Orlando. While
 many airlines make passengers feel like cattle loaded onto a truck, Southwest creates fun by, for example, getting
 children excited about visiting Sea World when they see this custom Shamu plane design.
 Target offers extremely competitive prices, but the firm also differentiates itself from other discount retailers by
 carrying products from trendy designers such as Michael Graves, Isaac Mizrahi, Fiorruci, and Universal Thread.
 Chipotle Mexican Grill relies on organic ingredients to create very tasty burritos that are sold at prices comparable to
 those of fast-food restaurants. When noon arrives, many hungry people prefer to spend their lunch dollars on a
 top-shelf burrito rather than a greasy burger combo meal.
 Pabst Blue Ribbon is offered at an extremely low price and its taste (or lack thereof) is comparable to other inexpensive
 beers. PBR enjoys brand loyalty, however, due to its high name recognition. The frequent appearance of PBR's
 well-known logo on signs, t-shirts, and other merchandise has helped make PBR an enduring favorite among beer
 consumers with light wallets.

The Challenge of Following a Best-Cost Strategy

Some executives are not content to have their firms compete based on offering low prices or unique features.
They want it all! Firms that charge relatively low prices and offer substantial differentiation are following a
best-cost strategy (Table 6.9). This strategy is difficult to execute in part because creating unique features and
communicating to customers why these features are useful generally raises a firm's costs of doing business.
Product development and advertising can both be quite expensive. However, firms that manage to implement
an effective best-cost strategy are often very successful.
Target appears to be following a best-cost strategy. The firm charges prices that are relatively low among
retailers while at the same time attracting trend-conscious consumers by carrying products from famous
designers, such as Michael Graves, Isaac Mizrahi, Fiorucci, Universal Thread, and others. This is a lucrative
position for Target, but the position is under attack from all sides. Cost leader Walmart charges lower prices
than Target. This makes Walmart a constant threat to steal the thriftiest of Target's customers. Focus
differentiators such as Anthropologie that specialize in trendy clothing and home furnishings can take business
from Target in those areas. Deep discounters such as T. J. Maxx and Marshalls offer another viable alternative
to shoppers because they offer designer clothes and furnishings at closeout prices. A firm such as Target that
uses a best-cost strategy also opens itself up to a wider variety of potentially lethal rivals.

Developing a Best-Cost Strategy at Plain Ivey Jane

According to government statistics, women are
60% less likely than men to become
entrepreneurs. Meanwhile, succeeding within
the specialty fashion retailing market is
notoriously difficult. These trends do not
worry Sarah Reeves, a young entrepreneur and
2007 graduate of Auburn University who is
rapidly becoming a key player within the
Austin, Texas, retail scene by offering high-end
fashion at low prices.

Sarah describes Plain Ivey Jane as "the go-to     Figure 6.10: The success recent college graduates have as
place for women who want to elevate their         entrepreneurs have may inspire other recent graduates
wardrobes. We offer high end designer names       to become entrepreneurs.

at a discount, and the new overstocked apparel is handpicked from over 70 different brands to offer

exactly what Austin needs at a price every girl can afford. To pair with your fabulous new wardrobe,

Plain Ivey Jane carries accessories from undiscovered local artisans." We asked Reeves to discuss

her firm (Ketchen & Short).

Question:
Can you tell us a little about your Plain Ivey Jane concept?

Sarah Reeves, Owner:

Plain Ivey Jane sells overstock from Anthropologie, Urban Outfitters, Bloomingdales, and other
high-end and small designers. Although I buy from the same designers as the big and famous
retailers, our dresses and accessories are sold at a fraction of their prices.

Question:
What differentiates your boutique from competitors?

Reeves:

I'm one of the lowest-priced retailers in the shopping district that people in Austin call the Second
Street area. My niche in the fashion retailing business is that my merchandise is overstock from
great brands. There's maybe one other business in Austin that sells overstock. What makes my
concept different is that it has the feel of a high-end retail store versus a basement feel of the
typical discount retailer.

                                                              Chapter 6: Selecting Business-Level Strategies | 153
       Question:
       Do have a lot of regular customers?
       Reeves:
       Yes. Once people find out what I offer, they're in here all the time. I see the same group of people
       every few months, but getting in new faces is the challenge. I think a lot of people walk by and
       assume that our clothes are expensive, but nothing could be further from the truth.
       Question:
       Were you fearful of starting your own business so young?
       Reeves:
       No, I figured this was a great time since I had nothing to lose. I thought getting it out of my system
       now was a good idea, and it was a good time since I was able to get a great deal on my lease. With
       the downturn in the economy, the time was right for my lower-priced strategy.
       Question:
       What would you say is the biggest key to success for a small business?
       Reeves:
       Flexibility. Rolling with the punches and definitely the ability to follow up with people. I thought
       that people who owned their own business must know what they are doing, but many people don't.
       At this point, I prefer to do everything myself. At least I can blame myself when things go wrong.
       Another key is networking with other small-business owners. A lot of the other boutique owners
       nearby have become close friends. I learn what works for them and what might possibly apply to
       my concept.

Many firms would like to use a best cost strategy but struggle to meet the strategy's dual requirements of charging
low prices and providing differentiation features. One way to help make the best cost strategy a reality is to use a
  business model that slashes fixed costs. Amazon.com, for example, can charge low prices in part because it does
  not have to absorb the overhead involved in operating stores. Similarly, some talented chefs are pursuing a best

   cost strategy by operating food trucks and thereby avoiding the overhead required to run a restaurant such as
                                       rent and utilities. Several examples are illustrated below.

 offerings such as their Garbanzo "Tuna" sandwich.
 PBJ's offer unique sandwiches with organic peanut butter at the heart of many of their creations. The traditional PB and J
 is a staple nationwide, but customers will travel far to get the "Hot Hood" with Challah bread, black cherry jam, jalapeo,
 applewood-smoked bacon, and PBJ's peanut butter for only $5.50.
 Owners Kahala and Kat founded Ninja Plate Lunch in Portland, Oregon, to offer large portions of delectable Hawaiian
 foods such as pulled pork for only around $5.
 In the smash hit graphic novel Tales of Garcn: The Franchise Players, the Tapas Taxi takes the concept of a cheap taxi
 ride to a new level by also offering passengers a variety of "tapas." These Spanish snacks are top shelf, of course!

Pursuing the Best-Cost Strategy through a Low-Overhead Business Model

One route toward a best-cost strategy is for a firm to adopt a business model whose fixed costs and overhead
are very low relative to the costs that competitors are absorbing (Table 6.10). The internet has helped make this
possible for some firms. Amazon, for example, can charge low prices in part because it does not have to endure
the expenses that firms such as Walmart and Target do in operating many hundreds of stores. Meanwhile,
Amazon offers an unmatched variety of goods. This combination has made Amazon the unquestioned leader in
e-commerce.
Another example is Netflix. This firm is able to offer customers a far greater variety of movies and charge lower
prices than video rental stores by conducting all its business over the internet and via mail. Netflix's best-cost
strategy has been so successful that $10,000 invested in the firm's stock in May 2006 was worth more than
$1,050,000 in May 2020, fourteen years later (Forbes, 2020).
Moving toward a best-cost strategy by dramatically reducing expenses is also possible for firms that cannot
rely on the internet as a sales channel. Owning a restaurant requires significant overhead costs, such as rent
and utilities. Some talented chefs are escaping these costs by taking their food to the streets. Food trucks that
serve high-end specialty dishes at very economical prices are becoming a popular trend in cities around the
country. In Portland, Oregon, a food truck called the Viking Soul Food offers Norwegian food at low prices.
Another Portland food truck is The Good and Evil Wrap Company, whose unique and inexpensive wraps center
on specialty foods. Beyond keeping costs low, the mobility of food trucks offers important advantages over a
traditional restaurant. Some food trucks set up outside big-city nightclubs, for example, to sell party goers a
late-night snack before they head home.

                                                                                                     Chapter 6: Selecting Business-Level Strategies | 155

6.7 Stuck in the Middle

 A firm is said to be stuck in the middle if it does not offer features that are unique enough to convince customers
  to buy its offerings and its prices are too high to effectively compete based on price. Firms that are stuck in the
   middle generally perform poorly because they lack a clear market or competitive pricing. Several examples of

                                                       such firms are illustrated below.
                                                                Table 6.12 Stuck in the Middle

 Examples of Firms that are Stuck in the Middle
 Arby's signature roast beef sandwiches are neither cheaper than other fast food nor are they standouts in taste.
 Sears and their famous catalog once dominated US retailing, but the failure to cultivate customers among newer
 generations and prices that are higher than those of rivals have severely wounded the company. Sears filed for
 bankruptcy in 2018.
 Electronics retailer Circuit City found itself squeezed by the superior service offered by rival Best Buy and the cheaper
 prices charged on electronics by Walmart and Target. Headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, the firm went bankrupt in
 2009 after sixty years in business.
 Kmart's "Blue Light Specials" that alert shoppers to a deeply discounted item reflect the firm's long-running effort to be
 a cost leader. But emerging on the losing end of a price war with Walmart sent the firm into bankruptcy. Struggling to
 survive, it has closed most of its stores.

Stuck in the Middle: Neither Inexpensive nor Differentiated

Some firms fail to effectively pursue one of the generic strategies. A firm is said to be stuck in the middle if it
does not offer features that are unique enough to convince customers to buy its offerings, and its prices are too
high to compete effectively based on price (Table 6.11). Arby's appears to be a good example. Arby's signature

are stuck in the middle generally perform poorly because they lack a clear market or competitive pricing.

Doing Everything Means Doing Nothing Well

Michael Porter has noted that strategy is as much about executives deciding what a firm is not going to do as
it is about deciding what the firm is going to do (Porter, 1996). In other words, a firm's business-level strategy
should not involve trying to serve the varied needs of different segments of customers in an industry. No firm
could possibly pull this off.

                                                                 The fable, The Miller, His Son, and Their Ass, told by the

                                                                 ancient Greek storyteller Aesop helps illustrate this

                                                                 idea. In this tale, a miller and his son were driving their

                                                                 ass (donkey) to market for sale. They soon encountered

                                                                 a group of girls who mocked them for walking instead

                                                                 of riding. The father then told his son to ride the

                                                                 animal. Not long after, father and son overheard a man

                                                                 claim that young people had no respect for the elderly.

                                                                 On hearing this opinion, the father told the boy to

                                                                 dismount the animal and he began to ride. They

                                                                 progressed a short distance farther and met a

                                                                 alone; once again the two changed positions. Another

that executives need to follow.                                  way it was weighed down. In fact, it would make more

                                                                 sense for the man and his son to carry the ass. On

hearing this, the father and his son tied the animal's legs together and carried it on a pole. As they crossed a

bridge near town, the townspeople began to gather and laugh at the unorthodox sight. The noise and the chaos

frightened the beast, leading it to thrash around until it tumbled into the river. With tongue in cheek, we note

that the moral of the story is that if you try to please everyone, you may lose your ass (Short & Ketchen, 2005).

Getting Outmaneuvered by Competitors

In many cases, firms become stuck in the middle not because executives fail to arrive at a well-defined strategy
but because firms are simply outmaneuvered by their rivals. After six decades as an electronics retailer, Circuit
City went out of business in 2009. The firm had simply lost its appeal to customers. Rival electronics retailer

                                                                                                     Chapter 6: Selecting Business-Level Strategies | 159
Best Buy offered comparable prices to Circuit City's prices, but the former offered much better customer
service. Meanwhile, the service offered by discount retailers such as Walmart and Target on electronics was no
better than Circuit City's, but their prices were better.
The results were predictable--customers who made electronics purchases based on the service they received
went to Best Buy, and value-driven buyers patronized Walmart and Target. Circuit City's demise was probably
inevitable because it lacked a competitive advantage within the electronics business. Although Target was on
the winning end of this battle, Target executives need to worry that their firm could become stuck in the middle
between Walmart's better prices on one side and the trendiness of specialty shops on the other.
IBM's personal computer business offers another example. IBM tried to position its personal computers via
a differentiation strategy. In particular, IBM's personal computers were offered at high prices, and the firm
promised to offer excellent service to customers in return. Unfortunately for IBM, rivals such as Dell were able
to provide equal levels of service while selling computers at lower prices. Nothing made IBM's computers stand
out from the crowd, and the firm eventually exited the business.

              Figure 6.13: Netflix and Redbox have left video rental stores such as Movie Gallery and Blockbuster stuck
              in the middle. Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy in late 2010.

At its peak in the mid-2000's, Blockbuster operated approximately 9,000 video rental stores. By 2010, the
firm filed for bankruptcy. This rapid demise can be traced to the firm becoming outmaneuvered by Netflix.
When Netflix began offering inexpensive DVD rentals through the mail, customers defected in droves from
Blockbuster and other video rental stores such as Movie Gallery. Netflix customers were delighted by the
firm's low prices, vast selection, the convenience of not having to visit a store to select and return videos, and
were among the first to transition to streaming movies. The low price strategy of RedBox also hurt the firm.
160 | Chapter 6: Selecting Business-Level Strategies
Blockbuster was stuck in the middle--its prices were higher than those of Redbox and Netflix, and Netflix's
service was superior. Once individuals lacked a compelling reason to be Blockbuster customers, the firm's fate
was sealed. As of 2020 Blockbuster operated one store!

   Key Takeaway

          When executing a business-level strategy, a firm must not become stuck in the middle between
             viable generic business-level strategies by neither offering unique features nor competitive
             pricing.

             your advice be to the executives in charge of this firm?

        2. Research a company that has gone bankrupt or otherwise stopped operations in the past decade
             because their strategy was "stuck in the middle" of otherwise viable generic business-level
             strategies. Could its demise have been prevented?

6.8 Conclusion

This chapter explains generic business-level strategies that executives select to keep their firms competitive.
Executives must select their firm's source of competitive advantage by choosing to compete based on low-cost
versus more expensive features that differentiate their firm from competitors. In addition, targeting either a
narrow or broad market helps firms further understand their customer base. Based on these choices, firms
will follow broad cost leadership, broad differentiation, focused cost leadership, or focused differentiation
strategies. Another potentially viable business strategy, best cost, exists when firms offer relatively low prices
while still managing to differentiate their goods or services on some important value-added aspects. All firms
pursuing a best cost strategy can fall victim to being "stuck in the middle" by not offering unique features or
competitive prices.

   Learning Objectives

     After reading this chapter, you should be able to understand and articulate answers to the following
     questions:

         1. What is Entrepreneurial Orientation?
        2. Why should companies innovate?
        3. What are the four types of innovation?
        4. What are the four stages of the product life cycle and crossing the chasm?
        5. What are the ways firms might cooperate with their competitors?

7.1 Introduction

A firm's philosophy toward innovation greatly impacts the business-level/competitive strategies that it
pursues. Having an entrepreneurial orientation stimulates a firm toward innovation, improving its products and
services and launching new product lines. Innovation can open new markets for a company, and being the first
mover to launch a new product or service can be an advantage over competitors, but not always. There are
four types of innovation that depend on if existing or new markets are reached or if existing or new technology
is used. Firms may also find it advantageous to cooperate at certain levels, such as through a joint venture,
strategic alliance, merger, acquisition co-location, or co-opetition.
Innovation is important in strategic management. A firm must be improving its products and services or

                                                                                                                         Chapter 7: Innovation Strategies | 163
developing new ones to stay competitive. Business level strategy will not be able to sustain any competitive
advantage by sitting still. As firms implement corporate and international strategies, discussed in the next two
chapters, cooperative and co-opetition measures help companies obtain resources and capabilities needed to
innovate and enter new markets.

7.2 Entrepreneurial Orientation

  A famous Nike slogan encourages people to "just do it!" For people and organizations that have developed an
entrepreneurial orientation (EO), "just do it!" is a way of life. While often associated with starting new ventures,

        an EO can be very valuable to established organizations as well. Below we describe each of the three
                 characteristics associated with an EO: innovativeness, proactiveness, and risk-taking.

 An additional two characteristics were later added--competitive aggressiveness and autonomy. However, these
       two dimensions of EO have been subject to much debate and are omitted for the purposes of this text.

The Value of Thinking and Acting Entrepreneurially

When asked to think of an entrepreneur, people typically offer examples such as Elon Musk, Oprah Winfrey,
Jeff Bezos, Kylie Jenner, and Mark Zuckerberg --individuals who have started their own successful businesses
from the bottom up that generated a lasting impact on society. But entrepreneurial thinking and doing are not
limited to those who begin in their garage with a new idea, financed by family members or personal savings.
Some people in large organizations are filled with passion for a new idea, spend their time championing a new
product or service, work with key players in the organization to build a constituency, and then find ways to
acquire the needed resources to bring the idea to fruition.

164 | Chapter 7: Innovation Strategies
Entrepreneurship within an organization is called intrapreneurship. Companies often grow by offering new
services or launching new products. Rather than acquire another company that provides that product or
service, they develop it themselves. This is a method of strategy implementation called internal development.
To maximize opportunities for intrapreneurship, companies need employees with a high entrepreneurial
orientation.
Thinking and behaving entrepreneurially can help a person's career as well. Some enterprising individuals
successfully navigate through the environments of their respective organizations and maximize their own
career prospects by identifying and seizing new opportunities (Table 7.1) (Certo et al., 2009).

    Section Video

       The relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and organizational performance [01:02]
       The video for this lesson discusses the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and
       organizational performance.
       You can view this video here: https://youtu.be/Iru7IBqc3Vk.

In the 1730s, Richard Cantillon used the French term entrepreneur, or literally "undertaker," referring to those
who undertake self-employment while also accepting an uncertain return. In subsequent years, entrepreneurs
have also been referred to as innovators of new ideas (Thomas Edison), individuals who find and promote new
combinations of factors of production (Bill Gates' bundling of Microsoft's products), and those who exploit
opportunistic ideas to expand small enterprises (Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook). The common elements of these
conceptions of entrepreneurs are that they do something new and that some individuals can make something
out of opportunities that others cannot.
Entrepreneurial orientation (EO) is a key concept when executives are crafting strategies in the hopes of
doing something new and exploiting opportunities that other organizations cannot exploit. EO refers to the
processes, practices, and decision-making styles of organizations that act entrepreneurially (Lumpkin & Dess,
1996). Any organization's level of EO can be understood by examining how it stacks up relative to three
dimensions: (1) innovativeness, (2) proactiveness, (3) and risk taking. These dimensions are also relevant to
individuals.

                                                                                                                         Chapter 7: Innovation Strategies | 165
Entrepreneurial orientation (EO) is measured at both the organizational
and the individual levels. The characteristics of an entrepreneurial
company noted in Table 7.1 also apply to individuals. Those individuals
who are less risk averse, innovative thinkers, and competitive tend to have
a higher EO and greater success at starting a business. Online EO
assessment tools exist for those wishing to determine their EO. It is
important to note that EO is not only related to high tech start-ups.
Starting a lawn care business or a beauty shop are very valid and
necessary entrepreneurial ventures, and will have a better chance of
success if an entrepreneur possesses a higher EO.

Innovativeness

creating new innovations for the company. This latter example illustrates how multiple EO dimensions--in this

case, autonomy and innovativeness--can reinforce one another.

166 | Chapter 7: Innovation Strategies
Proactiveness

Proactiveness is the tendency to anticipate and act on future needs rather than reacting to events after they
unfold. A proactive organization is one that adopts an opportunity-seeking perspective. Such organizations act
in advance of shifting market demand and are often either the first to enter new markets or "fast followers" that
improve on the initial efforts of first movers.

Consider Proactive Communications, an aptly named small firm in Killeen, Texas. From its beginnings in 2001,
this firm has provided communications in hostile environments, such as Iraq and areas impacted by Hurricane
Katrina. Being proactive in this case means being willing to don a military helmet or sleep outdoors--activities
often avoided by other telecommunications firms. By embracing opportunities that others fear, Proactive's
executives have carved out a lucrative niche in a world that is technologically, environmentally, and politically
turbulent (Choi, 2008).

Risk Taking

Risk taking refers to the tendency to engage in bold rather than cautious actions. Starbucks, for example, made
a risky move when it introduced a new instant coffee called VIA Ready Brew. Instant coffee has long been viewed
by many coffee drinkers as a bland drink, but Starbucks decided that the opportunity to distribute its product
in a different format was worth the risk of associating its brand name with instant coffee.

Although a common belief about entrepreneurs is that they are chronic risk takers, research suggests that
entrepreneurs do not perceive their actions as risky; most take action only after using planning and forecasting
to reduce uncertainty (Simon et al., 2000). However, uncertainty seldom can be fully eliminated. A few years
ago, Jeroen van der Veer, CEO of Royal Dutch Shell PLC, entered a risky energy deal in Russia's Far East. At the
time, van der Veer conceded that it was too early to know whether the move would be successful (Certo et
al., 2008). Just six months later, however, customers in Japan, Korea, and the United States had purchased all
the natural gas expected to be produced there for the next twenty years. If political instabilities in Russia and
challenges in pipeline construction do not dampen returns, Shell stands to post a hefty profit from its 27.5%
stake in the venture.

Building an Entrepreneurial Orientation

Steps can be taken by executives to develop a stronger entrepreneurial orientation throughout an organization
and by individuals to become more entrepreneurial themselves. For executives, it is important to design
organizational systems and policies to reflect the three dimensions of EO. As an example, how an organization's
compensation systems encourage or discourage these dimensions should be considered. Is taking sensible
risks rewarded through raises and bonuses, regardless of whether the risks pay off, for example, or does the
compensation system penalize risk taking? Other organizational characteristics such as corporate debt level

                                                                                                                         Chapter 7: Innovation Strategies | 167
may influence EO. Do corporate debt levels help or impede innovativeness? Is debt structured in such a way as
to encourage risk taking? These are key questions for executives to consider.
Examination of some performance measures can assist executives in assessing EO within their organizations.
To understand how the organization develops and reinforces autonomy, for example, top executives can
administer employee satisfaction surveys and monitor employee turnover rates. Organizations that effectively
develop autonomy should foster a work environment with high levels of employee satisfaction and low levels
of turnover. Innovativeness can be gauged by considering how many new products or services the organization
has developed in the last year and how many patents the firm has obtained.
Similarly, individuals should consider whether their attitudes and behaviors are consistent with the three
dimensions of EO. Is an employee making decisions that focus on competitors? Does the employee provide
executives with new ideas for products or processes that might create value for the organization? Is the
employee making proactive as opposed to reactive decisions? Each of these questions will aid employees in
understanding how they can help to support EO within their organizations.

   Key Takeaway

          Building an entrepreneurial orientation can be valuable to organizations and individuals alike in
             identifying and seizing new opportunities. Entrepreneurial orientation consists of three
             dimensions: (1) innovativeness, (2) proactiveness, and (3) risk taking.

7.3 Why Innovate?

Innovate to Capture Markets

Innovation can be a key strategy to stay ahead of the competition. Firms who sit still, perhaps satisfied
with their success, will find themselves outsmarted and left behind, with the competition winning over their
customers. An innovation strategy coupled with an entrepreneurial orientation will help keep customers
buying.

Automobile manufacturers have used this strategy of innovation for years. Every year, a new innovation of
nearly all car models comes out in the fall season. The new year's model may look a little sleeker, have some
safety improvements, or be connected to the internet. These innovations entice consumers to sell their existing
car to have the latest look or technology. Cell phone manufacturers do the same thing, coming out with a new
model almost annually, with more memory, a faster processor, a better camera, etc. Where would Apple be
today if they stopped with the iPhone 7? Drug manufacturers are always innovating by doing research to find
the next medication to slow Alzheimers or cure skin cancer.

Figure 7.3: Apple's iPhone has continued to boast new features  Innovation is usually the strategy of new startup IT

                                                                innovation strategy that propels the organization
                                                                forward. This is not to discount the need for a
                                                                business-level/competitive strategy such as focused

                                                                their business-level strategy and optimize it. Often a

                                                                for a new, innovative product or service and priced
                                                                high, because the competitors are few or none.

Joseph Addison, an eighteenth century poet, is often credited with coining the phrase "He who hesitates is lost."
170 | Chapter 7: Innovation Strategies
This proverb is especially meaningful in today's business world. It is easy for executives to become paralyzed
by the dizzying array of competitive and cooperative moves available to them. Given the fast-paced nature
of most industries today, hesitation can lead to disaster. Some observers have suggested that competition in
many settings has transformed into hyper-competition, which involves very rapid and unpredictable moves
and countermoves that can undermine competitive advantages. Under such conditions, it is often better to
make a reasonable move quickly rather than hoping to uncover the perfect move through extensive and time-
consuming analysis.

The importance of continuous learning also contributes to the value of adopting a "get moving" mentality.
Success in business often depends on executives learning from a series of competitive and cooperative moves,
not on selecting ideal moves. In some circumstances, advantages can be created by taking decisive action, even
if the decision is based on incomplete information.

Blue Ocean Strategy

It is best to win without fighting. - Sun-Tzu, The Art of War

A blue ocean strategy involves creating a new, untapped market rather than competing with rivals in an existing
market (Kim & Mauborgne, 2004). This strategy follows the approach recommended by the ancient master of
strategy Sun-Tzu in the quote above. Instead of trying to outmaneuver its competition, a firm using a blue
ocean strategy tries to make the competition irrelevant (Table 7.2). Baseball legend Wee Willie Keeler offered
a similar idea when asked how to become a better hitter: "Hit 'em where they ain't." In other words, hit the
baseball where there are no fielders rather than trying to overwhelm the fielders with a ball hit directly at them.

Nintendo openly acknowledges following a blue ocean strategy in its efforts to invent new markets. Perrin
Kaplan, Nintendo's former vice president of marketing and corporate affairs for Nintendo of America noted in
an interview, "We're making games that are expanding our base of consumers in Japan and America. Yes, those
who've always played games are still playing, but we've got people who've never played to start loving it with
titles like Nintendogs, Animal Crossing and Brain Games. These games are blue ocean in action" (Rosmarin,
2006). Other examples of companies creating new markets include FedEx's invention of the fast-shipping
business and eBay's invention of online auctions.

Firms that create blue oceans experience a temporary competitive advantage. How long "temporary
competitive advantage lasts" in a blue ocean strategy depends on the particular combination of internal and
external factors that create the opportunity in the first place. Needless to say, the more successful a company
is with a blue ocean strategy, the more attention they will receive from potential competitors who want to get
into a position to benefit from those same advantages.

It's a big ocean out there! When pursuing a blue ocean strategy, executives try to create and exploit vast untapped
markets rather than competing directly with rivals. See several examples of firms following a blue ocean strategy

                                                                         below.

 Examples of Firms Following a Blue Ocean Strategy
 The interactive features of Nintendo's Wii transformed playing video games from a hobby for the hardcore gamers into a
 treasured family event.
 Coffee shops were once the domain of old men, insomniacs, and chain-smoking urban hipsters. By reinventing coffee
 shops, Starbucks made the $4 latte a must-have item for college students, business people, and soccer moms.
 At a time when cars were only for the wealthy, Henry Ford envisioned cars that were affordable to the typical American.
 Ford priced his vehicles so that his assembly line workers could afford them.
 eBay's invention of online auctions extended the auction experience--and the chance to buy that rare Elvis plate--to
 anyone with internet access.
 Golf can be frustrating to even skilled players. Callaway's creation of the Big Bertha club with an oversized head made
 golf appealing to a whole new set of weekend warriors.
 A classy, affordable wine for novice wine drinkers? Casella wines (maker of Yellow Tail) steered clear of wine snobs and
 sommeliers and instead created fun and simple tastes for the masses.

   Key Takeaway

          Firms must continually innovate to stay ahead of the competition. Blue ocean strategy is one way
             that innovation can capture new markets.

   Exercises

         1. Find a key trend from the general environment and develop a blue ocean strategy that might
             capitalize on that trend.

7.4 Types of Innovation

Being a First Mover: Advantages and Disadvantages

The idea of first mover advantage borrows from military strategy. For example, Confederate general Nathan
Beford Forrest's attack plan was simply stated as "git thar fustest with the mostest."

    When confronted by a poisonous snake, should you strike first or wait for the serpent to make a move? Each
 option has advantages and disadvantages. In business, being a first mover might allow a firm to "rattle its rivals,
but a first move might also attract the "venom" of skeptical customers. Below are examples of successful--and not

                                                           so successful--first movers.

First Move Successes     Table 7.3 First Mover Advantage
                                          First Move Failures

At a time when using most personal computers            Netscape's web browser was a first mover that was popular in

pioneered--Sony--has now been a fierce electronics
competitor for over a half century.

A famous clich contends that "the early bird gets the worm." Applied to the business world, the clich suggests
that certain benefits are available to a first mover into a market that will not be available to later entrants. A
first-mover advantage exists when making the initial move into a market allows a firm to establish a dominant
position that other firms struggle to overcome (Table 7.3). For example, Apple's creation of a user-friendly, small
computer in the early 1980s helped fuel a reputation for creativity and innovation that persists today. Kentucky
Fried Chicken (KFC) was able to develop a strong bond with Chinese officials by being the first Western
restaurant chain to enter China. Today, KFC is the leading Western fast-food chain in this rapidly growing
market. Genentech's early development of biotechnology allowed it to overcome many of the pharmaceutical
industry's traditional entry barriers such as financial capital and distribution networks and become a profitable
firm. Decisions to be first movers helped all three of these firms to be successful in their respective industries
(Ketchen et al., 2004).

                                                               Chapter 7: Innovation Strategies | 173
On the other hand, a first mover cannot be sure that customers will embrace its offering, making a first move
inherently risky. Apple's attempt to pioneer the personal digital assistant market, through its Newton, was a
financial disaster. The first mover also bears the costs of developing the product and educating customers.
Others may learn from the first mover's successes and failures, allowing them to cheaply copy or improve the
product. Sony, Samsung, and others have built on Apple's knowledge and creation of Airpods to offer competing
products. In many industries, knowledge diffusion and public-information requirements make such imitation
increasingly easy.

One caution is that first movers must be willing to commit sufficient resources to follow through on their
pioneering efforts. RCA and Westinghouse were the first firms to develop active-matrix LCD display technology
for flat computer screens, but their executives did not provide the resources needed to sustain the products
spawned by this technology. Today, these firms are not even players in this important business segment that
supplies screens for notebook computers, camcorders, medical instruments, and many other products.

To date, the evidence is mixed regarding whether being a first mover leads to success. One research study of
1,226 businesses over a fifty-five-year period found that first movers typically enjoy an advantage over rivals for
about a decade, but other studies have suggested that first moving offers little or no advantages.

Perhaps the best question that executives can ask themselves when deciding whether to be a first mover is, how
will this move provide my firm with a sustainable competitive advantage? First moves that build on strategic
resources such as patented technology are difficult for rivals to imitate and thus are likely to succeed. For
example, Pfizer enjoyed a monopoly in the erectile dysfunction market for five years with its patented drug
Viagra before two rival products (Cialis and Levitra) were developed by other pharmaceutical firms. Despite
facing stiff competition, Viagra continues to raise about $1.9 billion in sales for Pfizer annually.

In contrast, E-Trade Group's creation of the portable mortgage seemed doomed to fail because it did not
leverage strategic resources. This innovation allowed customers to keep an existing mortgage when they
move to a new home. Bigger banks could easily copy the portable mortgage if it gained customer acceptance,
undermining E-Trade's ability to profit from its first move.

Incremental Innovation

Innovation can be classified into four types:

 1. Incremental Innovation
2. Disruptive Innovation
3. Architectural Innovation
4. Radical Innovation

The type of innovation is dependent on two factors:

 1. Market - does the innovation create a new market, or address the existing market?
2. Technology - does the innovation use a new technology or an existing technology?

174 | Chapter 7: Innovation Strategies
Figure 7.4 illustrates the four types of innovation.

                                                      Incremental innovation can be described as making
                                                      improvements on an existing product or service. The
                                                      improvements are based on using existing technology
                                                      and are directed at the existing market. In the

                                                      innovations. No new markets are formed, and existing
                                                      technology is used to make the car better. Some other
                                                      examples of incremental innovation are presented in
                                                      Table 7.4

                                                        Incremental innovation occurs when the innovation
                                                      uses existing technology to improve a product or service

                                                              Incremental Innovation Examples

 Each new version of Apple's iPhone that comes out is typically incremental innovation. iPhone features such as the
 camera and processor are tweaked to make an improvement over the previous model.
 When Gillette went from a single razor blade to a double blade, to now up to six blades, no new markets were created, as
 the same consumers are buying the blades. There was no new technology involved, so this is incremental innovation.
 Residential washers and dryers have been transitioning from top-loading to side-loading, and can handle larger loads.
 This incremental innovation used existing technology and created no new markets, but stimulated demand for more
 purchasers at higher prices.

Disruptive Innovation

Some firms have the opportunity to shake up their industry by introducing a disruptive innovation--an
innovation that conflicts with, and threatens to replace, traditional approaches to competing within an industry
(Table 7.5). Disruptive innovation occurs when a new product or service engages the existing market with a new
technology. The iPad has proved to be a disruptive innovation since its introduction by Apple in 2010. Many
individuals quickly abandoned clunky laptop computers in favor of the sleek tablet format offered by the iPad.
And as a first mover, Apple was able to claim a large share of the market.

Disruptive innovations occur when firms introduce offerings that are so unique and superior that they threaten
to replace traditional approaches. Existing markets are disrupted by new technology. Sometimes a disruption
is so significant that it may create a "blue ocean" by finding a new market while disrupting an existing one, but
this is not typically the case. A number of disruptive innovations are illustrated below.

                                                                                                                          Chapter 7: Innovation Strategies | 175
                                             Table 7.5 Shaking the Market with Disruptive Innovations
                                                               Disruptive Innovation Examples

 Tablet computers disrupted laptop sales due to their versatility and portability. Reading books can be awkward on
 traditional computers, but user-friendly devices such as iPad, Nook, and Kindle are popular platforms for aggressive
 textbook publishers.
 Many stores that relied on compact disc sales went under when downloadable digital media disrupted the music
 industry. Years earlier, CDs supplanted vinyl albums and cassette tapes due to their superior durability and quality.
 Music subscriptions such as Spotify and Apple Music are new technologies that are replacing downloads. What new
 technology will replace subscriptions?
 Digital cameras disrupted the photography industry by offering instant gratification and eliminating the cost of getting
 film developed. Excellent cameras on cell phones have since disrupted the digital camera industry.
 The emergence of personal computers disrupted the dominance of mainframes and made it possible for everyone to
 have a computer in their home.
 LED lights are a newer technology that have been disrupting and replacing incandescent lights by selling to the existing
 market.

The iPad story is unusual because most disruptive innovations are not overnight sensations. Typically, a small
group of customers embrace a disruptive innovation as early adopters and then a critical mass of customers
builds over time. An example is digital cameras. Few photographers embraced digital cameras initially because
they took pictures slowly and offered poor picture quality relative to traditional film cameras. As digital cameras
improved, they gradually won over almost everyone that takes pictures. Executives who are deciding whether
to pursue a disruptive innovation must first make sure that their firm can sustain itself during an initial period
of slow growth.

Architectural Innovation

Architectural innovation occurs when new products or services use existing technology to create new markets
and/or new consumers that did not purchase that item before. For example, the smart watch used existing
cell phone technology and was repackaged into a watch. This opened up a new market of purchasers by
repackaging an existing technology. Typically, firms alter the architecture of the product to create a new
product that opens up sales to new markets. Table 7.5 provides more examples.

  Firms can innovate by using and adapting existing technology to create new products or services that address
 new markets and consumers. This type of innovation is called Architectural Innovation, since the architecture of

                               a product is changed to create a new product to reach new markets.

                                                             Architectural Innovation Examples
 Peloton, maker of home exercise bicycles, packages the already existent bicycle, internet, and communications
 technologies to create new consumers who otherwise would not buy an exercise bike.
 Some firms have leveraged solar cell technology to produce small outdoor ground lighting. This created a whole new
 group of consumers who decorate their yards with these environmentally friendly lights.
 Copiers used to be large and expensive machines purchased only for large offices. Canon and others reconfigured these
 copiers to be small and usable on desktops, creating a whole new market of people buying personal copier/printers.

Radical Innovation

When new products or services are developed using new technology that open up new markets, the result
is called radical innovation. The airplane is a good example of a radical innovation. It used an entirely new
aeronautical technology to open up a whole new market for people traveling. Traveling across the country was
unthinkable for most people, when it would take weeks to go from New York to San Francisco by car or train.
Table 7.6 provides more examples of radical innovation.

   Innovation that uses new technology to reach new consumers is radical innovation. Firms who are successful
 with a new product of service using radical innovation may then employ a strategy of incremental innovation to

                               continually improve the product or service and generate more sales.

                                                                  Table 7.7 Radical Innovation
                                                                 Radical Innovation Examples
 Pharmaceutical researchers often produce a new product that is radical innovation. They come up with a new
 combination of chemicals to treat a medical condition that attracts new buyers. Aricept,a new medication co-marketed
 by Eisai and Pfizer that helps treat the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, has opened new markets.
 Apple's Airpods can be considered a radical innovation. Apple developed an earpiece that could use wireless technology
 to receive Bluetooth signals. Now we see people with Airpods in their ears when before they would not have been using
 wired earphones nearly as much.
 The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machine uses electro-magnetic forces instead of x-rays to produce images
 internal to the body. This new technology generated a brand new market for hospitals to buy these machines for new
 diagnostic capabilities.

Footholds

   Footholds are useful for rock climbers looking for sure footing to ascend a difficult mountain, as well as firms
    hoping to gain positions in new markets. In business, a foothold is a small position that a firm intentionally
    establishes within a market in which it does not yet compete. Examples of the use of footholds are illustrated

                                                                         below.

                                                                                                                          Chapter 7: Innovation Strategies | 177
                                                                      Table 7.8 Footholds
                                                                      Foothold Examples
 Swedish furniture seller IKEA opens just a single store when entering a new country, such as their first store in Japan.
 This foothold is used as a showcase to establish IKEA's brand; more stores are opened once brand recognition is
 gained in the country.
 Pharmaceutical giant Merck obtained a foothold by purchasing SmartCells Inc.,--a company developing a possible
 new diabetes treatment.
 The foothold concept also applies to warfare. Many armies establish new positions in geographic territories that they
 have not previously occupied. The Allied Forces used Normandy, France, as their foothold to advance on German
 forces during World War II.
Similarly, some organizations find it valuable to establish footholds in certain markets. Within the context of
business, a foothold is a small position that a firm intentionally establishes within a market in which it does
not yet compete (Upson et al., 2012). Swedish furniture seller IKEA is a firm that relies on footholds. When
IKEA enters a new country, it opens just one store. This store is then used as a showcase to establish IKEA's
brand. Once IKEA gains brand recognition in a country, more stores are established (Hambrick & Fredrickson,
2005).
Pharmaceutical giants such as Merck often obtain footholds in emerging areas of medicine. In December 2010,
for example, Merck purchased SmartCells Inc., a company that was developing a possible new treatment for
diabetes. In May 2011, Merck acquired an equity stake in BeiGene Ltd., a Chinese firm that was developing novel
cancer treatments and detection methods. Competitive moves such as these offer Merck relatively low-cost
platforms from which it can expand if clinical studies reveal that the treatments are effective.

   Key Takeaway

          Being the first mover can provide a firm a competitive advantage, but competitors who wait may
             be the ultimate winners.

          There are four types of innovation that firms employ to increase their strength in the
             marketplace.

   Exercises

         1. Provide an example of a product that, if invented, would work as a disruptive innovation. How
             widespread would be the appeal of this product?

        2. How would you propose to develop a new foothold if your goal was to compete in the fashion

7.5 Implementing Innovation

Product Life Cycle and Crossing the Chasm

When innovation creates a new product, it typically goes through four stages within the marketplace. This is
true whether it is a high-tech product like a new video game system or a more mundane product like a laundry
detergent. The four stages are:

 1. Introduction: The product is launched, with the hopes that it catches on. Sales are low.
2. Growth: The product catches on, and sales increase with time. Competitors jump in, but the rivalry among

      competitors is not really strong yet, and there are plenty of sales for all.
3. Maturity: Sales begin to level out, growth slows, and competition increases. Shake-out occurs, with some

      competitors leaving the market or being acquired by others.
4. Decline: Sales start declining. More consolidation occurs, with firms looking for exit strategies. A few

      firms remain.

Figure 7.5: Product Life Cycle

Figure 7.5 illustrates these four stages over time. To prevent the decline of their product after the maturity
stage, firms will often "relaunch" their product with a new and improved model. Innovation again plays a role,
making improvements to the product, so that consumers will purchase the latest model. Prime examples of
180 | Chapter 7: Innovation Strategies
incremental innovation strategy are Apple's iPhone and car manufacturers, such as Ford and Toyota. In essence,
the new model starts the product life cycle all over again. Figure 7.6 illustrates this concept.

Figure 7.6: Product Life Cycle Extension
Profits generated during the product life cycle also usually follow a traditional pattern. During the research and
development phase of the product, the firm is investing funds into the product, generating a negative profit.
Losses continue during the introduction phase, when sales are low and marketing expenses are high. Firms
tend to recoup their investment in R&D and marketing during the growth phase, with maximum profits at the
beginning of the maturity phase. Once competition heats up in the maturity phase, price competition kicks in,
and lower prices mean lower profits. Figure 7.7 illustrates the profits during the four phases of the product life
cycle.

                                                                                                                          Chapter 7: Innovation Strategies | 181
Figure 7.7: Profits During the Product Life Cycle

Another phenomenon that occurs in the innovation process with new technology is called "crossing the chasm."
When a new technology is launched, often there are technology innovators/enthusiasts who will purchase the
new technology to check it out. A few more, called early adopters, will also want to try out the new product.
But how does the firm get the product into the mainstream market? How do they get it to catch on? This can
often be challenging. Can the product make the leap to the mainstream? This is called "crossing the chasm," and
often requires a different marketing approach.

Figure 7.6 illustrates this concept, breaking down the market into customer segments. Innovators and early
adopters make up about 15% of the market. Firms must determine a business strategy for each segment of
the market. If they cannot convince the early majority to buy their product, the product fails. Google Glass
is an example of a product that did not cross the chasm. Eyeglasses connected to the internet were quite an
innovative product, projecting internet sites in front of the eyes, or allowing the wearer to take pictures. Its true
usefulness, however, was questionable, and aside from some early adopters, it failed.

Where is the electric car in this technology adoption life cycle? The purchase of electric cars has certainly
been growing. Have they crossed the chasm? In 2019, approximately 2.2% of all car sales were electric plug-in
vehicles (Coran, 2019). Electric vehicles still need to cross the chasm. The lack of charging stations across the
nation and concern for running out of battery are limiting factors preventing the electric vehicle from selling
to the early majority.

Making Cooperative Moves

Franklin Roosevelt once quipped, "Competition has been shown to be useful up to a certain point and no further,
but cooperation, which is the thing we must strive for today, begins where competition leaves off." We illustrate

                                   four commonly used cooperative moves used by firms below.

     Joint                                       Table 7.9 Making Cooperative Moves
  Ventures    Joint ventures involve two or more organizations that contribute to the creation of a new entity. For
              example, Hong Kong Disneyland is a joint venture between the government of Hong Kong and the Walt
  Strategic   Disney Company. While the park consists of Disney mainstays such as Main Street, USA, Fantasyland,
  Alliances   Adventureland, and Tomorrowland, the park also incorporates elements of Chinese culture such as
              adherence to the rules of Feng Shui--a set of aesthetic design principles believed to promote positive
Mergers and   energy.
Acquisitions  Strategic alliances are cooperative arrangements governed by contract between two or more
              organizations that do not involve creating new entities. For example, a strategic alliance between Merck
              and PAREXEL International Corporation was formed with the goal of collaborating on biotechnology
              efforts known as biosimilars--a term used to describe subsequent versions of innovative drugs.
              Mergers and Acquisitions combine two organizations into one. Mergers typically occur between
              like-size firms. Sprint and T-Mobile merged to create a stronger force in the wireless communications
              industry. Acquisitions usually are done by larger companies acquiring smaller ones, as when Google
              acquired Fitbit.

In addition to competitive moves, firms can benefit from cooperating with one another. Cooperative moves
such as forming joint ventures and strategic alliances may allow firms to enjoy successes that might not
otherwise be reached (Table 7.9). This is because cooperation enables firms to share rather than duplicate
resources and to learn from one another's strengths. Firms that enter cooperative relationships take on risks,
however, including the loss of control over operations, possible transfer of valuable secrets to other firms, and
possibly being taken advantage of by partners (Ketchen et al., 2004).

                                                                                                                         Chapter 7: Innovation Strategies | 183
Joint Ventures

A joint venture is a cooperative arrangement that involves two or more organizations with each contributing
to the creation of a new entity. The partners in a joint venture share decision-making authority, control of the
operation, and any profits that the joint venture earns.

Sometimes two firms create a joint venture to deal with a shared opportunity. A joint venture was created
between Merck and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., an Indian pharmaceutical company. The purpose of the
joint venture was to create and sell generic drugs in developing countries. In a press release, a top executive at
Sun stressed that each side has important strengths to contribute: "This joint venture reinforces [Sun's] strategy
of partnering to launch products using our highly innovative delivery technologies around the world. Merck has
an unrivaled reputation as a world leading, innovative, research-driven pharmaceutical company" (Merck, 2011).
Both firms contributed executives to the new organization, reflecting the shared decision making and control
involved in joint ventures.

In other cases, a joint venture is designed to counter a shared threat. Brewers SABMiller and Molson Coors
Brewing Company created a joint venture called MillerCoors that combines the firms' beer operations in the
United States. Miller and Coors found it useful to join their US forces to better compete against their giant
rival Anheuser-Busch, while the two parent companies still remain separate. The joint venture controls a wide
array of brands, including Miller Lite, Coors Light, Blue Moon Belgian White, Coors Banquet, Foster's, Henry
Weinhard's, Icehouse, Keystone Premium, Leinenkugel's, Killian's Irish Red, Miller Genuine Draft, Miller High
Life, Milwaukee's Best, Molson Canadian, Peroni Nastro Azzurro, Pilsner Urquell, and Red Dog. This diverse
portfolio makes MillerCoors a more potent adversary for Anheuser-Busch than either Miller or Coors would be
on their own.

Strategic Alliances

A strategic alliance is a cooperative arrangement between two or more organizations that does not involve
the creation of a new entity. For example, Twitter formed a strategic alliance with Yahoo! Japan. The alliance
involved relevant Tweets appearing within various functions offered by Yahoo! Japan (Rao, 2011). The alliance
simply involves the two firms collaborating through a contractual relationship as opposed to creating a new
entity together.

The pharmaceutical industry is the location of many strategic
alliances. In another example, Merck and PAREXEL International
Corporation engaged in a strategic alliance. Within this alliance, Figure 7.9: ExxonMobil, a merger of Exxon and
the two companies collaborate on biotechnology efforts known Mobil oil companies
as biosimilars. This alliance could be quite important to Merck
because the global market for biosimilars has been predicted to rise significantly (PRWeb, 2011).

184 | Chapter 7: Innovation Strategies
Mergers and Acquisitions

Another way for firms to cooperate to the advantage of both firms and their stockholders is through mergers.
Two firms decide to combine into one entity, often gaining strength in the market. The merger of T-Mobile
and Sprint is a prime example. As the number three and four players in the wireless communications industry,
combining forces makes the new firm a much stronger competitor against AT&T and Verizon. Sometimes both
firms' identities remain in the name of the new company, such as with the merger of Exxon and Mobil oil
companies to ExxonMobil. At other times, only one of the firm's names remains, or a new name is selected for
the merged companies.
Whereas mergers typically occur with like-size companies, acquisitions are usually done by the larger firm
acquiring the smaller firm. The end result is basically the same, with two companies combining into one.
Sometimes the acquired firm is absorbed into the acquiring company, but sometime it retains its identity.
Besides combining the strengths of both organizations with the intent of having a stronger performing
company, mergers and acquisitions reduce the number of competitors in the industry.
Mergers and acquisitions are not without risk, however. According to a Harvard Business Review report, the
failure rate of mergers and acquisitions is between 70% - 90% (Lakelet Capital, 2019). Often, the enthusiasm
of the perceived benefits of the merger overshadow the challenges of adapting two organizational cultures
into one, the total costs of the venture, and/or dealing with different technical systems. Also, an acquisition
is a quick way to increase firm revenues, a metric that may incentivize CEOs to acquire another firm without
adequate due diligence, creating an agency problem, which is discussed in Chapter 11 on ethics.

Internal Development

Another method to expand a firm is through internal development. If a firm wants to add a new product
or service line, rather than acquire that expertise by buying a company, the firm can develop that capability
themselves. Although this is more of a competitive rather than a cooperative move, this is where a firm's
strength of entrepreneurial orientation (EO) comes into play, and when intrapreneurship is important. Instead
of acquiring Fitbit, Google could have developed this wearable technology internally by hiring those with the
expertise and paying for the research and development for product development to enter this market.

                                                                                                                         Chapter 7: Innovation Strategies | 185
   Key Takeaways

          New products and services typically follow a predictable product life cycle, and must be able to
             "cross the chasm" to attract buyers beyond the early adopters.

          Sometimes it is advantageous for a firm to make a cooperative move with a competitor, with
             strategies such as a joint venture, strategic alliance, merger, or acquisition. Internal development
             is also a method to add innovative capability.

7.6 Responding to Innovation in the Market

Executives in many markets must cope with a rapid-fire barrage of attacks from rivals, such as head-to-head
advertising campaigns, price cuts, and attempts to grab key customers. If a firm is going to respond to a
competitor's move, doing so quickly is important. If there is a long delay between an attack and a response, this
generally provides the attacker with an edge. For example, PepsiCo made the mistake of waiting fifteen months
to copy Coca-Cola's introduction of Vanilla Coke. In the interim, Vanilla Coke carved out a significant market
niche.

In contrast, fast responses tend to prevent such an edge. Pepsi's announcement of a mid-calorie cola
introduction was quickly followed by a similar announcement by Coke, signaling that Coke would not allow
this niche to be dominated by its longtime rival. Thus, as former General Electric CEO Jack Welch noted in
his autobiography, success in most competitive rivalries "is less a function of grandiose predictions than it is a
result of being able to respond rapidly to real changes as they occur. That's why strategy has to be dynamic and
anticipatory."

So...We Meet Again

Multi-point competition adds complexity to decisions about whether to respond to a rival's moves. With multi-
point competition, a firm faces the same rival in more than one market. Cigarette makers R. J. Reynolds (RJR)
and Philip Morris, for example, square off not only in the United States, but also in many countries around
the world. When a firm has one or more multi-point competitors, executives must realize that a competitive
move in a market can have effects not only within that market, but also within others. When RJR started using
lower-priced cigarette brands in the United States to gain customers, Philip Morris responded in two ways. The
first response was cutting prices in the United States to protect its market share. This started a price war that
ultimately hurt both companies. Second, Philip Morris started building market share in Eastern Europe where
RJR had been establishing a strong position. This combination of moves forced RJR to protect its market share
in the United States and neglect Eastern Europe.

If rivals are able to establish mutual forbearance, then multi-point competition can help them be successful.
Mutual forbearance occurs when rivals do not act aggressively because each recognizes that the other can
retaliate in multiple markets. Southwest Airlines and United Airlines compete in some, but not all markets.
United announced plans to form a new division that would move into some of Southwest's other routes.
Southwest CEO Herb Kelleher publicly threatened to retaliate in several shared markets. United then backed
down, and Southwest had no reason to attack. The result was better performance for both firms. Similarly,
in hindsight, both RJR and Philip Morris probably would have been more profitable had RJR not tried to steal
market share in the first place. Thus, recognizing and acting on potential forbearance can lead to better
performance through firms not competing away their profits, while failure to do so can be costly.

Responding to a Disruptive Innovation

When a rival introduces a disruptive innovation that conflicts with the industry's current competitive practices,
such as the emergence of online stock trading, executives choose from among three main responses. First,
executives may believe that the innovation will not replace established offerings entirely and thus, may choose
to focus on their traditional modes of business while ignoring the disruption. For example, many traditional
bookstores such as Barnes & Noble did not consider book sales on Amazon to be a competitive threat until
Amazon began to take market share from them. Second, a firm can counter the challenge by attacking along a
different dimension. For example, Apple responded to the direct sales of cheap computers by Dell and Gateway
by adding power and versatility to its products. The third possible response is to simply match the competitor's
move. Merrill Lynch, for example, confronted online trading by forming its own Internet-based unit. Here the
firm risks cannibalizing its traditional business, but executives may find that their response attracts an entirely
new segment of customers.

Fighting Brands: Get Ready to Rumble

A firm's success can be undermined when a competitor tries to lure away its customers by charging lower
prices for its goods or services. Such a scenario is especially scary if the quality of the competitor's offerings is
reasonably comparable to the firm's. One possible response would be for the firm to lower its prices to prevent
customers from abandoning it. This can be effective in the short term, but it creates a long-term problem.
Specifically, the firm will have trouble increasing its prices back to their original level in the future because
charging lower prices for a time will devalue the firm's brand and make customers question why they should
accept price increases.

The creation of a fighting brand is a move that can prevent this problem. A fighting brand is a lower-end brand
that a firm introduces to try to protect the firm's market share without damaging the firm's existing brands.
In the late 1980s, General Motors (GM) was troubled by the extent to which the sales of small, inexpensive
Japanese cars were growing in the United States. GM wanted to recapture lost sales, but it did not want to
harm its existing brands, such as Chevrolet, Buick, and Cadillac, by putting their names on low-end cars. GM's
solution was to sell small, inexpensive cars under a new brand: Geo.

Interestingly, several of Geo's models were produced in joint ventures between GM and the same Japanese
automakers that the Geo brand was created to fight. A sedan called the Prizm was built side by side with the
Toyota Corolla by the New United Motor Manufacturing Incorporated (NUMMI), a factory co-owned by GM and
Toyota. The two cars were virtually identical except for minor cosmetic differences. A smaller car (the Metro)
and a compact sport utility vehicle (the Tracker) were produced by a joint venture between GM and Suzuki. By
1998, the US car market revolved around higher-quality vehicles, and the low-end Geo brand was discontinued.

                                                                                                                         Chapter 7: Innovation Strategies | 189
                                                            Some fighting brands are rather short lived. Merck's

                                                            failed attempt to protect market share in Germany by

                                                            creating a fighting brand is an example. Zocor, a

                                                            treatment for high cholesterol, was set to lose its

                                                            German patent in 2003. Merck tried to keep its high

                                                            profit margin for Zocor intact until the patent expired

                                                            as well as preparing for the inevitable competition with

                                                            generic drugmakers by creating a lower-priced brand,

                                                            Zocor MSD. Once the patent expired, however, the new

                                                            brand was not priced low enough to keep customers

                                                            from switching to generics. Merck soon abandoned the

                                                            Zocor MSD brand (Ritson, 2009).

Figure 7.10: The Geo brand was known for its low price and  Two major airlines experienced similar futility. In
good gas mileage, not for its styling.                      response to the growing success of discount airlines

such as Southwest, AirTran, Jet Blue, and Frontier, both United Airlines and Delta Airlines created fighting

brands. United launched Ted in 2004 and discontinued it in 2009. Delta's Song had an even shorter existence. It

started in 2003 and ended in 2006. Southwest's acquisition of AirTran in 2011 created a large airline that may

make United and Delta lament that they were not able to make their own discount brands successful.

Despite these missteps, the use of fighting brands is a time-tested competitive move. For example, very
successful fighting brands were launched forty years apart by Anheuser-Busch and Intel. After Anheuser-Busch
increased the prices charged by its existing brands in the mid-1950s (Budweiser and Michelob), smaller brewers
started gaining market share. In response, Anheuser-Busch created a lower-priced brand: Busch. The new
brand won back the market share that had been lost and remains an important part of Anheuser-Busch's brand
portfolio today. In the late 1990s, silicon chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) started undercutting the
prices charged by industry leader Intel. Intel responded by creating the Celeron brand of silicon chips, a brand
that has preserved Intel's market share without undermining profits. Wise strategic moves such as the creation
of the Celeron brand help explain why Intel ranks thirty-second on Fortune magazine's list of the "World's Most
Admired Corporations." Meanwhile, Anheuser-Busch is the second most admired beverage firm, ranking behind
Coca-Cola.

Co-location                                  Table 7.10 Co-location and Co-opetition
Co-opetition  Co-location refers to a situation when goods and services offered under different brands are located
              very close to each other. Noting one common example of co-location, a comedian once joked that La
              Quinta was Spanish for "Next to Denny's." Both hotels and restaurants are often co-located alongside
              freeway exits to allow numerous choices for road-weary travelers.
              Co-opetition is a term that refers to the blending of competition and cooperation between two firms.
              Toyota and General Motors' creation of jointly owned New United Motor Manufacturing incorporated
              (NUMMI) allowed for collaboration on automobile designs while Toyota and GM continued to compete
              for market share worldwide. The NUMMI experience also inspired the comedy Gung Ho.

190 | Chapter 7: Innovation Strategies
Co-location

Co-location occurs when goods and services offered under different brands are located close to one another.
In many cities, for example, theaters and art galleries are clustered together in one neighborhood. Auto malls
that contain several different car dealerships are found in many areas. Restaurants and hotels are often located
near one another as well. "Big Box Stores" like Target. Staples, Best Buy, Lowes, etc., are almost always found
clustered together with other retailers. By providing customers with a variety of choices, a set of co-located
firms can attract a bigger set of customers collectively than the sum that could be attracted to individual
locations. If a desired play is sold out, a restaurant overcrowded, or a hotel overbooked, many customers simply
patronize another firm in the area.

Because of these benefits, savvy executives in some firms co-locate their own brands. The industry that Brinker
International competes within is revealed by its stock ticker symbol: EAT. This firm often sites outlets of the
multiple restaurant chains it owns on the same street. Marriott's Courtyard and Fairfield Inn often sit side by
side. Yum! Brands takes this clustering strategy one step further by locating more than one of its brands--A&W,
Long John Silver's, Taco Bell, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Pizza Hut--within a single store.

Co-opetition

Although competition and cooperation are usually
viewed as separate processes, the concept of co-
opetition highlights a complex interaction that is
becoming increasingly popular in many industries.
Ray Noorda, the founder of software firm Novell,
coined the term to refer to a blending of competition
and cooperation between two firms. For example,
drug manufacturers Merck and Roche are rivals in Figure 7.11: Yum! Co-located brands
some markets, but the firms are working together to
develop tests to detect cancer and to promote a hepatitis treatment. NEC, a Japanese electronics company, has
three different relationships with Hewlett-Packard Co.: customer, supplier, and competitor. Some units of each
company work cooperatively with the other company, while other units are direct competitors. NEC and
Hewlett-Packard could be described as "frienemies"--part friends and part enemies.

Toyota and General Motors provide a well-known example of co-opetition. In terms of cooperation, Toyota and
GM vehicles were produced side by side for many years at the jointly owned New United Motor Manufacturing
Incorporated (NUMMI) in Fremont, California. While Honda and Nissan used wholly owned plants to begin
producing cars in the United States, NUMMI offered Toyota a lower-risk means of entering the US market.
This entry mode was desirable to Toyota because its top executives were not confident that Japanese-style
management would work in the United States. Meanwhile, the venture offered GM the chance to learn
Japanese management and production techniques--skills that were later used in GM's facilities. NUMMI offered
both companies economies of scale in manufacturing and the chance to collaborate on automobile designs.

                                                                                                                          Chapter 7: Innovation Strategies | 191
Meanwhile, Toyota and GM compete for market share around the world. In recent years, the firms have been
the world's two largest automakers, and they have traded the top spot over time.
In their book titled, not surprisingly, Co-opetition, A. M. Brandenberger and B. J. Nalebuff suggest that
cooperation is generally best suited for "creating a pie," while competition is best suited for "dividing it up"
(Brandenberger & Nalebuff, 1996). In other words, firms tend to cooperate in activities located far in the
value chain from customers, while competition generally occurs close to customers. The NUMMI example
illustrates this tendency--GM and Toyota worked together on design and manufacturing but worked separately
on distribution, sales, and marketing. Similarly, a research study focused on Scandinavian firms found that,
in the mining equipment industry, firms cooperated in material development, but they competed in product
development and marketing. In the brewing industry, firms worked together on the return of used bottles but
not in distribution (Bengtsson & Kock, 2000).

   Key Takeaway

          Cooperating with other firms is sometimes a more lucrative and beneficial approach than
             directly attacking competing firms.

7.7 Conclusion

This chapter explains how innovation impacts strategy development. An entrepreneurial orientation helps a
firm develop and implement new innovations. Being the first mover can present advantages, but is not without
the risk of competitors learning from the first mover and eventually beating them. Executives may also choose
a more conservative route by establishing a foothold within an area that can serve as a launching point or
by avoiding existing competitors overall by using a blue ocean strategy. There are four types of innovation:
incremental, disruptive, architectural, and radical. New products typically follow a predictable product life cycle
with four stages: introduction, growth, maturity, and decline. Firms often use incremental innovation to re-
launch products with improved features, starting the product life cycle over again. New products and services
must "cross the chasm" to get them into the mainstream. Firms may cooperate with competitors through joint
ventures, strategic alliances, mergers, and acquisitions, or through co-location and co-opetition. Executives
may also react to competitive attacks by using fighting brands. All of these efforts by firms are part of the
strategic management process that executives must respond to if they want their companies to be successful.

   Learning Objectives

     After reading this chapter, you should be able to understand and articulate answers to the following
     questions:

         1. What is corporate-level strategy and how does it differ from business-level strategy?
        2. What is vertical integration and what benefits can it provide?
        3. What are the three types of diversification and when should they be used?
        4. What are four methods that a firm can use to implement its corporate strategy?
        5. Why and how might a firm retrench or restructure?
        6. What is portfolio planning and why is it useful?

8.1 Introduction

The preceding chapters focused on generic business-level, also referred to as generic competitive strategy:
how firms compete head-to-head on products and services they offer. The intent is to develop strategies that
provide a competitive advantage, so that buyers will purchase what a business has to offer instead of purchasing
from a competitor. However, there are three types of strategy: business-level, corporate-level, and international
strategy.
In this chapter, the focus is on corporate-level strategy. Corporate-level strategy is a paradigm shift from
business-level strategy. It asks: what businesses should the firm be in, and how can being in those businesses

                                                                                                   Chapter 8: Selecting Corporate-Level Strategies | 195
create synergy and improve performance? Diversification is the key in corporate strategy. There are several
ways that a corporate diversification strategy can be implemented that will be examined here. The third and
final type of strategy following business-level and corporate-level strategies is international strategy, which will
be discussed in the next chapter.

Following a string of legendary films such as Pinocchio (1940), Fantasia (1940), Bambi (1942), and Cinderella
(1950), Walt Disney began to diversify his empire. His company developed a television series for the American
Broadcasting Company (ABC) in 1954 and opened the Disneyland theme park in 1955. Shortly before its opening,
the theme park was featured on the television show to expose the American public to Walt's innovative ideas.
One of the hosts of that episode was Ronald Reagan, who twenty-five years later became president of the
United States. A larger theme park, Walt Disney World, was opened in Orlando in 1971. Roy Disney died just
two months after Disney World opened; his brother Walt had passed in 1966 while planning the creation of the
Orlando facility.

The Walt Disney Company began a series of acquisitions in 1993 with the purchase of movie studio Miramax
Pictures. ABC was acquired in 1996, along with its very successful sports broadcasting company, ESPN. Two
other important acquisitions were made during the following decade. Pixar Studios was purchased in 2006
for $7.4 billion (Stewart, 2011). This strategic move brought a very creative and successful animation company

attractive because of its vast roster of popular characters, including Iron Man, the X-Men, the Incredible Hulk,
the Fantastic Four, and Captain America. In addition to featuring these characters in movies, Disney could build
attractions around them within its theme parks.

With annual revenues in excess of $38 billion, The Walt Disney Company was the largest media conglomerate
in the world by 2010. It was active in four key industries. Disney's theme parks included not only its American
locations but also joint ventures in France and Hong Kong. A park in Shanghai, China opened in 2016. The theme
park business accounted for 28% of Disney's revenues.

Disney's presence in the television industry, including ABC, ESPN, Disney Channel, and ten television stations,
accounted for 45% of revenues. Disney's original business, filmed entertainment, accounted for 18% of revenue.
Merchandise licensing was responsible for 7% of revenue. This segment of the business included children's
books, video games, and 350 stores spread across North American, Europe, and Japan. The remaining 2% of
revenues were derived from interactive online technologies. Much of this revenue was derived from Playdom,
an online gaming company that Disney acquired in 2010.

Disney continued with more acquisitions, buying Lucasfilm in 2012, Maker Studios in 2015, BAMTech in 2017, and
21st Century Fox in 2019. With the exception of 2017, when there was a slight revenue decline, Disney's revenues
have shown consistent, strong growth (Macrotrends, n.d.). Can Disney maintain this trend? Is Disney getting
too large to manage effectively? With the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 shutting down many of Disney's business
lines temporarily, should Disney diversify into other industries, and not be so dependent on the entertainment
industry for its future success?

level strategy considers issues at a broader level of
analysis. The word "corporate" does not refer to the
legal entity of a corporation, but to the level of strategy
higher than direct head-to-head competition. Any size
firm can develop corporate-level strategy. The owner
of a McDonald's franchise can pursue a corporate
strategy, as can the owner of a local plumbing
company.

Corporate Strategy -Specifies actions taken by the
firm to gain a competitive advantage by selecting and
industries and/or product markets.

In corporate-level strategy, executives seek to answer two basic questions, and then three more detailed
questions.

A. What business(es) should we be in?

                                                             Chapter 8: Selecting Corporate-Level Strategies | 197
B. How should we manage the portfolio to achieve synergy/create value?

With respect to the first question A above, what business(es) should we be in, firms must ask:

 1. In what stage of the industry value chain should we participate?
2. What range of products and services should we offer?
3. Where geographically should we compete?

All three of these questions should be answered within the context of question B above, how can synergy be
achieved?

Synergy in the business context means the cooperation or interaction of two or more business units so that
they perform more effectively together than they would if independent. For example, if a larger company
acquires a similar smaller company, some of the administrative overhead expenses such as accounting or
human resources can be combined and operate more efficiently. Another synergy produced is overall reduced
marketing expenses since they can market their products together.

The foundational issue in corporate-level strategy is diversification: how can the organization diversify, and in
doing so, create synergy? Diversification can address geographic questions, such as how Disney established
theme parks in France, Japan, and China. Also, moving a firm into other industries, outside the home industry,
is another way to diversify. Warren Buffet's company Berkshire Hathaway owns businesses as diverse as real
estate, insurance, and a railroad. Additionally, a firm may expand into business areas within its value chain, by
acquiring suppliers upstream in the supply chain or distributors or retailers downstream. For example, when
Disney launched its streaming service Disney+, it diversified downstream in its value chain to control and
provide an outlet for the movie content it produced.

The executives in charge of a firm such as The Walt Disney Company must decide whether to remain within
their present domains or venture into new ones. In Disney's case, the firm has expanded from its original
business (films) and into television, theme parks, cruise lines, and several others. In contrast, many firms
never expand beyond their initial choice of industry. Disney executives could consider further diversifying
geographically, diversifying into additional industries, and diversifying deeper into its value chain, for example,
by acquiring some of its suppliers. In all these considerations, Disney needs to evaluate if and how synergy can
be produced.

8.3 Diversification

There are a variety of reasons a company may consider diversification. Diversification strategies can help mitigate
the risk of a company operating in only one industry. If an industry experiences issues or slows down, being in other
industries can help soften the impact. Companies can also diversify within their own industry. There are three types of
diversification:

 1. Related Diversification --Diversifying into business lines in the same industry; Volkswagen acquiring Audi is an
      example.

2. Unrelated Diversification --Diversifying into new industries, such as Amazon entering the grocery store business
      with its purchase of Whole Foods.

3. Geographic Diversification --Operating in various geographic markets, which is the corporate strategy of
      Starbucks, Target, and KFC.

In all three diversification strategies, the goal is to achieve synergy. How can the firm operate more efficiently and
effectively through its diversification efforts?

Three Tests for Diversification

A proposed diversification move must first answer three questions to determine if it should be accepted or
rejected (Porter, 1987).

 1. How attractive is the industry that a firm is considering entering? Unless the industry has strong profit potential,

                                                                                                   Chapter 8: Selecting Corporate-Level Strategies | 199
      entering it may be very risky. Porter's Five Forces Analysis can help with this assessment.
2. How much will it cost to enter the industry? Executives need to be sure that their firm can recoup the expenses

      that it absorbs in diversifying. When Philip Morris bought 7Up, it paid four times what 7Up was actually worth.
      Making up these costs proved to be impossible and 7Up was sold less than 10 years later.
3. Will the new unit and the firm be better off? Unless at least one side gains a competitive advantage, diversification
      should be avoided. In the case of Philip Morris and 7Up, for example, neither side benefited significantly from
      joining together.

Related Diversification

Related diversification occurs when a firm moves into a new industry that has important similarities with the
firm's existing industry or industries (Figure 8.1). Because films and television are both aspects of entertainment,
Disney's purchase of ABC is an example of related diversification. Some firms that engage in related
diversification aim to develop and exploit a core competency to become more successful. A core competency
is a skill set that is difficult for competitors to imitate, can be leveraged in different businesses, and contributes
to the benefits enjoyed by customers within each business (Prahalad & Hamel, 1990). For example, Newell
Rubbermaid is skilled at identifying under-performing brands and integrating them into their three business
groups: (1) home and family, (2) office products, and (3) tools, hardware, and commercial products.

Figure 8.3: Estee Lauder exemplifies related diversification with their ventures into skincare, makeup, and hair care products.
                                                                                                   Chapter 8: Selecting Corporate-Level Strategies | 201
Honda Motor Company provides a good example of leveraging a
core competency through related diversification. Although Honda
is best known for its cars and trucks, the company actually started
out in the motorcycle business. Through competing in this
business, Honda developed a unique ability to build small and
reliable engines. When executives decided to diversify into the
automobile industry, Honda was successful in part because it
leveraged this ability within its new business. Honda also applied its
engine-building skills in the all-terrain vehicle, lawn mower, and
boat motor industries.

Sometimes the benefits of related diversification that executives       Figure 8.4: Honda's related diversification
hope to enjoy are never achieved. Both soft drinks and cigarettes       strategy has taken the firm into several

convince consumers to buy these products through marketing
activities such as branding and advertising. Thus, on the surface,
the acquisition of 7Up by Philip Morris seemed to offer the potential
for Philip Morris to take its existing marketing skills and apply them
within a new industry. Unfortunately, the possible benefits to 7Up
never materialized.

Unrelated Diversification

   "Don't put all your eggs in one basket" is often a good motto for individual investors. By building a portfolio of
  stocks, an investor can minimize the chances of suffering a huge loss. Some executives take a similar approach.
  Rather than trying to develop synergy across businesses, they seek greater financial stability for their firms by
   owning an array of companies. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has long enjoyed strong performance by
purchasing companies and improving how they are run. Below we illustrate some of the different groups in their

                                                      very diversified portfolio of firms.

Why would a soft-drink company buy a movie studio? It's hard to imagine the logic behind such a move,
but Coca-Cola did just this when it purchased Columbia Pictures for $750 million. This is a good example of
unrelated diversification, which occurs when a firm enters an industry that lacks any important similarities with
the firm's existing industry or industries (Table 8.1). Luckily for Coca-Cola, its investment paid off--Columbia
was sold to Sony for $3.4 billion just seven years later.

Most unrelated diversification efforts, however, do not have happy endings. Harley-Davidson, for example,
once tried to sell Harley-branded bottled water. Starbucks tried to diversify into offering Starbucks-branded
furniture. Both efforts were disasters. Although Harley-Davidson and Starbucks both enjoy iconic brands, these
strategic resources simply did not transfer effectively to the bottled water and furniture businesses.

A different example, lighter firm Zippo tried to avoid this scenario. According to CEO Geoffrey Booth, the Zippo
lighter is viewed by consumers as a "rugged, durable, made in America, iconic" brand (Associated Press, 2011).
This brand has fueled ninety years of success for the firm. But the future of the lighter business is bleak. This
downward trend is likely to continue as smoking becomes less and less attractive in many countries. To save
their company, Zippo executives want to diversify.

In particular, Zippo wants to follow a path blazed by     Figure 8.5: The durability of Zippo's products is illustrated by
Eddie Bauer and Victorinox Swiss Army Brands Inc.         this lighter, which still works despite being made in 1968.
The rugged outdoors image of Eddie Bauer's clothing
brand has been used effectively to sell sport utility
vehicles made by Ford. The high-quality image of Swiss
Army knives has been used to sell Swiss Army-branded
luggage and watches. As of 2020, Zippo has diversified
into pocket knives, money clips, pocket flashlights, key
holders, writing instruments, and tape measures.
Trying to figure out which of these diversification
options would be winners, such as the Eddie Bauer-
edition Ford Explorer, and which would be losers, such
as Harley-branded bottled water, was a key challenge
facing Zippo executives.

                                                          Chapter 8: Selecting Corporate-Level Strategies | 203
Geographic Diversification

Firms may also diversify through expanding geographically. Big box stores such as Target and Best Buy use this
strategy. Starbucks and KFC have found success with international expansion as well as domestic expansion.
Synergy is developed in several ways. Many of the administrative functions such as logistics, procurement,
human resources, and legal can be consolidated at the corporate level, so they do not need to be duplicated at
each location. New store development is also made easier. Having already developed new stores, the firm can
establish a process that it has learned from previously establishing stores, and can implement this best practice
to efficiently build out, equip, and supply new stores.

Horizontal Integration: Mergers and Acquisitions

   Horizontal integration refers to pursuing a diversification strategy by acquiring or merging with a rival. The
term merger is generally used when two similarly sized firms are integrated into a single entity. In an acquisition,

               a larger firm purchases and absorbs a smaller firm. Examples of each are illustrated below..

                                                               Table 8.2 Horizontal Integration
                                                              Horizontal Integration Examples
 ExxonMobil is a direct descendant of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company. It was formed by the 1999 merger of
 Exxon and Mobil. As in many mergers, the new company name combines the old company names.
 Starbucks acquired competitor Seattle's Best Coffee--which had a presence in Borders Bookstores and Subway
 Restaurants--in order to target a more working-class audience without diluting the Starbucks brand.
 Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard formed Hewlett-Packard in a garage after graduating from Stanford in 1935. HP has
 pursued horizontal integration through a merger with Compaq computers and the acquisition of Palm, a digital personal
 assistant. Both failed miserably.
 DaimlerChrysler was formed in 1998 when Chrysler entered into what was billed as a "merger of equals" with Germany's
 Daimler-Benz AG. The marriage failed, with billions of dollars in losses, and Chrysler is currently owned by Italian
 automaker Fiat.
 There tend to be many of mergers in the banking industry. Recently, BB&T merged with SunTrust Banks and adopted the
 new name Truist Financial Corp.
 The merger of wireless carriers Sprint and T-Mobile combined the number three and four companies in the market. The
 new company name dropped Sprint and operates under the name T-Mobile.

Rather than rely on their own efforts, some firms try to expand their presence in an industry by acquiring
or merging with one of their rivals. This strategic move is known as horizontal integration (Table 8.2). An
acquisition takes place when one company purchases another company. Generally, the acquired company is
smaller than the firm that purchases it. A merger joins two companies into one. Mergers typically involve
similarly sized companies. Disney was much bigger than Miramax and Pixar when it joined with these firms,
thus these two horizontal integration moves are considered to be acquisitions.

Horizontal integration can be attractive for several reasons. In many cases, horizontal integration is aimed at
lowering costs by achieving greater economies of scale. This was the reasoning behind several mergers of large

204 | Chapter 8: Selecting Corporate-Level Strategies
oil companies, including BP and Amoco in 1998, Exxon and Mobil in 1999, and Chevron and Texaco in 2001.
Oil exploration and refining is expensive. Executives in charge of each of these six corporations believed that
greater efficiency could be achieved by combining forces with a former rival. Considering horizontal integration
alongside Porter's Five Forces model highlights that such moves also reduce the intensity of rivalry in an
industry and thereby make the industry more profitable.

Some purchased firms are attractive because they own strategic resources such as valuable brand names.
Acquiring Tasty Baking was appealing to Flowers Foods, for example, because the name Tastykake is well
known for quality in heavily populated areas of the northeastern United States. Some purchased firms have
market share that is attractive. Part of the motivation behind Southwest Airlines' purchase of AirTran was that
AirTran had a significant share of the airline business in cities--especially Atlanta, home of the world's busiest
airport--that Southwest had not yet entered. Rather than build a presence from nothing in Atlanta, Southwest
executives believed that buying a position was prudent.

                                               Horizontal integration can also provide access to new distribution
                                               channels. Some observers were puzzled when Zuffa, the parent
                                               company of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), purchased
                                               rival mixed martial arts (MMA) promotion Strikeforce. UFC had
                                               such a dominant position within MMA that Strikeforce seemed to
                                               add very little for Zuffa. Unlike UFC, Strikeforce had gained
                                               exposure on network television through broadcasts on CBS and its
                                               partner Showtime. Thus, acquiring Strikeforce might help Zuffa
                                               gain mainstream exposure of its product (Wagenheim, 2011).

Figure 8.6: The combination of UFC and         Despite the potential benefits of mergers and acquisitions, their

the growing popularity of mixed martial arts.  more than 60% of mergers and acquisitions erode shareholder
                                               wealth while fewer than one in six increases shareholder wealth
                                               (Henry, 2002). Some of these moves struggle because the cultures
                                               of the two companies cannot be meshed. Other acquisitions fail
                                               because the buyer pays more for a target company than that
                                               company is worth and the buyer never earns back the premium it
                                               paid.

In the end, between 70% to 90% of mergers fail, according to a Harvard Business Review study, often at huge
losses (Lakelet Capital, 2009). For example, Mattel purchased The Learning Company in 1999 for $3.6 billion and
sold it a year later for $430 million--12% of the original purchase price. Similarly, Daimler-Benz bought Chrysler
in 1998 for $37 billion. When the acquisition was undone in 2007, Daimler recouped only $1.5 billion worth
of value--a mere 4% of what it paid. Thus, executives need to be cautious when considering using horizontal
integration.

Vertical Integration Strategies

When pursuing a vertical integration strategy, a firm gets involved in new portions of the value chain (Table
8.3). This approach can be very attractive when a firm's suppliers or buyers have too much power over the
firm and are becoming increasingly profitable at the firm's expense. By entering the domain of a supplier or a
buyer, executives can reduce or eliminate the leverage that the supplier or buyer has over the firm. Considering
vertical integration alongside Porter's five forces model highlights that such moves can create greater profit
potential. Firms can pursue vertical integration on their own, such as when Apple opened stores bearing its
brand, or through a merger or acquisition, such as when eBay purchased PayPal.

In the late 1800s, Carnegie Steel Company was a pioneer in the use of vertical integration. The firm controlled
the iron mines that provided the key ingredient in steel, the coal mines that provided the fuel for steel making,
the railroads that transported raw material to steel mills, and the steel mills themselves. Having control over all
elements of the production process ensured the stability and quality of key inputs. By using vertical integration,
Carnegie Steel achieved levels of efficiency never before seen in the steel industry.

When using vertical integration, firms get involved in different elements of the value chain. This concept gets top
billing at American Apparel, a firm that describes its business model as "vertically integrated manufacturing." The

     elements of their integrated process for designing, manufacturing, wholesaling, and selling basic T-shirts,
underwear, leggings, dresses, and other clothing and accessories for men, women, children, and dogs is illustrated

                                                                         below.

                                               Table 8.3 Vertical Integration at American Apparel

                                                        American Apparel Vertical Integration
 Backward Vertical Integration -- entering a supplier's business--is evident as all clothing design is done
 in-house--often using employees as models.
 Manufacturing is conducted in an 800,000 square foot factory in downtown Los Angeles.
 Ironically, it was a Canadian named Dov Charney who founded American Apparel in 1989.
 The vertical integration process allows the company to keep pace with the fast-moving world of fashion. It takes just
 a couple of weeks to go from idea to retail floor.
 Forward Vertical Integration - American Apparel uses forward vertical integration--entering a buyer's business--by
 operating 250 plus company-owned stores worldwide.

Today, oil companies are among the most vertically integrated firms. Firms such as ExxonMobil and
ConocoPhillips can be involved in all stages of the value chain, including crude oil exploration, drilling for oil,
shipping oil to refineries, refining crude oil into products such as gasoline, distributing fuel to gas stations, and
operating gas stations.

The risk of not being vertically integrated is illustrated by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of
Mexico. Although the US government held BP responsible for the disaster, BP cast at least some of the blame on
drilling rig owner Transocean and two other suppliers: Halliburton Energy Services (which created the cement
casing for the rig on the ocean floor) and Cameron International Corporation (which had sold Transocean

206 | Chapter 8: Selecting Corporate-Level Strategies
blowout prevention equipment that failed to prevent the disaster). In April 2011, BP sued these three firms for
what it viewed as their roles in the oil spill.

Vertical integration also creates risks. Venturing into
new portions of the value chain can take a firm into
very different businesses. A lumberyard that started
building houses, for example, would find that the skills
it developed in the lumber business have very limited
value to home construction. Such a firm would be
better off selling lumber to contractors.

Vertical integration can also create complacency.

Consider, for example, a situation in which an

aluminum company is purchased by a can company.

People within the aluminum company may believe that

they do not need to worry about doing a good job          Figure 8.7: The 2010 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil

products. Some companies try to avoid this problem by     crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico.

forcing their subsidiary to compete with outside

suppliers, but this undermines the reason for purchasing the subsidiary in the first place.

Backward Vertical Integration

A backward vertical integration strategy involves a
firm moving back along the value chain and entering
a supplier's business. Some firms use this strategy
when executives are concerned that a supplier has
too much power over their firms. In the early days of
the automobile business, Ford Motor Company
created subsidiaries that provided key inputs to
vehicles such as rubber, glass, and metal. This
approach ensured that Ford would not be hurt by
suppliers holding out for higher prices or providing
materials of inferior quality.

Although backward vertical integration is usually         Figure 8.8: To ensure high quality, Ford relied heavily on
discussed within the context of manufacturing             backward vertical integration in the early days of the
                                                          automobile industry.

businesses, such as steel making and the auto

industry, this strategy is also available to firms such as Disney that compete within the entertainment sector.

ESPN is a key element of Disney's operations within the television business. Rather than depend on outside

Forward Vertical Integration

A forward vertical integration strategy involves a firm moving further down the value chain to enter a buyer's
business. Disney has pursued forward vertical integration by operating more than three hundred retail stores
that sell merchandise based on Disney's characters and movies. This allows Disney to capture profits that would
otherwise be enjoyed by another store. Each time a Frozen book bag is sold through a Disney store, the firm
makes a little more profit than it would if the same book bag were sold by a retailer such as Target.

Forward vertical integration also can be useful for neutralizing the effect of powerful buyers. Rental car
agencies are able to insist on low prices for the vehicles they buy from automakers because they purchase
thousands of cars. If one automaker stubbornly tries to charge high prices, a rental car agency can simply
buy cars from a more accommodating automaker. It is perhaps not surprising that Ford purchased Hertz
Corporation, the world's biggest rental car agency, in 1994. This ensured that Hertz would not drive too hard of a
bargain when buying Ford vehicles. By 2005, selling vehicles to rental car companies had become less important
to Ford and Ford was struggling financially. The firm then reversed its forward vertical integration strategy by
selling Hertz.

                                                            concern for eBay is that many individuals avoid eBay
                                                            because they are nervous about buying and selling
                                                            goods online with strangers. PayPal addressed this
                                                            problem by serving, in exchange for a fee, as an
                                                            intermediary between online buyers and sellers. eBay's

                                                            that their online transactions were completely
                                                            safe--eBay was now not only the place where business
                                                            took place but eBay also protected buyers and sellers
                                                            from being ripped off.

Apple's ownership of its own branded stores set the firm apart from computer makers such as Hewlett-
Packard, Dell, and Lenovo that only distribute their products through retailers like Best Buy and Office Depot.
Employees at Best Buy and Office Depot are likely to know only a little bit about each of the various brands
their store carries. In contrast, Apple's stores are popular in part because store employees are experts about
Apple products. They can therefore provide customers with accurate and insightful advice about purchases and
repairs. This is an important advantage that has been created through forward vertical integration.

Key Takeaways

     Diversification strategies involve a firm stepping beyond its existing industries and entering a
        new value chain. Generally, related diversification (entering a new industry that has important
        similarities with a firm's existing industries) is wiser than unrelated diversification (entering a
        new industry that lacks such similarities). Geographic diversification is another strategy to drive
        synergy.

     A horizontal diversification strategy involves trying to compete successfully within a single
        industry.

     Mergers and acquisitions are popular moves for executing a concentration strategy, but
        executives need to be cautious about horizontal integration because the results are often poor.

     Vertical integration occurs when a firm gets involved in new portions of the value chain. By
        entering the domain of a supplier (backward vertical integration) or a buyer (forward vertical
        integration), executives can reduce or eliminate the leverage that the supplier or buyer has over
        the firm.

Exercises

   1. Studies have shown that executives' pay increases when their firms get larger. What role, if any,
        do you think executive pay plays in diversification decisions? Is this an ethical issue?

   2. Identify a firm that has recently engaged in diversification. Search the firm's website to identify
        executives' rationale for diversifying. Do you find the reasoning to be convincing? Why or why
        not?

   3. Suppose the president of your college or university decided to merge with or acquire another
        school. What schools would be good candidates for this horizontal integration move? Would the
        move be a success?

   4. Given that so many mergers and acquisitions fail, why do you think that executives keep making
        horizontal integration moves?

   5. Identify a well-known company that does not use backward or forward vertical integration. Why
        do you believe that the firm's executives have avoided these strategies?

   6. Some universities have used vertical integration by creating their own publishing companies.
        The Harvard Business Press is perhaps the best-known example. Are there other ways that a
        university might vertically integrate? If so, what benefits might this create?

                                                                                            Chapter 8: Selecting Corporate-Level Strategies | 209

8.4 Implementing Corporate Strategy

Once a firm decides which corporate strategy to pursue, it must implement that strategy successfully. As noted
earlier, many attempts to diversify end in failure. Executing a good implementation plan successfully is key.
There are various ways that a firm can implement their corporate diversification strategy. These are:

   Internal Development
   Strategic Alliance
   Joint Venture
   Merger and Acquisition

Internal Development

When deciding what business to be in, sometimes an organization chooses internal development. Internal
development means the company develops and launches the new business themselves. To do this, the firm
should have a strong entrepreneurial orientation, as this implementation method is the same process as
starting a new business. A firm may select this method if they have sufficient resources and capabilities within
the firm or can hire the expertise and knowledge to develop this new business unit and achieve the marketing
and sales required to be successful. Internal development has been the implementation method of choice for
Apple's corporate strategy. Apple has used internal development to enter new markets. Apple moved from the
computer industry to the music industry with iPod and Apple music and then into the smartphone industry by
developing internal capabilities and resources. This is a very costly and time-intensive strategy, but as is evident
with Apple, it can be extremely lucrative and create many competitive benefits.

Strategic Alliance

A firm might implement their corporate strategy by working with another firm, even if that firm is a competitor.
A strategic alliance is a mutually beneficial relationship between two organizations, usually governed through a
contractual agreement. The firms may agree to share expertise or knowledge, resources, supply chain activities,
distribution channels, research and development, etc.. Often money changes hands as one company provides
what the other company needs. T-Mobile and Nokia entered into a strategic alliance in 2018, where for a fee,
Nokia helped T-Mobile develop its 5G network. Barnes & Noble and Starbucks have a strategic alliance whereby

                                                                                                    Chapter 8: Selecting Corporate-Level Strategies | 211
Starbucks puts their coffee shops inside of the Barnes & Noble bookstores. In all these examples, an alliance
was beneficial for both companies.

Joint Venture

Similar to a strategic alliance, two or more companies form a joint venture when they "birth" a third company,
and the joint venture partners are shared owners of the new firm. With a joint venture, a new company is always
formed. The ownership arrangement can vary as to how much each partner owns and how much each partner
has control. Typically, profits of the new company are shared according to the ownership percentages. Joint
ventures can work well, even among competitors, when each partner brings something of value to the venture
that the other partner could use. US airplane manufacturer Boeing created a joint venture with the Brazilian
aircraft manufacturer of smaller commercial jets Embraer to start a third company that will get Boeing into the
smaller passenger planes market. Boeing owns 80% of the company, and Embraer 20% (AP News, 2019).

Mergers and Acquisitions

A common method for firms to diversify is through mergers and acquisitions. A merger is between two
companies of similar size and are less common. Acquisitions occur when one company buys another. Typically,
a larger company acquires a smaller one. Mergers and acquisitions (M & A) may occur between competitors,
which reduces the competition in the market. In this situation, the M & A is an example of related diversification
and horizontal integration. T-Mobile's merger with Sprint is an example. Firms might acquire other companies
in their value chain to give them more control within the industry. Moving into their suppliers' industry
is backward integration, and buying companies in industries they sell to is forward integration. Forward
integration is illustrated by Apple establishing Apple Stores and having direct involvement in the retail market.
One way to diversify by acquisitions is through unrelated diversification. Unrelated diversification occurs when
one company purchases another company that is located in an industry the first company is not involved in.
An example of this strategy is Berkshire Hathaway owning companies in industries as diverse as insurance and
railroads.

8.5 Strategies for Getting Smaller

"In what industry or industries should our firm compete?" is the central question addressed by corporate-level
strategy. In some cases, the answer that executives arrive at involves exiting one or more industries.

Retrenchment

In the early twentieth century, many military battles were fought in a series of parallel trenches. If an attacking
army advanced enough to force a defending army to abandon a trench, the defenders would move back to the
next trench and try to refortify their position. This small retreat was preferable to losing the battle entirely.
Trench warfare inspired the business term retrenchment. Firms following a retrenchment strategy shrink one
or more of their business units. Much like an army under attack, firms using this strategy hope to make just a
small retreat rather than losing a battle for survival. It is also commonly referred to as "downsizing" or "right-
sizing."

                                                              Retrenchment is often accomplished through laying off
                                                              employees. For example, South African grocery store
                                                              chain Pick n Pay announced plans to release more than
                                                              3,000 of its estimated 36,000 workers. Just over a

                                                              Walmart's acquisition of a leading local retailer called
                                                              Massmart. Rivalry in the South African grocery
                                                              business seemed likely to become more fierce, and
                                                              Pick n Pay executives needed to cut costs for their firm
                                                              to remain competitive.

                                                              A Pick n Pay executive explained the layoffs by noting

Figure 8.10: The term retrenchment has its origins in trench  that "the decision was not taken lightly but was

France.                                                       and its employees into the future" (Chilwane, 2011). This

                                                              is a common rationale for retrenchment--by shrinking

the size of a firm, executives hope that the firm can survive as a profitable enterprise. Without becoming

smaller and more cost effective, Pick n Pay and other firms that use retrenchment can risk total failure. This

strategy was particularly evident during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020. Many organizations shrank

temporarily with hopes of surviving until the economy opened up again. Some did survive, and unfortunately,

some did not.

                                                              Chapter 8: Selecting Corporate-Level Strategies | 213
Restructuring

  Spin-offs occur when businesses create a new firm from a piece of their operations. Because some diversified
 firms are too complex for investors to understand, breaking them up can create wealth by resulting in greater
 stock market valuations. Spinning off a company also reduces management layers, which can lower costs and

            speed up decision making. Below we describe a variety of firms that were created as spin-offs.

                                                                     Table 8.4 Spin Offs

                                                                   Examples of Spin Offs
There are 17 billion of Freescale Semiconductor's chips in use around the world. The firm was spun-off from
Motorola.
Toyota started in the car business, right? Wrong. The firm was spun-off in the 1930s from Toyoda Automatic Loom
Works--a company that produced commercial weaving looms.
Delphi Automotive--an automotive parts company headquartered in Troy, Michigan--is a spin-off from General
Motors.
Guidant Corporation--a spin-off from Eli Lilly--designs and manufacturers artificial pacemakers, defibrillators, stents,
and other heart-helpful medical products.

Executives sometimes decide that bolder moves than retrenchment are needed for their firms to be successful
in the future. Divestment refers to selling off part of a firm's operations. In some cases, divestment reverses a
forward vertical integration strategy, such as when Ford sold Hertz. Divestment can also be used to reverse
backward vertical integration. General Motors (GM), for example, turned a parts supplier called Delphi
Automotive Systems Corporation from a GM subsidiary into an independent firm. This was done via a spin-off,
which involves creating a new company whose stock is owned by investors (Table 8.4). GM stockholders
received 0.69893 shares of Delphi for every share of stock they owned in GM. A stockholder who owned 100
shares of GM received 69 shares of the new company plus a small cash payment in lieu of a fractional share.

Divestment also serves as a means to undo
diversification strategies. Divestment can be especially
appealing to executives in charge of firms that have
engaged in unrelated diversification. Investors often
struggle to understand the complexity of diversified
firms, and this can result in relatively poor
performance by the stocks of such firms. This is known
as a diversification discount. Executives sometimes
attempt to unlock hidden shareholder value by
breaking up diversified companies.

Sometimes diversified companies find themselves in a      Figure 8.11: Fortune Brands hopes to unlock hidden

costs. In this case, the value of the individual businesses are worth more separately than when part of the

conglomerate. This can happen when an organization grows too large, with too many layers of management,

214 | Chapter 8: Selecting Corporate-Level Strategies
and too top heavy. This situation is called a diversification discount. General Electric is a good example of this
phenomenon. GE made everything from light bulbs, to washing machines, to jet engines, to CAT, scanners, to
large power systems, and had engaged in operating a financial institution, GE Capital, that provided loans to
companies. When the recession of 2008-2009 hit, GE Capital was left holding a lot of unpaid debt, and drove
the GE stock price down. GE began to get out of the financing business, along with a number of its other
business lines. It trimmed down to a much smaller organization that was not so complicated to manage in order
to survive.
Fortune Brands provides another good example. Surprisingly, this company does not own Fortune magazine,
but it has been involved in a diverse set of industries. The firm consisted of three businesses: spirits (including
Jim Beam and Maker's Mark), household goods (including Masterlock and Moen Faucets), and golf equipment
(including Titleist clubs and balls as well as FootJoy shoes). Fortune Brand's CEO announced a plan to separate
the three businesses to "maximize long-term value for our shareholders and to create exciting opportunities
within our businesses" (Dalal, et. al., 2011). Fortune Brands took the first step toward overcoming the
diversification discount when it reached an agreement to sell its golf business to Fila. Later plans to spin off the
home products business were announced.
Executives are sometimes forced to admit that the operations that they want to abandon have no value. If selling
off part of a business is not possible, the best option may be liquidation. This involves simply shutting down
portions of a firm's operations, often at a tremendous financial loss. GM has done this by scrapping its Geo,
Saturn, Oldsmobile, and Pontiac brands. Ford followed this approach by shutting down its Mercury brand. Such
moves are painful because massive investments are written off, but becoming "leaner and meaner" may save a
company from total ruin.

   Key Takeaway

          Executives sometimes need to reduce the size of their firms to maximize the chances of success.
             This can involve fairly modest steps such as retrenchment or more profound restructuring
             strategies.

8.6 Portfolio Planning and Corporate-Level Strategy

Executives in charge of firms involved in many different businesses must figure out how to manage such
portfolios. General Electric (GE), for example, competed in a very wide variety of industries, including financial
services, insurance, television, theme parks, electricity generation, lightbulbs, robotics, medical equipment,
railroad locomotives, and aircraft jet engines. When leading a company such as GE, executives must decide
which units to grow, which ones to shrink, and which ones to abandon.
Portfolio planning can be a useful tool. Portfolio planning is a process that helps executives assess their firms'
prospects for success within each of its industries, offers suggestions about what to do within each industry,
and provides ideas for how to allocate resources across industries. Portfolio planning first gained widespread
attention in the 1970s, and it remains a popular tool among executives today.

The Boston Consulting Group Matrix

The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Matrix is the best-known approach to portfolio planning (Table 8.5). Using
the matrix requires a firm's businesses to be categorized as high or low along two dimensions: its share of the
market and the growth rate of its industry. The BCG Matrix has four quadrants or categories:

216 | Chapter 8: Selecting Corporate-Level Strategies
 Cash Cows: High market share units within slow-       Figure 8.12: BCG Matrix
   growing industries are called cash cows. Because
   their industries have bleak prospects, profits from
   cash cows should not be invested back into cash
   cows but rather diverted to more promising
   businesses.

 Dogs: Low market share units within slow-
   growing industries are called dogs. These units
   are good candidates for divestment.

 Stars: High market share units within fast-
   growing industries are called stars. These units
   have bright prospects and thus are good
   candidates for growth.

 Question Marks: Finally, low-market-share units
   within fast-growing industries are called question
   marks. Executives must decide whether to build
   these units into stars, hold them, or to divest
   them.

Figure 8.12 shows how the BCG Matrix is laid out. The various business units that a company has are plotted on
the matrix. Once plotted, decisions can be made about the portfolio of businesses the company operates, such
as where more investment would be beneficial, and which units may be candidates to divest.

     The Boston Consulting Group matrix is the best-known approach to portfolio planning--assessing a firm's
prospects for success within the industries in which it competes. The matrix categorizes businesses as high or low
along two dimensions--the firm's market share in each industry and the growth rate of each industry. Suggestions

                                        are then offered about how to approach each industry.

To use the BCG Matrix, the company needs to know the market share for each of
its business lines and the relative growth rate. It is important to set the scales on
both axes so that the midpoints are roughly in the middle of the range of the
market share and growth rates of the business units. Once the axes are set, the
business units are plotted on the matrix relative to each other. Figure 8.14 shows
a BCG Matrix for the Coca-Cola company and its various products. Notice that
sometimes the market share axis is reversed, as it is in Figure 8.12.

Sometimes a third dimension is plotted on the BCG Matrix, using the size of the

circle. The circle sizes might represent the business units' proportion of total       Figure 8.13: Owning a puppy is

example, if a business unit in the Dog quadrant also represents 40% of the

                                                in the Cash Cow quadrant have little opportunity for

Limitations to Portfolio Planning

Although portfolio planning is a useful tool, this tool has important limitations. First, portfolio planning
oversimplifies the reality of competition by focusing on just two dimensions when analyzing a company's
operations within an industry. Many dimensions are important to consider when making strategic decisions,
not just two. Second, portfolio planning can create motivational problems among employees. For example, if

218 | Chapter 8: Selecting Corporate-Level Strategies
workers know that their firm's executives believe in the BCG Matrix and that their subsidiary is classified as
a dog, then they may give up any hope for the future. Similarly, workers within cash cow units could become
dismayed once they realize that the profits that they help create will be diverted to boost other areas of the
firm. Third, portfolio planning does not help identify new opportunities. Because this tool only deals with
existing businesses, it cannot reveal what new industries a firm should consider entering.

   Key Takeaway

          Portfolio planning is a useful tool for analyzing a firm's various business units, but this tool has
             limitations. The BCG matrix is one of the most widely used approaches to portfolio planning.

8.7 Conclusion

This chapter explains corporate-level strategy. Executives grappling with corporate-level strategy must decide
in what industry or industries their firms will compete. Many of the possible answers to this question involve
diversification, which can be related, unrelated, or geographic. Integration involves expanding into new stages
of the value chain. Backward integration occurs when a firm enters a supplier's business while forward vertical
integration occurs when a firm enters a customer's business. Firms implement their corporate diversification
strategies through internal development, strategic alliances, joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions.
Sometimes being smart about corporate-level strategy requires shrinking the firm through retrenchment or
restructuring. Finally, portfolio planning using the BCG Matrix can be useful for analyzing firms that participate
in a wide variety of industries or business lines.

   Learning Objectives

     After reading this chapter, you should be able to understand and articulate answers to the following
     questions:

         1. What are the main benefits and risks of competing in international markets?
        2. What is the "diamond model," and how does it help explain why some firms compete better in

             international markets than others?
        3. How does the CAGE framework help a firm predict its degree of success in doing business in

             another country?
        4. What are the four global strategies that firms can adopt, and what are the two pressures that

             define these strategies?
        5. What methods of entry are available to firms that seek to compete in international markets?

9.1 Introduction

International strategy is the third and final type of strategy presented in this textbook. The first, generic
business-level/competitive strategy, is how companies directly compete with rivals on their products and
services. Corporate strategy is how a firm might diversify to compete in other industries or expand
geographically to reduce risk and grow profits. In international strategy, a firm may desire to expand by
entering into new foreign markets or to lower its costs. There are advantages and opportunities when going

                                                                                                     Chapter 9: Competing in International Markets | 221
international, but it is not without risks. There are several tools that firms use to help them assess their
potential success when their strategic management process points them abroad. Firms will need to determine
which one of four international strategies will work best and which method to enter another country. Some US
companies have found great success going international, while others have struggled or failed.

9.2 Advantages and Disadvantages of Competing in International
Markets

Kia Picks Up Speed

On June 2, 2011, South Korean automaker Kia
announced plans for a major expansion of its American
production facility. Capacity at Kia Motors
Manufacturing Georgia Inc. (KMMG) was slated to
expand 20% from 300,000 to 360,000 vehicles per
year. In addition to the crossover utility vehicle
Sorento, the plant would begin making a sedan named
the Optima in September 2011. The expansion of the
plant was estimated to cost $100 million and was
expected to create 1,000 new jobs (Sands, 2011).

This ambitious growth was made possible by Kia's       Figure 9.1: Kia is enjoying accelerated growth within the
superb performance in the US market. KMMG had          global automobile industry.
started building vehicles less than two years earlier

after being constructed for a cost of $1 billion. In 2010, yearly sales in the United States climbed above 350,000

vehicles. Kia's overall share of the US market increased in 2010 for the sixteenth consecutive year. In May 2011,

Kia sold more than 48,000 cars and trucks in the United States, an increase of more than 53% from May 2010

sales levels. The Optima led the way with a whopping 210% increase in sales.

Kia was not the only beneficiary of its success. KMMG's location of West Point, Georgia, had been economically
devastated when its homegrown textile company, WestPoint Home, shut down its local factories to take
advantage of lower labor prices overseas. Following a fierce competition with towns in Mississippi, Kentucky,
and other states, West Point was selected in 2006 as the site of Kia's first US manufacturing facility. To win the
plant, state and local authorities offered Kia more than $400 million worth of incentives, including tax breaks,
free land, and infrastructure creation. This kind of governmental inducement has become commonplace when
states lure new businesses to a region. This practice is also an example of "corporate welfare."

Georgia's return on this investment included two thousand new jobs at the plant as well as hundreds of jobs at
suppliers that set up shop to support KMMG. The neighboring state of Alabama benefited from KMMG's success

222 | Chapter 9: Competing in International Markets
too. As of June 2011, nearly sixty companies spread across twenty-three Alabama counties supplied parts or
services to KMMG (Kent, 2011).

                Figure 9.2: Workers in Georgia build Cadenzass for South Korea-based Kia.

The name "Kia" means to arise or come up out of Asia (Kia, n.d.). This name is very appropriate; Kia rose from
humble beginnings as a maker of bicycle parts in 1944 to become a global player in the automobile industry.
As of 2011, Kia was producing more than 2.1 million vehicles per year in eight countries. Kias were sold in
172 countries. Kia employed more than 44,000 people and enjoyed annual revenues in excess of $20 billion.
Fellow South Korean automaker Hyundai owned just over 33% of Kia, and the two firms strengthened each
other through collaboration. When taking all of these facts into consideration, Kia's slogan--"The Power to
Surprise"--had to make its rivals wonder what surprises the Korean upstart might have in store for them next.
As Kia's experience illustrates, international business is a huge segment of the world's economic activity.
Amazingly, current projections suggest that, within a few years, the total dollar value of trade across national
borders will be greater than the total dollar value of trade within all of the world's countries combined. One
driver of the rapid growth of internal business over the past two decades has been the opening up of large
economies such as China and Russia that had been mostly closed off to outside investors.
International strategy is determining how to do business outside the borders of a firm's home country.
International business has opened up significantly in the last few decades. This has been due to lower trade
barriers, improved communications, more efficient shipping via ship and airplane, and the internet. Many
US companies have shifted their manufacturing and supply chain activities abroad, where labor is cheaper
and overall costs are reduced, even with the additional costs of shipping. The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020
illustrated some issues that emerge when an economy, such as with the US, becomes dependent on other
countries for the materials it uses for its final products. During the pandemic, the capacity for global supply
chains to meet the sharp increase in demand for paper goods, cleaning supplies, as well as for medications and
other medical equipment and supplies, was immediately strained.
International strategy for a firm can be somewhat minimal, such as procuring needed supply chain resources

                                                                                                    Chapter 9: Competing in International Markets | 223
for manufacturing a product in the home country, to an expanded role, like exporting products for sale in other
countries, to full manufacturing subsidiaries such as the Kia example in the US. There are multiple reasons why
a firm would go international, and also multiple advantages and disadvantages.

 The domestication of the camel by Arabian travelers fueled two early examples of international trade: spices and
  silk. Today, camels have been replaced by airplanes, trains, and ships, and international trade is more alluring

                  than ever. Here are three key reasons why executives are enticed to enter new markets.

                  Business risk refers to the risk of an operation failing. Competing in multiple markets allows this risk
                  to be spread out among many economies and customers. Coca-Cola, for example, has a presence in
                  over 200 markets worldwide.

The United States enjoys the world's largest economy. As an illustration of the power of the American economy,
consider that in 2018, the economy of just one state--California--was the fifth largest in the world. If it were
a country, it would rank between Germany and the United Kingdom (CBS News, 2018). The size of the US
economy has led American commerce to be very much intertwined with international markets. In fact, it is
fair to say that every business is affected by international markets to some degree. Tiny businesses such as
individual convenience stores and clothing boutiques sell products that are imported from abroad. Meanwhile,
corporate goliaths such as General Motors (GM), Coca-Cola, and Microsoft conduct a great volume of business
overseas.

Access to New Customers

Perhaps the most obvious reason to compete in international markets is gaining access to new customers.
Although the United States enjoys the largest economy in the world, it accounts for only about 5% of the world's
population. Selling goods and services to the other 95% of people on the planet can be very appealing, especially
for companies whose industry within their home market is saturated (Table 9.1).

Few companies have a stronger "All-American" identity than McDonald's. Yet McDonald's is increasingly reliant
on sales outside the United States. In 2006, the United States accounted for 34% of McDonald's revenue, while
Europe accounted for 32% and 14% was generated across Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. By 2011, Europe was
McDonald's biggest source of revenue (40%), the US share had fallen to 32%, and the collective contribution
of Asia, the Middle East, and Africa had jumped to 23%. By 2019, McDonald's US percent of total revenue had
grown to 41% (Statista, 2019). With less than half of its sales being generated in its home country, McDonald's is
truly a global powerhouse.

                                               China and India have been attractive markets to US firms. The
                                               countries are the two most populous in the world. Both nations have
                                               growing middle classes, which means they have been building
                                               infrastructures, like education and transportation systems, that
                                               support increased purchasing power. In other words, individuals in
                                               these countries can buy goods and services that are not merely
                                               necessities of life. This trend has created tremendous opportunities
                                               for some firms. In 2019, for example, GM sold more vehicles in China
                                               than it sold in the United States (3.1 million vs. 2.9 million). This gap
                                               has continued from at least 2010. (Reuters, 2020).

                                               Lowering Costs

                                               Many firms that compete in international markets hope to gain cost

                                               many businesses to purchase supplies in greater numbers. This can

provide a firm with stronger leverage when negotiating prices with its suppliers.

Offshoring has become a popular yet controversial means for trying to reduce costs. Offshoring involves
relocating a business activity to another country. Many American companies have closed down operations at
home in favor of creating new operations in countries such as China and India that offer cheaper labor. While
offshoring can reduce a firm's costs of doing business, the job losses in the firm's home country can devastate
local communities. For example, West Point, Georgia, lost approximately 16,000 jobs in the 1990s and 2000s
as local textile factories were shut down in favor of offshoring (Copeland, 2010). Fortunately for the town, Kia's
decision to locate its first US factory in West Point has improved the economy in the past few years. In another
example, Fortune Brands saved $45 million a year by relocating several factories to Mexico, but the employee
count in just one of the affected US plants dropped from 1,160 to 350.

A growing number of US companies are finding that offshoring is not providing the benefits they had expected.
This has led to a new phenomenon known as reshoring, whereby jobs that had been sent overseas are
returning home. In some cases, the quality provided by workers overseas is not good enough. Carbonite, a
seller of computer backup services, found that its call center in Boston was providing much stronger customer
satisfaction than its call center in India. The Boston operation's higher rating was attained even though it
handled the more challenging customer complaints. As a result, Carbonite shifted 250 call center jobs back to
the United States.

                Figure 9.4: Concerns about customer service are leading some American firms to shift their call centers
                back to the United States.

In other cases, the expected cost savings have not materialized. NCR had been making ATMs and self-service
checkout systems in China, Hungary, and Brazil. These machines can weigh more than a ton, and NCR found
that shipping them from overseas plants back to the United States was extremely expensive. NCR hired 500
workers to start making the ATMs and checkout systems at a plant in Columbus, Georgia, adding 370 more jobs
(Isidore, 2011). Similarly, Apple, General Motors, Boeing, and Ford had brought back thousands of jobs each to
the US from abroad by 2019 (Monroe Engineering, 2018).

Diversification of Business Risk

A familiar clich warns "don't put all of your eggs in one basket." Applied to business, this clich suggests that
it is dangerous for a firm to operate in only one country. Business risk refers to the potential that an operation
might fail. If a firm is completely dependent on one country, negative events in that country could ruin the firm.
Just like spreading one's eggs into multiple baskets reduces the chances that all eggs will be broken, business
risk is reduced when a firm is involved in multiple countries.
Consider, for example, natural disasters such as the earthquakes and tsunami that hit Japan in 2011. If Japanese
automakers such as Toyota, Nissan, and Honda sold cars only in their home country, the financial consequences
could have been grave. Because these firms operate in many countries, however, they were protected from
being ruined by events in Japan. In other words, these firms diversified their business risk by not being overly
dependent on their Japanese operations.

American cigarette companies such as Philip Morris
and R. J. Reynolds are challenged by trends within the
United States and Europe. Tobacco use in these areas
is declining as more laws are passed that ban smoking
in public areas and in restaurants. In response,
cigarette makers are attempting to increase their
operations within countries where smoking remains
popular to remain profitable over time.

For example, Philip Morris spent $5.2 billion to

purchase a controlling interest in Indonesian cigarette

maker Sampoerna. This was the biggest acquisition

ever in Indonesia by a foreign company. Tapping into

the fifth-largest tobacco market in the world, trailing only China, the United States, Russia, and Japan. To appeal

to local preferences for cigarettes flavored with cloves, Philip Morris introduced a variety of its signature

Marlboro brand called Marlboro Mix 9 that includes cloves in its formulation (The Two Malcontents, 2007).

The use of PESTEL can be a valuable tool in assessing the risk for a firm considering international
diversification. Analyzing the industry within the target country could provide valuable insights on whether to
enter that market or not. For example, if Apple were to consider shifting some of its product manufacturing to
India, what do the PESTEL forces reveal for the Indian IT industry?

                Figure 9.6: Entering New Markets: Worth the Risk?

Political Risk

Although competing in international markets offers important potential benefits, such as access to new
customers, the opportunity to lower costs, and the diversification of business risk, going overseas also poses
daunting challenges. Political risk refers to the potential for government upheaval or interference with
business to harm an operation within a country (Figure 9.1). For example, the term "Arab Spring" has been
used to refer to a series of uprisings in 2011 within countries such as Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Bahrain, Syria, and
Yemen. Unstable governments associated with such demonstrations and uprisings make it difficult for firms
to plan for the future. Over time, a government could become increasingly hostile to foreign businesses by
imposing new taxes and new regulations. In extreme cases, a firm's assets in a country are seized by the national
government. This process is called nationalization. In recent years, for example, Venezuela has nationalized
foreign-controlled operations in the oil, cement, steel, and glass industries. US oil companies were expelled
from the country.

Countries with the highest levels of political risk tend to be those whose governments are so unstable that few
foreign companies are willing to enter them because of the potential for physical violence and harm to life or
property. High levels of political risk are also present, however, in several of the world's important emerging
economies, including India, the Philippines, and Indonesia. This creates a dilemma for firms in that these risky
settings also offer enormous growth opportunities. Firms can choose to concentrate their efforts in countries

228 | Chapter 9: Competing in International Markets
such as Canada, Australia, South Korea, and Japan that have very low levels of political risk, but opportunities in
such settings are often more modest (Kostigen, 2011).

Economic Risk

Economic risk refers to the potential for a country's economic conditions and

policies, property rights protections, and currency exchange rates to harm a firm's

operations within a country. Executives who lead companies that do business in

many different countries have to take stock of these various dimensions and try to   Figure 9.7: President Hugo
anticipate how the dimensions will affect their companies. Because economies are     Chavez of Venezuela
unpredictable, economic risk presents executives with tremendous challenges.         nationalized the oil industry,
                                                                                     expelling US oil companies.

                                         Consider, for example, Kia's operations in

                                         Europe., Kia reported increased sales in ten European countries relative

                                         to the prior year. The firm enjoyed a 62% year-to-year increase in

                                         Slovakia, 58% in Austria, 50% in Gibraltar, 49% in Sweden, 43% in Poland,

                                         24% in Germany, 21% in the United Kingdom, 13% in the Czech Republic,

                                         6% in Belgium, and 3% in Italy (Kia, 2020). As Kia's executives planned for

                                         the future, they needed to wonder how economic conditions would

                                         difficult for consumers to purchase new Kias. If currency exchange rates

were to change such that the euro became weaker relative to the South Korean won, this would make a Kia

more expensive for European buyers.

Cultural Risk

Cultural risk refers to the potential for a company's operations in a country to struggle because of differences
in language, customs, norms, and customer preferences (Table 9.2). The history of business is full of colorful
examples of cultural differences undermining companies. For example, a laundry detergent company was
surprised by its poor sales in the Middle East. Executives believed that their product was being skillfully
promoted using print advertisements that showed dirty clothing on the left, a box of detergent in the middle,
and clean clothing on the right. A simple and effective message, right? Not exactly. Unlike English and other
Western languages, the languages used in the Middle East, such as Hebrew and Arabic, involve reading from
right to left. To consumers, the implication of the detergent ads was that the product could be used to take
clean clothes and make them dirty. Not surprisingly, few boxes of the detergent were sold before this cultural
blunder was discovered.

                                         Chapter 9: Competing in International Markets | 229
   The phrase "When in Rome, do as the Romans do" is used to encourage travelers to embrace local customs. An
 important part of fitting in is avoiding behaviors that locals consider offensive. Below we illustrate a number of

     activities that would go largely unnoticed in the United States but could raise concerns in other countries.

                                                          Table 9.3 Cultural Risk: When in Rome
                                                                  Examples of Cultural Risk

 If you want to signal "Check please!" to catch the attention of your garon in France and Belgium, remember that
 snapping your fingers is vulgar there.

 Provocative dress is embraced by many Americans, but many people in Muslim countries consider a woman's clothing
 to be inappropriate if it reveals anything besides the face and hands.

 Do you pride yourself on your punctuality? You may be wasting your time in Latin American countries, where the
 locals tend to be about 20 minutes behind schedule.
 Do not eat with your left hand in India or Malaysia. That hand is associated with unclean activities reserved for the
 bathroom.
 In many Asian and Arabian countries, showing the sole of your shoe is considered rude.
 If everything is OK when you're in Brazil, avoid making the "OK" hand signal. It's the equivalent to giving someone the
 middle finger.
 Do not clean your plate in China. Leaving food on the plate indicates the host was so generous that the meal could not
 be finished.
 In Japan, direct eye contact is viewed as impolite.

A refrigerator manufacturer experienced poor sales in the Middle East because of another cultural difference.
The firm used a photo of an open refrigerator in its print ads to demonstrate the large amount of storage
offered by the appliance. Unfortunately, the photo prominently featured pork, a type of meat that is not eaten
by the Jews and Muslims who make up most of the area's population (Ricks, 1993). To get a sense of consumers'
reactions, imagine if you saw a refrigerator ad that showed meat from a horse or a dog. You would likely be
disgusted. In some parts of the world, however, horse and dog meat are accepted parts of diets. Firms must
take cultural differences such as these into account when competing in international markets.

Cultural differences can cause problems even when the cultures involved are very similar and share the
same language. RecycleBank is an American firm that specializes in creating programs that reward people
for recycling, similar to airlines' frequent-flyer programs. When RecycleBank expanded its operations into the
United Kingdom, executives at RecycleBank became offended when the British press referred to RecycleBank's
rewards program as a "scheme." Their concern was unwarranted, however. The word scheme implies sneakiness
when used in the United States, but a scheme simply means a service in the United Kingdom (Maltby, 2010).
Differences in the meaning of English words between the United States and the United Kingdom are also vexing
(Table 9.4).

230 | Chapter 9: Competing in International Markets
    Cultural differences rooted in language--even across English-speaking countries--can affect how firms do
                                    business internationally. Below we provide a few examples.
                                                              Table 9.4 Watch Your Language
                                                             Cultural Differences in Language

Book and movie titles are often changed in different markets to appeal to different cultural sensibilities. For example,
British author J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was changed to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's
Stone in the United States because of the belief that American children would find a philosopher to be boring.
Moms in the states can be seen walking with strollers in their neighborhoods, while "mums" in Ireland and the United
Kingdom keep their children moving in a buggy.
In India, you are more likely to hear "no problem" than "no" as Indian nationals avoid the disappointment associated with
using the word no.
The area of a car called a trunk in America is known as the boot in England.
Wondering what it means when a British friend asks, "What's under your bonnet?" Open the hood of your car to offer an
answer.
While Americans look for a flashlight when power goes out, a torch is the preferred term for those outside of North
America.
Urban legend says that the Chevrolet Nova did not do well in Spanish speaking countries because the name translates as
"no go." The truth is that the car sold well in both Mexico and Venezuela.

  Key Takeaway

         Competing in international markets involves important opportunities and daunting threats. The
            opportunities include access to new customers, lowering costs, and diversification of business
            risk. The threats include political risk, economic risk, and cultural risk.

9.3 CAGE Framework

Doing business abroad is fraught with peril. Even Target failed when it opened stores in Canada--a move that
one would think was easy. A firm must assess the risks and the likelihood of success before taking the leap. One
way to do this is to analyze the political, economic, and cultural risks discussed earlier in this chapter. Another
tool to assist in this evaluation is the CAGE framework.

The CAGE framework (Mariadoss, 2017) helps a firm gauge the distance that the target country is from the firm's
home country on four dimensions. The greater the distance or difference, the more risk exists and the less
opportunity there is for success.

The four CAGE dimensions are:

   Cultural Distance
   Administrative Distance
   Geographic Distance
   Economic Distance

Cultural Distance: This refers to the differences of cultures between the target and home countries. The
history of relationships between nations provides one source of explanation for the closeness (similarity) or
distance (difference) between cultures. For instance, many countries suffered under the domination of imperial
rule during colonial times with effects that are evident in their contemporary culture and influencing national
relationships. For example, as a former colony of Great Britain, there is a smaller cultural distance between
the US and the United Kingdom than there is between the US and Spain. However, this is not always the case.
Western European countries have a significant cultural distance with many Asian countries despite having
colonized many of those same territories. Therefore, history provides a partial insight into cultural distance.

Societal customs and values also play a key role in cultural distance. Language differences also increase or
decrease cultural distance. At first glance, it would appear that the US and India would have a large cultural
distance, but this is reduced because much of business in India is conducted in English, and both countries
were colonies of Great Britain.

Administrative Distance: The legal and political systems of the home and target countries determine the
administrative distance between the two. In countries where the political systems are different, for example,
democracy versus communism, there is a greater distance and more uncertainty. Different laws between
countries can make compliance and doing business more difficult. For example, in some countries, laws
governing contract compliance are not enforced. In some nations if a buyer fails to make payment for
purchases, the seller can sue, but it may take years before a court will even hear the case. Also, labor laws
can be quite different among nations. In the Dominican Republic, for instance, companies are required to pay
employees a thirteenth month of salary at the end of the year, as a bonus. Alternatively, some nations protect
the civil rights of people who fall within protected categories in the US (e.g., age, race, sex, class, gender, sexual
orientation, etc.), but other nations may not. This raises particularly tricky questions for firms who must abide
by US laws, but seek to expand abroad,

234 | Chapter 9: Competing in International Markets
Geographic Distance: The literal physical distance between the home and target country are a key
consideration of this dimension. The more miles the countries are apart, the longer and more costly it is to
go there or to ship from one to the other. But mileage is not the only factor. The ease of communication
between countries is another. Advances in telephone and internet communications have made this almost a
non-issue in most countries. However, when two countries are twelve time zones apart, like the US and China,
communication can be hampered when work schedules are twelve hours out of sync. Geographic distance
can also be affected by the infrastructure of a country in other ways other than communication and internet
capabilities. For example, Haiti is physically close to the US, but its lack of adequate port facilities make it a poor
target for outsourcing manufacturing.

Economic Distance: International business between two countries is also impacted by the differences in their
economic factors. The greater the differences in the two economies, the more difficult it is to be successful.
One way to measure the difference is by GDP per capita. Countries with a similar GDP per capita have a
greater opportunity for success. If the purchasing power and disposable income of the target country are quite
different from the home country, working in the target country is more challenging.

Suppose Chipotle believes there are great opportunities if they go international. Executives have narrowed
the countries down to two--Canada and Spain. Canada made the list because they are close and more like the
US. But Spain has 10 million more inhabitants, is not spread out like Canada is, and Spaniards should have
a great attraction to Chipotle's menu, since it's Mexican cuisine. The CAGE framework can be used to help
make a decision. The four dimensions for each country are measured on a 10 point scale, with the higher
numbers indicating greater distance. Therefore, the country with the lower score is the better choice. Table 9.5
illustrates the process.

                                      Table 9.5 Using the CAGE Framework: Canada vs Spain for Chipotle

           C                                   A                      G                             E      Total

       food                           different                difference.

As can be seen from the CAGE scores, the Chipotle executives' hunches about Spain proved incorrect, and
Canada is the best location to first go international.

                                                               Chapter 9: Competing in International Markets | 235

   Key Takeaway

          Success with implementing an international strategy starts with selecting the correct country to
             enter. Using the CAGE framework allows a firm to compare target countries to help make this
             critical decision. Understanding the distance between the home country and the target country
             as it relates to differences in culture, administrative functions, geographic barriers, and
             economic disparities will assist the firm in making the best decision.

   Exercises

         1. Tesla wants to explore going into Europe or South America, and has narrowed down the
             countries to Germany or Chile. Use the CAGE framework to decide which would be the better
             choice.

        2. Divide up into groups of 4 or 8 and discuss some of the cultural differences that exist across
             countries that cultural distance shows should be taken into consideration. Report out.

9.4 Types of International Strategies

A firm that has operations in more than one country is known as a multinational corporation (MNC). The
largest MNCs are major players within the international arena. Walmart's annual worldwide sales, for example,
are larger than the dollar value of the entire economies of Austria, Norway, and Saudi Arabia. Although Walmart
tends to be viewed as an American retailer, the firm earns 35% of its revenues outside the United States.
Walmart owns significant numbers of stores in Mexico, Central America, Brazil, Japan, the United Kingdom,
Canada, Chile, Botswana, and Argentina. Walmart also participates in joint ventures in China and India. Even
more modestly sized MNCs are still very powerful. If Kia were a country, its current sales level of approximately
$21 billion would place it in the top 100 among the more than 180 nations in the world.
Multinationals such as Kia and Walmart must choose an international strategy to guide their efforts in various
countries. There are four main international strategies available:

 1. International
2. Multi-domestic
3. Global
4. Transnational
(Figure 9.2). Each strategy involves a different approach to trying to be sensitive to (1) costs and efficiencies on
one hand and trying to be responsive to (2) variation in customer preferences and market conditions across
nations. Responding or not responding to these two pressures of cost and local cultural conditions determines
which of the four types of international strategies will be pursued.

                                                                                                    Chapter 9: Competing in International Markets | 237
                                           International Strategy

                                           Firms pursuing an international strategy are neither

                                           concerned about costs nor adapting to the local

                                           cultural conditions. They attempt to sell their products

                                           internationally with little to no change. When Harley

                                           Davidson sells motorcycles abroad, they do not need to

                                           lower their prices or adapt the bike to local motorcycle

                                           standards. People in other countries buy a Harley

                                           particularly because it is different from the local

                                           motorcycles. Buyers want the American look and the

                                           sound and power of a Harley, and will pay for that

                                           differentiation. Belgium chocolate exporters do not

                                           lower their price when exporting to the American

                                           market to compete with Hershey's, nor do they adapt

                                           international strategy. Starbucks and Rolex watches

are other examples of firms pursuing the international strategy.

Multi-Domestic Strategy

A firm using a multi-domestic strategy does not focus on cost or efficiency but emphasizes responsiveness to
local requirements within each of its markets. Rather than trying to force all of its American-made shows on
viewers around the globe, Netflix customizes the programming that is shown on its channels within dozens
of countries, including New Zealand, Portugal, Pakistan, and India. Similarly, food company H. J. Heinz adapts
its products to match local preferences. Because some Indians will not eat garlic and onion, for example,
Heinz offers them a version of its signature ketchup that does not include these two ingredients. Outback
Steakhouse uses the multi-domestic strategy in the multiple countries where it operates, adapting to local
eating preferences but not lowering prices significantly.

                              Figure 9.10: Baked beans flavored with curry? This H. J. Heinz product is very
                              popular in the United Kingdom.
238 | Chapter 9: Competing in International Markets
Global Strategy

A firm using a global strategy sacrifices responsiveness to local requirements within each of its markets in favor
of emphasizing lower costs and better efficiency. This strategy is the complete opposite of a multi-domestic
strategy. Some minor modifications to products and services may be made in various markets, but a global
strategy stresses the need to gain low costs and economies of scale by offering essentially the same products
or services in each market.
Microsoft, for example, offers the same software programs around the world but adjusts the programs to match
local languages. Similarly, consumer goods maker Procter & Gamble attempts to gain efficiency by creating
global brands whenever possible. Global strategies also can be very effective for firms whose product or service
is largely hidden from the customer's view, such as silicon chip maker Intel. Lenovo also uses this strategy. For
such firms, variance in local preferences is not very important, but pricing is.

Transnational Strategy

A firm using a transnational strategy seeks a middle ground between a multi-domestic strategy and a global
strategy. Such a firm tries to balance the desire for lower costs and efficiency with the need to adjust to local
preferences within various countries. For example, large fast-food chains such as McDonald's and Kentucky
Fried Chicken (KFC) rely on the same brand names and the same core menu items around the world. These
firms make some concessions to local tastes too. In France, for example, wine can be purchased at McDonald's.
This approach makes sense for McDonald's because wine is a central element of French diets. In Saudi Arabia,
McDonalds serves a McArabia Chicken sandwich, and its breakfast menu features no pork products like ham,
bacon, or sausage.

   Key Takeaway

          Multinational corporations choose from among four basic international strategies: (1)
             international (2) multi-domestic, (3) global, and (4) transnational. These strategies vary
             depending on two pressures; 1) on emphasizing low cost and efficiency and 2) responding to the
             local culture and needs.

9.5 Drivers of Success and Failure When Competing in International
Markets

The title of a book written by newspaper columnist Thomas Friedman attracted a great deal of attention when
the book was released in 2005. In The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the 21st Century, Friedman argued that
technological advances and increased interconnectedness is leveling the competitive playing field between
developed and emerging countries. This means that companies exist in a "flat world" because economies
across the globe are converging on a single integrated global system (Friedman, 2005). For executives, a key
implication is that a firm being based in a particular country is ceasing to be an advantage or disadvantage.

While Friedman's notion of business becoming a flat world is flashy and attention grabbing, it does not match
reality. Research studies conducted since 2005 have found that some firms enjoy advantages based on their
country of origin while others suffer disadvantages. A powerful framework for understanding how likely it
is that firms based in a particular country will be successful when competing in international markets was
provided by Professor Michael Porter of the Harvard Business School (Porter, 1990). The framework is formally
known as "the determinants of national advantage," but it is often referred to more simply as "the diamond
model" because of its shape (Table 9.6).

 Diamonds may be a country's best friend. Around half of the world's diamonds are mined in South Africa, giving
  that country a unique advantage in the global diamond industry. Porter's Determinants of National Advantage

   (often referred to as the diamond model) includes four key dimensions that help explain why firms located in
                           certain countries are more successful than others in particular industries.

Strategy, Structure,             Table 9.6 Porter's Diamond Model of National Advantage
and Rivalry           The United States has an overall trade deficit, but it enjoys a trade surplus within the service
                      sector. Fierce domestic competition in industries such as hotels and restaurants has helped make
Factor Conditions     American firms such as Marriott and Subway important players on the world stage.
                      The inputs present in a country shape a firm's global competitiveness. The rapid growth of
Demand Conditions     Chinese manufacturers has been fueled by the availability of cheap labor.
                      Fussy domestic customers help firms prepare for the global arena. Japanese firms must create
Related and           excellent goods to meet Japanese consumers' high expectations about quality, aesthetics, and
Supporting            reliability.
Industries            Firms benefit when their domestic suppliers and other complementary industries are developed
                      and helpful. Italy's fashion industry is enhanced by the abundance of fine Italian leather and
                      well-known designers.

According to the model, the ability of the firms in an industry whose origin is in a particular country (e.g., South
Korean automakers or Italian shoemakers) to be successful in the international arena is shaped by four factors:

1. Their home country's demand conditions
2. Their home country's factor conditions
3. Related and supporting industries within their home country
4. Strategy, structure, and rivalry among their domestic competitors

                      Chapter 9: Competing in International Markets | 241
Demand Conditions

Within the diamond model, demand conditions refer to
the nature of domestic customers (Table 9.7). It is
tempting to believe that firms benefit when their
domestic customers are perfectly willing to purchase
inferior products. This would be a faulty belief! Instead,
firms benefit when their domestic customers have
high expectations.

Japanese consumers are known for insisting on very          Figure 9.11: Japanese firms must deliver very high quality to
high levels of quality, aesthetics, and reliability.        meet the expectations of Japanese consumers.
Japanese automakers such as Honda, Toyota, and
Nissan reap rewards from this situation. These firms
have to work hard to satisfy their domestic buyers.
Living up to lofty quality standards at home prepares
these firms to offer high-quality products when
competing in international markets. In contrast,
French car buyers do not stand out as particularly
fussy. It is probably not a coincidence that French
automakers Renault and Peugeot have struggled to
gain traction within the global auto industry.

 Within the diamond model, demand conditions refer to the nature of domestic customers. Below we provide
examples from the worldwide auto industry that illustrate how domestic customers influence firms' ability to

                                                       compete in the global arena.

                                                                Table 9.7 Demand Conditions
                                                                Demand Condition Examples
Japanese consumers insist on very high levels of quality, aesthetics, and reliability. This forces Honda, Toyota, and Nissan
to rise to a difficult challenge as well as preparing them to dominate internationally.
Because French car buyers are not particularly picky, Renault and Peugeot have not been forced to excel in their home
market. Not surprisingly, they have struggled to gain traction within the global auto industry.
Germans place value on the concept of fahrvergngen, which means "driving pleasure." Customers around the globe
experience driving pleasure when purchasing cars from BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, and Volkswagen.
The Italian fascination with styling is evident in luxury car brands such as Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Lamborghini, and
Maserati.
To many Americans, bigger is better. This attitude is captured in the large SUVs like the Suburban. When gas prices go
down, sales of these hunkers go up.

Demand conditions also help to explain why German automakers such as Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW
create excellent luxury and high-performance vehicles. German consumers value superb engineering. While a
car is simply a means of transportation in some cultures, Germans place value on the concept of
fahrvergngen, which means "driving pleasure." Meanwhile, demand for fast cars is high in Germany because

242 | Chapter 9: Competing in International Markets
the country has built nearly eight thousand miles of superhighways known as autobahns. No speed limits for
cars are enforced on more than half of the eight thousand miles. Many Germans enjoy driving at 150 miles per
hour or more, and German automakers must build cars capable of safely reaching and maintaining such
speeds. When these companies compete in the international arena, the engineering and performance of their
vehicles stand out.

Factor Conditions

Factor conditions refer to the nature of raw material and other inputs that firms need to create goods and
services (Table 9.8). Examples include land, labor, capital markets, and infrastructure. Firms benefit when they
have good access to factor conditions and face challenges when they do not. Companies based in the United
States, for example, are able to draw on plentiful natural resources, a skilled labor force, highly developed
transportation systems, and sophisticated capital markets to be successful. The dramatic growth of Chinese
manufacturers in recent years has been fueled in part by the availability of cheap labor.

 The factor conditions in a country serve as the basic building blocks of doing business within the country. Below
are examples of how important factor conditions have provided competitive advantages for firms based in certain

                                                                different countries.

Land                                                    Table 9.8 Factor Conditions
                 Russia has the greatest land mass of any country in the world and it enjoys vast oil deposits. This
Labor            abundance of natural resources has helped Russia's petroleum industry become one of the largest in
                 the world.
Capital          India is the seventh largest country in terms of land mass, but its population size is second only to
Entrepreneurial  China. Because India graduates more English speakers annually than the United States, it should come
Ability          as no surprise that Indian firms have gained ground in the international arena within industries that
                 rely on engineering and computer skills.
                 The capital market in the United States is one of the largest and most sophisticated in the world. This
                 has helped American companies fund expansion and innovation over time, making them better
                 prepared for international competition.
                 Entrepreneurial ability creates national wealth when entrepreneurs develop new innovations that
                 support key industries. Denmark's low start-up costs and high research and development spending
                 have fueled success in industries such as pharmaceuticals and medical equipment.

In some cases, overcoming disadvantages in factor conditions leads companies to develop unique skills. Japan is
a relatively small island nation with little room to spare. This situation has led Japanese firms to be pioneers in
the efficient use of warehouse space through systems such as just-in-time inventory management (JIT). Rather
than storing large amounts of parts and material, JIT management conserves space--and lowers costs--by
requiring inputs to a production process to arrive at the moment they are needed. Their use of JIT management
has given Japanese manufacturers an advantage when they compete in international markets.

                Figure 9.12: American furniture makers benefit from the abundance of high-quality lumber in the
                United States.

Related and Supporting Industries

The Beatles' legendary songwriting team of Lennon and McCartney once wrote that they got by "with a little help
from my friends." In Porter's diamond model, the presence of strong friends in the form of related and supporting

     industries is one of the keys to national advantage. We provide examples of American industries that excel
                                   internationally due in part to help from supporting industries.

                                                      Table 9.9 Related and Supporting Industries
                                                             Related and Supporting Industries

 A very strong agriculture business helps support the cattle industry--which accounted for approximately $8.33 billion
 dollars worth of exports in 2018.
 Excellent steel makers and engine manufacturers support the production of one of America's most lucrative
 exports--commercial aircraft.
 The pharmaceutical industry benefits from the research skills possessed by university-affiliated hospitals.
 America's excellent performing arts schools such as the Juilliard School cultivate the talents of world-famous American
 performers.

Could Italian shoemakers create some of the world's best shoes if Italian leather makers were not among the
world's best? Possibly, but it would be much more difficult. The concept of related and supporting industries
refers to the extent to which firms' domestic suppliers and other complementary industries are developed and
helpful (Table 9.9). Italian shoemakers such as Salvatore Ferragamo, Prada, Gucci, and Versace benefit from
the availability of top-quality leather within their home country. If these shoemakers needed to rely on
imported leather, they would lose flexibility and speed.

244 | Chapter 9: Competing in International Markets
The auto industry is a setting where related and

supporting industries are very important. Electronics

are key components of modern vehicles. South Korean

automakers Kia and Hyundai can leverage the excellent

electronics provided by South Korean firms Samsung

and LG. Similarly, Honda, Nissan, and Toyota are able

to draw on the skills of Sony and other Japanese

electronics firms. Unfortunately, for French

automakers Renault and Peugeot, no French

electronics firms are standouts in the international

arena. This situation makes it difficult for Renault and

Peugeot to integrate electronics into their vehicles as

effectively as their South Korean and Japanese rivals.    Figure 9.13: Fine Italian shoes, such as those found at the

supporting industries can undermine an operation.

Otabo LLC, a small custom shoe company, was forced to shut down its Florida factory as it struggled to find

technicians that had the skills needed to fix its shoe making machines. Meanwhile, there are very few suppliers

of shoelaces, soles, eyelets, and other components in the United States because about 99% of the shoes

purchased in the United States are imported, mostly from China. The few available suppliers were unwilling to

create the small batches of customized materials that Otabo wanted. In the end, the American factory simply

could not get access to many of the supplies needed to create shoes (Aeppel, 2008). Production was shifted to

China, where all the needed supplies can be found easily and cheaply.

Firm Strategy, Structure, and Rivalry

  The concept of firm strategy, structure, and rivalry within the diamond model refers to how challenging it is to
    survive domestic competition. When domestic competition is fierce, the survivors are well prepared for the

 international arena. Below we offer examples of some of the most renowned exports that have resulted from the
                                                 intense competition in domestic markets.

                                                          Chapter 9: Competing in International Markets | 245

                                                                Successful Export Examples

Cuban cigar brands such as Chiba are treasured by cigar aficionados around the globe. Despite US trade sanctions,
cigars remain a leading export from Cuba.
Belgian firms produce over 200 million tons of chocolate each year. Brands that prosper despite this domestic
competition stand out when they compete overseas.
Say "domo arigato" (Thank you very much) to the Japanese electronics industry, where competitors Seiko, Sony, Hitachi,
and others push each other to bring smiles to the faces of consumers wanting a new watch, camera, video game system,
or robot.
Over one million weavers work in Iran's Persian rug industry. Part of the magic behind these world-famous carpets is
that excellence is needed in order to fly above a crowded domestic market.
German breweries produce over five thousand brands of beer. With this high level of domestic rivalry, it is not surprising
that German beers excel worldwide.
US movie studios have collectively dominated the global scene since the days of Charlie Chaplin and other silent-film
stars.

The concept of firm strategy, structure, and rivalry refers to how challenging it is to survive domestic
competition (Table 9.10). The Olympics offer a good analogy for illustrating the positive aspects of very
challenging domestic situations. If the competition to make a national team in gymnastics is fierce, the
gymnasts who make the team will have been pushed to stretch their abilities and performance. In contrast,
gymnasts who faced few contenders in their quest to make a national team will not have been tested with the
same level of intensity. When the two types meet at the Olympics, the gymnasts who overcame huge hurdles
to make their national teams are likely to have an edge over athletes from countries with few skilled gymnasts.

                                                                Companies that have survived intense rivalry within

                                                                their home markets are likely to have developed

                                                                strategies and structures that will facilitate their

                                                                success when they compete in international markets.

                                                                Hyundai and Kia had to keep pace with each other

                                                                within the South Korean market before expanding

                                                                overseas. The leading Japanese automakers, Honda,

                                                                Nissan, and Toyota, have had to compete not only with

                                                                one another but also with smaller yet still potent

market. However, the lack of being pushed by rivals will likely mean that the firm struggles to reach its potential

in creativity and innovation. This undermines the firm's ability to compete overseas and makes it vulnerable to

foreign entry into its home market. Because neither Renault nor Peugeot has been a remarkable innovator

historically, these French automakers have enjoyed fairly gentle domestic competition. Once the auto industry

became a global competition, however, these firms found themselves trailing their Asian rivals.

   Key Takeaway

          The likelihood that a firm will succeed when it competes in international markets is shaped by
             four aspects of its domestic market: (1) demand conditions; (2) factor conditions; (3) related and
             supporting industries; and (4) strategy, structure, and rivalry among its domestic competitors.

9.6 Options for Competing in International Markets

French philosopher Michel de Montaigne once quipped that marriage is "a market which has nothing free but the
entrance." When trying to match their goods and services with the promise of love from a new market, executives

        have multiple entry options--but they should carefully consider each, lest the romance be short-lived.

Exporting                                     Table 9.11 Market Entry Options
                    Exporting involves creating goods at home and then shipping them to another country. Civilian
                    aircraft are a top-ten US export to countries such as Japan, China, Germany, Italy, and France
                    that want to make their skies friendlier for travel.

Licensing           Licensing involves granting a foreign company the right to create a company's product in
Franchising         exchange for a fee. This option is frequently used in manufacturing industries, such as when
Joint Venture       Coca-Cola licenses their secret formulas to local bottlers (without revealing the formulas, of
                    course).
                    Franchising involves "renting" a firm's brand name and business processes to local
                    entrepreneurs. Curves International has used franchising to bulk up its fitness empire to
                    include over thirty countries.
                    In a joint venture, two or more organizations each contribute to the creation of a new entity. In
                    a strategic alliance, firms work together cooperatively without forming a new organization.
                    Global Nuclear Fuel Co.--a collaboration among General Electric, Toshiba Corporation, and
                    Hitachi Limited--is an example of a joint venture.

Acquisition/Wholly  Acquisition/wholly owned subsidiary is when a firm acquires a business operation in a foreign
owned Subsidiary    country. The firm fully owns the acquired company. Intel established IPLS--a wholly owned
                    subsidiary in Ireland--to facilitate and manage its research throughout the "Emerald Isle."
                    Smithfield Foods, the world's largest producer of pork products and located in Virginia, was
                    acquired by a Chinese company for nearly $5 million.

Greenfield/Wholly   Greenfield/wholly owned subsidiary is when a company enters a foreign country and buys
owned subsidiary    property and constructs their business. This could be a manufacturer building a plant, or a
                    retailer building a store, as opposed to acquiring an existing one. BMW used this approach to
                    build its car manufacturing plant in South Carolina.

When the executives in charge of a firm decide to enter a new country, they must decide how to enter the
country. There are six basic options available: (1) exporting, (2) licensing, (3) franchising, (4) creating a joint
venture or strategic alliance (5) acquisition/creating a wholly owned subsidiary, and (6) greenfield/wholly
owned subsidiary (Table 9.11). These options vary in terms of how much control a firm has over its operation,
how much risk is involved, and what share of the operation's profits the firm gets to keep.

It is important to note that these options are not exclusively for implementing international strategy. As
discussed in Chapter 8, all but exporting are also methods to accomplish corporate strategies in their domestic
markets to diversify their portfolio.

                    Chapter 9: Competing in International Markets | 249
As shown in Figure 9.3, there are trade-offs in the selection of the method of entry to another country. These
variables are:

   The amount of risk
   The degree of control and ownership
   The potential for profit
Exporting provides the least amount of risk, but also the least amount of control and profit potential. Moving
from exporting at one end of the continuum to greenfield on the other end, the amount of risk increases, as
does the degree of control/ownership and the potential to make more profit. The most risky method to enter
into another country is greenfield, when the investment is high in acquiring land and building facilities, without
the advantage of taking over an existing company. However, the venture is totally under the control of the
entering company and the profit potential is the highest, although riskiest, as noted.

                Figure 9.15: Entering International Markets

Exporting

Exporting involves creating goods within a firm's home country and then shipping them to another country.
Once the goods reach foreign shores, the exporter's role is over. A local firm then sells the goods to local
customers. Many firms that expand overseas start out as exporters because exporting offers a low-cost method
to find out whether a firm's products are appealing to customers in other lands. Some Asian automakers, for
250 | Chapter 9: Competing in International Markets
example, first entered the US market through exporting. Small firms may rely on exporting because it is a low-
cost and lower risk option.
Once a firm's products are found to be viable in a
particular country, exporting often becomes
undesirable. A firm that exports its goods loses control
of them once they are turned over to a local firm for
sale locally. This local distributor may treat customers
poorly and thereby damage the firm's brand. Also, an
exporter only makes money when it sells its goods at
wholesale prices to a local firm, not when end users
buy the goods. Executives may want their firm to enjoy
the profits that are made when products are sold to
individual customers rather than a local distributor.

                                                                                          Figure 9.16: Exporting often relies on huge cargo ships, such
                                                                                          as this one docked in Cyprus.

Figure 9.17: What gets exported from one country to another?

Licensing

While franchising is an option within service industries, licensing is most frequently used in manufacturing
industries. Licensing involves granting a foreign company the right to create a company's product within a

                                                                                                    Chapter 9: Competing in International Markets | 251
foreign country in exchange for a fee. These relationships often center on patented technology. A firm that
grants a license avoids absorbing a lot of costs, but its profits are limited to the fees that it collects from the
local firm. The firm also loses some control over how its technology is used.

A historical example involving licensing illustrates how rapidly events can change within the international arena.
By the time Japan surrendered to the United States and its Allies in 1945, World War II had crippled the country's
industrial infrastructure. In response to this problem, Japanese firms imported a great deal of technology,
especially from American firms. When the Korean War broke out in the early 1950s, the American military relied
on Jeeps made in Japan using licensed technology. In just a few years, a mortal enemy had become a valuable
ally.

Strategy at the Movies

Gung Ho

Can American workers survive under Japanese

management? Although this sounds like the

premise for a bad reality TV show, the question

was a legitimate consideration for General

Motors (GM) and Toyota in the early 1980s. GM

was struggling at the time to compete with the

inexpensive, reliable, and fuel-efficient cars

produced by Japanese firms. Meanwhile,

Toyota was worried that the US government

would limit the number of foreign cars that

could be imported. To address these issues,

these companies worked together to reopen a          Figure 9.18: Assembly line at car factory in South Korea.
defunct GM plant in Fremont, California in 1984

that would manufacture both companies' automobiles in one facility. The plant had been the worst

performer in the GM system; however, under Toyota's management, the New United Motor

Manufacturing Incorporated (NUMMI) plant became the best factory associated with GM--using

the same workers as before! Despite NUMMI's eventual success, the joint production plant

experienced significant growing pains stemming from the cultural differences between Japanese

managers and American workers.

The NUMMI story inspired the 1986 movie Gung Ho in which a closed automobile manufacturing
plant in Hadleyville, Pennsylvania, was reopened by Japanese car company Assan Motors. While
Assan Motors and the workers of Hadleyville were both excited about the venture, neither was

252 | Chapter 9: Competing in International Markets
       prepared for the differences between the two cultures. For example, Japanese workers feel
       personally ashamed when they make a mistake. When manager Oishi Kazihiro failed to meet
       production targets, he was punished with "ribbons of shame" and forced to apologize to his
       employees for letting them down. In contrast, American workers were presented in the film as
       likely to reject management authority, prone to fighting at work, and not opposed to taking
       shortcuts.
       When Assan Motors' executives attempted to institute morning calisthenics and insisted that
       employees work late without overtime pay, the American workers challenged these policies and
       eventually walked off the production line. Assan Motors' near failure was the result of differences in
       cultural norms and values. Gung Ho illustrates the value of understanding and bridging cultural
       differences to facilitate successful cross-cultural collaboration, value that was realized in real life by
       NUMMI.

Franchising

 Franchising is a popular way for firms to grow internationally. Below are examples of US-based franchises that
                                                            are successful worldwide.

                                                  Table 9.12 Franchising: A Leading American Export
                                                               Successful US-based Franchises

 In many Asian countries, McDonald's franchises offer side dishes such as rice alongside its signature French fries.
 If you grow tired of strudel while in Germany, remember that Dunkin' Donuts has over 3,200 stores in 36 countries
 outside of the United States.
 Legend says that the first sandwich was created when John Montagu, the fourth Earl of Sandwich, ordered meat tucked
 between bread so he could play cards and eat at the same time. The sandwich remains popular in Europe, where Subway
 boasts over one thousand franchised restaurants.
 All KFCs in Japan prominently feature a statue of KFC's founder Colonel Sanders.
 If a franchised store in Norway was open during the age of the Vikings, its slogan may have been "Thank Asgard for 7-11."

Franchising has been used by many firms that compete in service industries to develop a worldwide presence
(Table 9.12). Subway, The UPS Store, and Hilton Hotels are just a few of the firms that have done so. Franchising
involves an organization (called a franchiser) granting the right to use its brand name, products, and processes
to other organizations (known as franchisees) in exchange for an up-front payment (a franchise fee) and a
percentage of franchisees' revenues (a royalty fee).

                                                                                                    Chapter 9: Competing in International Markets | 253
                                                            Franchising is an attractive way to enter foreign
                                                            markets because it requires little financial investment
                                                            by the franchiser. Indeed, local franchisees must pay
                                                            the vast majority of the expenses associated with
                                                            getting their businesses up and running. On the
                                                            downside, the decision to franchise means that a firm
                                                            will get to enjoy only a small portion of the profits
                                                            made under its brand name. Also, local franchisees
                                                            may behave in ways that the franchiser does not
                                                            approve. For example, KFC was angered by some of
                                                            its franchisees in Asia when they started selling fish
                                                            dishes without KFC's approval. It is often difficult to
                                                            fix such problems because laws in many countries are
                                                            stacked in favor of local businesses. Last, franchises
                                                            are only successful if franchisees are provided with a
                                                            simple and effective business model. Executives thus
                                                            need to avoid expanding internationally through
                                                            franchising until their formula has been perfected.

Figure 9.19: Firms should own a thoroughly proven business
model before franchising in other countries.

Joint Ventures and Strategic Alliances

Within each market entry option described earlier, a firm either maintains strong control of operations (wholly
owned subsidiary) or it turns most control over to a local firm (exporting, franchising, and licensing). In some
cases, however, executives find it beneficial to work closely with one or more local partners in a joint venture
or a strategic alliance. In a joint venture, two or more organizations each contribute to the creation of a new
entity. In a strategic alliance, firms work together cooperatively, but no new organization is formed. In both
cases, the firm and its local partner or partners share decision-making authority, control of the operation, and
any profits that the relationship creates.

Joint ventures and strategic alliances are especially attractive when a firm believes that working closely with
locals will provide important knowledge about local conditions, facilitate acceptance of their involvement by
government officials, or both. In the late 1980s, China was a difficult market for American businesses to enter.
Executives at KFC saw China as an attractive country because chicken is a key element of Chinese diets. After
considering the various options for entering China with its first restaurant, KFC decided to create a joint
venture with three local organizations. KFC owned 51% of the venture; having more than half of the operation
was advantageous in case disagreements arose. A Chinese bank owned 25%, the local tourist bureau owned 14%,
and the final 10% was owned by a local chicken producer that would supply the restaurant with its signature
food item.

254 | Chapter 9: Competing in International Markets
Having these three local partners helped KFC navigate the
cumbersome regulatory process that was in place and allowed the
American firm to withstand the scrutiny of wary Chinese officials.
Despite these advantages, it still took more than a year for the store
to be built and approved. Once open in 1987, however, KFC was an
instant success in China. As China's economy gradually became more
and more open, KFC was a major beneficiary. By the end of 1997, KFC
operated 191 restaurants in 50 Chinese cities. By the start of 2019,
there were approximately 5,000 KFCs spread across 1,100 Chinese
cities. Roughly 90% of these restaurants are wholly owned
subsidiaries of KFC--a stark indication of how much doing business
in China has changed over the past twenty-five years.

Creating a Wholly Owned Subsidiary:

Acquisition and Greenfield

In international strategy, a wholly owned subsidiary is a business      Figure 9.20: As of early 2011, KFC was opening
                                                                        a new store in China every eighteen hours on
                                                                        average.

operation in a foreign country that a firm fully owns. A firm can

develop a wholly owned subsidiary through a greenfield venture, meaning that the firm creates the entire

operation itself. This usually means building and operating the facility. Another possibility is purchasing an

existing operation from a local company or another foreign operator.

Regardless of whether a firm builds a wholly owned subsidiary "from scratch" or acquires an existing company,
having a wholly owned subsidiary can be attractive because the firm maintains complete control over the
operation, and gets to keep all of the profits that the operation makes. A wholly owned subsidiary can be quite
risky, however, because the firm must pay all of the expenses required to set it up and operate it. Kia, for
example, spent $1 billion to build its US factory. Many firms are reluctant to spend such sums in more volatile
countries because they fear that they may never recoup their investments.

   Key Takeaway

          When entering a new country, executives can choose exporting, licensing, franchising, creating a
             joint venture or strategic alliance, and creating a wholly owned subsidiary through greenfield or
             acquisition. The key issues of how much control a firm has over its operation, how much risk is
             involved, and what share of the operation's profits the firm gets to keep all vary across these
             options. Along the continuum from exporting to wholly owned subsidiary, risk, control, and
             profit potential are least with exporting and highest with the wholly owned subsidiary.

   Exercises

         1. Do you believe that KFC would have been so successful in China today if executives had tried to
             make their first store a wholly owned subsidiary? Why or why not?

        2. The typical joint venture only lasts a few years. Why might joint ventures dissolve so quickly?

9.7 Conclusion

This chapter explains competition in international markets. Executives must consider the benefits and risks
of competing internationally when making decisions about whether to expand overseas. Using the CAGE
framework helps firms decide the cultural, administrative, geographic, and economic distance between the
home and target country. Executives also need to determine the likelihood that their firms will succeed
when they compete in international markets by examining demand conditions, factor conditions, related and
supporting industries, strategy, structure, and rivalry among its domestic competitors. When a firm does
venture overseas, a decision must be made about whether its international strategy will be international, multi-
domestic, global, or transnational. Finally, when leading a firm to enter a new market, executives can choose
to manage the operation via exporting, licensing, franchising, creating a joint venture or strategic alliance, and
creating a wholly owned subsidiary through greenfield or acquisition.

   Learning Objectives

     After reading this chapter, you should be able to understand and articulate answers to the following
     questions:

         1. Why is a firm's organizational structure important?
        2. What are the basic building blocks of organizational structure?
        3. What are strategic advantages and disadvantages of each organizational structure type?
        4. What are the different forms of control and when should they be used?
        5. What are the key legal forms of business, and what implications does the choice of a business

             form have for organizational structure?

10.1 Introduction

With an understanding of developing business-level, corporate level, and international strategies, firms must
execute their strategies to be successful. The way a firm organizes itself is critical to its ability to implement
strategy. This chapter addresses why organizational structure is important to achieving a firm's strategic
goals--which types of structures are deployed by firms, what control systems are used by firms, and what are
the options for establishing a legal entity. These organizational decisions should support and align with an

                                                                                        Chapter 10: Executing Strategy - Organizational Design | 259
organization's mission, vision, and values to ensure ethical as well as strategic outcomes. The role of social
responsibility and ethics in a corporate setting will be discussed in detail in the next and final chapter.

The word executing used in this chapter's title has two distinct meanings. These meanings were cleverly
intertwined in a quip by John McKay. McKay had the misfortune to be the head coach of a hapless professional
football team. In one game, McKay's offensive unit played particularly poorly. When McKay was asked after the
game what he thought of his offensive unit's execution, he wryly responded, "I am in favor of it."

In the context of business, execution refers to how well a firm such as GE implements the strategies that
executives create for it. This involves the creation and operation of both an appropriate organizational structure
with an aligned organizational control process. Executives who skillfully orchestrate structure and control are
likely to lead their firms to greater levels of success. In contrast, those executives who fail to do so are likely
to be viewed by stakeholders such as employees and owners in much the same way McKay viewed his offense:
worthy of execution.

was GE's third acquisition of a company that provides services to oil
wells in only five months. In October 2010, GE added the deepwater
exploration capabilities of Wellstream Holdings PLC for $1.3 billion. In
December 2010, part and equipment maker Dresser was acquired for
$3 billion. By spending more than $7 billion on these acquisitions, GE
executives made it clear that they had big plans within the oil well
services business.

While many executives would struggle to integrate three new
companies into their firms, experts expected GE's leaders to smoothly execute the transitions. In

260 | Chapter 10: Executing Strategy - Organizational Design
describing the acquisition of John Wood Group PLC, for example, one Wall Street analyst noted,
"This is a nice bolt-on deal for GE" (Layne, 2011). In other words, this analyst believed that John
Wood Group PLC could be seamlessly added to GE's corporate empire. The way that GE was
organized fueled this belief.

GE's organizational structure includes six divisions, each devoted to specific product categories: (1)
Energy (the most profitable division), (2) Capital (the largest division), (3) Home & Business
Solutions, (4) Healthcare, (5) Aviation, and (6) Transportation. Within the Energy division, there are
three subdivisions: (1) Oil & Gas, (2) Power & Water, and (3) Energy Services. Rather than having the
entire organization involved with integrating John Wood Group PLC, Wellstream Holdings PLC, and
Dresser into GE, these three newly acquired companies would simply be added to the Oil & Gas
subdivisions within the Energy division.

In addition to the six product divisions, GE also had a division devoted to Global Growth &
Operations. This division was responsible for all sales of GE products and services outside the
United States. The Global Growth & Operations division was very important to GE's future. Indeed,
GE's CEO Jeffrey Immelt expected that countries other than the United States will account for 60%
of GE's sales in the future, up from 53% in 2010. To maximize GE's ability to respond to local needs,
the Global Growth & Operations was further divided into twelve geographic regions: China, India,
Southeast Asia, Latin/South America, Russia, Canada, Australia, the Middle East, Africa, Germany,
Europe, and Japan (GE News Center, 2010).

Finally, like many large companies, GE also provided some centralized services to support all its
units. These support areas included public relations, business development, legal, global research,
human resources, and finance. By having entire units of the organization devoted to these
functional areas, GE hoped not only to minimize expenses but also to create consistency across
divisions.

Growing concerns about the environmental effects of drilling, for example, made it likely that GE's
oil well services operations would need the help of GE's public relations and legal departments in
the future. Other important questions about GE's acquisitions remained open as well. In particular,
would the organizational cultures of John Wood Group PLC, Wellstream Holdings PLC, and Dresser
mesh with the culture of GE? Most acquisitions in the business world fail to deliver the results that
executives expect, and the incompatibility of organizational cultures is one reason why.

This General Electric example highlights several concepts regarding the strategic role decisions
about the organization. First, how large, complex organizations organize themselves impact how
they accomplish their mission. Also, assessing the external environment can open up organizational
opportunities. Third, how the acquisition and then integration of companies into the home firm can
be challenging. And fourth, in hindsight, investing in the fossil fuel industry at a time of rising
energy renewables was a strategic mistake. Since this time, GE has sold off many of its business
lines for billions of dollars, and the downsized company is nowhere near the powerhouse it was a

                                                                                Chapter 10: Executing Strategy - Organizational Design | 261
       decade ago. GE is still struggling due to the strategic errors in a number of the industries it was
       involved in.

                Figure 10.2: GE fits a dizzying array of businesses into a relatively simple organizational chart.

Firms must be organized in an optimal way to be able to compete and accomplish its mission. As noted in an
earlier chapter, the external and competitive environments cannot be ignored. A firm must find the best "fit" to
deal with the business environment and maximize its internal resources, capabilities, and core competencies.
This organizational fit will determine its performance. It is unique to each organization; it is not "one size fits
all."
The business-level strategy that a firm selects impacts the organizational structure, with some structures
better suited for certain strategies. There are trade-offs with each structure. The structure influences the firm's
ability to respond quickly to outside forces, its adaptability, resource efficiency, and accountability.
Walmart uses a functional organizational structure (described later in this chapter) because it is the best design
to support a low cost strategy operating in a stable environment. A functional structure allows for excellent
resource efficiency, but the trade off is a reduction in its adaptability and responsiveness to external forces
(Harvard).

10.3 The Basic Building Blocks of Organizational Structure

Legendary football coach Vince Lombardi once noted, "The achievements of an organization are the results of the
 combined effort of each individual." Understanding how people can be most efficiently organized is the basis for

      modern management thought, and the building blocks of organizational structure are illustrated below.

             Table 10.1 The Building Blocks of Organizational Structure

Division of  Division of labor is a process of splitting up a task into a series of smaller tasks, each of which is
   Labor     performed by a specialist. In ancient Greece, historian Xenophon wrote about the division of labor in
             shoe making: one person cut out the shoes, another sewed the uppers together, and a third person
             assembled the parts.

Informal     Informal linkages are unofficial relationships such as friendships that do not appear in organizational

             their departments, a mentor relationship, or an experienced staff member taking a new employee
             "under their wing" to help them get off to a good start at the company.

Vertical     Vertical linkages tie supervisors and subordinates together. These linkages show the lines of

             principle, which states that each person should only report directly to one supervisor.

Division of Labor

General Electric (GE), although downsized, still offers an array of products and services, including power
generation, jet engines, medical equipment, and renewable energy. One way that GE could produce its jet
engines would be to have individual employees work on one jet engine at a time from start to finish. However,
this would be very inefficient so GE and most other organizations avoid this approach. Instead, organizations
rely on division of labor when creating their products (Table 10.1). Division of labor is a process of splitting up a
task (such as the creation of jet engines) into a series of smaller tasks, each of which is performed by a specialist.

  Illustrated below is one of the oldest recorded stories from about 4300 years ago that is relevant to the design of
                                                              modern organizations.

Hierarchy of Authority Example: Moses

After fleeing Egypt, Moses found himself as the sole  Moses's father-in-law, Jethro, warned Moses that he would

population may have exceeded one million people.

Jethro offered Moses some practical advice. He told   Rather than handling all judging himself, Moses should appoint

duties they were to perform.                          would be brought to Moses.

This is perhaps the first recorded example of a clear hierarchy of authority--an arrangement of individuals
based on rank. A similar idea is used today in the US justice system where there are lower courts for easy-to-
resolve cases and the Supreme Court only handles the most difficult cases.

The leaders at the top of organizations have long known that division of labor can improve efficiency.
Thousands of years ago, for example, Moses's creation of a hierarchy of authority by delegating responsibility
to other judges offered perhaps the earliest known example (Table 10.2). In the eighteenth century, Adam
Smith's book The Wealth of Nations quantified the tremendous advantages that division of labor offered for a pin
factory. If a worker performed all the various steps involved in making pins himself, he could make about twenty
pins per day. By breaking the process into multiple steps, however, 10 workers could make 48,000 pins a day.
In other words, the pin factory was a staggering 240 times more productive than it would have been without
relying on division of labor. In the early twentieth century, Smith's ideas strongly influenced Henry Ford and
other industrial pioneers who sought to create efficient organizations.

                Figure 10.3: Division of labor allowed eighteenth century pin factories to dramatically increase their
                efficiency.

While division of labor fuels efficiency, it also creates a challenge--figuring out how to coordinate different tasks
and the people who perform them. The solution is organizational structure, which is defined as the process by
which tasks are assigned and grouped together with formal reporting relationships. Creating a structure that
effectively coordinates a firm's activities increases the firm's likelihood of success. Meanwhile, a structure that
does not match well with a firm's needs undermines the firm's chances of prosperity.

                                                                                        Chapter 10: Executing Strategy - Organizational Design | 265
                Figure 10.4: Division of labor was central to Henry Ford's development of assembly lines in his
                automobile factory. Ford noted, "Nothing is particularly hard if you divide it into small jobs."

Vertical and Horizontal Linkages

Most organizations use a diagram called an organizational chart to depict their structure. These organizational
charts show how firms' structures are built using two basic building blocks: vertical linkages and horizontal
linkages. Vertical linkages tie supervisors and subordinates together. These linkages show the lines of
responsibility through which a supervisor delegates authority to subordinates, oversees their activities,
evaluates their performance, and guides them toward improvement when necessary. Every supervisor except
for the person at the very top of the organizational chart also serves as a subordinate to someone else. In the
typical business school, for example, a department chair supervises a set of professors. The department chair
in turn is a subordinate of the dean.

Most executives rely on the unity of command principle when mapping out the vertical linkages in an
organizational structure. This principle states that each person should only report directly to one supervisor. If
employees have multiple bosses, they may receive conflicting guidance about how to do their jobs. The unity
of command principle helps organizations to avoid such confusion. In the case of GE, for example, the head
of the Energy division reports only to the chief executive officer. If problems were to arise with executing the
strategic move discussed in this chapter's opening vignette, joining the John Wood Group PLC with GE's Energy
division, the head of the Energy division would look to the chief executive officer for guidance.

Horizontal linkages are relationships between equals in an organization. These linkages are often called

266 | Chapter 10: Executing Strategy - Organizational Design
committees, task forces, or teams. Horizontal linkages are important when close coordination is needed
across different segments of an organization. For example, most business schools revise their undergraduate
curriculum every five or so years to ensure that students are receiving an education that matches the needs of
current business conditions. Typically, a committee consisting of at least one professor from every academic
area (such as management, marketing, accounting, and finance) will be appointed to perform this task. This
approach helps ensure that all aspects of business are represented appropriately in the new curriculum.

                Figure 10.5: Committee meetings can be boring, but they are often vital for coordinating efforts across
                departments.

The organic grocery store chain Whole Foods Market, owned by Amazon, is a company that relies heavily on
horizontal linkages. As noted on their website:

          At Whole Foods Market we recognize the importance of smaller tribal groupings to maximize familiarity
          and trust. We organize our stores and company into a variety of interlocking teams. Most teams have
          between 6 and 100 Team Members and the larger teams are divided further into a variety of sub-teams.
          The leaders of each team are also members of the Store Leadership Team and the Store Team Leaders
          are members of the Regional Leadership Team. This interlocking team structure continues all the way
          upwards to the Executive Team at the highest level of the company (Mackey, 2010).
This emphasis on teams is intended to develop trust throughout the organization, as well as to make full use of
the talents and creativity possessed by every employee.

Informal Linkages

Informal linkages refer to unofficial relationships such as personal friendships, rivalries, and politics. In the
long-running comedy series The Simpsons, Homer Simpson is a low-level, low-performing employee at a

                                                                                        Chapter 10: Executing Strategy - Organizational Design | 267
nuclear power plant. In one episode, Homer gains power and influence with the plant's owner, Montgomery
Burns, which far exceeds Homer's meager position in the organization chart, because Mr. Burns desperately
wants to be a member of the bowling team that Homer captains. Homer tries to use his newfound influence for
his own personal gain and, naturally, the organization as a whole suffers. Informal linkages such as this one do
not appear in organizational charts, but they nevertheless can have (and often do have) a significant influence
on how firms operate.

   Key Takeaway

          The concept of division of labor (dividing organizational activities into smaller tasks) lies at the
             heart of the study of organizational structure. Understanding vertical, horizontal, and informal
             linkages helps managers to organize better the different individuals and job functions within a
             firm.

10.4 Creating an Organizational Structure

Within most firms, executives rely on vertical and horizontal linkages to create a structure that they hope will
match the needs of their firm's strategy. Four types of structures are available to executives:

 1. Functional
2. Multi-divisional
3. Matrix
4. Boundaryless

Like snowflakes, however, no two organizational structures are exactly alike. When creating a structure for
their firm, executives will take one of these types and adapt it to fit the firm's unique circumstances. As they
do this, executives must realize that the choice of structure will influence their firm's strategy in the future.
Once a structure is created, it constrains future strategic moves. If a firm's structure is designed to maximize
efficiency, for example, the firm may lack the flexibility needed to react quickly to exploit new opportunities.

    Executives rely on vertical and horizontal linkages to create a structure that they hope will match the firm's
 needs. While no two organizational structures are exactly alike, four general types of structures are available to

                                executives: functional, multi-divisional, matrix, and boundaryless.
                                                                                        Chapter 10: Executing Strategy - Organizational Design | 269

Functional Structure

Organizations become more complex as they grow, and this can require more formal division of labor and a
strong emphasis on hierarchy and vertical links.

  Functional structures rely on a division of labor whereby groups of people handle activities related to a specific
 function of the overall business. Illustrated are functional structures in action within two types of organizations

                                                            that commonly use them.

The creation of produce, deli, and butcher
departments provides an efficient way to divide a
grocery store physically as well as functionally.

Within a functional structure, employees are divided into departments that each handle activities related to
a functional area of the business, such as marketing, production, human resources, information technology,
and customer service (Table 10.4). Each of these five areas would be headed up by a manager who coordinates

270 | Chapter 10: Executing Strategy - Organizational Design
all activities related to her functional area. Everyone in a company that works on marketing the company's
products, for example, would report to the manager of the marketing department. The marketing managers
and the managers in charge of the other four areas in turn would report to the chief executive officer.

                Figure 10.6: An example of a functional structure

Using a functional structure creates advantages and disadvantages. An important benefit of adopting a
functional structure is that each person tends to learn a great deal about his or her particular function. By being
placed in a department that consists entirely of marketing professionals, an individual has a great opportunity
to become an expert in marketing. Thus a functional structure tends to create highly skilled specialists. Second,
grouping everyone that serves a particular function into one department tends to keep costs low and to create
efficiency. Also, because all the people in a particular department share the same background training, they
tend to get along with one another. In other words, conflicts within departments are more rare.
Using a functional structure also has a significant downside: executing strategic changes can be very slow
when compared with other structures. Suppose, for example, that a textbook publisher decides to introduce
a new form of textbook that includes "scratch and sniff" photos that let students smell various products in
addition to reading about them. If the publisher is organized using a functional structure, every department
in the organization will have to be intimately involved in the creation of the new textbooks. Because the new
product lies outside each department's routines, it may become lost in the proverbial shuffle. And unfortunately
for the books' authors, the publication process will be halted whenever a functional area does not live up to its
responsibilities in a timely manner. More generally, because functional structures are slow to execute change,
they tend to work best for organizations that offer narrow and stable product lines.
The specific functional departments that appear in an organizational chart vary across organizations that use
functional structures. In the example offered earlier in this section, a firm was divided into five functional areas:
(1) marketing, (2) production, (3) human resources, (4) information technology, and (5) customer service. In the
TV show The Office, a different approach to a functional structure is used at the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch
of Dunder Mifflin. The branch was divided into six functional areas: (1) sales, (2) warehouse, (3) quality control,
(4) customer service, (5) human resources, and (6) accounting. A functional structure was a good fit for the
branch at the time because its product line was limited to just selling office paper.

                                                                                         Chapter 10: Executing Strategy - Organizational Design | 271
                Figure 10.7: The Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin may be a dysfunctional organization, but it relies on
                a functional structure.

Multi-Divisional Structure

Many organizations offer a wide variety of products and services. Some of these organizations sell their
offerings across an array of geographic regions. These approaches require firms to be very responsive to
customers' needs. Yet, as noted, functional structures tend to be fairly slow to change. As a result, many firms
abandon the use of a functional structure as their offerings expand. Often the new choice is a multi-divisional
structure. In this type of structure, employees are divided into departments based on product areas and/or
geographic regions.
General Electric (GE) is an example of a company organized this way. As shown in the organization chart
that accompanies this chapter's opening vignette, most of the company's employees belonged to one of six

272 | Chapter 10: Executing Strategy - Organizational Design
product divisions (Energy, Capital, Home & Business Solutions, Health Care, Aviation, and Transportation) or to
a division that is devoted to all GE's operations outside the United States (Global Growth & Operations).

A big advantage of a multi-divisional structure is that it allows a firm to act quickly. When GE makes a strategic
move such as acquiring the well-support division of John Wood Group PLC, only the relevant division (in this
case, Energy, needs to be involved in integrating the new unit into GE's hierarchy. In contrast, if GE were
organized using a functional structure, the transition would be much slower because all the divisions in the
company would need to be involved. A multi-divisional structure also helps an organization to better serve
customers' needs. For example, GE's Capital division started to make real-estate loans after exiting that market
during the financial crisis of the late 2000s (Jacobius, 2011). Because one division of GE handled all the firm's
loans, the wisdom and skill needed to decide when to re-enter real-estate lending was easily accessible.

Of course, empowering divisions to act quickly can backfire if people in those divisions take actions that do not
fit with the company's overall strategy. McDonald's experienced this kind of situation. In particular, the French
division of McDonald's ran a surprising advertisement in a magazine called Femme Actuelle. The ad included
a quote from a nutritionist that asserted children should not eat at a McDonald's more than once per week.
Executives at McDonald's headquarters in suburban Chicago were concerned about the message sent to their
customers, of course, and they made it clear that they strongly disagreed with the nutritionist.

Another downside of multi divisional structures is that
they tend to be more costly to operate than functional
structures. While a functional structure offers the
opportunity to gain efficiency by having just one
department handle all activities in an area, such as
marketing, a firm using a multi-divisional structure
needs to have marketing units within each of its
divisions. In GE's case, for example, each of its seven
divisions must develop marketing skills. Absorbing the
extra expenses that are created reduces a firm's profit
margin. Often a multi-divisional firm will employ a
functional structure within each of its divisions.

GE's organizational chart highlights a way that firms    Figure 10.8: Problems can be created when delegating lots of

organizational chart, departments devoted to

important aspects of public relations, business development, legal, global research, human resources, and

finance are maintained centrally to provide services to the six product divisions and the geographic division. By

consolidating some human resource activities in one location, for example, GE creates efficiency and saves

money.

An additional benefit of such moves is that consistency is created across divisions. For example, the Coca-
Cola Company created an Office of Sustainability to coordinate sustainability initiatives across the entire
company. Bea Perez was named Coca-Cola's chief sustainability officer and was put in charge of the Office

"made significant progress with our sustainability initiatives, but our current approach needs focus and better
integration" (Coca-Cola Company, 2011). In other words, a department devoted to creating consistency across
Coca-Cola's sustainability efforts was needed for Coca-Cola to meet its sustainability goals.

Matrix Structure

Within functional and multi-divisional structures, vertical linkages between bosses and subordinates define
most of the elements. Matrix structures, in contrast, rely heavily on horizontal relationships (Ketchen & Short,
2011). In particular, these structures create cross-functional teams that each work on a different project. This
offers several benefits: maximizing the organization's flexibility, enhancing communication across functional
lines, and creating a spirit of teamwork and collaboration. A matrix structure can also help develop new
managers. In particular, a person without managerial experience can be put in charge of a relatively small
project as a test to see whether the person has a talent for leading others.

Using a matrix structure can create difficulties too. One concern is that a matrix structure violates the unity
of command principle, because each employee is assigned multiple bosses. Specifically, any given individual
reports to a functional area supervisor as well as one or more project supervisors. This creates confusion for
employees because they are left unsure about who should be giving them direction. Violating the unity of
command principle also creates opportunities for unsavory employees to avoid responsibility by claiming to
each supervisor that a different supervisor is currently depending on their efforts.

The potential for conflicts arising between project managers within a matrix structure is another concern.
Chances are that students have had some classes with professors who are excellent speakers, while being
forced to suffer through a semester of incomprehensible lectures in other classes. This mix of experiences
reflects a fundamental reality of management: in any organization, some workers are more talented and
motivated than others. Within a matrix structure, each project manager, naturally, will want the best people in
the company assigned to their project because their boss evaluates these managers based on how well their
projects perform. Because the best people are a scarce resource, infighting and politics can easily flare up
around which people are assigned to each project.

Given these problems, not every organization is a good candidate to use a matrix structure. Organizations such
as information technology, engineering, and consulting firms that need to maximize their flexibility to service
projects of limited duration can benefit from the use of a matrix. Matrix structures are also used to organize
research and development departments within many large corporations. In each of these settings, the benefits
of organizing around teams are so great that they often outweigh the risks of doing so.

274 | Chapter 10: Executing Strategy - Organizational Design
                Figure 10.9: You won't need to choose between a red pill and a blue pill within a matrix structure, but
                you will have multiple bosses.

The matrix structure works well for other complex organizations that are not project based. These can be set up
on a permanent basis and fit well for firms with multiple locations. This works particularly well for standardizing
processes and policies across the various units of the firm. For example, a manufacturer with five plants
spread out across the Southeast United States can use this structure to standardize finance and accounting,
production, supply chain, marketing, and logistics. Each of these functional areas has a vice-president in charge
of that function and reports to the CEO. However, each function in each plant has a manager who reports both
to the functional VP and to the plant manager. The matrix structure is best suited for firms implementing a
related diversification corporate strategy in complex environments where responding quickly to external forces
is important.

Sentara Healthcare is a hospital system that operates 13 hospitals in Virginia. This organization uses a matrix
structure to provide consistency and standardization of policies, procedures, supplies, and equipment across
its hospitals. The diagram below illustrates how the reporting structure goes both vertically and horizontally.
This allows for standardization of the major functions across the hospital system. For example, the emergency

                                                                                        Chapter 10: Executing Strategy - Organizational Design | 275
rooms in all hospitals use the same medical equipment, the same computer systems, and the same processes
and paperwork, so nurses can easily work in any hospital without having to be retrained. Efficiency is improved,
best practices are implemented across the system easier, and volume discounts by purchasing identical
supplies and equipment for all the emergency departments saves money.

    Strategy at the Movies

       Office Space
       How much work can a man accomplish with eight bosses breathing down his neck? For Peter
       Gibbons, an employee at information technology firm Initech in the movie Office Space, the answer
       was zero. Initech's use of a matrix structure meant that each employee had multiple bosses, each
       representing a different aspect of Initech's business. High-tech firms often use a matrix structure
       to gain the flexibility needed to manage multiple projects simultaneously. Successfully using a
       matrix structure requires excellent communication among various managers--however, excellence
       that Initech could not reach. When Gibbons forgot to put the appropriate cover sheet on his TPS
       report, each of his eight bosses--and a parade of his coworkers--admonished him. This fiasco and
       others led to Gibbons to become cynical about his job.
       Simpler organizational structures can be equally frustrating. Joanna, a waitress at nearby restaurant
       Chotchkie's, had only one manager--a stark contrast to Gibbons's eight bosses. Unfortunately,

276 | Chapter 10: Executing Strategy - Organizational Design
Joanna's manager had an unhealthy obsession with the "flair" (colorful buttons and pins) used by
employees to enliven their uniforms. A series of mixed messages about the restaurant's policy on
flair led Joanna to emphatically proclaim--both verbally and nonverbally--her disdain for the
manager. She then quit her job and stormed out of the restaurant.

structure involved simpler working relationships, but these
relationships were strained beyond the breaking point by a manager's
eccentricities. In a more general sense, Office Space shows that all
organizational structures involve a series of trade-offs that must be
carefully managed.

Boundaryless Organizations

Most organizational charts show clear divisions and boundaries between different units. The value of a much
different approach was highlighted by former GE CEO Jack Welch when he created the term boundaryless
organization. A boundaryless organization is one that removes the usual barriers between parts of the
organization as well as barriers between the organization and others (Askenas, et. al., 1995). Eliminating all
internal and external barriers is not possible, of course, but making progress toward being boundaryless
can help an organization become more flexible and responsive. One example is W. L. Gore, a maker of
fabrics, medical implants, industrial sealants, filtration systems, and consumer products. This firm avoids
organizational charts, management layers, and supervisors despite having approximately 9,000 employees
across 30 countries. Rather than granting formal titles to certain people, leaders with W. L. Gore emerge based
on performance, and they attract followers to their ideas over time. As one employee noted, "We vote with our
feet. If you call a meeting, and people show up, you're a leader" (Hamel, 2007).

Chapter 10: Executing Strategy - Organizational Design | 277
Boundaryless organizations work best in knowledge
industries, such as information technology and
communications firms. They are characterized by the frequent
use of cross-functional teams and decision-making that is
highly decentralized. These organizations rely heavily on loose
boundaries and the informal linkages mentioned earlier in this
chapter. The boundaryless structure lends itself well to the
free-rein leadership style where the external environment
changes quickly, and for executing innovation strategies.

An illustration of how removing barriers can be valuable has its

roots in a very unfortunate event. During Hurricane Katrina in

2005, rescue efforts were hampered by a lack of coordination

between responders from the National Guard (who are

controlled by state governments) and from active-duty

military units (who are controlled by federal authorities).

According to one National Guard officer, "It was just like a solid

wall was between the two entities" (Elliott, 2011). Efforts were    Figure 10.12: The boundaryless approach to structure

example, poor coordination caused the evacuation of

thousands of people from the New Orleans Superdome to be delayed by a full day. The results were immense

human suffering and numerous fatalities.

                                           To avoid similar problems from arising in the future, barriers
                                           between the National Guard and active-duty military units are being
                                           bridged by special military officers called dual-status commanders.
                                           These individuals will be empowered to lead both types of units
                                           during a disaster recovery effort, helping to ensure that all areas
                                           receive the attention they need in a timely manner.

                                           organization are being made too slowly or if the organization is
                                           performing poorly. Both these problems plagued Sears Holdings
                                           leading executives to reorganize the company.

278 | Chapter 10: Executing Strategy - Organizational Design
Sears's new structure organized the firm around five types of divisions: (1) operating businesses (such as
clothing, appliances, and electronics), (2) support units (certain functional areas such as marketing and finance),
(3) brands (which focus on nurturing the firm's various brands such as Lands' End, Joe Boxer, Craftsman,
and Kenmore), (4) online, and (5) real estate. At the time, Sears's chairman Edward S. Lampert noted that
"by creating smaller focused teams that are clearly responsible for their units, we [will] increase autonomy
and accountability, create greater ownership and enable faster, better decisions" (Jones, 2008). Unfortunately,
structural changes cannot cure all a company's ills. Sears's stock was worth just over half what it had been worth
five years earlier and it continues to close stores into 2020.

Sometimes structures become too complex and need

to be simplified. Many observers believe that this

description fits Cisco. The company's CEO, John

Chambers, moved Cisco away from a hierarchical

emphasis toward a focus on horizontal linkages.

Before, Cisco had four types of such linkages. For any

given project, a small team of people reported to one

of 47 boards. The boards averaged 14 members each.

Forty-three of these boards each reported to one of 12

councils. Each council also averaged 14 members. The

councils reported to an operating committee

consisting of Chambers and 15 other top executives.     Figure 10.14: Although it was created to emphasize the need

some top executives spend 30% of their work hours

serving on more than 10 of the boards and councils, as well as the operating committee.

Because it competes in fast-changing high-tech markets, Cisco needed to be able to make competitive moves
quickly. The firm's complex structural arrangements were preventing this. A competitor, Hewlett-Packard
(HP), started promoting a warranty service that provided free support and upgrades within the computer
network switches market. Because Cisco's response to this initiative had to work its way through multiple
committees, the firm did not take prompt action. During the delay, Cisco's share of the market dropped as
customers embraced HP's warranty. This problem and others created by Cisco's overly complex structure were
so severe that one columnist wondered aloud "has Cisco's John Chambers lost his mind?" (Blodget, 2009).
Finally, Chambers reversed course and decided to return Cisco to a more traditional structure while reducing
the firm's workforce by 9%. Since the implementation of these structural changes, Cisco's stock price more than
doubled.

   Key Takeaway

          Executives must select among the four types of structure (functional, multi-divisional, matrix,
             and boundaryless) available to organize operations. Each structure has unique advantages, and
             the selection of structures involves a series of trade-offs.

10.5 Creating Organizational Control Systems

In addition to creating an appropriate organizational structure, effectively executing strategy depends on the
skillful use of organizational control systems. Executives create strategies trying to achieve their organization's
vision, mission, and goals. Organizational control systems allow executives to track how well the organization
is performing, identify areas of concern, and then take action to address the concerns. Three basic types
of control systems are available to executives: (1) output control, (2) behavioral control, and (3) clan control.
Different organizations emphasize different types of control, but most organizations use a mix of all three types.

Output Control

Stephen Covey said "start with the end in mind." Output control is one way decision makers put this into
practice. Output control focuses on measurable results within an organization. Examples from the business
world include the number of hits a website receives per day, the number of microwave ovens an assembly
line produces per week, and the number of vehicles a car salesman sells per month (Table 10.5). In each of
these cases, executives must decide what level of performance is acceptable, communicate expectations to the
relevant employees, track whether performance meets expectations, and then make any needed changes. In an
ironic example, a group of post office workers in Pensacola, Florida, were once disappointed to learn that their
paychecks had been lost--by the US Postal Service. The corrective action was simple: they started receiving
their pay via direct deposit rather than through the mail.
Many times the stakes are much higher. Delta Airlines was forced to face some facts as part of its use of output
control. Data gathered by the federal government revealed that only 77.4% of Delta's flights had arrived on time
during the year. This performance led Delta to rank dead last among the major US airlines and fifteenth out
of 18 total carriers (Yamanouchi, 2011a). In response, Delta took important corrective steps. In particular, the
airline added to its ability to service airplanes and provided more customer service training for its employees.

282 | Chapter 10: Executing Strategy - Organizational Design
These changes and others paid off. For the second quarter of the following year, Delta enjoyed a $198 million
profit, despite having to absorb a $1 billion increase in its fuel costs due to rising prices (Yamanouchi, 2011b).

   Outcome controls assess measurable production and other tangible results. Often output controls emphasize
             "bottom-line" performance. We illustrate some outcome controls found in organizations below.

                                                                   Table 10.5 Output Controls
                                                                    Output Control Examples
 Because real estate agents are paid a percentage of the selling price when a house sells, the number of dollars generated
 in houses sold is an important metric. Many realty offices have designations like "five million dollar club" to recognize
 very productive realtors.
 Grade point averages provide a tangible means for employers and graduate schools to compare students.
 In the classic movie Elf, the main character Buddy leaves Santa's workshop when the number of Etch-A-Sketch toys he
 produces is nearly 900 units lower than the standard pace.
 To earn tenure in a research-focused business school, a professor's output generally must include publishing numerous
 high-quality articles at reputable scholarly journals.
 Within restaurants, servers can increase a key output--amount of tips received--by providing customers with fast,
 friendly, and high-quality service.

Output control also plays a big part in the college

experience. For example, test scores and grade point

averages are good examples of output measures. If you

perform badly on a test, a student might take

corrective action by studying harder or by studying in

a group for the next test. At most colleges and

universities, a student is put on academic probation

when his grade point average drops below a certain

level. If the student's performance does not improve,

he may be removed from his major and even dismissed.

On the positive side, output measures can trigger

rewards too. A very high grade point average can lead

to placement on the dean's list and graduating with     Figure 10.15: While most scholarships require a high GPA,
honors.                                                 comedian David Letterman created a scholarship for a "C"

progress toward achieving performance goals and

strategies. Sometimes an output measure may have unintended consequences and produce the opposite

impact desired. For example, if the sales team in a firm is rewarded based only on individual sales totals, sales

people may not cooperate, collaborate, or help each other. They may even attempt to sabotage each other in

their quest to achieve first place in sales for the period. Organizations must take care in how employees and

managers are incentivized.

                                                        Chapter 10: Executing Strategy - Organizational Design | 283
Behavioral Control

Behavioral controls dictate the actions of individuals. Such controls often emphasize rules and procedures. Some
                                behavioral controls found in organizations are illustrated below.

                                                               Table 10.6 Behavioral Controls
                                                                Behavioral Control Examples
No shoes, no shirt, no paycheck. Many food service companies have strict attire requirements to make sure employees
are in compliance with the rules of the Food and Drug Administration and those of local health departments.
Casual Fridays provide a welcome break in offices that enforce strict dress codes.
Many businesses require that checks are signed by two people. This prevents a dishonest employee from embezzling
money.
In a classroom setting, grading attendance is a behavioral control designed to force students to show up for class. This
can be very helpful because research shows that attendance is positively related to grades. Unfortunately, there are no
behavioral controls that force professors' lectures to be interesting.
Gotta go? Be careful to not take too much time at certain auto factories, where bathroom breaks are monitored in an
effort to cut costs. Some employees of US firms are limited to 46 minutes of bathroom time per shift, while Japanese
automakers allow their American employees only 30 minutes per shift.

                                             While output control focuses on results, behavioral control focuses
                                             on controlling the actions that ultimately lead to results. In
                                             particular, various rules and procedures are used to standardize or
                                             to dictate behavior (Table 10.6). In most states, for example, signs are
                                             posted in restaurant bathrooms reminding employees that they
                                             must wash their hands before returning to work. To try to prevent
                                             employee theft, many firms require direct deposit for paychecks.
                                             And as an extreme example, some automobile factories and meat
                                             processing plants dictate to workers how many minutes they can
                                             spend in restrooms during their work shift.

                                             experience. An illustrative (although perhaps unpleasant) example is

                                             penalizing students for not attending class. Instructors grade

                                             attendance to control students' behavior; specifically, to motivate

                                             students to attend class. Meanwhile, student's exert some control

                                             over an instructor's future behavior through their student evaluation

customers, following them is beneficial to   Outside the classroom, behavioral control is a major factor within
everyone.                                    college athletic programs. The National Collegiate Athletic

Association (NCAA) governs college athletics using an enormous set of rules, policies, and procedures. The

NCAA's rule book on behavior is so complex that virtually all coaches violate its rules at one time or another.

Critics suggest that the behavioral controls instituted by the NCAA have reached an absurd level. Despite this

284 | Chapter 10: Executing Strategy - Organizational Design
example, some degree of behavioral control is needed within virtually all organizations to ensure a productive
work environment for all employees.

While a firm may have many mechanisms within its behavioral control system, the priority given to a particular
set of control mechanisms can be influenced by the external environment. The Supreme Court ruling (June
2020) on LGBTQ workplace protections coupled with parallel outrage regarding social justice issues facing
Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color (BIPOC) have an impact on firm decision-making. As a result, firms
have been focused to pay more addition to making public statements on racial injustice while making changes
to the existing (or absent) practices ensuring enforcement of anti-discrimination and equity policies. These
changes may result in new prioritization within organizational behavior control systems. For example, in 2020
NASCAR banned the presence of the Confederate flag at its race venues following national demonstrations
against white supremacy.

Creating an effective reward structure is key to effectively managing behavior because people tend to focus
their efforts on the rewarded behaviors. Problems can arise when people are rewarded for behaviors that seem
positive on the surface but that can actually undermine organizational goals under some circumstances. For
example, restaurant servers are highly motivated to serve their tables quickly because doing so can increase
their tips. But if a server devotes all his or her attention to providing fast service, other tasks that are vital to
running a restaurant, such as communicating effectively with managers, host staff, chefs, and other servers,
may suffer. Managers need to be aware of such trade-offs and strive to align rewards with behaviors. For
example, waitstaff who consistently behave as team players could be assigned to the most desirable and
lucrative shifts, such as nights and weekends.

Clan Control

     Rather than measuring results (as in outcome control) or dictating behavior (as in behavioral control), clan
   control relies on shared traditions, expectations, values, and norms to lead people to work toward the good of

     their organization. Some of the most interesting and unusual examples of clan control are found on college
             campuses. Below we illustrate a few striking examples that help build school spirit and loyalty.

                                                                     Table 10.7 Clan Controls
                                                                            Clan Controls

 Roughly one-quarter of Brandeis University's student body gets adorned in paint--and nothing else--at the annual Liquid
 Latex event.
 No matter how you slice it, the Toast Toss seems strange to outsiders. University of Pennsylvania students fling the
 breakfast staple into the air after the third quarter of home football games.
 Students at Texas Tech University honor the school's Southwest heritage by throwing tortillas at sporting events.

                                                                                        Chapter 10: Executing Strategy - Organizational Design | 285
Instead of measuring results (as in outcome control) or dictating
behavior (as in behavioral control), clan control is an informal type of
control. Specifically, clan control relies on shared traditions,
expectations, values, and norms to lead people to work toward the good
of their organization (Table 10.7). Clan control is often used heavily in
settings where creativity is vital, such as many high-tech businesses. In
these companies, output is tough to dictate, and many rules are not
appropriate. The creativity of a research scientist would be likely to be
stifled, for example, if she were given a quota of patents that she must
meet each year (output control) or if a strict dress code were enforced
(behavioral control).

Google is a firm that relies on clan control to be successful. Employees     Figure 10.17: As part of the team-building

projects. The company offers an ``ideas mailing list'' for employees to      as Noogles and are given a propeller hat to
submit new ideas and to comment on others' ideas. Google executives          wear.
routinely make themselves available two to three times per week for        racetrack at Talladega, Alabama, in a
employees to visit with them to present their ideas. These informal
meetings have generated a number of innovations, including
personalized home pages and Google News, which might otherwise
have never been adopted. Another illustration is when NASCAR banned
the Confederate flag, all the race car drivers and crews walked the
powerful support of the ban.

Some executives look to clan control to improve the performance of struggling organizations. In Florida,
officials became fed up with complaints about surly clerks within the state's driver's license offices. The solution
was to look for help with training employees from two companies that are well-known for friendly, engaged
employees and excellent customer service. The first was The Walt Disney Company, which offers world-famous
hospitality at its Orlando theme parks. The second was regional supermarket chain Publix, a firm whose motto
stressed that "shopping is a pleasure" in its stores. The goal of the training was to build the sort of positive team
spirit Disney and Publix enjoy. The state's highway safety director summarized the need for clan control when
noting that "we've just got to change a little culture out there" (Bousquet, 2005).

Clan control is also important on many college campuses. Philanthropic and social organizations such as clubs,
fraternities, and sororities often revolve around shared values and team spirit. More broadly, many campuses
have treasured traditions that bind alumni together across generations. Purdue University, for example, proudly
owns the world's largest drum. The drum is beaten loudly before home football games to fire up the crowd.
After athletic victories, Auburn University students throw rolls of toilet paper into campus oak trees. At Virginia
Tech, their spirit of service as modeled in their motto "That I May Serve" leads them to hold the largest Relay for
Life fundraising event on a university campus year after year. These examples and thousands of others spread
across the country's colleges and universities help students feel like they belong to something special.

Management Fads: Out of Control?

The emergence and disappearance of fads appears to be a predictable aspect of modern society. A fad arises when
 some element of culture--such as fashion, a toy, or a hairstyle--becomes enthusiastically embraced by a group of

    people. Fads also seem to be a predictable aspect of the business world. Below we illustrate several fads that
                executives have latched onto in an effort to improve their organizations' control systems.

             Table 10.8 Managing Management Fads

Management   A supervisor and an employee create a series of goals that provide structure and motivation for the

Sensitivity  Free-flowing group discussions are used to lead individuals toward greater understanding of themselves
Training     and others. Because a "mob mentality" can take over a group, sensitivity training too often degenerates
             into hostility and humiliation.

Culture      strong culture became viewed as crucial to organizational success. Within a few years, many of the
             "excellent" companies highlighted in the book had fallen on hard times. However, firms such as Disney
             continue to gain competitive advantage through their strong cultures.

Don't chase the latest management fads. The situation dictates which approach best accomplishes the team's
mission. -Colin Powell

The emergence and disappearance of fads appears to be a predictable aspect of modern society. A fad arises
when some element of popular culture becomes enthusiastically embraced by a group of people. Over the
past few decades, for example, fashion fads have included leisure suits (1970s), "Members Only" jackets (1980s),
platform shoes (1990s), Crocs (2000s), and torn jeans (2010s). Ironically, the reason a fad arises is also usually
the cause of its demise. The uniqueness (or even outrageousness) of a fashion, toy, or hairstyle creates "buzz"
and publicity but also ensures that its appeal is only temporary (Ketchen & Short, 2011).

Fads also seem to be a predictable aspect of the business world (Table 10.8 "Managing Management Fads"). As
with cultural fads, many provocative business ideas go through a life cycle of creating buzz, captivating a group
of enthusiastic adherents, and then giving way to the next fad. Bookstore shelves offer a seemingly endless
supply of popular management books whose premises range from the intriguing to the absurd. Within the
topic of leadership, for example, various books promise to reveal the "leadership secrets" of an eclectic array of
famous individuals such as Jesus Christ, Hillary Clinton, Attila the Hun, and Santa Claus.

Beyond the striking similarities between cultural and business fads, there are also important differences. Most
cultural fads are harmless, and they rarely create any long-term problems for those that embrace them. In
contrast, embracing business fads could lead executives to make bad decisions. As our quote from Colin
Powell suggests, relying on sound business practices is much more likely to help executives to execute their
organization's strategy than are generic words of wisdom from Old St. Nick.

                                  Chapter 10: Executing Strategy - Organizational Design | 287
Many management fads have been closely tied to organizational control systems. For example, one of the best-
known fads was an attempt to use output control to improve performance. Management by Objectives (MBO)
is a process wherein managers and employees work together to create goals. These goals guide employees'
behaviors and serve as the benchmarks for assessing their performance. Following the presentation of MBO in
Peter Drucker's 1954 book The Practice of Management, many executives embraced the process as a cure-all for
organizational problems and challenges.

Like many fads, however, MBO became a good idea run amok. Companies that attempted to create an objective
for every aspect of employees' activities eventually discovered that this was unrealistic. The creation of explicit
goals can conflict with activities involving tacit knowledge about the organization. Intangible notions such as
"providing excellent customer service," "treating people right," and "going the extra mile" are central to many
organizations' success, but these notions are difficult if not impossible to quantify. Thus, in some cases, getting
employees to embrace certain values and other aspects of clan control is more effective than MBO.

Quality circles were a second fad that built on the notion of behavioral control. Quality circles began in Japan in
the 1960s and were first introduced in the United States in 1972. A quality circle is a formal group of employees
that meets regularly to brainstorm solutions to organizational problems. As the name "quality circle" suggests,
identifying behaviors that would improve the quality of products and the operations management processes
that create the products was the formal charge of many quality circles.

While the quality circle fad depicted quality as the key driver of productivity, it quickly became apparent
that this perspective was too narrow. Instead, quality is just one of four critical dimensions of the production
process; speed, cost, and flexibility are also vital. Maximizing any one of these four dimensions often results in a
product that simply cannot satisfy customers' needs. Many products with perfect quality, for example, would be
created too slowly and at too great a cost to compete in the market effectively. Thus trade-offs among quality,
speed, cost, and flexibility are inevitable.

Improving clan control was the aim of sensitivity-training groups (or T-groups) that were used in many
organizations in the 1960s. This fad involved gatherings of approximately eight to fifteen white people openly
discussing their emotions, feelings, beliefs, and biases about workplace issues. In stark contrast to the rigid
nature of MBO, the T-group involved free-flowing conversations led by a facilitator. These discussions were
thought to lead individuals to greater understanding of themselves and others. The anticipated results were
more enlightened workers and a greater spirit of teamwork.

Research on social psychology has found that groups are often far crueler than individuals. Unfortunately, this
meant that the candid nature of T-group discussions could easily degenerate into accusations and humiliation.
Eventually, the T-group fad gave way to recognition that creating potentially hurtful situations has no place
within an organization. Hints of the softer side of T-groups can still be observed in modern team-building fads,
however. Perhaps the best known is the "trust game," which claims to build trust between employees by having
individuals fall backward and depend on their coworkers to catch them.

Improving clan control was the basis for the fascination with organizational culture that was all the rage in
the 1980s. This fad was fueled by a best-selling 1982 book titled In Search of Excellence: Lessons from America's
Best-Run Companies. Authors Tom Peters and Robert Waterman studied companies that they viewed as stellar
performers and distilled eight similarities that were shared across the companies. Most of the similarities,

288 | Chapter 10: Executing Strategy - Organizational Design
including staying "close to the customer" and "productivity through people," arose from powerful corporate
cultures. The book quickly became an international sensation; more than three million copies were sold in the
first four years after its publication.

Soon it became clear that organizational culture's importance was being exaggerated. Before long, both the
popular press and academic research revealed that many of Peters and Waterman's "excellent" companies
quickly had fallen on hard times. Basic themes such as customer service and valuing one's company are quite
useful, but these clan control elements often cannot take the place of holding employees accountable for their
performance.

                                                               The history of fads allows us to make certain

                                                               predictions about today's hot ideas, such as

                                                               empowerment, "good to great," and viral marketing.

                                                               Executives who distill and act on basic lessons from

                                                               these fads are likely to enjoy performance

                                                               improvements. Empowerment, for example, builds on

                                                               important  research  findings  regarding

                                                               offer to their firms, and these workers become more

                                                               Just as executives in the 1980s could not treat In Search

of Excellence as a recipe for success, today's executives should avoid treating James Collins's 2001 best-selling

book Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap...and Others Don't as a detailed blueprint for running

their companies. Overall, executives should understand that management fads usually contain a core truth that

can help organizations improve but that a balance of output, behavioral, and clan control is needed within most

organizations. As legendary author Jack Kerouac noted, "Great things are not accomplished by those who yield

to trends and fads and popular opinion."

Key Takeaway

 Organizational control systems are a vital aspect of executing strategy because they track
   performance and identify adjustments that need to be made. Output controls involve measurable
   results. Behavioral controls involve regulating activities rather than outcomes. Clan control relies
   on a set of shared values, expectations, traditions, and norms. Over time, a series of fads
   intended to improve organizational control processes have emerged. Although these fads tend to
   be seen as cure-alls initially, executives eventually realize that an array of sound business
   practices is needed to create effective organizational controls.

10.6 Legal Forms of Business

  Making a profit is a key goal for the overwhelming majority of firms. How a firm's owners benefit from profits
  and suffer from losses varies across different legal forms of business. Below we illustrate how profits and losses

                                                are treated within different business forms.

                                                                   Table 10.9 Business Forms
 Treatment of Profits and Losses within Different Business Forms
 A sole proprietorship is owned by one person. The firm and its owner are treated interchangeably--the owner is the only
 beneficiary of any profits and is personally responsible for any losses and debts. Most sole proprietorships are small, but
 entrepreneur James Cash Penney operated JCPenney as one for many years after buying out his two partners.
 In a partnership, two or more partners jointly own the firm. A successful partnership requires trust because profits and
 losses are shared and because each partner is accountable for the actions of others. Partnerships are a common business
 form for dental practices and law offices.
 A corporation such as Southwest Airlines separates ownership and management by issuing ownership shares that are
 publicly traded in stock markets. Shareholders do not directly receive profits or absorb losses, but profits and losses
 tend to be reflected in whether the firm's stock price rises or falls. Shareholders can also benefit from profits in the form
 of dividends. Most large companies are C corporations with multiple stockholders. A disadvantage of this business form
 is double taxation: taxes are paid on corporate profits and on any dividends that corporate pays to stockholders, at their
 personal tax rate. An S corporation is limited to 100 stockholders and is more for smaller companies. It does not have
 double taxation. Taxes are paid on profits distributed to stockholders at their personal tax rate.
 A limited liability company (LLC) can be thought of as a hybrid of a corporation and partnership. Like in a corporation,
 owners are not accountable for the firm's debts. A winner of a legal judgement against an LLC, for example, cannot claim
 the personal assets of the LLC's owners. LLC's also enjoy the management flexibility of partnerships. For federal tax
 purposes, an LLC must choose to be treated as a corporation, a partnership, or a sole proprietorship. Many architectural
 and consulting firms are organized as LLCs.

Choosing a Form of Business

The legal form a firm chooses to operate under is an important decision with implications for how a firm
structures its resources and assets. Several legal forms of business are available to executives. Each involves a
different approach to dealing with profits and losses (Table 10.9).
There are three primary considerations that firms should take into account when deciding which legal form of
business should be chosen. These are:

 1. How taxes are handled
2. How liability of the owners is handled
3. How easy to set up and operate the entity

                                                                                         Chapter 10: Executing Strategy - Organizational Design | 291
There are five basic forms of business entities:

 1. Sole Proprietorship
2. Partnership
3. Corporation
4. S Corporation
5. Limited Liability Company--LLC

A sole proprietorship is a firm that is owned by one person. From a legal perspective, the firm and its owner are
considered one and the same. On the plus side, this means that all profits are the property of the owner (after
taxes are paid, of course). On the minus side, however, the owner is personally responsible for the firm's losses
and debts. This presents a tremendous risk. If a sole proprietor is on the losing end of a significant lawsuit, for
example, the owner could find his personal assets forfeited. Most sole proprietorships are small and many have
no employees. In most towns, for example, there are a number of self-employed repair people, plumbers, and
electricians who work alone on home repair jobs. Also, many sole proprietors run their businesses from their
homes to avoid expenses associated with operating an office. Along with the disadvantage of personal liability
for the owner, sole proprietorships enjoy two advantages. Taxes on profits are assessed at the owner's personal
tax rate. Also, this is the easiest form of business to set up and operate.

In a partnership, two or more partners share ownership of a firm. A partnership is similar to a sole
proprietorship in that the partners are the only beneficiaries of the firm's profits, but they are also responsible
for any losses and debts. Partnerships can be especially attractive if each person's expertise complements the
others. For example, an accountant who specializes in preparing individual tax returns and another who has
mastered business taxes might choose to join forces to offer customers a more complete set of tax services
than either could offer alone.

From a practical standpoint, a partnership allows a person to take time off without closing down the business
temporarily. Sander & Lawrence is a partnership of two home builders in Tallahassee, Florida. When Lawrence
suffered a serious injury a few years ago, Sander was able to take over supervising his projects and see them
through to completion. Had Lawrence been a sole proprietor, his customers would have suffered greatly.
However, a person who chooses to be part of a partnership rather than operating alone as a sole proprietor
also takes on some risk; your partner could make bad decisions that end up costing you a lot of money. Thus
developing trust and confidence in one's partner is very important. As with the sole proprietorship, the owners
and the partnership are considered as one. Being personally liable for the debts and actions of the partnership
and the partner(s) is certainly a downside, however setting up a partnership is relatively easy. Taxes are also
paid at the partners individual rate, a tax advantage generally.

Most large firms, such as Southwest Airlines, are organized as corporations. A key difference between a
corporation and a sole proprietorship or partnership is that corporations involve the separation of ownership
and management. Corporations sell shares of ownership that are publicly traded in stock markets, and they are
managed by professional executives. These executives may own a significant portion of the corporation's stock,
but this is not a legal requirement.

Another unique feature of corporations is how they deal with profits and losses. Unlike in sole proprietorships

292 | Chapter 10: Executing Strategy - Organizational Design
and partnerships, a corporation's owners (i.e., shareholders) do not directly receive profits or absorb losses.
Instead, profits and losses indirectly affect shareholders in two ways. First, profits and losses tend to be
reflected in whether the firm's stock price rises or falls. When a shareholder sells her stock, the firm's
performance while she has owned the stock will influence whether she makes a profit relative to her stock
purchase. Shareholders can also benefit from profits if a firm's executives decide to pay cash dividends to
shareholders. Unfortunately, for shareholders, corporate profits and any dividends that these profits support
are both taxed. This double taxation is a big disadvantage of corporations. Corporations (also called C
corporations) are also the most difficult form of business to set up and have a number of regulations to comply
with.

A specialized type of corporation called an S corporation is designed for smaller companies.. Much like in a
partnership, the firm's profits and losses are reported on owners' personal tax returns in proportion with each
owner's share of the firm, so double taxation is avoided. Although this is an attractive feature, an S corporation
would be impractical for most large firms because the number of shareholders in an S corporation is capped,
usually at one hundred. In contrast, Southwest Airlines has more than ten thousand shareholders. For smaller
firms, such as many real-estate agencies, the S corporation is an attractive form of business. S corporations
also provide liability protection for their stockholders as C corporations do, and are easier to set up and operate
than C corporations.

A final form of business is very popular, yet it is not actually recognized by the federal government as a form
of business. Instead, the ability to create a limited liability company (LLC) is granted in state laws. LLCs
mix attractive features of corporations and partnerships. The owners of an LLC are not personally liable for
debts that the LLC accumulates (like in a corporation) and the LLC can be run in a flexible manner (like
in a partnership). When paying federal taxes, however, an LLC must choose to be treated as a corporation,
a partnership, or a sole proprietorship. Many home builders (including Sander & Lawrence), architectural
businesses, and consulting firms are LLCs. The ease of setting up and operating an LLC is similar to a sole
proprietorship or partnership.

   Key Takeaway

          The five major forms of business in the United States are sole proprietorships, partnerships,
             LLCs, and C and S corporations. Each form has implications for how individuals are taxed, the
             personal liability of the owners, and how resources are managed and deployed in the set up and
             operations.

   Exercises

         1. Why are so many small firms sole proprietorships?
        2. Find an example of a firm that operates as an LLC. Why do you think the owners of this firm

             chose this form of business over others?
        3. Why might different forms of business be more likely to rely on a different organizational

             structure?

294 | Chapter 10: Executing Strategy - Organizational Design
10.7 Conclusion

This chapter explains elements of organizational design that are vital for executing strategy. Leaders of firms,
ranging from the smallest sole proprietorship to the largest global corporation, must make decisions about
the delegation of authority and responsibility when organizing activities within their firms. Deciding how to
best divide labor to increase efficiency and effectiveness is often the starting point for more complex decisions
that lead to the creation of formal organizational charts. While small businesses rarely create organization
charts, firms that embrace functional, multidivisional, matrix, and boundaryless structures often have reporting
relationships with considerable complexity. To execute strategy effectively, managers also depend on the
skillful use of organizational control systems that involve output, behavioral, and clan controls. Although
introducing more efficient business practices to improve organizational functioning is desirable, executives
need to avoid letting their firms become "out of control" by being skeptical of management fads. Finally, the
legal form a business takes is an important decision with implications for a firm's organizational structure.

   Learning Objectives

     After reading this chapter, you should be able to understand and articulate answers to the following
     questions:

         1. What is the role of the firm's board of directors as it relates to ethical behavior of the firm?
        2. What is corporate social responsibility and its strategic role for a firm?
        3. What are the implications of the contemporary ethical questions and issues facing companies?

11.1 Introduction

Today, more than ever, stakeholders are placing a variety of ethical and socially responsible demands on firms
across industries. Subsequently, strategic management will be unsuccessful if it is performed in an ethical
vacuum. Strategy development and implementation must reflect the firm's mission, vision, and values. Ethical
assessments of the external and internal environments must be performed using accurate information and
transparent processes even in competitive environments. When firms attempt to gain a competitive advantage,
many companies engage in legitimate and accepted competitive tactics, but sometimes firms cross the line and
enter unethical, and perhaps illegal, space in their quest. The potential costs of unethical corporate business
practice is born by the perpetrator--if they are "caught." However, in many cases, like environmental dumping or

                                                                                                         Chapter 11: Leading an Ethical Organization | 297
exploitative labor practices, society and its members may pay the costs years before the firm does. Minimally,
business level, corporate level, and international strategy development should always occur within acceptable
practices in the industry and in light of the firm's own code of ethics and compliance. As firms move from "doing
right" to "doing good," and endorse corporate social responsibility philosophies and activities, employees,
managers, customers, and other stakeholders take pride and satisfaction in the impact their company has on
improving the society. Further, as contemporary societal expectations have shifted, firms have witnessed new
opportunities to turn corporate values and ethical decision-making into a competitive advantage within their
marketplace.

                                                                 basis for TOMS Shoes, which has now given away more

than one million pairs of shoes to those in need in more than 20 countries worldwide (Oloffson, 2010). The rise

of TOMS Shoes has inspired other companies that have adopted the "buy-one-give-one" philosophy. For

example, the Good Little Company donates a meal for every package purchased (Nicolas, 2011). This business

model has also been successfully applied to selling (and donating) other items such as glasses and books.

The social initiatives that drive TOMS Shoes stand in stark contrast to the criticisms that plagued Nike
Corporation, where claims of human rights violations, ranging from the use of sweatshops and child labor to
lack of compliance with minimum wage laws, were rampant in the 1990s (McCall, 1998). While Nike struggled
to win back confidence in buyers that were concerned with their business practices, TOMS social initiatives
are a source of excellent publicity in pride in those who purchase their products. As further testament to their
popularity, TOMS has engaged in partnerships with Nordstrom, Disney, and Element Skateboards.

Although the idea of social entrepreneurship and the birth of firms such as TOMS Shoes are relatively new, a
push toward social initiatives has been the source of debate for executives for decades. Issues that have sparked
particularly fierce debate include CEO pay and the role of today's modern corporation. More than a quarter of
a century ago, famed economist Milton Friedman argued, "The social responsibility of business is to increase

298 | Chapter 11: Leading an Ethical Organization
its profits." This notion is now being challenged by firms such as TOMS and their entrepreneurial CEO, who
argue that serving other stakeholders beyond the owners and shareholders can be a powerful, inspiring, and
successful motivation for growing business.
This chapter discusses some of the key issues and decisions relevant to understanding corporate and business
ethics. These issues include how to govern large corporations in an effective and ethical manner, what
behaviors are considered best practices in regard to corporate social performance, and how different
generational perspectives and biases may hold a powerful influence on important decisions. Understanding
these issues may provide knowledge that can encourage effective organizational leadership like that of TOMS
Shoes and discourage the criticisms of many firms associated with the corporate scandals of the late 1990s and
early 2000s.

Corporate Scandals and Sarbanes-Oxley Act

often lead to the forfeiture of millions of dollars as well as prison sentences. We illustrate some notable corporate

In the 1990s and early 2000s, several corporate scandals were revealed in the United States that showed a lack
of board vigilance. Perhaps the most famous involves Enron, whose executive antics were documented in the
film The Smartest Guys in the Room. Enron used accounting loopholes to hide billions of dollars in failed deals.
When their scandal was discovered, top management cashed out millions in stock options while preventing
lower-level employees from selling their stock. The collective acts of Enron led many employees to lose all
their retirement holdings and their jobs, stockholders lost $74 billion, and many Enron execs were sentenced
to prison. This scandal also caused the dissolution of Enron's outside accounting firm, Arthur Anderson, one of
the five largest accounting firms in the world at the time.

Around the same time as Enron, other corporate scandals created colossal damage. WorldCom, a
telecommunications firm, inflated its assets. When discovered, shareholders lost $180 billion and 30,000
employees lost their jobs. Another famous one is Tyco, where the CEO and CFO stole $150 million and inflated
the company revenues by $500 million. Before being discovered, the CEO threw a birthday party for his wife on
a Mediterranean island that cost $2 million, paid with company funds. The CEO and CFO both went to prison.

In response to notable corporate scandals at Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, and other firms, Congress passed

300 | Chapter 11: Leading an Ethical Organization
sweeping new legislation with the hopes of restoring investor confidence while preventing future scandals
(Table 11.1). Signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2002, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act contained 11 aspects
that represented some of the most far-reaching reforms since the presidency of Franklin Roosevelt. These
reforms create improved standards that affect all publicly traded firms in the United States. The key elements
of each aspect of the act are summarized as follows:

 1. Because accounting firms were implicated in corporate scandals, an oversight board was created to
      oversee auditing activities.

 2. Standards now exist to ensure auditors are truly independent and not subject to conflicts of interest in
      regard to the companies they represent.

 3. Enron executives claimed that they had no idea what was going on in their company, but the Sarbanes-
      Oxley Act requires senior executives to take personal responsibility for the accuracy of financial
      statements.

 4. Enhanced reporting is now required to create more transparency in regard to a firm's financial condition.
 5. Securities analysts must disclose potential conflicts of interest.
 6. To prevent CEOs from claiming tax fraud is present at their firms, CEOs must personally sign the firm's

      tax return.
 7. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) now has expanded authority to censor or bar securities

      analysts from acting as brokers, advisers, or dealers.
 8. Reports from the comptroller general are required to monitor any consolidations among public

      accounting firms, the role of credit agencies in securities market operations, securities violations, and
      enforcement actions.
 9. Criminal penalties now exist for altering or destroying financial records.
10. Significant criminal penalties now exist for white-collar crimes.
11. The SEC can freeze unusually large transactions if fraud is suspected.

The changes that encouraged the creation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act were so sweeping that comedian Jon
Stewart quipped, "Did Wall Street have any rules before this? Can you just shoot a guy for looking at you
wrong?" Despite the considerable merits of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, no legislation can provide a cure-all for
corporate scandal (Table 11.2). As evidence, the scandal by Bernard Madoff that broke in 2008 represented the
largest investor fraud ever committed by an individual. But in contrast to some previous scandals that resulted
in relatively minor punishments for their perpetrators, Madoff was sentenced to 150 years in prison.

 In the early 2000s, highly publicized fraud at Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, and other firms revealed significant issues
 including conflicts of interest by auditors and securities analysts, boardroom failures, and inadequate funding of
 the Securities and Exchange Commission. In response, Senator Paul Sarbanes and Representative Michael Oxley

     sponsored legislation that contained what former President George. W. Bush called "the most far-reaching
  reforms of American business practices since the time of Franklin D. Roosevelt." We outline the 11 key aspects of

                                                                    the law below.

Did the Sarbanes-Oxley Act help reduce corporate scandals? Maybe, but unfortunately they have continued.
Some more notable ones are HealthSouth (2003), Freddie Mac (2004), American Insurance Group AIG (2005),
Lehman Brothers (2008), Bernie Madoff (2008). Accounting and financial misdeeds are not the only type
or corporate scandals that still plague the corporate environment. Sadly, more recent scandals involved
Volkswagen (emissions fraud), Uber (sexual harassment), Apple (deliberately slowing devices), Facebook (data
harvesting without consent), Boeing (skirting FAA rules), and various pharmaceutical companies that
unethically pushed sales of opiate medications, increasing the opioid epidemic. As noted, not all corporate
scandals are financial in nature, but typically are driven by greed and provide a financial benefit for individuals
or companies.

302 | Chapter 11: Leading an Ethical Organization
Ethics and CSR as Corporate Strategy

One positive outcome of the corporate scandals has been an increased focus by firms on corporate ethics.
Many companies now have an Ethics and Compliance Officer and a detailed Ethics and Compliance Code. For
example, Walmart's Global Ethics and Compliance Program is provided online for the public and has numerous
pages (Walmart, n.d.). Many firms provide annual training to all its employees on their company's ethics and
compliance standards.

   Here is the Table of Contents for Facebook's Code of Conduct. Although this is a typical approach to a Code of
Conduct, it doesn't mean a company is necessarily perceived as ethical. This is particularly true lately as Facebook

  contends with pressure to change its commitments to "free speech" with accusations of promoting hate speech.

Another form of regulation designed to prevent corporate misbehavior are "whistleblower" laws and policies.
Many firms intentionally encourage employees to report any suspected misconduct by the firm, its managers,
or employees. A "whistleblower" hotline is often provided where suspected violations can be reported
anonymously. Anti-retaliation policies encourage employees to come forward to report misconduct without
fear of retaliation or losing their job. Although all these measures are helpful, unfortunately, fraud and
misconduct still occur.

In response to persistent "rule-breaking" by corporate actors, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) emerged
in the 1970s to assert that a "social contract" exists between business and society. At its base is the assumption
that businesses thrive when the society it relies on thrives, and therefore, firms have a duty to provide more
than profit back to its environment. It is a business model that attempts to "give back" to the members of the

                                                                                                         Chapter 11: Leading an Ethical Organization | 303
community or society that help the firm succeed through the purchasing of its products or services. The goal of
CSR is to enhance the success of a business by enhancing the society in which the organization operates. It can
take the form of philanthropy or donating funds to causes it believes are important to its stakeholders. Some
forms of CSR include corporate volunteerism, such as asking company employees to volunteer to build a Habitat
for Humanity house on a Saturday. Improving environmental sustainability is one of the most recognized recent
forms of CSR.
Many firms adopt the Triple Bottom Line approach to guide their CSR philosophy. In the triple bottom line,
the company focuses on the three P's; profit, planet, and people. CSR is discussed in more detail later in this
chapter.

   Key Takeaway

          Firms can have a positive or negative impact on society. Corporate scandals have caused
             tremendous losses for shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders. The government has
             passed various regulations such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in attempts to thwart unethical and
             illegal company behavior, yet this behavior continues. Company boards of directors have the
             ultimate responsibility of ensuring ethical behavior on the part of the organization and its CEO.
             Senior management may be tempted to act in their own interest instead of the best interests of
             the firm, which is called the agency problem. On the positive side, many firms have adopted the
             philosophy and activities of corporate social responsibility or creating shared value. Ethical
             issues will confront firms and their leadership teams. Adhering to the companies' core values and
             keeping the best interests of the firm as the priority will help guide leaders to the best decisions.

11.3 Corporate Governance

The Many Roles of Boards of Directors

"You're fired!" is a commonly used phrase most closely associated with Donald Trump as he dismissed
candidates on his reality show, The Apprentice. But who would have the power to utter these words to today's
CEOs, whose paychecks are on par with many of the top celebrities and athletes in the world? This honor
belongs to the board of directors--a group of individuals that oversees the activities of an organization or
corporation.

Potentially firing or hiring a CEO is one of many roles played by the board of directors in their charge to provide
effective corporate governance for the firm. An effective board plays many roles, ranging from the approval
of financial objectives, advising on strategic issues, making the firm aware of relevant laws, and representing
stakeholders who have an interest in the long-term performance of the firm (Table 11.1 "Board Roles"). Effective
boards may help bring prestige and important resources to the organization. For example, General Electric's
board often has included the CEOs of other firms as well as former senators and prestigious academics. Blake
Mycoskie of TOMS Shoes was touted as an ideal candidate for an "all-star" board of directors because of his
ability to fulfill his company's mission "to show how together we can create a better tomorrow by taking
compassionate action today" (Bunting, 2011).

One of the key stakeholders of a corporation is generally agreed to be the shareholders of the company's
stock. Most large, publicly traded firms in the United States are made up of thousands of shareholders. While
5% ownership in many ventures may seem modest, this amount is considerable in publicly traded companies,
where such ownership is generally limited to other companies, and ownership in this amount could result in
representation on the board of directors.

The possibility of conflicts of interest is considerable in public corporations. A conflict of interest exists when a
person could receive personal benefit from decisions they make in their official capacity. For example, if a firm's
purchasing agent's husband owns an office supply company that could sell products to the firm, the purchasing
agent has a conflict of interest, On the one hand, CEOs favor large salaries and job stability, and these desires
are often accompanied by a tendency to make decisions that would benefit the firm (and their salaries) in the
short term at the expense of decisions considered over a longer time horizon. In contrast, shareholders prefer
decisions that will grow the value of their stock in the long term. This separation of interest creates an agency
problem wherein the interests of the individuals that manage the company (agents such as the CEO) may not
align with the interest of the owners (such as stockholders).

The Ethisphere Institute presents an annual listing of the #WorldsMostEthicalCompanies at
https://www.worldsmostethicalcompanies.com/honorees.

The composition of the board is critical because the dynamics of the board play an important part in resolving
the agency problem. However, who exactly should be on the board is an issue that has been subject to fierce
debate. CEOs often favor the use of board insiders who often have intimate knowledge of the firm's business

306 | Chapter 11: Leading an Ethical Organization
affairs. In contrast, many institutional investors such as mutual funds and pension funds that hold large blocks
of stock in the firm often prefer significant representation by board outsiders that provide a fresh, unbiased
perspective concerning a firm's actions.

One particularly controversial issue in regard to board composition is the potential for CEO duality, a situation
in which the CEO is also the chairman of the board of directors. This has also been known to create a bitter
divide within a corporation.

For example, during the 1990s, The Walt Disney Company was often listed in BusinessWeek's rankings for having
one of the worst board of directors (Lavelle, 2002). In 2005, Disney's board forced the separation of then CEO
(and chairman of the board) Michael Eisner's dual roles. Eisner retained the role of CEO but later stepped down
from Disney entirely. Disney's story reflects a changing reality that boards are acting with considerably more
influence than in previous decades when they were viewed largely as rubber stamps that generally folded to
the whims of the CEO.

 William Shakespeare once wrote, "All the world's a stage, and the men and women merely players." This analogy
applies well to boards of directors. When the performance of board members is impressive, the company is able to
 put on a dynamic show. But if a board member phones in their role, failure may soon follow. Discussed below are

                                               the different roles board members may play.

Managing CEO Compensation

One of the most visible roles of boards of directors is setting CEO pay. The valuation of the human capital
associated with the rare talent possessed by some CEOs can be illustrated in a story of an encounter one tourist
had with the legendary artist Pablo Picasso. As the story goes, Picasso was once spotted by a woman sketching.
Overwhelmed with excitement at the serendipitous meeting, the tourist offered Picasso fair market value if he
would render a quick sketch of her image. After completing his commission, she was shocked when he asked
for five thousand francs, responding, "But it only took you a few minutes." Undeterred, Picasso retorted, "No, it
took me all my life" (Kay, 1999).

                                                                                                         Chapter 11: Leading an Ethical Organization | 307
                                                    This story illustrates the complexity associated with managing
                                                    CEO compensation. On the one hand, large corporations must
                                                    pay competitive wages for the scarce talent that is needed to
                                                    manage billion-dollar corporations. In addition, like celebrities
                                                    and sport stars, CEO pay is much more than a function of a day's
                                                    work for a day's pay. CEO compensation is a market driven
                                                    function of the competitive wages that other corporations would
                                                    offer for a potential CEO's services.

                                                    On the other hand, boards will face considerable scrutiny from

                                                    investors if CEO pay is out of line with industry norms. From the

                                                    year 1980 to 2000, the gap between CEO pay and worker pay grew

                                                    from 42 to 1 to 475 to 1 (Blumenthal, 2000). Although efforts to

                                                    close this gap have been made, as recently as 2019 reports

                                                    indicate the ratio continues to be as high as 278 to 1. This is much

                                                    higher than other countries, for example, Germany's is half the US

                                                    ratio (Cox, 2019). Meanwhile, shareholders need to be aware that

$100 million.                                       compensation (Tosi et al., 2000). Consequently, when a CEO tries

to grow a company, such as by acquiring a rival firm, shareholders should question whether such growth is in

the company's best interest or whether it is simply an effort by the CEO to get a pay raise.

     Within American firms, the average CEO is paid over 200 times what the typical worker makes--one of the
 highest ratios in the world. Many CEOs also receive perks that the average employee could only dream possible.
Such perks are trouble to the extent that they reflect the board's lack of vigilance in monitoring CEO spending. We

                                                        illustrate a few examples below.

                                                                      Table 11.5 CEO Perks
Perks of Being a CEO
Former Tyco CEO Dennis Koslowski--now a convicted felon--threw a week-long $2 million birthday bash for his wife that
included an ice-sculpture of Michelangelo's David that dispensed vokda--top shelf, of course!
A pint-sized matter compared to the lavish perks of many executives, the sweet tooth should be satisfied for former Ben
& Jerry's CEO Robert Holland Jr., who will receive free ice cream for life.
Golden parachutes where CEOs receive large cash settlements if fired are common in publicly traded companies. Less
common is the "golden coffin" that provides big settlements if an executive passes away in office. Abercrombie & Fitch
CEO Michael Jefferies was offered $6 million for his loyalty to the company...dead or alive.
Foreclosure! Countrywide Financial, now owned by Bank of America, paid nearly $1 million for their executives' country
club memberships between 2003 through 2006.
Although Don Tyson of Tyson Foods retired in 2001, Tyson employees mowed his yard and cleaned his house to keep
things tidy post retirement.

In most publicly traded firms, CEO compensation generally includes guaranteed salary, cash bonus, and stock
options. But perks provide another valuable source of CEO compensation (Table 11.4 "CEO Perks"). In addition
to the controversy surrounding CEO pay, such perks associated with holding the position of CEO have also

308 | Chapter 11: Leading an Ethical Organization
come under considerable scrutiny. The term perks, derived from perquisite, refers to special privileges, or
rights, as a function of one's position. CEO perks have ranged in magnitude from the sweet benefit of ice
cream for life given to former Ben & Jerry's CEO Robert Holland, to much more extreme benefits that raise the
ears of investors while outraging employees. One such perk was provided to John Thain who, as former head
of NYSE Euronext, received more than $1 million to renovate his office. While such perks may provide
powerful incentives to stay with a company, they may result in considerable negative press and serve only to
motivate vigilant investors wary of the value of such investments to shop elsewhere.

As noted earlier in this chapter, sometimes CEOs get involved in corporate scandals, seeking their own self
interest instead of the best interests of the company. But this problem can be much more subtle than creating
a scandal, and not limited to CEOs. An agency problem exists whenever an "agent" of the company, typically
senior management, acts in their own self interest at the expense of the best interests of the firm. For example,
a CEO may push for the acquisition of another company to enhance his or her salary and legacy when that
acquisition is not a wise move. They may decide to expand into Spain instead of the United Kingdom because
they prefer to travel to sunny Spain with its great food instead of the rainy United Kingdom, even though
the United Kingdom is the better choice. Selfish or self-centered motives can influence decision making in
ways that are difficult to detect. At times, the decision maker may feel justified in the decision and not realize
their impure motives behind the decision. The board of directors and the decision makers themselves need to
recognize that the agency problem exists and guard against it in their organization. The agency problem also
exists in politics, and at times politicians are accused of making decisions that benefit themselves over their
constituents.

The Market for Corporate Governance

The terms associated with mergers, acquisitions, and the actions used by executives to block these moves often
                   sound like material from the latest war movie. We explain important terms below.

Table 11.6 Takeover Terms

Defenses against takeovers are often referred to as shark repellent. We illustrate a few below.

                                                               Chapter 11: Leading an Ethical Organization | 309
An old investment clich encourages individuals to buy low and sell high. When a publicly traded firm loses
value, often due to lack of vigilance on the part of the CEO and/or board, a company may become a target of
a takeover wherein another firm or set of individuals purchases the company. Generally, the top management
team is charged with revitalizing the firm and maximizing its assets.
In some cases, the takeover is in the form of a leveraged buyout (LBO) in which a publicly traded company
is purchased with sizable debt and then taken off the stock market. One of the most famous LBOs was of
RJR Nabisco, which inspired the book (and later film) Barbarians at the Gate. LBOs are historically associated
with reduction in workforces to streamline processes and decrease costs. The managers who instigate buyouts
generally bring a more entrepreneurial mind-set to the firm with the hopes of creating a turnaround from the
same fate that made the company an attractive takeover target (recent poor performance) (Wright et al., 2001).
Many takeover attempts increase shareholder value. However, because most takeovers are associated with
the dismissal of previous management, the terminology associated with change of ownership has a decidedly
negative slant against the acquiring firm's management team. For example, individuals or firms that hope to
conduct a takeover are often referred to as corporate raiders. An unsolicited takeover attempt is often dubbed
a hostile takeover, with shark repellent as one of the potential defenses against such attempts. Although the
poor management of a targeted firm is often the reason such businesses are potential takeover targets, when
another firm that may be more favorable to existing management enters the picture as an alternative buyer, a
white knight is said to have entered the picture (Table 11.3 "Takeover Terms").
The negative tone of takeover terminology also extends to the potential target firm. CEOs as well as board
members are likely to lose their positions after a successful takeover occurs, and a number of anti-takeover
tactics have been used by boards to deter a corporate raid. For example, many firms are said to pay greenmail
by repurchasing large blocks of stock at a premium to avoid a potential takeover. Firms may threaten to take
a poison pill where additional stock is sold to existing shareholders, increasing the shares needed for a viable
takeover. Even if the takeover is successful and the previous CEO is dismissed, a golden parachute that includes
a lucrative financial settlement is likely to provide a soft landing for the ousted executive.

   Key Takeaway

          Firms can benefit from superior corporate governance mechanisms such as an active board that
             monitors CEO actions, provides strategic advice, and helps to network to other useful resources.
             When such mechanisms are not in place, CEO excess may go unchecked, resulting in negative
             publicity, poor firm performance, and the potential for a takeover by other firms. An agency
             problem exists when the CEO acts in their own best interest instead of the best interest of the
             firm.

   Exercises

         1. Divide the class into teams and see who can find the most egregious CEO perk in the last year.
        2. Find a listing of members of a board of directors for a Fortune 500 firm. Does the board seem to

             be composed of individuals who are likely to fulfill all the board roles effectively?
        3. Research a hostile takeover in the past five years and examine the long-term impact on the firm's

             stock market performance. Was the takeover beneficial or harmful for shareholders?
        4. Examine the AFL-CIO Executive Paywatch website https://aflcio.org/paywatch and select a

             company of interest to see how many years you would need to work to earn a year's pay enjoyed
             by the firm's CEO.

11.4 Corporate Ethics and Social Responsibility

What Is Corporate Social Responsibility?

As introduced early in this chapter, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) "is a self-regulating business model
that helps a company be socially accountable--to itself, its stakeholders, and the public. By practicing corporate
social responsibility, also referred to simply as social responsibility, companies can be conscious of the kind of
impact they are having on all aspects of society, including economic, social, and environmental" (Chen, 2020).
Philanthropy is the simplest form of CSR, where a firm donates funds to a nonprofit organization such as the
local volunteer rescue squad or the American Cancer Society. However, CSR can take many forms, with the end
result that society benefits in some way. Environmental efforts in CSR might include reducing the company's
pollution or helping to clean up the plastic that washes up on beaches. Supporting the local literacy volunteers
by encouraging employees to participate to help adults learn to read and write provides a social benefit.
312 | Chapter 11: Leading an Ethical Organization
                Figure 11.3: The CSR Pyramid shown illustrates the ever-increasing responsibilities of a firm that
                engages in a CSR philosophy and the associated activities.

The CSR approach is not without controversy. When CSR was introduced, the famous economist Milton
Friedman opposed CSR on philosophical grounds. He believed, as some others did, that no profits should be
diverted for CSR activities. The logic was that company investors and stockholders took a risk when they
invested in the company, and therefore the company's first obligation is to them. On the other hand, many
who practice CSR believe that CSR activities ultimately do benefit the company investors and stockholders. The
belief is that having a CSR strategy provides good public relations for the firm and enhances their brand image,
creating loyalty and more sales long term. For example, some consumers may specifically shop for TOMS shoes
because of the firm's Buy One, Give One model, where the consumer feels their purchase is providing a positive
social impact.

Some examples of CSR efforts are:

   Reducing their carbon footprint--Coca Cola
   Ensuring contract manufacturers pay a living wage--Patagonia
   Improving sustainable manufacturing--BMW
   Matches employees' donations to nonprofits--Microsoft and Google
   Reducing carbon emissions--United Airlines
   Promoting literacy among children--Twitter

                                                                                                         Chapter 11: Leading an Ethical Organization | 313

   Donating employees' hours to children's tutoring--Salesforce

One criticism of CSR is that it is seen as an "add on" endeavor for firms. Often, CSR is not an ingrained
component of the firm's philosophy and operations. In response to this criticism, a rather new movement
emerged in an attempt to remedy this deficiency. Michael Porter and Mark Kramer suggest that instead of CSR,
wise corporations are shifting to a Creating Shared Value (CSV) model that argues that firms should address
social issues by creating shared value, which is fundamentally focused on expanding the total pool of social and
economic resources (Porter & Kramer, 2006; Porter & Kramer, 2011). Porter and Kramer re-frame the business
proposition by trying to recognize that "societal needs, not just conventional economic needs, define markets,
and social harms can create internal costs for firms" (Porter & Kramer, 2011).
Creating shared value (CSV) is a business strategy that creates a direct link between the success of the firm
and the improvement of society. Generally, CSV can be considered to be a particular strategic approach within
the more general CSR landscape. A key differentiating detail is the explicit focus of CSV in generating positive
economic outcomes through its strategic investments. As a company prospers economically, so do those it
impacts. However, CSV and CSR both take a longer-term, rather than a short-term, approach to measuring
impact. For example, Whole Foods was one of the most high profile companies to adopt CSV as a guiding
strategy. This strategy translated into investing in local schools to ensure a well prepared work force and
supporting local agricultural communities so it could reliably source produce from local vendors. While one
traditional view of "business as usual" is that when a company prospers, it is at the expense of the consumer
and society. CSV and CSR flip this view.

Measuring Corporate Social Performance

TOMS Shoes' commitment to donating a pair of shoes for every pair sold illustrates the concept of social
entrepreneurship, in which a business is created with a goal of improving both business and society
(Schectman, 2010). Using a CSR model, firms such as TOMS exemplify a desire to improve corporate social
performance (CSP) in which a commitment to individuals, communities, and the natural environment is valued
alongside the goal of creating economic value. Although determining the level of a firm's social responsibility
is subjective, this challenge has been addressed by other organizations that rate firms on a number of
stakeholder-related issues with the goal of measuring CSP. They conduct ongoing research on social,
governance, and environmental performance metrics of publicly traded firms and reports such statistics to
institutional investors. For example, the KLD database provides ratings on numerous "strengths" and "concerns"
for each firm along a number of dimensions associated with corporate social performance (Table 11.6
"Measuring Corporate Social Performance"). The results of their assessment are used to develop the Domini
social investments fund, which has performed at levels roughly equivalent to the S&P 500. Some rating firms
use an ESG framework for evaluating a firm. ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance, and
measures within each of these three dimensions are used to score a company.

 Corporate social performance is defined as the degree to which a firm's actions honor ethical values that respect
  individuals, communities, and the natural environment. Determining whether a firm is socially responsible is
   somewhat subjective, but one popular approach has been developed by KLD Research & Analytics. Their work

 tracks "strengths" and "concerns" for hundreds of firms over time. KLD's findings are used by investors to screen
   socially responsible firms and by scholars who are interested in explaining corporate social performance. We
                                        illustrate the six key dimensions tracked by KLD below.

Assessing the community dimension of CSP is accomplished by assessing community strengths, such as
charitable or innovative giving that supports housing, education, or relations with indigenous peoples, as well as
charitable efforts worldwide, such as volunteer efforts or in-kind giving. A firm's CSP rating is lowered when a
firm is involved in tax controversies or other negative actions that affect the community, such as plant closings
that can negatively affect property values.

                                                                       Chapter 11: Leading an Ethical Organization | 315
CSP diversity strengths are scored positively when the

company is known for promoting women and

minorities, especially for board membership and the

CEO position. Employment of people with disabilities

and the presence of family benefits such as child or

elder care would also result in a positive score by KLD.

Diversity concerns include fines or civil penalties in

conjunction with an affirmative action or other

diversity-related controversy. Lack of representation

by women on top management positions--suggesting

that a glass ceiling is present at a company--would also

negatively impact scoring on this dimension.              Figure 11.4: Chick-fil-A encourages education through their

profit sharing and employee stock-option plans,

favorable retirement benefits, and positive health and safety programs noted by the US Occupational Health

and Safety Administration. Employee relations concerns would be evident in poor union relations, as well as

fines paid due to violations of health and safety standards. Substantial workforce reductions as well as concerns

about adequate funding of pension plans also warrant concern for this dimension.

The environmental dimension records strengths by examining engagement in recycling, preventing pollution,
or using alternative energies. KLD would also score a firm positively if profits derived from environmental
products or services were a part of the company's business. Environmental concerns such as penalties for
hazardous waste, air, water, or other violations or actions such as the production of goods or services that could
negatively impact the environment would reduce a firm's CSP score.

Product quality/safety strengths exist when a firm has an established and/or recognized quality program;
product quality safety concerns are evident when fines related to product quality and/or safety have been
discovered or when a firm has been engaged in questionable marketing practices or paid fines related to
antitrust practices or price fixing.

Corporate governance strengths are evident when lower levels of compensation for top management and board
members exist, or when the firm owns considerable interest in another company rated favorably by KLD;
corporate governance concerns arise when executive compensation is high or when controversies related to
accounting, transparency, or political accountability exist.

   Key Takeaway

          Many companies have adopted a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) philosophy to make
             improvements in the communities and society they operate. CSR is evolving to a Creating Shared
             Value (CSV) model which integrates the profit motive with solving social issues. Firms such as
             KLD provide objective measures of both positive and negative actions related to corporate social
             performance.

   Exercises

         1. How would your college or university fare if rated on the dimensions of CSR? Of CSV?
        2. Do you believe that executives behave more ethically as a result of legislation such as the

             Sarbanes-Oxley Act? Why or why not?

11.5 Contemporary Questions of Corporate Ethics

The subject of corporate ethics is an ever-evolving theme. Sometimes companies and the individuals in those
companies cross the line and commit acts that are unethical, immoral, or illegal. Society has attempted to
erect barriers to prevent these activities from happening by passing laws and regulations, expecting a strict
code of ethics and conduct, and providing measures of a firm's social contribution. Depending on which party
is in power in Washington, laws and regulations are relaxed because they are "bad for business," or they are
strengthened to "protect the people." Unfortunately, whatever the legal climate, violations of society's standards
and expectations continue to occur, and it is critical to recognize that laws represent the minimum ethical
standard tolerated by a society.
Firms committed to ethical business practices must start by recognizing that just because an action is legal,
it does not mean it is ethical. Strategists understand the importance of this distinction because it will be the
organization's stakeholders, and not the legal system, that will decide if the firm is satisfactorily ethical. For
example, the 2020 boycott by advertisers of Facebook was a reaction to Facebook's failure to take a more active
position on hate speech, but Facebook's decisions did not break any laws. (Fung, 2020).
This leads to questions about contemporary corporate ethics. In a global economy, where US companies are
competing against cell phones from South Korean companies and Belgian chocolates, ethical questions arise
as to the best path for a company to follow. Will companies stick to their core values statements when ethical
decision making gets tough? Some of these questions are explored below.

318 | Chapter 11: Leading an Ethical Organization
Stakeholder Considerations

Bottom of the Pyramid Mini Case

In 2017, 8.6% of the world population controlled 86.3% of global wealth. This disparity continues to increase.
This left about 3.5 billion people at the "bottom of the pyramid" (BOP) making $10,000 or less annually. This
group has largely been ignored by business, assuming they did not have the means to purchase goods other
than subsistence items (Prahalad, 2019).

Some companies are recognizing that this market of nearly half the world's population may be a viable market
and in doing so, provide the world's poor with access to low-cost products that would improve the quality of
their daily lives. There are three factors causing the increased interest in this market:

   The rise in income of this group in the last several decades.
   The widespread use of cell phone technology among the world's poor, lowering the cost of

      communication and learning. Banking is even done by cell phone in some poor countries.
   The rise of corporate social responsibility and creating shared value philosophies among companies in

      richer nations (Prahalad, 2019).

Companies entering this market have used the strategy of "low price, low margins, high volumes" in attempts
to gain profitability, but this strategy required appropriately 30% market penetration to be successful. Proctor
and Gamble launched its PUR(R) water purification powder on a large scale with this strategy but failed, not
achieving sufficient penetration and volumes. Dupont attempted the same strategy selling protein powder
packets to fortify foods, but failed for the same reason (Simanis, 2012).

There are criticisms of BOP strategies that extend beyond their failure to achieve market penetration. These
BOP critics argue that the targeted marketing of the world's poorest people is exploitative and will
systematically keep the poor in poverty by pushing out local suppliers and failing to provide sustainable
structures for local employment in their place. Pointedly, they suggest that this approach perpetuates the
conditions it is trying to improve.

What can firms like P&G and Dupont do to be successful in the market? How do they need to change their
strategy? How can this be a win-win for the company and those at the bottom of the pyramid, or can it? Should
firms be engaging in this strategy at all?

Offshoring

As US wages increased, and with improvements in communications and transportation, many US companies
offshored their activities. Often, manufacturing operations were closed down in the United States and
performed in a country where the labor costs were much cheaper. The result has been the loss of thousands

                                                                                                         Chapter 11: Leading an Ethical Organization | 319
of jobs in the US, with plants closed down and communities left devastated. Another aspect of offshoring
has been in the service sector, with US firms setting up their call centers abroad, along with IT services and
even accounting services. Importantly, offshoring impacts the working conditions of people around the world,
generally in the poorest economies with the least labor protections. Workers in agricultural and garment
industries are particularly vulnerable to labor exploitation in the global supply chain (British Standards
Institution, 2019), and global concerns about child labor are well documented (Moulds, n.d.).

The ethical question is, "Is offshoring ethical?" Justifications can be made on both sides of the issue. US
companies compete in a global marketplace, and the dominant argument has been that if they had to pay US
wages, they could not compete internationally. Also, in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States
had record low unemployment, so the need to return jobs to the United States was questionable. Conversely,
the loss of good jobs and the resulting blight of closed facilities in communities across the country are just not
worth the advantage of offshoring, in the opinion of some. As of 2018, efforts are being made by the federal
government to encourage manufacturers to return to the United States, which include imposing additional
tariffs on some goods made abroad. One outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic was the realization that the
United States depends on foreign countries for many essential products, such as pharmaceuticals and face
masks. This dependency, especially on China, a political adversary, gave more merit to the argument of reducing
offshoring.

Of course, other countries besides the United States pursue cheap labor costs. Sometimes, this can lead to
increased labor exploitation abroad, as foreign manufacturers compete against each other on price. This can
even lead to labor exploitation at home, with the threat of offshoring to reduce wages and benefits. Conversely,
ethical companies have produced the opposite effect abroad, making their suppliers pay fair wages if they want
their business. Child labor has been reduced in developing countries because US firms required their suppliers
to not use child labor. In an interesting twist, some industries are turning to the American South for cheap
manufacturing labor. (Roberts, 2018)

Offshoring is a complicated strategic question, and without considering the full context of the questions facing
the firm within its external environment, a strategist could easily make a short-sighted decision.

Environment/Climate Change/Sustainability

Another debate involving multiple world-wide stakeholders relates to environmental sustainability and global
warming. As in offshoring, there are opposing forces that tip the scale one way or the other. On one side is
the health of the economy and business environment. The opposing side is the health of the planet and its
inhabitants; people, animals, and plant life. As environmental forces gain traction and laws and regulations are
implemented by governments, some believe this hurts the economy, businesses, and employment. On the flip
side, as regulations are loosened, others believe it contributes to increased pollution, poorer human health, and
global warming with all its implications for drought, rising sea levels, and loss of animal and plant species.

These arguments have been going on since the early 1970's with the passage of the Clean Air Act and Clean
Water Act by Congress. Some take the position that the dichotomy of opposing forces does not have to exist,

320 | Chapter 11: Leading an Ethical Organization
that movements toward clean renewable energy sources or reducing pollution are overall good for the business
environment, stimulating innovation, efficiency, and job creation. Even though it may cost a manufacturer
millions of dollars to retrofit their plant to reduce pollution, these costs can be made up and the overall
impact is positive. The pendulum swings back and forth on this issue, often depending on who is in power
in Washington. European countries have taken the lead in sustainability, with significant conversion to wind
power for electricity generation. Others, including China, India, and emerging economies lag behind.

Global Economic Inequality

In 1990, approximately 36% of the world's population lived in extreme poverty. The World Bank defines extreme
poverty as living on less than $1.90 per day. Fortunately, this rate has been consistently declining about one
percentage point annually, and in 2015 the percentage of people world wide living in extreme poverty was 10%.
Approximately 68 million people are no longer considered in extreme poverty (The World Bank, 2018). China is a
prime example of poor people moving to cities to take manufacturing jobs, with the result of millions elevating
into the middle class.

What created such a drop in those living in extreme poverty? These people have benefited from the increase in
global business and foreign direct investment that have impacted developing countries in Asia, Latin America,
and Africa. Offshoring to low wage countries, although controversial, has helped millions move from an agrarian
lifestyle of poverty to a steady job with steady income. The increase in global trade, particularly in commodities
produced by poorer countries, helped in this effort. Likewise, the corporate social responsibility efforts of
companies manufacturing in poorer countries insisted on their partners and supply chains to pay a living wage,
pay men and women equally, and eliminate child labor, which meant more children received an education.

It is important to understand that even though there has been significant improvements in the number of
people world wide living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 per day), nearly half of the world's population still
lives in poverty. Approximately 46% (as of 2015) live on less than $5.50 per day, and 25% live on less than $3.20
per day. Progress has been made but there is still a long way to go. (Walton, 2019).

Since 2015, the rate of decrease in extreme poverty has slowed. The world goal of reaching 3% living in extreme
poverty by 2030 is doubtful (The World Bank, 2020). Several more recent factors slow the decline even more.
In 2018-2019 the United States implemented tariffs on many products being imported into the country. This
had the effect of slowing international trade, lowering manufacturing volumes abroad, and impacting the job
growth seen earlier in poorer countries. The trend of reversing offshoring by US companies, called onshoring,
will slow the rate as jobs transition to the United States. Lower commodity prices also influenced the decline.
The COVID-19 pandemic had a tremendous negative impact on the world economy with a long term effect
of increasing the poverty rate. COVID-19 caused economic activity to decline world wide, and employment in
poorer countries dropped off considerably.

                                                                                                         Chapter 11: Leading an Ethical Organization | 321
COVID-19 Mini Case

The world wide pandemic created by the COVID-19 virus had tremendous impact on businesses domestically
and globally. For some, sales increased dramatically, such as in the grocery and medical ventilator industries.
For most, however, volumes shrunk as countries mandated stay at home orders and social distancing. Local
and national economies across the world were devastated, creating vast numbers of unemployed. Governments
were tempted to open the economy back up as soon as possible, and sometimes even when the incidence of
infections and hospitalization were still on the rise. This conflicted decision was also deliberated by executives
and owners of businesses large and small.

The pandemic created an ethical challenge for both political leaders and citizens: Open up to get the economy
going and people back to work and school, but risk raising infection rates, or, continue to lock down to control
and diminish the impact of the virus but keep people unemployed, or some balance in between.

(1) Suppose you are the governor of a state. Should lock down continue, at the cost of more unemployment over
a longer time frame, or open the economy up at the expense of more coronavirus cases, hospitalizations, and
even deaths? What do you do?

(2) Suppose you are the CEO of a 200 person company that makes specialized parts for airplanes. You outsource
the manufacturing to another company in Mexico. With the coronavirus outbreak, you initially followed the
governor's guidance, closed the office and had people work from home. Productivity is suffering, and you have
a lab where 30 people work in two shifts who cannot work from home. You have paid them for the first 4 weeks
anyway, but now you are running in the red with sales down. What do you do? Bring everyone back to the
office, and risk them getting infected? Bring only the lab staff back, with the same risk? Lay off the lab staff?
Furlough everyone to stop the bleeding until this passes? Continue paying everyone and risk bankrupting the
company? Some combination of these options? Or is there another option you haven't thought of yet? What's
your decision, CEO?

(3) In the midst of this chaos, there are strategic opportunities for those firms positioned to take advantage of
the new environment. What might some of those opportunities be?

(4) Suppose you own Sharkey's in Blacksburg. Students are gone and your business has collapsed. Now you're
closed per the governor's order, and all staff are furloughed. You tried to stay open for take-out only but it didn't
work. The governor has announced that Phase 2 will start next week, and you can open with 25% capacity. It's
July, there are a few students around, with many more expected in August. You have enough cash in the bank
to stay closed and pay the bills until the semester starts. You'll lose even more money if you open now at 25%
capacity and have to pay staff. They need their jobs, however, coming back also increases their risk of infection.
What do you do? What's the best decision? You first decide that you hate these ethical dilemmas. Then what?

   Key Takeaway

          Living in the United States isolates and insulates its citizens from most of the extreme problems
             of the world; war, dire poverty, starvation, poor housing, lack of water for drinking, bathing, and
             cleaning, as well as toxic environments. Global business and economic activities over the last few
             decades have had a positive impact on the conditions of approximately half of the world's
             population that struggle financially. Foreign direct investment and offshoring by wealthy
             countries, as well as buying commodities from poorer countries have contributed to the rise in
             incomes in poorer nations. Ethical questions remain on how business can impact positively not
             only on the world's poor, but also on citizens at home, and on the health of the planet.

11.6 Conclusion

This chapter explains the role of boards of directors in the corporate governance of organizations such as
large, publicly traded corporations. Wise boards work to manage the agency problem that creates a conflict
of interest between top managers such as the CEO and other groups with a stake in the firm. When boards
fail to do their duties, numerous scandals may ensue. Corporate scandals became so widespread that new
legislation such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has been developed with the hope of impeding future
actions by executives associated with unethical or illegal behavior. Companies have adopted practices such as
ethics and compliance codes and corporate social responsibility activities to improve their accountability to the
communities and society they serve. Globally, business activities have lowered poverty rates, but ethical issues
remain regarding balancing competing interests on many issues such as offshoring, pollution, sustainability,
and economic inequality.
