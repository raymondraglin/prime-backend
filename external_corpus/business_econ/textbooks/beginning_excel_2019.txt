Introduction

This core Microsoft® Excel® text provides students with the skills needed to execute many per-
sonal and professional activities. It also prepares them to go on to more advanced skills using the
Excel software. The text takes the approach of making decisions using Excel. Personal decisions
introduced include important purchases, such as homes and automobiles, savings for retirement,
and personal budgets. Professional decisions include budgets for managing expenses, merchan-
dise items to mark down or discontinue, and inventory management. Students are given clear,
easy-to-follow instructions for each skill presented and are also provided with opportunities to
learn additional skills related to the personal or professional objectives presented. For example,
students learn the key terms with respect to home mortgages and understand the impact interest
rates have on monthly mortgage payments. This text also places an emphasis on "what-if" sce-
narios so students gain an appreciation for the computational power of the Excel application. In
addition, students learn how Excel is used with Microsoft® Word® and Microsoft® PowerPoint®
to accomplish a variety of personal and professional objectives.

Microsoft® Office contains a variety of tools that help people accomplish many personal and
professional objectives. Microsoft Excel is perhaps the most versatile and widely used of all the
Office applications. No matter which career path you choose, you will likely need to use Excel to
accomplish your professional objectives, some of which may occur daily. This chapter provides an
overview of the Excel application along with an orientation for accessing the commands and fea-
tures of an Excel workbook.

MAKING DECISIONS WITH EXCEL

Taking a very simple view, Excel is a tool that allows you to enter quantitative data into an elec-
tronic spreadsheet to apply one or many mathematical computations. These computations ulti-
mately convert that quantitative data into information. The information produced in Excel can be
used to make decisions in both professional and personal contexts. For example, employees can
use Excel to determine how much inventory to buy for a clothing retailer, how much medication
to administer to a patient, or how much money to spend to stay within a budget. With respect to
personal decisions, you can use Excel to determine how much money you can spend on a house,
how much you can spend on car lease payments, or how much you need to save to reach your

                                                                                                        2

retirement goals. We will demonstrate how you can use Excel to make these decisions and many
more throughout this text.

Figure 1.1 shows a completed Excel worksheet that will be constructed in this chapter. The infor-
mation shown in this worksheet contains sales data for a hypothetical merchandise retail com-
pany. The worksheet data can help a retailer analyze the business and determine the number of
salespeople needed for each month for example.

EXCEL FOR WINDOWS VS EXCEL FOR MAC

The Excel for Windows and Excel for Mac software versions are very similar. Most of the features,
tools and commands are available in both versions. There are, however, some differences with the
Excel interface. There are also a few features that are not available in the Excel for Mac version.
The screenshots and step-by-step instructions in this textbook are specific to Excel for Windows.
We have attempted to provide alternate screenshots and instructions for the Mac version when

the differences are significant. When you see this icon  , it means we are providing information
specific to Mac users.

The Excel Workbook

A workbook is an Excel file that contains one or more worksheets (referred to as spreadsheets).
Excel will assign a file name to the workbook, such as Book1, Book2, Book3, and so on, depending
on how many new workbooks are opened. Figure 1.2 shows a blank workbook after starting Excel.
Take some time to familiarize yourself with this screen. Your screen may be slightly different based
on the version you're using.

NAVIGATING WORKSHEETS

Data are entered and managed in an Excel worksheet. The worksheet contains several rectangles
called cells for entering numeric and non-numeric data. Each cell in an Excel worksheet contains
an address, which is defined by a column letter followed by a row number. For example, the
cell that is currently activated in Figure 1.3 is A1. This would be referred to as cell location A1
or cell reference A1. The following steps explain how you can navigate in an Excel worksheet:

       1. Place your mouse pointer over cell D5 and click.
       2. Check to make sure column letter D and row number 5 are highlighted, as shown in Fig­

            ure 1.4.
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  8

Figure 1.4 Activating a Cell Location

       1. Move the mouse pointer to cell A1.
       2. Click and hold the left mouse button and drag the mouse pointer back to cell D5.
       3. Release the left mouse button. You should see several cells highlighted, as shown in Fig­

            ure 1.5.
This is referred to as a cell range and is documented as follows: A1:D5. Any two cell locations sepa-
rated by a colon are known as a cell range. The first cell is the top left corner of the range, and the
second cell is the lower right corner of the range.

       + adds additional worksheets. This is how you open or add a worksheets within a work-
       book. To see how this works, click on the + to add another worksheet so that you now
       have two sheets

   2. Click the Sheet1 worksheet tab at the bottom of the worksheet to return to the work-
       sheet shown in Figure 1.5.

                               Keyboard Shortcuts

   Basic Worksheet Navigation

   · Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to activate cells on the worksheet.

   · Hold the SHIFT key and press the arrow keys on your keyboard to highlight a range of cells in
      a worksheet.

   · Hold the CTRL key while pressing the PAGE DOWN or PAGE UP keys to open other worksheets
      in a workbook.

   ·  Mac Users: Hold down the Fn and Command keys and press the left or right arrow keys

THE EXCEL RIBBON

Excel's features and commands are found in the Ribbon, which is the upper area of the Excel
screen that contains several tabs running across the top. Each tab provides access to a different
set of Excel commands. Figure 1.6 shows the commands available in the Home tab of the Rib-
bon. Table 1.1 "Command Overview for Each Tab of the Ribbon" provides an overview of the
commands that are found in each tab of the Ribbon.

Figure 1.6 Home Tab of Ribbon
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  10

The Excel for Mac ribbon, as shown in Figure 1.6a below, has two primary differences:

                 The older dropdown menu structure is still available with Excel for Mac.

                 The specific commands and tools within each tab are slightly different between
                   the two Excel Ribbons. Some of the commands found within the Excel for Win-
                   dows Ribbon tabs are located within the dropdown menu structure in the Excel
                   for Mac version. So, if you can't find the tool on the Excel for Mac Ribbon, then
                   try to find the tool by looking through the dropdown menu instead.

Figure 1.6a Home tab of Excel for Mac Ribbon with dropdown menu structure

Group Title Names on the Ribbon

If you look closely at the Excel Ribbon (See Figure 1.6 above), you will see that the Ribbon is sep-
arated in groups of tool buttons, and each group has a title name. On Home tab, the group title
names are "Clipboard", "Font", "Alignment", "Number", "Styles". "Cells", "Editing", etc. The tool but-
tons within each group are all related to the group title.

    Mac Users Only: The default "View" for the Excel for Mac ribbon does not display these
"group title names". Notice in Figure 1.6a above, there are no group title names. It is a good idea
to change this "view" so you can see the group title names. Here are the steps:

       1. Click the "Excel" menu option at top left above the Ribbon
       2. Choose "Preferences"
       3. Click the "View" button
       4. Scroll down and check the box for "Group Titles"
       5. Close the "View" dialog box. The group title names should now display as shown in Fig-

            ure 6.1 (not Figure 6.1a) above

Tab Name Description of Commands

           Also known as the Backstage view of the Excel workbook. Contains all commands for opening, closing, saving, and

File       creating new Excel workbooks. Includes print commands, document properties, e-mailing options, and help features.

           The default settings and options are also found in this tab.

Home       Contains the most frequently used Excel commands. Formatting commands are found in this tab along with
           commands for cutting, copying, pasting, and for inserting and deleting rows and columns.

Insert     Used to insert objects such as charts, pictures, shapes, PivotTables, Internet links, symbols, or text boxes.

Page       Contains commands used to prepare a worksheet for printing. Also includes commands used to show and print the
Layout     gridlines on a worksheet.

Formulas   Includes commands for adding mathematical functions to a worksheet. Also contains tools for auditing mathematical
           formulas.

Data       Used when working with external data sources such as Microsoft® Access®, text files, or the Internet. Also contains
           sorting commands and access to scenario tools.

Review     Includes Spelling and Track Changes features. Also contains protection features to password protect worksheets or
           workbooks.

View       Used to adjust the visual appearance of a workbook. Common commands include the Zoom and Page Layout view.

Help       This tab provides access to help and support features such as contacting Microsoft support, sending feedback,
Draw
Developer  suggesting a new feature, and community discussion groups. This tab is not available with Excel for Mac.

           Provides drawing options for using a digital pen, mouse or finger depending on the type of device (laptop with touch
           screen, tablet, computer, etc). This tab is not visible by default. See below on how to customize the Ribbon to add or
           remove tabs.

           Provides access to some advanced features such as macros, form controls, and XML commands. This tab is not visible
           by default. See below on how to customize the Ribbon to add or remove tabs.

The Ribbon shown in Figure 1.6 and Figure 1.6a (above) is full, or maximized. The benefit of hav-
ing a full Ribbon is that the commands are always visible while you are developing a worksheet.
However, depending on the screen dimensions of your computer, you may find that the Ribbon
takes up too much vertical space on your worksheet. If this is the case, you can minimize the Rib-
bon by clicking the button shown in Figure 1.6. When minimized, the Ribbon will show only the
tabs and not the command buttons. When you click on a tab, the command buttons will appear
until you select a command or click anywhere on your worksheet.

    To hide the Ribbon with Excel for Mac you can use the keyboard shortcut:

        Hold down the "Command and Option" keys and tap the "R" key

The same keyboard shortcut will unhide the Ribbon as well.

HOW TO CUSTOMIZE THE EXCEL RIBBON

Here are the steps to add additional tabs to the Excel Ribbon

       1. Click the File tab and choose Options
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019                                                                    12

2. Click on "Customize Ribbon" at the left side of the Options screen

QUICK ACCESS TOOLBAR AND RIGHT-CLICK MENU

The Quick Access Toolbar is found at the upper left side of the Excel screen above the Ribbon, as
13  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

shown in Figure 1.7. This area provides access to the most frequently used commands, such as
Save and Undo. You also can customize the Quick Access Toolbar by adding commands that you
use on a regular basis. By placing these commands in the Quick Access Toolbar, you do not have to
navigate through the Ribbon to find them. To customize the Quick Access Toolbar, click the down
arrow as shown in Figure 1.8. This will open a menu of commands that you can add to the Quick
Access Toolbar. If you do not see the command you are looking for on the list, select the More
Commands option.

Figure 1.8 Customizing the Quick Access Toolbar

In addition to the Ribbon and Quick Access Toolbar, you can also access many commands by right
clicking anywhere on the worksheet. Figure 1.9 shows an example of the commands available in

            1. Understand how to enter data into a worksheet.
            2. Examine how to edit data in a worksheet.
            3. Examine how Auto Fill is used when entering data.
            4. Understand how to delete data from a worksheet and use the Undo command.
            5. Examine how to adjust column widths and row heights in a worksheet.
            6. Understand how to hide columns and rows in a worksheet.
            7. Examine how to insert columns and rows into a worksheet.
            8. Understand how to delete columns and rows from a worksheet.
            9. Learn how to move data to different locations in a worksheet.

In this section, we will begin the development of the workbook shown in Figure 1.1. The skills cov-
ered in this section are typically used in the early stages of developing one or more worksheets in
a workbook.

ENTERING DATA

You will begin building the workbook shown in Figure 1.1 by manually entering data into the work-
sheet. The following steps explain how the column headings in Row 2 are typed into the work-
sheet:

       1. Click cell location A2 on the worksheet.
       2. Type the word Month.
       3. Press the RIGHT ARROW key. This will enter the word into cell A2 and activate the next

            cell to the right.
       4. Type Unit Sales and press the RIGHT ARROW key.
       5. Repeat step 4 for the words Average Price and then again for Sales Dollars.

                                                                                                       22
23  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

Figure 1.15 shows how your worksheet should appear after you have typed the column headings
into Row 2. Notice that the word Price in cell location C2 is not visible. This is because the column
is too narrow to fit the entry you typed. We will examine formatting techniques to correct this
problem in the next section.

Integrity Check
Column Headings
It is critical to include column headings that accurately describe the data in each column of a worksheet. In
professional environments, you will likely be sharing Excel workbooks with coworkers. Good column head-
ings reduce the chance of someone misinterpreting the data contained in a worksheet, which could lead to
costly errors depending on your career.
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  24

 1. Click cell B3.

 2. Type the number 2670 and press the ENTER key. After you press the ENTER key, cell B4
      will be activated. Using the ENTER key is an efficient way to enter data vertically down a
      column.

 3. Enter the following numbers in cells B4 through B14:
      2160, 515, 590, 1030, 2875, 2700, 900, 775, 1180, 1800, and 4560.

 4. Click cell C3.

 5. Type the number 9.99 and press the ENTER key.

 6. Enter the following numbers in cells C4 through
      C14: 12.49, 14.99, 17.49, 14.99, 12.49, 9.99, 19.99, 19.99, 19.99, 17.49, and 14.99.

 7. Click cell D3.

 8. Type the number 26685 and press the ENTER key.

 9. Enter the following numbers in cells D4 through
      D14: 26937, 7701, 10269, 15405, 35916, 26937, 17958, 15708, 23562, 31416, and 75125.

10. When finished, check that the data you entered matches Figure 1.16.

Why?

Avoid Formatting Symbols When Entering Numbers

When typing numbers into an Excel worksheet, it is best to avoid adding any formatting symbols such as dol-
lar signs and commas. Although Excel allows you to add these symbols while typing numbers, it slows down
the process of entering data. It is more efficient to use Excel's formatting features to add these symbols to
numbers after you type them into a worksheet.

Integrity Check
Data Entry
25  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

It is very important to proofread your worksheet carefully, especially when you have entered numbers. Trans-
posing numbers when entering data manually into a worksheet is a common error. For example, the number
563 could be transposed to 536. Such errors can seriously compromise the integrity of your workbook.

Integrity Check

Figure 1.16 shows how your worksheet should appear after entering the data. Check your numbers carefully
to make sure they are accurately entered into the worksheet.
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  26

Figure 1.16 Completed Data Entry for Columns B, C, and D

EDITING DATA

Data that has been entered in a cell can be changed by double clicking the cell location or using
the Formula Bar. You may have noticed that as you were typing data into a cell location, the data
you typed appeared in the Formula Bar. The Formula Bar can be used for entering data into cells
as well as for editing data that already exists in a cell. The following steps provide an example of
entering and then editing data that has been entered into a cell location:

       1. Click cell A15 in the Sheet1 worksheet.
       2. Type the abbreviation Tot and press the ENTER key.
       3. Click cell A15.
       4. Move the mouse pointer up to the Formula Bar. You will see the pointer turn into a cur-

            sor. Move the cursor to the end of the abbreviation Tot and left click.

    5. Type the letters al to complete the word Total.

    6. Click the check mark to the left of the Formula Bar (see Figure 1.17). This will enter the
        change into the cell.

AUTO FILL

The Auto Fill feature is a valuable tool when manually entering data into a worksheet. This feature
has many uses, but it is most beneficial when you are entering data in a defined sequence, such
as the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on, or nonnumeric data such as the days of the week or months
of the year. The following steps demonstrate how Auto Fill can be used to enter the months of the
year in Column A:

       1. Click cell A3 in the Sheet1 worksheet.
       2. Type the word January and press the ENTER key.
       3. Click cell A3 again.
       4. Move the mouse pointer to the lower right corner of cell A3. You will see a small square

            in this corner of the cell; this is called the Fill Handle (See Figure 1.18) When the mouse
            pointer gets close to the Fill Handle, the white block plus sign will turn into a black plus
            (+) sign.
29  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

Figure 1.18 Fill Handle

Left click and drag the Fill Handle to cell A14. Notice that the Auto Fill tip box indicates what month
will be placed into each cell (see Figure 1.19). Release the mouse button when the tip box reads
"December."
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  30

Figure 1.19 Using Auto Fill to Enter the Months of the Year

Once you release the left mouse button, all twelve months of the year should appear in the cell
range A3:A14, as shown in Figure 1.20. You will also see the Auto Fill Options button. By clicking
this button, you have several options for inserting data into a group of cells.

       4. Click the Fill Months option to return the months of the year to the cell range A4:A14.

            The Fill Series option will provide the same result.

DELETING DATA AND THE UNDO COMMAND

There are several methods for removing data from a worksheet, a few of which are demonstrated
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019                                                                               32

here. With each method, you use the Undo command. This is a helpful command in the event
you mistakenly remove data from your worksheet. The following steps demonstrate how you can
delete data from a cell or range of cells:

       1. Click cell C2.
       2. Press the DELETE key on your keyboard. This removes the contents of the cell.

                 Mac Users: Hold down the Fn key and press the Delete key
       3. Highlight the range C3:C14. Then left click and drag the mouse pointer down to cell C14.
       4. Place the mouse pointer over the Fill Handle. You will see the white block plus sign

            change to a black plus sign (+).
       5. Click and drag the mouse pointer up to cell C3 (see Figure 1.21). Release the mouse but-

            ton. The contents in the range C3:C14 will be removed.

ADJUSTING COLUMNS AND ROWS

There are a few entries in the worksheet that appear cut off. For example, the last letter of the
word September cannot be seen in cell A11. This is because the column is too narrow for this
word. The columns and rows on an Excel worksheet can be adjusted to accommodate the data
that is being entered into a cell using three different methods. The following steps explain how to
adjust the column widths and row heights in a worksheet:

       1. Bring the mouse pointer between Column A and Column B in the Sheet1 worksheet, as
            shown in Figure 1.23. You will see the white block plus sign turn into double arrows.

       2. Click and drag the column to the right so the entire word September in cell A11 can be
            seen. As you drag the column, you will see the column width tip box. This box displays
            the number of characters that will fit into the column using the Calibri 11-point font
            which is the default setting for font/size.

       3. Release the left mouse button.
35  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

Figure 1.23 Adjusting Column Widths

You may find that using the click-and-drag method is inefficient if you need to set a specific char-
acter width for one or more columns. Steps 1 through 6 illustrate a second method for adjusting
column widths when using a specific number of characters:

       1. Click any cell location in Column A by moving the mouse pointer over a cell location and
            clicking the left mouse button. You can highlight cell locations in multiple columns if you
            are setting the same character width for more than one column.

       2. In the Home tab of the Ribbon, left click the Format button in the Cells group.

       3. Click the Column Width option from the drop-down menu. This will open the Column
            Width dialog box.

       4. Type the number 13 and click the OK button on the Column Width dialog box. This will
            set Column A to this character width (see Figure 1.24).

       5. Once again bring the mouse pointer between Column A and Column B so that the dou-
            ble arrow pointer displays and then double-click to activate AutoFit. This features adjusts

Hidden Rows and Columns
In most careers, it is common for professionals to use Excel workbooks that have been designed by a
coworker. Before you use a workbook developed by someone else, always check for hidden rows and
columns. You can quickly see whether a row or column is hidden if a row number or column letter is missing.

                                                                 Skill Refresher

   Hiding Columns and Rows
            1. Activate at least one cell in the row(s) or column(s) you are hiding.
            2. Click the Home tab of the Ribbon.
            3. Click the Format button in the Cells group.
            4. Place the mouse pointer over the Hide & Unhide option.
            5. Click either the Hide Rows or Hide Columns option.

INSERTING COLUMNS AND ROWS

Using Excel workbooks that have been created by others is a very efficient way to work because it
eliminates the need to create data worksheets from scratch. However, you may find that to accom-
plish your goals, you need to add additional columns or rows of data. In this case, you can insert
blank columns or rows into a worksheet. The following steps demonstrate how to do this:

       1. Click cell C1.
       2. Click the down arrow on the Insert button in the Home tab of the Ribbon (see Figure

            1.28).

         Figure 1.28 Insert Button (Down Arrow)

    3. Click the Insert Sheet Columns option from the drop-down menu (see Figure 1.29). A
        blank column will be inserted to the left of Column C. The contents that were previously
        in Column C now appear in Column D. Note that columns are always inserted to the left

            3. Click the down arrow on the Insert button in the Cells group.
            4. Click either the Insert Sheet Columns or Insert Sheet Rows option.

MOVING DATA

Once data are entered into a worksheet, you have the ability to move it to different locations. The
following steps demonstrate how to move data to different locations on a worksheet:

       1. Select the range D2:D15.
       2. Bring the mouse pointer to the left edge of cell D2. You will see the white block plus sign

            change to cross arrows (see Figure 1.30). This indicates that you can left click and drag
            the data to a new location.

         Mac Users: when the mouse hovers over the left edge of cell D2, the pointer will turn
    into a small hand that looks like this:
3. Left Click and drag the mouse pointer to cell C2.
4. Release the left mouse button. The data now appears in Column C.
5. Click the Undo button in the Quick Access Toolbar. This moves the data back to Column
    D.

Moving Data

Before moving data on a worksheet, make sure you identify all the components that belong with the series
you are moving. For example, if you are moving a column of data, make sure the column heading is included.
Also, make sure all values are highlighted in the column before moving it.

DELETING COLUMNS AND ROWS

You may need to delete entire columns or rows of data from a worksheet. This need may arise
if you need to remove either blank columns or rows from a worksheet or columns and rows that
contain data. The methods for removing cell contents were covered earlier and can be used to
delete unwanted data. However, if you do not want a blank row or column in your workbook, you
can delete it using the following steps:

       1. Click cell A3.
       2. Click the down arrow on the Delete button in the Cells group in the Home tab of the Rib-

            bon.
       3. Click the Delete Sheet Rows option from the drop-down menu (see Figure 1.31). This

            removes Row 3 and shifts all the data (below Row 2) in the worksheet up one row.

                                                                    Keyboard Shortcuts

             · Column headings should be used in a worksheet and should accurately describe the data con-
                 tained in each column.

             · Using symbols such as dollar signs when entering numbers into a worksheet can slow down
                 the data entry process.

             · Worksheets must be carefully proofread when data has been manually entered.
             · The Undo command is a valuable tool for recovering data that was deleted from a worksheet.
             · When using a worksheet that was developed by someone else, look carefully for hidden

                 columns or rows.

                                                              Learning Objectives

            1. Use formatting techniques as introduced in the Excel Spreadsheet Guidelines to enhance the
                 appearance of a worksheet.

            2. Understand how to align data in cell locations.
            3. Examine how to enter multiple lines of text in a cell location.
            4. Understand how to add borders to a worksheet.
            5. Examine how to use the AutoSum feature to calculate totals.
            6. Use the Cut, Copy, and Paste commands to manipulate the data on a worksheet.
            7. Understand how to move, rename, insert, and delete worksheet tabs.

This section addresses formatting commands that can be used to enhance the visual appearance
of a worksheet. It also provides an introduction to mathematical calculations. The skills introduced
in this section will give you powerful tools for analyzing the data that we have been working with
in this workbook and will highlight how Excel is used to make key decisions in virtually any career.
Additionally, Excel Spreadsheet Guidelines for format and appearance will be introduced as a for-
mat for the course and spreadsheets submitted.

FORMATTING DATA AND CELLS

Enhancing the visual appearance of a worksheet is a critical step in creating a valuable tool for you
or your coworkers when making key decisions. There are accepted professional formatting stan-
dards when spreadsheets contain only currency data. For this course, we will use the following
Excel Guidelines for Formatting. The first figure displays how to use Accounting number format
when ALL figures are currency. Only the first row of data and the totals should be formatted with
the Accounting format. The other data should be formatted with Comma style. There also needs
to be a Top Border above the numbers in the total row. If any of the numbers have cents, you
need to format all of the data with two decimal places.

                                                                                                       49
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  50

Figure 1.31a

Often, your Excel spreadsheet will contain values that are both currency and non-currency in
nature. When that is the case, you'll want to use the guidelines in the following figure:

The following steps demonstrate several fundamental formatting skills that will be applied to the
workbook that we are developing for this chapter. Several of these formatting skills are identical to
ones that you may have already used in other Microsoft applications such as Microsoft® Word®
or Microsoft® PowerPoint®.

                   1. Select the range A2:D2. Click the Bold button in the Font group of commands in

                      Why?
                      Format Column Headings and Totals
                      Applying formatting enhancements to the column headings and column totals in a work-
                      sheet is a very important technique, especially if you are sharing a workbook with other
                      people. These formatting techniques allow users of the worksheet to clearly see the col-
                      umn headings that define the data. In addition, the column totals usually contain the most
                      important data on a worksheet with respect to making decisions, and formatting tech-
                      niques allow users to quickly see this information.

    1. Select the range B3:B14.
    2. Click the Comma Style button in the Number group of commands in the Home tab of the

        Ribbon. This feature adds a comma as well as two decimal places. (see Figure 1.33).
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  54

       Figure 1.33 Number Group of Commands

 3. Since the figures in this range do not include cents, click the Decrease Decimal button in
      the Number group of commands in the Home tab of the Ribbon two times (see Figure
      1.33).

 4. The numbers will also be reduced to zero decimal places.

 5. Select the range C3:C14.

 6. Click the Accounting Number Format button in the Number group of commands in the
      Home tab of the Ribbon (see Figure 1.33). This will add the US currency symbol and two
      decimal places to the values. This format is common when working with pricing data. As
      discussed above in the Formatting Data and Cells section, you will want to use Account-
      ing format on all values in this range since the worksheet contains non-currency as well
      as currency data.

 7. Select the range D3:D14.

 8. Again, select the Accounting Number Format; this will add the US currency symbol to the
      values as well as two decimal places.

 9. Click the Decrease Decimal button in the Number group of commands in the Home tab
      of the Ribbon.

10. This will add the US currency symbol to the values and reduce the decimal places to zero
      since there are no cents in these figures.

11. Select the range A1:D1.

12. Click the down arrow next to the Fill Color button in the Font group of commands in the
      Home tab of the Ribbon (see Figure 1.34). This will add background fill color the range
      for a worksheet title when entered.

           Figure 1.34 Fill Color Palette

    13. Click the Blue, Accent 1, Darker 25% color from the palette (see Figure 1.34). Notice that
          as you move the mouse pointer over the color palette, you will see a preview of how the
          color will appear in the highlighted cells. Experiment with this feature.

    14. Click on A1 and enter the worksheet title: Merchandise City, USA and click on the check
          mark in the formula bar to enter this information.

    15. Since the black font is difficult to read on the blue background, you'll change the font
          color to be more visible. Click the down arrow next to the Font Color button in the Font
          group of commands in the Home tab of the Ribbon; select White as the font color for
          this range (see Figure 1.32).

    16. Select the range A1:D1 and format for Italics by clicking on "I" in the Font group.
    17. Click the drop-down arrow on the right side of the Font button in the Home tab of the

          Ribbon; select Arial as the font for this range and format for Bold click on "B" in the Font
          group. (see Figure 1.32).
    18. Notice that as you move the mouse pointer over the font style options, you can see the
          font change in the highlighted cells.
    19. Expand the column width of Column D to 14 characters.
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  56

Why?

Pound Signs (####) Appear in Columns

When a column is too narrow for a long number, Excel will automatically convert the number to a series of
pound signs (####). In the case of words or text data, Excel will only show the characters that fit in the col-
umn. However, this is not the case with numeric data because it can give the appearance of a number that is
much smaller than what is actually in the cell. To remove the pound signs, increase the width of the column.

Figure 1.35 shows how the Sheet1 worksheet should appear after the formatting techniques are
applied.

DATA ALIGNMENT (WRAP TEXT, MERGE CELLS, AND CENTER)

The skills presented in this segment show how data are aligned within cell locations. For example,
text and numbers can be centered in a cell location, left justified, right justified, and so on. In some
cases you may want to stack multiword text entries vertically in a cell instead of expanding the
width of a column. This is referred to as wrapping text. These skills are demonstrated in the fol-
lowing steps:

       1. Select the range A2:D2.
       2. Click the Center button in the Alignment group of commands in the Home tab of the Rib-

            bon (see Figure 1.36). This will center the column headings in each cell location.
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019                                                     58

Figure 1.36 Alignment Group in Home Tab

3. Click the Wrap Text button in the Alignment group (see Figure 1.36). The height of Row 2
    automatically expands, and the words that were cut off because the columns were too
    narrow are now stacked vertically.

The benefit of using the Wrap Text command is that it significantly reduces the need to expand the
column width to accommodate multiword column headings. The problem with increasing the col-

    umn width is that you may reduce the amount of data that can fit on a piece of paper or one screen.
    This makes it cumbersome to analyze the data in the worksheet and could increase the time it takes
    to make a decision.

    4. Select the range A1:D1.

    5. Click the down arrow on the right side of the Merge & Center button in the Alignment
        group of commands in the Home tab of the Ribbon.

    6. Click the Merge & Center option (see Figure 1.37). This will create one large cell location
        running across the top of the data set and center the text in that cell.

Why?
Merge & Center
One of the most common reasons the Merge & Center command is used is to center the title of a worksheet
directly above the columns of data. Once the cells above the column headings are merged, a title can be cen-
tered above the columns of data. It is very difficult to center the title over the columns of data if the cells are
not merged.

Figure 1.38 shows the Sheet1 worksheet with the data alignment commands applied. The reason
for merging the cells in the range A1:D1 will become apparent in the next segment.

In the Sheet1 worksheet, the cells in the range A1:D1 were merged for the purposes of adding a
title to the worksheet. This worksheet will contain both a title and a subtitle. The following steps
explain how you can enter text into a cell and determine where you want the second line of text
to begin:

       1. Click cell A1. Since the cells were merged, clicking cell A1 will automatically activate the
            range A1:D1. Position your mouse to the end of the title, directly after the "A" in the word
            "USA" and double-click to get a cursor (flashing I-beam).

       2. Hold down the ALT key and press the ENTER key. This will start a new line of text in this
            cell location.

       3. Type the text Retail Sales and press the ENTER key.
       4. Select cell A1. Then click the Bold buttons in the Font group of commands in the Home

            tab of the Ribbon so that the titles are now in Bold and Italics.
       5. Increase the height of Row 1 to 30 points. Once the row height is increased, all the text

            typed into the cell will be visible (see Figure 1.39).

BORDERS (ADDING LINES TO A WORKSHEET)

In Excel, adding custom lines to a worksheet is known as adding borders. Borders are different
from the grid lines that appear on a worksheet and that define the perimeter of the cell locations.
The Borders command lets you add a variety of line styles to a worksheet that can make reading
the worksheet much easier. The following steps illustrate methods for adding preset borders and
custom borders to a worksheet:

       1. Click the down arrow to the right of the Borders button in the Font group of commands
            in the Home page of the Ribbon to view border options. (see Figure 1.40).

     Figure 1.40 Borders Dropdown Menu

2. Select the range A1:D15. Left click the All Borders option from the Borders drop-down
    menu (see Figure 1.40). This will add vertical and horizontal lines to the range A1:D15.

3. Select the range A2:D2 .
4. Click the down arrow to the right of the Borders button.
5. Left click the Thick Bottom Border option from the Borders drop-down menu.
6. Select the range A14:D14 and apply a Thick Bottom Border from the drop-down menu.

    The thick border will help maintain the Excel Formatting Guidelines.

 8. Click cell C15 to explore other AutoSum selections. Select the COUNT function from the

      list; Excel will return "12" for the number of months (rows). Excel will also display indica-
      tors of a green arrow in the corner of C15 and an exclamation point in yellow. These
      indicate that the function in this cell varies from the other functions in row 15. They can
      be ignored and do not print.
 9. Click cell C15 again; this time selecting the MAX option from the list. Excel will display
      $19.99. This reflects the Maximum Average Price in column C.
10. Click cell C15 and delete the contents in this cell.

             · Formatting skills are critical for creating worksheets that are easy to read and have a profes-
                 sional appearance.

             · A series of pound signs (####) in a cell location indicates that the column is too narrow to dis-
                 play the number entered.

             · Using the Wrap Text command allows you to stack multiword column headings vertically in a
                 cell location, reducing the need to expand column widths.

             · Use the Merge & Center command to center the title of a worksheet directly over the columns
                 that contain data.

             · Adding borders or lines will make your worksheet easier to read and helps to separate the
                 data in each column and row.

             · You cannot use the Undo command to bring back a worksheet that has been deleted.

                                               Learning Objectives

· Use the Page Layout tab to prepare a worksheet for printing.
· Add headers and footers to a printed worksheet.
· Examine how to print worksheets and workbooks.

Once you have completed a workbook, it is good practice to select the appropriate settings for
printing. These settings are in the Page Layout tab of the Ribbon and discussed in this section of
the chapter.

PAGE SETUP

Before you can properly print the worksheets in a workbook, you must establish appropriate set-
tings. The following steps explain several of the commands in the Page Layout tab of the Ribbon
used to prepare a worksheet for printing:

       1. Open the CH1 Merchandise City Sales Data workbook, if it is not already open.
       2. Click the Page Layout tab of the Ribbon.
       3. Click the Margins button in the Page Setup group of commands. This will open a drop-

            down list of options for setting the margins of your printed document.
       4. Click the Wide option from the Margins drop-down list. (see Figure 1.47)
       5. Click the Orientation button in the Page Setup and select Landscape.
       6. Click on the arrow to the bottom right of the Page Setup category to launch the Page

            Setup options dialog box. Mac Users: there is no "arrow at the bottom right of the

Page Setup category". Simply click the Page Setup button            on the Page Layout tab.

7. Click the Margins tab and locate "Center on Page". Click the boxes to Horizontally and
    Vertically center the data on the worksheet. Click OK.

Why?

Use Print Settings

Because professionals often share Excel workbooks, it is a good practice to select the appropriate print set-
tings in the Page Layout tab even if you do not intend to print the worksheets in a workbook. It can be
extremely frustrating for recipients of a workbook who wish to print your worksheets to find that the neces-
sary print settings have not been selected. This may reflect poorly on your attention to detail, especially if the
recipient of the workbook is your boss.

HEADERS AND FOOTERS

When printing worksheets from Excel, it is common to add headers and footers to the printed
document. Information in the header or footer could include the date, page number, file name,
company name, and so on. The following steps explain how to add headers and footers to the
Merchandise City, USA Retail Sales worksheet.

       1. Click the Insert Ribbon and click on Header & Footer at the right end of the ribbon
77  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

        (located in the Text group). You will see the Design tab added to the Ribbon; this is used
        for creating the headers and footers for the printed worksheet. Also, this will convert the
        view of the worksheet from Normal to Page Layout (see Figure 1.48). This Page Layout
        view makes adding Headers & Footers easy and provides key features to incorporate.

    2. Click on the Current Date icon to add the date to the left section of the worksheet

     CHAPTER 2 - MATHEMATICAL
     COMPUTATIONS

Perhaps the most valuable feature of Excel is its ability to produce mathematical outputs using the
data in a workbook. This chapter reviews several mathematical outputs that you can produce in
Excel through the construction of formulas and functions. The chapter begins with the construc-
tion of formulas for basic and complex mathematical computations. The second section reviews
statistical functions, such as SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, and MAX, which can be applied to a range of
cells. The last section of the chapter addresses functions used to calculate mortgage and lease
payments as well as the valuation of investments. This chapter also shows how you can use data
from multiple worksheets to construct formulas and functions. These skills will be demonstrated
in the context of a personal cash budget, which is a vital tool for managing your money for long-
term financial security. The personal budget objective will also provide you with several oppor-
tunities to demonstrate Excel's what-if scenario capabilities, which highlight how formulas and
functions automatically produce new outputs when one or more inputs are changed.

                                                              Learning Objectives

             · Learn how to create basic formulas.
             · Understand relative referencing when copying and pasting formulas.
             · Work with complex formulas by controlling the order of mathematical operations.
             · Understand formula auditing tools.

This section reviews the fundamental skills for entering formulas into an Excel worksheet. The
example used for this chapter is the construction of a personal budget. Most financial advisors rec-
ommend that all households construct and maintain a personal budget to achieve and maintain
strong financial health. Organizing and maintaining a personal budget is a skill you can practice at
any point in your life. Whether you are managing your expenses during college or maintaining the
finances of a family of four, a personal budget can be a vital tool when making financial decisions.
Excel can make managing your money a fun and rewarding exercise.

Figure 2.1 shows the completed workbook that will be demonstrated in this chapter. Notice that
this workbook contains four worksheets. The first worksheet, Budget Summary, serves as an
overview of the data that was entered and calculated in the second and third worksheets, Bud­
get Detail and Loan Payments. The second worksheet, Budget Detail, provides a detailed list
of all the expenses and the third worksheet, Loan Payments, provides information regarding car
payment and mortgage payment amounts. The last worksheet, Prepare to Print, has data that is
unrelated to the budget worksheets but will be used in Section 2.4 - Preparing to Print.

CREATING A BASIC FORMULA

When formulas and cell          Formulas are used to calculate a variety of math-
references are used Excel will  ematical outputs in Excel and can be used to cre-
automatically recalculate when  ate virtually any custom calculation required for
data is changed                 your objective. Furthermore, when constructing
                                a formula in Excel, you use cell addresses that,

                                when added to a formula, become cell refer-

ences. This means that Excel uses, or references, the number entered into the cell location when

performing the calculation. As a result, when the numbers in the cells that are referenced are

changed, Excel automatically recalculates the formula and produces a new result. This is what

gives Excel the ability to create a variety of what-if scenarios, which will be explained later in the

chapter.

To demonstrate the construction of a basic formula, we will begin working on the Budget Detail
worksheet, which is shown in Figure 2.2. To complete this worksheet, we will enter some data, and
then create several formulas and functions. Table 2.1 provides definitions for each of the spend
categories listed in the range A3:A11. When you develop a personal budget, these categories are
defined on the basis of how you spend your money. It is likely that every person could have dif-
ferent categories or define the same categories differently. Therefore, it is important to review the
definitions in Table 2.1 to understand how we are defining these categories before proceeding.
89                                                                                        DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

Table 2.1 Spend Category Definitions

Category       Definition
Utilities      Electricity, heat, water, home phone, cable, Internet access
Cell Phone     Cell phone plan and equipment charges
Food           Groceries
Gas            Cost of gas for vehicle
Clothes        Clothes, shoes, and accessories
Insurance      Renter, homeowner, and/or car insurance
Entertainment  Activities like dining out, movie and theater tickets, parties, and so on
Vacation       Vacation expenses
Miscellaneous  Any other spending categories

The amount of money spent each month for each category, as well as the amount of money
spent last year, is already entered into the worksheet. We will write formulas that will calculate the
annual (yearly) amount spent, the percent of the total spent each category represents, as well as
the percent change from last year's spending to the current year.

The first formula will calculate the Annual Spend values. The formula will be constructed so that it
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019                                                                                 90

takes the values in the Monthly Spend column and multiplies them by 12 (the number of months
in a year). This will show how much money will be spent per year for each of the categories listed
in Column A. Since the first category is Utilities, we will start by creating the formula to multiply
the Monthly Spend amount in B3 by 12. This formula will be created in D3 - the Annual Spend cell
for the Utilities category. This formula will be written as: =B3*12

1. Switch to the Budget Detail worksheet if needed. Click cell D3.

2. Type an equal sign =                                  Formulas always start with
    When the first character entered into a cell is     the equal sign. This signifies
    an equal sign, it signals Excel to perform a        to Excel that the contents of
    calculation.                                       the cell should be calculated,

3. Type B3. This adds B3 to the formula, which             not just displayed as basic
    is now a cell reference. Excel will use whatever                     text or numbers.
    value is entered into cell B3 in the calculation.

4. Type the * . This is the symbol for multiplica­
    tion in Excel. As shown in Table 2.2 the mathematical operators in Excel are slightly different
    from those found on a typical calculator.

5. Type the number 12. This multiplies the value in cell B3 by 12. In this formula, a number, or
    constant, is used instead of a cell reference because it will not change. In other words, there
    will always be 12 months in a year.

6. Press the ENTER key. This enters the formula into the cell.

*                     Multiplication
^                     Power/Exponent

Why?
Use Cell References
Cell references enable Excel to automatically recalculate when one or more inputs in the referenced cells are
91                                          DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

changed. Cell references also allow you to trace how results are being calculated in a formula. You should
never use a calculator to determine a mathematical output and type it into the cell location of a worksheet.
Doing so eliminates Excel's cell-referencing benefits as well as your ability to trace a formula to determine
how results are being calculated.

Use Universal Constants

There will be times when you are writing formulas that you will need to use universal constants, or numbers
that do not change, such as the number of days in a week, weeks or months in a year, and so on. For exam-
ple, if you are calculating the monthly cost of an item when you know the yearly cost, you will always divide
by 12 since there are 12 months in a year. In this case, you use the constant of 12 instead of a cell reference
because the number of months in a year never changes.

Figure 2.3 shows how the formula appears in cell D3 before you press the ENTER key. Figure 2.4
shows the result of the formula after you press the ENTER key, as well as the formula bar which
displays the formula as it was entered in the cell.

The Annual Spend for Utilities is $3,000 because the formula is taking the Monthly Spend in cell
B3 and multiplying it by 12. If the value in cell B3 is changed, the formula automatically produces
a new result.

RELATIVE REFERENCES (COPYING AND PASTING FORMULAS)

Once a formula is typed into a worksheet, it can be copied and pasted to other cell locations. For
example, in cell D3 we have calculated the annual spend for the Utilities category, but this calcu-
lation needs to be performed for the rest of the cell locations in Column D. Since we used the B3
cell reference in the formula, Excel automatically adjusts that cell reference when the formula is
copied and pasted into the rest of the cell locations in the column. This is called relative referenc-
ing and is demonstrated as follows:

       1. Click cell D3.
       2. Place the mouse pointer over the Auto Fill Handle in the bottom right corner of the cell.
       3. When the mouse pointer turns from a white block plus sign to a black plus sign, click and

            drag down to cell D11. This pastes the formula into the range D4:D11.
       4. Double click cell D6. Notice that the cell reference in the formula is automatically

            changed to B6.
       5. Press the ENTER key.

Figure 2.5 shows the results added to the rest of the cell locations in the Annual Spend column.
For each row, the formula takes the value in the Monthly Spend column and multiplies it by 12.
You will also see that cell D6 has been double clicked to show the formula. Notice that Excel auto-
matically changed the original cell reference of B3 to B6. This is the result of relative referencing,
which means Excel automatically adjusts a cell reference relative to its original location when it
is pasted into new cell locations. In this example, the formula was pasted into eight cell locations
93  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

below the original cell location. As a result, Excel increased the row number of the original cell ref-
erence by a value of one for each row it was pasted into.

Figure 2.5 Relative Reference Example

Why?
Use Relative Referencing
Relative referencing is a convenient feature in Excel. When you use cell references in a formula, Excel auto-
matically adjusts the cell references when the formula is pasted into new cell locations. If this feature were
not available, you would have to manually retype the formula when you want the same calculation applied
to other cell locations in a column or row.
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019                                                                                                            94

CREATING COMPLEX FORMULAS (CONTROLLING THE ORDER OF
OPERATIONS)

The next formula to be added to the Personal Budget workbook is the percent change over last
year (Column F). This formula determines the difference between this year's Annual Spend values
(Column D) and the values in the Last Year Spend column (Column E) and shows the difference in
terms of a percentage. This requires that the order of mathematical operations be controlled to
get an accurate result.

Excel uses the standard mathematical order of operations, as defined in Table 2.3. When writing
complex formulas it is important to remember this order of operations. You want to be sure that
your formulas will calculate in the order you intend. To help you remember which operations will
be performed first, you can use the acronym PEMDAS.

P - parentheses
E - exponents
MD - multiplication and division
AS - addition and subtraction

Table 2.3 shows the standard order of operations (PEMDAS) for a typical formula. To change the
order of operations shown in the table, you can use parentheses to process certain mathematical
calculations first.

Table 2.3 Standard Order of Mathematical Operations (PEMDAS)

Symbol Order

        Any calculation inside parentheses will be done first.

( )     If there are layers of parentheses used in a formula, Excel computes the innermost parentheses first and the outermost

        parentheses last.

^       Excel executes any exponential computations next.

* or /  Excel performs any multiplication or division computations next.
        When there are multiple instances of these computations in a formula, they are executed in order from left to right.

+ or -  Excel performs any addition or subtraction computations last.
        When there are multiple instances of these computations in a formula, they are executed in order from left to right.

To create the Percent Change formula, we will need to use parentheses to control the order of the
calculations. We need the difference of the two values to be found before the division is done, so
we will use parentheses around the subtraction portion of the formula to indicate that calculation
needs to be done first. This formula is added to the worksheet as follows:

       1. Click cell F3 in the Budget Detail worksheet.

       2. Type an equal sign =.

       3. Type an open parenthesis (.

       4. Click cell D3. This will add a cell reference to cell D3 to the formula. When building formu­
            las, you can click cell locations instead of typing them.
95  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

       5. Type a minus sign -.
       6. Click cell E3 to add this cell reference to the formula.
       7. Type a closing parenthesis ).
       8. Type the slash / symbol for division.
       9. Click cell E3. This completes the formula that will calculate the percent change of last

            year's actual spent dollars vs. this year's budgeted spend dollars (see Figure 2.6).
     10. Press the ENTER key.
     11. Click cell F3 to activate it.
     12. Place the mouse pointer over the Auto Fill Handle.
     13. When the mouse pointer turns from a white block plus sign to a black plus sign, click and

            drag down to cell F11. This pastes the formula into the range F4:F11.

Figure 2.6 shows the formula that was added to the Budget Detail worksheet to calculate the
percent change in spending. The parentheses were added to this formula to control the order of
operations. Any mathematical computations placed in parentheses are executed first before the
standard order of mathematical operations (see Table 2.3). In this case, if parentheses were not
used, Excel would produce an erroneous result for this worksheet.

Figure 2.6 Adding the Percent Change Formula

Figure 2.7 shows the result of the percent change formula if the parentheses are removed. The
formula produces a result of a 299900% increase. Since there is no change between the LY spend
and the budget Annual Spend, the result should be 0%. However, without the parentheses, Excel
is following the standard order of operations. This means the value in cell E3 will be divided by
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  96

E3 first (3,000/3,000), which is 1. Then, the value of 1 will be subtracted from the value in cell D3
(3,000-1), which is 2,999. Since cell F3 is formatted as a percentage, Excel expresses the output as
an increase of 299900%.

Integrity Check<
Does the Output of Your Formula Make Sense?
It is important to note that the accuracy of the output produced by a formula depends on how it is con-
structed. Therefore, always check the result of your formula to see whether it makes sense with data in your
worksheet. As shown in Figure 2.7, a poorly constructed formula can give you an inaccurate result. In other
words, you can see that there is no change between the Annual Spend and LY Spend for Household Utilities.
Therefore, the result of the formula should be 0%. However, since the parentheses were removed in this
case, the formula is clearly producing an erroneous result.

                                                                  Skill Refresher

AUDITING FORMULAS

Excel provides a few tools that you can use to review the formulas entered into a worksheet. For
example, instead of showing the outputs for the formulas used in a worksheet, you can have Excel
show the formula as it was entered in the cell locations. This is demonstrated as follows:

       1. With the Budget Detail worksheet open, click the Formulas tab of the Ribbon.
       2. Click the Show Formulas button in the Formula Auditing group of commands. This dis-

            plays the formulas in the worksheet instead of showing the mathematical outputs.
       3. Click the Show Formulas button again. The worksheet returns to showing the output of

            the formulas.

You can also toggle Show Formulas on and off using the keyboard. Hold down the CTRL key while
pressing the ` key.

Figure 2.8 shows the Budget Detail worksheet after activating the Show Formulas command in
the Formulas tab of the Ribbon. As shown in the figure, this command allows you to view and
check all the formulas in a worksheet without having to click each cell individually. After activat-
ing this command, the column widths in your worksheet increase significantly. The column widths
were adjusted for the worksheet shown in Figure 2.8 so all columns can be seen. The column
widths return to their previous width when the Show Formulas command is deactivated.

   Show Formulas
             · Hold down the CTRL key while pressing the accent symbol `. Same for Excel for Mac.

Two other tools in the Formula Auditing group of commands are the Trace Precedents and Trace
Dependents commands. These commands are used to trace the cell references used in a formula.
A precedent cell is a cell whose value is used in other cells. The Trace Precedents command shows
an arrow to indicate the cells or ranges (precedents) which affect the active cell's value. A depen-
99  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

dent cell is a cell whose value depends on the values of other cells in the workbook. The Trace
Dependents command shows where any given cell is referenced in a formula. The following is a
demonstration of these commands:

       1. Click cell D3.

       2. Click the Trace Dependents button in the Formula Auditing group of commands in the
            Formulas tab of the Ribbon. A blue arrow appears, pointing to cell F3 (see Figure 2.9).
            This indicates that cell D3 is referenced in a formula entered in cell F3.

       3. Click the Remove Arrows command in the Formula Auditing group of commands in the
            Formulas tab of the Ribbon. This removes the Trace Dependents arrow.

       4. Click cell F3.

       5. Click the Trace Precedents button in the Formula Auditing group of commands in the
            Formulas tab of the Ribbon. A blue arrow with dots in cells D3 and E3, and pointing to
            cell F3 appears (see Figure 2.10). This indicates that cells D3 and E3 are references in a
            formula entered in cell F3.

       6. Click the Remove Arrows command in the Formula Auditing group of commands in the
            Formulas tab of the Ribbon. This removes the Trace Precedents arrow.

       7. Save the CH2 Personal Budget file.

Figure 2.9 shows the Trace Dependents arrow on the Budget Detail worksheet. The blue dot rep-
resents the activated cell. The arrows indicate where the cell is referenced in formulas.

             · Mathematical computations are conducted through formulas and functions.
101  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

             · An equal sign = precedes all formulas and functions.
             · Formulas and functions must be created with cell references to conduct what-if scenarios

                 where mathematical outputs are recalculated when one or more inputs are changed.
             · Mathematical operators on a typical calculator are different from those used in Excel. Table

                 2.2 "Excel Mathematical Operators" lists Excel mathematical operators.
             · When using numerical values in formulas and functions, only use universal constants that do

                 not change, such as days in a week, months in a year, and so on.
             · Relative referencing automatically adjusts the cell references in formulas and functions when

                 they are pasted into new locations on a worksheet. This eliminates the need to retype formu-
                 las and functions when they are needed in multiple rows or columns on a worksheet.
             · Parentheses must be used to control the order of operations when necessary for complex for-
                 mulas.
             · Formula auditing tools such as Trace Dependents, Trace Precedents, and Show Formulas
                 should be used to check the integrity of formulas that have been entered into a worksheet.

                                                              Learning Objectives

            1. Use the SUM function to calculate totals.
            2. Use the COUNT function to count cell locations with numerical values.
            3. Use the AVERAGE function to calculate the arithmetic mean.
            4. Use the MAX and MIN functions to find the highest and lowest values in a range of cells.
            5. Learn how to copy and paste formulas without formats applied to a cell location.
            6. Use absolute references to calculate percent of totals.
            7. Learn how to set a multiple level sort sequence for data sets that have duplicate values or out-

                 puts.

In addition to formulas, another way to conduct mathematical computations in Excel is through
functions. Excel functions apply a mathematical process to a group of cells in a worksheet. For
example, the SUM function is used to add the values contained in a range of cells. Functions are
more efficient than formulas when you are applying a mathematical process to a group of cells. If
you use a formula to add the values in a range of cells, you would have to add each cell location
to the formula one at a time. This can be very time-consuming if you have to add the values in a
few hundred cell locations. However, when you use a function, you can highlight all the cells that
contain values you wish to sum in just one step.

The components of a function are as follows:

=FunctionName(Arguments)

Functions are a type of formula, therefore they start with an equal sign. The next component is
the name of the function. A list of commonly used functions is shown in Table 2.4. After the func-
tion name comes the arguments for the function, which are always enclosed in parentheses. The
arguments are the cell locations and/or values that will be used in the function. The number and
type of arguments varies based on the the function being used, although in this section we will
only work with a range of cells for the function arguments. Some examples of different functions
with their arguments are:

                                                                                                      102
103                                                                                  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

=SUM(B2:B15) - adds the values in B2 through B15
=SQRT(A5) - finds the square root of the value in A5
=COUNTA(A1:A20) - finds the number of cells from A1 through A20 that contain text or a number

Throughout Section 2.2 we will add a variety of mathematical functions to the Personal Budget
workbook. In addition to creating functions, this section also reviews percent of total calculations
and the use of absolute references.

Table 2.4 Commonly Used Functions

Function Output

ABS     The absolute value of a number

AVERAGE The average or arithmetic mean for a group of numbers

COUNT The number of cell locations in a range that contain a numeric value

COUNTA The number of cell locations in a range that contain text or a numeric value

MAX     The highest numeric value in a group of numbers

MEDIAN  The middle number in a group of numbers (half the numbers in the group are higher than the median and half the numbers
        in the group are lower than the median)

MIN     The lowest numeric value in a group of numbers

MODE    The number that appears most frequently in a group of numbers

PRODUCT The result of multiplying all the values in a range of cell locations

SQRT    The positive square root of a number

It is important to note that there are several methods for adding a function to a worksheet, and
we will explore each of them throughout this section.

        · Typing the function directly into a cell
        · Selecting from the function list
        · Using the Function Library on the ribbon
        · Using the Insert Function button

THE SUM FUNCTION

The SUM function is used when you need to calculate totals for a range of cells or a group of
selected cells on a worksheet. With regard to the Budget Detail worksheet, we will use the SUM
function to calculate the totals in row 12, starting with the Monthly Spend total in B12. The follow-
ing illustrates how a function can be added to a worksheet by typing it into a cell location:

       1. Switch to the Budget Detail worksheet if needed.
       2. Click cell B12.
       3. Type an equal sign =.
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  104

       4. Type the function name SUM.
       5. Type an open parenthesis (.
       6. Click cell B3 and drag down to cell B11. This places the range B3:B11 into the function.
       7. Type a closing parenthesis ).
       8. Press the ENTER key. The function calculates the total for the Monthly Spend column,

            which is $1,427.

Figure 2.11 shows the appearance of the SUM function added to the Budget Detail worksheet
before pressing the ENTER key.

Figure 2.11 Adding the SUM Function to the Budget Detail Worksheet

As shown in Figure 2.11, the SUM function was added to cell B12. However, this function is also
needed to calculate the totals in the Annual Spend and Last Year Spend columns. The function can
be copied and pasted into these cell locations because of relative referencing. Relative referencing
serves the same purpose for functions as it does for formulas. To complete the Totals in row 12,
we need to copy and paste the SUM function into D12 and E12. Since we will then have totals in
D12 and E12, we can paste the percent change formula into F12.

       1. Click cell B12 in the Budget Detail worksheet.
       2. Click the Copy button in the Home tab of the Ribbon.
       3. Highlight cells D12 and E12.
105  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

       4. Click the Paste button in the Home tab of the Ribbon. This pastes the SUM function into
            cells D12 and E12 and calculates the totals for these columns.

       5. Click cell F11.
       6. Click the Copy button in the Home tab of the Ribbon.
       7. Click cell F12, then click the Paste button in the Home tab of the Ribbon.

Figure 2.12 shows the output of the SUM function that was added to cells B12, D12, and E12. In
addition, the percent change formula was copied and pasted into cell F12. Notice that this version
of the budget is planning an increase in spending compared to last year.

Cell Ranges in Functions
When you intend to use a function on a range of cells in a worksheet, make sure there are two cell locations
separated by a colon and not a comma. If you enter two cell locations separated by a comma, the function
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  106

will calculate only the two cell locations listed instead of an entire range of cells. For example, the SUM func-
tion shown in Figure 2.13 will add only the values in cells C3 and C11, not the range C3:C11.

Figure 2.13 SUM Function Adding Two Cell Locations

THE COUNT FUNCTION

Data file: Continue with CH2 Personal Budget.

The next function that we will add to the Budget Detail worksheet is the COUNT function. The
COUNT function is used to determine how many cells in a range contain a numeric entry. The
COUNT function will not work for counting text or other non-numeric entries. If you want to count
text instead of, or in addition to, numeric entries you use the COUNTA function. For the Budget
Detail worksheet, we will use the COUNT function to count the number of items that are planned
in the Annual Spend column (Column D). The following explains how the COUNT function is added
to the worksheet by selecting from the function list:

       1. Click cell D13.
       2. Type an equal sign =.
       3. Type the letter C (to start spelling the name of the function).
       4. Click the down arrow on the scroll bar of the function list (see Figure 2.14) and find the

            word COUNT.
                Mac Users can scroll down with touchpad or mouse to find COUNT
107  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

       5. Double click the word COUNT from the function list.

            Mac Users should single click the word "COUNT" do not double-click

       6. Highlight the range D3:D11.

       7. You can type a closing parenthesis ) and then press the ENTER key, or simply press the
            ENTER key and Excel will close the function for you. The function produces an output of
            9 since there are 9 items planned on the worksheet.

Figure 2.14 shows the function list box that appears after completing steps 2 and 3 for the COUNT
function. The function list provides an alternative method for adding a function to a worksheet.

Figure 2.14 Using the Function List to Add the COUNT Function

Figure 2.15 shows the output of the COUNT function after pressing the ENTER key. The function
counts the number of cells in the range D3:D11 that contain a numeric value. The result of 9 indi-
cates that there are 9 categories planned for this budget.

THE AVERAGE FUNCTION

The next function we will add to the Budget Detail worksheet is the AVERAGE function. This func-
tion is used to calculate the arithmetic mean for a group of numbers. For the Budget Detail work-
sheet, we will use the function to calculate the average of the values in the Annual Spend column.
We will add this to the worksheet by using the Function Library on the Formulas ribbon. The fol-
lowing steps explain how this is accomplished:

       1. Click cell D14 in the Budget Detail worksheet.
       2. Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon.
       3. Click the More Functions button in the Function Library group of commands.
       4. Place the mouse pointer over the Statistical option from the drop-down list of options.
       5. Click the AVERAGE function name from the list of functions that appear in the menu (see

            Figure 2.16). This opens the Function Arguments dialog box.
       6. Click the Collapse Dialog button in the Function Arguments dialog box (see Figure 2.17).

                For Mac Users, the Collapse Dialog button may not collapse. Just continue with Step 7
109  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

            and press Enter after selecting the range.
       7. Highlight the range D3:D11.
       8. Click the Expand Dialog button in the Function Arguments dialog box (see Figure 2.18).

            You can also press the ENTER key to get the same result.
       9. Click the OK button on the Function Arguments dialog box. This adds the AVERAGE func-

COPY AND PASTE FORMULAS (PASTING WITHOUT FORMATS)

Data file: Continue with CH2 Personal Budget.

As shown in Figure 2.24, the COUNT, AVERAGE, MIN, and MAX functions are summarizing the data
in the Annual Spend column. You will also notice that there is space to copy and paste these func-
tions under the Last Year Spend column. This allows us to compare what we spent last year and
what we are planning to spend this year. Normally, we would simply copy and paste these func-
tions into the range E14:E16. However, you may have noticed the thicker style border that was
used around the perimeter of the range D13:E16. If we used the regular Paste command, the thick
line on the right side of the range D13:E16 would be replaced with a single line. Therefore, we are
going to use one of the Paste Special commands to paste only the functions without any of the
formatting treatments. This is accomplished through the following steps:

       1. Highlight the range D14:D16 in the Budget Detail worksheet.
       2. Click the Copy button in the Home tab of the Ribbon.
       3. Click cell E14.
       4. Click the down arrow below the Paste button in the Home tab of the Ribbon.
       5. Click the Formulas option from the drop-down list of buttons (see Figure 2.25).

Figure 2.25 shows the list of buttons that appear when you click the down arrow below the Paste
button in the Home tab of the Ribbon. One thing to note about these options is that you can pre-
view them before you make a selection by dragging the mouse pointer over the options. When
117  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

the mouse pointer is placed over the Formulas button, you can see how the functions will appear
before making a selection. Notice that the thick line border does not change when this option is
previewed. That is why this selection is made instead of the regular Paste option.

ABSOLUTE REFERENCES (CALCULATING PERCENT OF TOTALS)

Data file: Continue with CH2 Personal Budget.
To further analyze your budget, you want to see what percentage of your total monthly spending
is spent in each category. Since totals were added to row 12 of the Budget Detail worksheet, a
percent of total calculation can be added to Column C beginning in cell C3. The percent of total
calculation shows the percentage for each value in the Monthly Spend column with respect to the
total in cell B12. However, after the formula is created, it will be necessary to turn off Excel's rela-
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  118

tive referencing feature before copying and pasting the formula to the rest of the cell locations in
the column. Turning off Excel's relative referencing feature is accomplished through an absolute
reference.

First we will create the formula, which needs needs to divide the amount in B3 by the total monthly
spend in B12.

       1. Click cell C3 in the Budget Detail worksheet.
       2. Type an equal sign =.
       3. Click cell B3.
       4. Type a forward slash /.
       5. Click cell B12.
       6. Press the ENTER key. You will see that Utilities represent about 17.5% of the Monthly

            Spend budget (see Figure 2.26).

Figure 2.26 Adding a Formula to Calculate the Percent of Total

Figure 2.26 shows the completed formula that is calculating the percentage that Utilities repre-
sents to the total Monthly Spend for the budget (see cell C3). Normally, we would copy this formula
and paste it into the range C4:C11. However, because of relative referencing, both cell references
will increase by one row as the formula is pasted into the cells below C3. This is fine for the first
cell reference in the formula (C3) but not for the second cell reference (C12).

Figure 2.27 illustrates what happens if we paste the formula into the range C4:C12 in its current
state. Notice that Excel produces the #DIV/0 error code. This means that Excel is trying to divide
a number by zero, which is impossible. Looking at the formula in cell C4, you see that the first cell
reference was changed from B3 to B4. This is fine because we now want to divide the Monthly
119                                               DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

Spend for Cell Phone (cell B4) by the total Monthly Spend in cell B12. However, Excel has also
changed the B12 cell reference to B13. Because cell location B13 does not contain a number, the
formula produces the #DIV/0 error code.

Figure 2.27 #DIV/0 Error from Relative Referencing

To eliminate the divide-by-zero error shown in Figure 2.27 we must add an absolute reference to
cell B12 in the formula. An absolute reference prevents relative referencing from changing a cell
reference in a formula. This is also referred to as locking a cell. No matter where you copy a for-
mula with an absolute reference, it will always refer back to the locked cell. An absolute reference
is indicated by a $ sign in front of both the column letter and the row number. For example, $A$15
is an absolute reference to cell A15.

We are going to modify the existing formula in    $A$15 is an example of
C3 to make the reference to cell B12 an absolute   an absolute reference
reference. The following explains how this is
accomplished:

       1. Double click cell C3.
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  120

       2. Place the mouse pointer in front of B12 and click. The blinking cursor should be in front
            of the B in the cell reference B12.

       3. Press the F4 key. You will see a dollar sign ($) added in front of the column letter B and
            the row number 12. You can also type the dollar signs in front of the column letter and row
            number if you prefer. The formula should appear as =B3/$B$12. The F4 key is a cool shortcut
            for adding the dollar signs.
                Mac Users: If the F4 key does not insert the $ symbols, check the keyboard settings:

            click black Apple icon at top left of the screen, choose "System Preferences", click
            the Keyboard icon, make sure the checkbox is checked for the item that says: "Use F1,
            F2, etc. as standard function keys".

       4. Press the ENTER key.

       5. Click cell C3.

       6. Use the AutoFill Handle or Copy and Paste to copy the formula from C3 to the range
            C4:C11.

Figure 2.28 shows the percent of total formula with an absolute reference added to B12. Notice
that in cell C4, the cell reference remains B12 instead of changing to B13. Also, you will see that
the percentages are being calculated in the rest of the cells in the column, and the divide-by-zero
error is now eliminated.

SORTING DATA (MULTIPLE LEVELS)

Data file: Continue with CH2 Personal Budget.
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  122

The Budget Detail worksheet shown in Figure 2.28 is now producing several mathematical out-
puts through formulas and functions. The outputs allow you to analyze the details and identify
trends as to how money is being budgeted and spent. Before we draw some conclusions from this
worksheet, we will sort the data based on the Percent of Total column. Sorting is a powerful tool
that enables you to analyze key trends in any data set. Sorting will be covered thoroughly in a later
chapter, but will be briefly introduced here.

For the purposes of the Budget Detail worksheet, we want to set multiple levels for the sort
order. We are going to sort first by the Percent of Total, and then by the Last Year Spend amount.
Excel will first sort the items by the Percent of Total, and any items with the same Percent of Total
will then be sorted by Last Year Spend. This is accomplished through the following steps:

       1. Highlight the range A2:F11.

       2. Click the Data tab in the Ribbon.

       3. Click the Sort button in the Sort & Filter group of commands. This opens the Sort dialog
            box, as shown in Figure 2.29.

       4. Click the down arrow next to the "Sort by" box.

       5. Click the Percent of Total option from the drop-down list.

       6. Click the down arrow next to the sort Order box.

       7. Click the Largest to Smallest option.

       8. Click the Add Level button. This allows you to set a second level for any duplicate values
            in the Percent of Total column.

three identical values in the Percent of Total column. This is why a second sort level had to be cre-
ated for this worksheet. The second sort level arranges the values of 7.01% based on the values
in the Last Year Spend column in ascending order. Excel gives you the option to set as many sort
levels as necessary for the data contained in a worksheet.

             · Statistical functions are used when a mathematical process is required for a range of cells,
                 such as summing the values in several cell locations. For these computations, functions are
                 preferable to formulas because adding many cell locations one at a time to a formula can be
                 very time-consuming.

             · Statistical functions can be created using cell ranges or selected cell locations separated by
                 commas. Make sure you use a cell range (two cell locations separated by a colon) when apply-
                 ing a statistical function to a contiguous range of cells.

             · To prevent Excel from changing the cell references in a formula or function when they are
                 pasted to a new cell location, you must use an absolute reference. You can do this by placing
                 a dollar sign ($) in front of the column letter and row number of a cell reference.

             · The #DIV/0 error appears if you create a formula that attempts to divide a constant or the
                 value in a cell reference by zero.

             · The Paste Formulas option is used when you need to paste formulas without any formatting
                 treatments into cell locations that have already been formatted.

             · You need to set multiple levels, or columns, in the Sort dialog box when sorting data that con-
                 tains several duplicate values.

missing from the Budget Detail worksheet are the payments you might make for a car or a home.
This section demonstrates Excel functions used to calculate loan payments for a car and to calcu-
late mortgage payments for a house.

THE FUNDAMENTALS OF LOANS AND LEASES

One of the functions we will add to the Personal Budget workbook is the PMT function. This func-
tion calculates the payments required for loan repayment. However, before demonstrating this
function, it is important to cover a few fundamental concepts on loans.
A loan is a contractual agreement in which money is borrowed from a lender and paid back over a
specific period of time. The amount of money that is borrowed from the lender is called the prin­
cipal of the loan. The borrower is usually required to pay the principal of the loan plus interest.
When you borrow money to buy a house, the loan is referred to as a mortgage. This is because
the house being purchased also serves as collateral to ensure payment. In other words, the bank
can take possession of your house if you fail to make loan payments. As shown in Table 2.5, there
are several key terms related to loans.
Table 2.5 Key Terms for Loans

                                                                                                      126

Term      Definition

Interest  The interest that is charged to the borrower as a cost for borrowing money
Rate

Mortgage A loan where property is put up for collateral

Principal The amount of money that has been borrowed

Residual  The estimated selling price of a vehicle at a future point in time
Value

Length The amount of time you have to repay a loan

Figure 2.31 shows an example of an amortization table for a loan. A lender is required by law to
provide borrowers with an amortization table when a loan contract is offered. The table in the fig-
ure shows how the payments of a loan would work if you borrowed $100,000 from a lender and
agreed to pay it back over 10 years at an interest rate of 5%. You will notice that each time you
make a payment, you are paying the bank an interest fee plus some of the loan principal. Each
year the amount of interest paid to the bank decreases and the amount of money used to pay off
the principal increases. This is because the bank is charging you interest on the amount of princi-
pal that has not been paid. As you pay off the principal, the interest rate is applied to a lower num-
ber, which reduces your interest charges. Finally, the figure shows that the sum of the values in
the Interest Payment column is $29,505. This is how much it costs you to borrow this money over
10 years. Indeed, borrowing money is not free. It is important to note that to simplify this example,
the payments were calculated on an annual basis. However, most loan payments are made on a
monthly basis.

THE PMT (PAYMENT) FUNCTION FOR LOANS

Data file: Continue with CH2 Personal Budget.
If you own a home, your mortgage payments are a major component of your household budget. If
you are planning to buy a home, having a clear understanding of your monthly payments is critical
for maintaining strong financial health. In Excel, mortgage payments are conveniently calculated
through the PMT (payment) function. This function is more complex than the statistical functions
129                                                                                          DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

covered in Section 2.2 "Statistical Functions". With statistical functions, you are required to add
only a range of cells or selected cells within the parentheses of the function, also known as the
argument. With the PMT function, you must accurately define a series of arguments in order for
the function to produce a reliable output. Table 2.6 lists the arguments for the PMT function. It is
helpful to review the key loan terms in Table 2.5 before reviewing the PMT function arguments.

Table 2.6 Arguments for the PMT Function

Argument Definition

Rate    This is the interest rate the lender is charging the borrower. The interest rate is usually quoted in annual terms, so you have
        to divide this rate by 12 if you are calculating monthly payments.

Nper    The argument letters stand for number of periods. This is the term of the loan, which is the amount of time you have to
        repay the bank. This is usually quoted in years, so you have to multiply the years by 12 if you are calculating monthly
        payments.

Pv      The argument letters stand for present value. This is the principal of the loan or the amount of money that is borrowed.

        The argument letters stand for future value. The brackets around the argument indicate that it is not always necessary to

[Fv]    define it. It is used if there is a lump-sum payment that will be made at the end of the loan terms. This is also used for the

        residual value of a lease. If it is not defined, Excel will assume that it is zero.

[Type]  This argument can be defined with either a 1 or a 0. The number 1 is used if payments are made at the beginning of each
        period. A 0 is used if payments are made at the end of each period. The argument is in brackets because it does not have to
        be defined if payments are made at the end of each period. Excel assumes that this argument is 0 if it is not defined.

By default, the result of the PMT function in Excel is shown as a negative number. This is because
it represents an outgoing payment. When making a mortgage or car payment, you are paying
money out of your pocket or bank account. Depending on the type of work that you do, your
employer may want you to leave your payments negative or they may ask you to format them as
positive numbers. In the following assignments, the payments calculated using the PMT function
will be made positive to make them easier to work with. To do this, you will place a negative sign
between the equal sign and the function name PMT.

We will first use the PMT function in the Personal Budget workbook to calculate the monthly loan
payments for a car. These calculations will be made in the Loan Payments worksheet and then
displayed in the Budget Summary worksheet through a cell reference link. So far we have demon-
strated several methods for adding functions to a worksheet. When working with more complex
functions such as the PMT, it is easiest to use the Function Dialog box.

Remember to use cell references for the arguments of the PMT function whenever possible. This
will allow you the flexibility to change aspects of the loan, such as a lower interest rate or more
expensive car, and have the payment automatically recalculate.

The following steps use the Insert Function com-  Using cell references for the

 3. Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon.

 4. Click the Insert Function button to bring up the Insert Function dialog box.

 5. Type loan payment in the search box and click Go.
          the Excel for Mac search box does is not the same as the "Search for a function: input

      box". Mac Users must type: PMT in the search box instead. Then press Enter.

 6. Double-click the PMT option in the "Select a function:" box. This will open the Function
      Arguments dialog box.

 7. Drag the Function Arguments dialog box out of the way so that you can see the work-

     sheet cells you want to use in the function. Refer to Figure 2.31 for the com­
     pleted Function Arguments dialog box as you complete the next
     steps.

 8. Click in the Rate argument box in the dialog box, then click cell B3 in the worksheet. This
      will add B3 (the annual interest rate) to the Rate argument.

 9. Type a forward slash / for division.

10. Type the number 12. Since our goal is to calculate the monthly payments for the loan, we
      need to divide the rate, which is stated in annual terms, by 12. This converts the annual rate
      to a monthly rate.

11. Click the Nper argument box (or use the Tab key) and then click cell B4 in the worksheet.
      This will add B4 (the number of years to repay the loan) to the Nper argument.

12. Type an asterisk * for multiplication.

13. Type the number 12. Since our goal is to calculate the monthly payments for the loan, we
      need to multiply the terms of the loan by 12. This converts the terms of the loan from years to
      months.

14. Click the Pv argument box (or use the Tab key) and then click cell B2 in the worksheet.
      This will add B2 (the amount of the loan) to the Pv argument.

15. You will now see the Rate, Nper, and Pv arguments defined for the function. (see Figure
      2.31)

16. Click the OK button at the bottom of the Function Arguments dialog box. The function
      will now be placed into the worksheet. Since we are not paying any lump sums of money
      at the end of the loan, there is no need to define the Fv argument. Also, we will assume
      that the monthly payments will be made at the end of each month. Therefore, there is
      no need to define the Type argument.

17. Notice that the result of the formula in cell B5 is showing as a negative number (see Fig­
      ure 2.32). To fix this, double-click on cell B5 and type a negative sign between the equal
      sign and the letters PMT in the formula (see Figure 2.33).

18. The finished formula in cell B5 should be =-PMT(B3/12,B4*12,B2)

Figure 2.31 shows the completed Function Arguments dialog box for the PMT function. Notice that
the dialog box shows the values for the Rate and Nper arguments. The Rate is divided by 12 to
convert the annual interest rate to a monthly interest rate. The Nper argument is multiplied by 12
to convert the terms of the loan from years to months. Finally, the dialog box provides you with a
definition for each argument. The definition appears when you click in the input box for the argu-
ment.

Integrity Check
Comparable Arguments for PMT Function
When using functions such as PMT, make sure the arguments are defined in comparable terms. For example,
if you are calculating the monthly payments of a loan, make sure both the Rate and Nper argument are
expressed in terms of months. The function will produce an erroneous result if one argument is expressed
in years while the other is expressed in months.

THE PMT FUNCTION WHEN THERE IS A DOWN PAYMENT

In addition to calculating the loan payments for a car, the PMT function will be used in the Personal
Budget workbook to calculate the mortgage payments for a home. The details for the mortgage
payments are also found in the Loan Payments worksheet. Unlike the car loan, there is a down
payment with the mortgage. A down payment on a mortgage is usually a percentage of the price
of the home, which is paid up front and reduces the amount of the loan itself. The down payment
amount and amount of the loan will both need to be calculated using formulas. While we did not
use a down payment in the car loan example, it is fairly common to have a down payment when
purchasing a car too.

Write the formulas to calculate the Down Payment Amount and new Loan Amount by following
these steps:

       1. Click cell B11.

       2. Write the formula =B9*B10. This will calculate 20% of the price of the house.

       3. Click cell B12. Write the formula =B9-B11. This will subtract the down payment amount
            from the price of the house (see Figure 2.34 for the Show Formulas View and Figure 2.35
            for the formula results).

Figure 2.34 Show Formulas View
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  134

Figure 2.35 Results of the Down Payment Amount and Revised Loan Amount Formulas

Now that we have the revised Loan Amount in cell B12, we can write the PMT function following
the same process we did for the car loan.

       1. Click cell B15.
       2. Click the Formulas tab on the Ribbon.
       3. Click the Insert Function button to bring up the Insert Function dialog box.
       4. Type PMT in the search box and click Go.
       5. Double-click the PMT option in the "Select a function:" box. This will open the Function

            Arguments dialog box.
       6. Enter the following arguments (see Figure 2.36)

                     Rate: B13/12 -> divide by 12 to convert the annual rate to a monthly one
                     Nper: B14*12 -> multiply by 12 to convert the number of years into number of

                        months
                     Pv: B12 -> this is the cell with the actual loan amount, not the price of the house

       7. Click OK in the Function Arguments dialog box.
       8. Modify the formula in cell B15 to display the result as a positive number. Remember to

            type a negative sign between the equal sign and the letters PMT.

     9. Cell B15 should contain the function: =-PMT(B13/12,B14*12,B12) and the
         result should be $708.60 (see Figure 2.37).

Figure 2.36 shows how the the completed Function Arguments dialog box for the PMT function
for the mortgage should appear before pressing the OK button.

                 the function list.
            3. Define the Rate argument with a cell location that contains the rate being charged by the

                 lender for the loan or lease. If the interest rate given is an annual rate, divide it by 12 to convert
                 it to a monthly rate.
            4. Define the Nper argument with a cell location that contains the amount of time to repay the
                 loan or lease. If the amount of time is in years, multiply it by 12 to convert it to number of
                 months.
            5. Define the Pv argument with a cell location that contains the principal of the loan or the price

LINKING WORKSHEETS (CREATING A SUMMARY WORKSHEET)

So far we have used cell references in formulas and functions, which allow Excel to produce new
outputs when the values in the cell references are changed. Cell references can also be used to
display values or the outputs of formulas and functions in cell locations on other worksheets. This
is how we will complete the Budget Summary worksheet using values from both the Budget Detail
and Loan Payments worksheets.

Outputs from the formulas and functions that were entered into the Budget Detail will be dis-
played on the Budget Summary worksheet through the use of cell references.

       1. Switch to the Budget Summary worksheet and select cell B4. This cell needs to reference
            the Total Annual Spend (D12) from the Budget Detail worksheet.

       2. Type an =
       3. Click the Budget Detail worksheet tab.
       4. Click cell D12.
       5. Press the ENTER key on your keyboard.
       6. The formula bar will display the formula ='Budget Detail'!D12 and the cell will display

            $17,124. (see Figure 2.38)
137  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

Figure 2.38 shows how the cell reference appears in the Budget Summary worksheet. Notice that
the cell reference D12 is preceded by the Budget Detail worksheet name enclosed in apostro-
phes followed by an exclamation point (`Budget Detail'!) This indicates that the value displayed in
the cell is referencing a cell location in the Budget Detail worksheet.

Figure 2.38 Cell Reference Showing the Total Annual Spend from the Budget Detail Worksheet

We will use a similar process to enter in the annual car payments and mortgage payments from
the Loan Payments worksheet. The payments on the Loan Payments worksheet are monthly pay-
ments though, so we will need to multiply each one by 12 to get the annual amount to display in
the Budget Summary worksheet.

       1. Click on cell B5. This cell needs to contain a formula that references the monthly car payment
            cell (B5) on the Loan Payments worksheet and multiplies by 12.

       2. Type an =
       3. Click the Loan Payments worksheet tab.
       4. Click cell B5 on the Loan Payments worksheet.
       5. The formula bar will display the formula ='Loan Payments'!B5
       6. Type an asterisk * for multiplication.
       7. Type the number 12. The formula in the formula bar should read: ='Loan Pay­

       8. Press the ENTER key on your keyboard.
       9. Click on cell B6. This cell needs to contain a formula that references the monthly mortgage

            payment cell (B15) on the Loan Payments worksheet and multiplies by 12.
     10. Type an =
     11. Click the Loan Payments worksheet tab.

Figure 2.39 shows the results of creating formulas that reference cell locations in the Loan Pay­
ments worksheet.

We can now add other formulas and functions to the Budget Summary worksheet that can calcu-
late the difference between the total spend dollars vs. the total net income in cell B3. The following
steps explain how this is accomplished:
139  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

       1. Click cell B7 in the Budget Summary worksheet.
       2. Type an equal sign =.
       3. Type the function name SUM followed by an open parenthesis (.
       4. Highlight the range B4:B6.
       5. Type a closing parenthesis ) and press the ENTER key on your keyboard or simply press

            the ENTER key to close the function. The total for all annual expenses now appears on the
            worksheet.
       6. Click cell B8 on the Budget Summary worksheet. You will enter a formula to calculate
            Remaining (Savings) amount in this cell.
       7. Type an equal sign =.
       8. Click cell B3.
       9. Type a minus sign - and then click cell B7.
     10. Press the ENTER key on your keyboard. This formula produces a positive number, indi-
            cating our income is greater than our total expenses.

Figure 2.40 shows the results of the formulas that were added to the Budget Summary work-
sheet. Overall, having your income exceed your total expenses is a good thing because it allows
you to save money for future spending needs or unexpected events.

Figure 2.40 Formulas Added to Calculate Amount Remaining for Savings

We can now add a few formulas that calculate both the spending rate and the savings rate as a
percentage of net income. These formulas require the use of absolute references, which we cov-
ered earlier in this chapter. The following steps explain how to add these formulas:
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019                                       140

 1. Click cell C7 in the Budget Summary worksheet.
 2. Type an equal sign =.
 3. Click cell B7.
 4. Type a forward slash / for division and then click B3.
 5. Press the F4 key on your keyboard. This adds an absolute reference to cell B3.
 6. Press the ENTER key. The result of the formula shows that total expenses consume 89%

      of our net income.
 7. Click cell C7.
 8. Place the mouse pointer over the Auto Fill Handle.
 9. When the mouse pointer turns to a black plus sign, left click and drag down to cell C8.

      This copies and pastes the formula into cell C8.
10. Compare your worksheets with Figures 2.41a-c below. Make any necessary changes

      before moving on to the next section.
11. Save the CH2 Personal Budget file.

             · The PMT function can be used to calculate the monthly mortgage payments for a house or the
                 monthly lease payments for a car.

             · When using the PMT function, each argument must be separated by a comma.
             · To calculate the monthly payment for a loan using the PMT function, the Rate and Nper argu-

                 ments must be defined in terms of months. The Rate should be divided by 12 to convert it
                 from an annual rate to a monthly rate. The Nper should be multiplied by 12 to convert the
                 term of the loan from years to months.
             · The PMT function produces a negative output if the Pv argument is not preceded by a minus
                 sign. For the purposes of this textbook, a minus sign will be entered before the PV argument

USING PAGE SETUP OPTIONS

Once the worksheet is professionally formatted, you need to look in Print Preview to see how the
pages will print.
147                                            DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

     1. Go to Backstage View by clicking the File tab on the ribbon. Select Print from the menu.
         Notice that the worksheet is currently printing on two pages, with the page breaking
         between the April and May columns. To fix this problem, you will first change the left
         and right margins while still in Print Preview

              Mac Users should click the File menu option and select Print from the menu

     2. Click the Margins drop-down arrow in the Settings section (see Figure 2.45)

     3. Select Custom Margins... at the bottom of the list.

              Mac Users should select "Manage Custom Margins"

     4. Type in 0.5 for the Left Margin and 0.5 for the Right Margin.

     5. Click OK. Changing the margins brought the May column onto the same page, but the
         June column is still on a separate page. Next you will use Page Scaling to fix this while
         still in Print Preview.

     6. Click the Scaling drop-down arrow in the Settings section (Figure 2.46).

              Mac Users: there is no "Scaling drop-down arrow". Just click the checkbox for "Scale
         to fit"

     7. Select Fit All Columns on One Page.

CREATING A FOOTER USING PAGE SETUP

Now that the entire worksheet is printing on one page, you need to add a footer with information
about the date the file was printed along with the filename. In Chapter 1 you learned how to create
headers and footers using the Insert ribbon. You can also create headers and footers using the
Custom Header/Footer dialog box.

       1. Click the Page Layout tab on the ribbon.
       2. Click the dialog box launcher in the Page Setup group. A window similar to Figure 2.47

            should appear.

                                                   Key Takeaways

· It is important to always check your workbooks in Print Preview to ensure that the data is
   printed in a professional and easy to read manner.

· Adjust margins and page scaling as needed to keep columns of data together on one page if
   possible.

· Use headers and footers to display information in the top and bottom margins of the printed
   worksheet. Use the Insert buttons to insert changing information, such as dates and file
   names, instead of typing them in directly.

FINANCIAL PLAN FOR A LAWN CARE BUSINESS

Download Data File: PR2-Data
Running your own lawn care business can be an excellent way to make money over the summer
while on break from college. It can also be a way to supplement your existing income for the pur-
pose of saving money for retirement or for a college fund. However, managing the costs of the
business will be critical in order for it to be a profitable venture. In this exercise you will create a
simple financial plan for a lawn care business by using the skills covered in this chapter.
There are two worksheets in the workbook you will be using.

        · Annual Plan - provides calculations to determine how much money the lawn care busi-
            ness brings in for one year, based on the average price per lawn cut and the number cut
            per year, as well as the expenses for the year.

       1. Switch to the Equipment Loans worksheet.
       2. In cell E3, write a PMT function to calculate the monthly payment for the Commercial

            Lawn Mower. Don't forget the negative sign in between the equal sign and the PMT! Remem­
            ber to convert the interest rate and years to monthly terms and to use cell references. The
            arguments of the PMT function should be as follows:

                     RATE: B3/12
                     NPER: C3*12
                     PV: D3

       3. Copy the PMT function from cell E3 to the other equipment items.
       4. In cell E10, use the SUM function to calculate the total for the monthly loan payments.

            Make sure that the blank rows (7 through 9) were included in the range for the SUM
            function so that you can add more equipment items later if needed.
       5. In cell E11, write a formula that calculates the total annual loan payments. This will be
            the monthly total multiplied by 12 (the number of months in a year).
       6. If needed, apply Accounting format to all of the monetary values so that the placement
            of the dollar sign is consistent throughout the worksheet.

HOTEL OCCUPANCY AND EXPENSES

Download Data File: SC2-Data

The hotel management industry presents a wide variety of career opportunities. These range from
running a bed and breakfast to a management position at a large hotel. No matter what hotel
management career you choose to pursue, understanding hotel occupancy and costs are critical
to running a successful operation. This exercise examines the occupancy rate and expenses of a
small hotel.

There are three worksheets in the workbook for this assignment.

        · Occupancy - calculates and displays the maximum hotel capacity for each month
            (based on the number of rooms, the capacity of each room, and the number of days in
            the specific month), the actual occupancy (how many actually stayed in the hotel that
            month), and the occupancy percentage (what percentage of capacity was the hotel
            each month).

        · Statistics - calculates and displays the highest, lowest, and average actual occupancy
            and occupancy percentages form the Occupancy worksheet.

        · Shuttle Purchase - calculates three different down payment options for a loan to pur-
            chase a shuttle for the hotel.

Occupancy Worksheet

       1. Open the file named SC2 Data and then Save As SC2 Hotel.
       2. Switch to the Occupancy worksheet if needed.
       3. Replace the [Insert Year] in A1 with the year number for last year.
       4. You need to calculate the January capacity for the hotel in C5. The capacity shows how

            many people the hotel can hold during the month. It is calculated by first multiplying the
            occupants per room by the number of rooms in the hotel. This result is then multiplied by
            the number of days in the month (cell B5 for January). Create this formula using
            absolute references so that the appropriate cells do not change when the formula is

                                                                                                      157
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  158

      pasted throughout column C. Hint: two of the cells in the formula need to be absolute refer­
      ences.

 5. Copy the formula in cell C5 and paste it into the range C6:C16. Use a paste method that
      does not remove the border at the bottom of cell C16.

 6. Format the numbers in columns C and D for comma format with zero decimal places.

 7. In cell C17, enter a function that finds the sum of the monthly hotel capacity values. Do
      the same in cell D17 to find the sum of the monthly actual occupancy values.

 8. Enter a formula in cell E5 to calculate the Percent Occupied of the hotel (this statistic
      shows what percentage of the hotel is full or occupied). Your formula should divide the
      Actual Occupancy by the Hotel Capacity. Then copy and paste the formula into the range
      E6:E17. Use a paste method that does not remove the borders at the bottom of cell E16
      and E17. Format the results in E5:E17 as percentages with two decimal places.

 9. Format the Totals (C17:E17) as bold.

10. Apply any number formatting that aids in the readability and professionalism of the
      worksheet.

11. Check Print Preview and make any changes necessary for professional printing.

Statistics Worksheet

       1. Replace the [Insert Year] in A1 with the year number for last year.
       2. Enter a function in cell B3 that finds the highest value in the Actual Occupancy column

            from the Occupancy worksheet.
       3. Enter a function in cell B4 that finds the lowest value in the Actual Occupancy column

            from the Occupancy worksheet.
       4. Enter a function in cell B5 that shows the average value of the Actual Occupancy column

            on the Occupancy worksheet.
       5. Use the Auto Fill handle to copy the formulas in the range B3:B5 to the range C3:C5.
       6. Apply any number formatting that aids in the readability and professionalism of the

            worksheet. The numbers should be formatted similarly to the Occupancy worksheet.
       7. Check Print Preview and make any changes necessary for professional printing.

Shuttle Purchase Worksheet

The hotel is considering buying a car to shuttle customers to and from the airport. You need to
decide how much of a down payment to make, so you are going to calculate the monthly payment
based on three different down payment percentages. The number of years to pay off the loan will
vary for each of the down payment percentage options. Remember, the down payment amount
159          DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

is found by multiplying the price of the car by the down payment percentage. This amount is then
subtracted from the price of the car to find the amount of the loan.

       1. In cell B5 write a formula that will calculate the amount of the down payment. Be sure
            to use cell references as much as possible. Copy the formula to the other down payment
            options.

       2. In cell B6 write a formula to calculate the amount of the loan. Be sure to use cell refer­
            ences as much as possible.Copy the formula to the other down payment options.

       3. In cell B9 create a PMT function to calculate the monthly payment. Make sure the argu-
            ments in the PMT function are converted into months and that the monthly payment is a

         positive number. Be sure to use cell references as much as possible. Copy the function to

            the other down payment options.

       4. In cell B10 create a formula that calculates how much will be paid in total for the vehi-
            cle, including the down payment and the total amount paid on the loan in the given
            number of years. Copy the formula to the other down payment options.

       5. In cell A12, write an explanation of which down payment option is the best and why.

       6. Apply any number formatting that aids in the readability and professionalism of the
            worksheet.

       7. Make the following page setup changes to the worksheet:

                     Center horizontally on the page
                     Create a footer with the date on the left and the file name on the right. Make

                        sure that both the date and the file name will update automatically.

       8. Check the spelling on all of the worksheets and make any necessary changes.

       9. Save the SC2 Hotel workbook and submit the workbook as directed by your instructor.

     CHAPTER 3 - FORMULAS,
     FUNCTIONS, LOGICAL AND
     LOOKUP FUNCTIONS

Excel workbooks are designed to allow you to create useful and complex calculations. In addition
to doing arithmetic, you can use Excel to look up data, and to display results based on logical con-
ditions. We will also look at ways to highlight specific results. These skills will be demonstrated in
the context of a typical gradebook spreadsheet that contains the results for an imaginary Excel
class.

In this chapter, we will:

        · Use the Quick Analysis Tool to find the Total Points for all students and Points Possible.
                (Note for Mac Users: the Quick Analysis Tool is not available with Excel for Mac. We

            have alternate steps for Mac Users)
        · Write a division formula to find the Percentage for each student, using an absolute refer-

            ence to the Total Points Possible.
        · Write an IF Function to determine Pass/Fail - passing is 70% or higher.
        · Write a VLOOKUP to determine the Letter Grade using the Letter Grades scale.
        · Use the TODAY function to insert the current date.
        · Review common Error Messages using Smart Lookup to get definitions of some of the

            terms in your spreadsheet.
        · Apply Data Bars to the Total Points values.
        · Apply Conditional Formatting to the Percentage, Pass/Fail, and Letter Grade columns.
        · Printing Review - Change to Landscape, Scale to Fit Columns on One Page and Set Print

            Area.

Figure 3-1 shows the completed workbook that will be demonstrated in this chapter. Notice the
techniques used in columns O and R that highlight the results of your calculations. Notice, also
that there are more numbers on this version of the file than you will see in your original data file.
These are all completed using Excel calculations.

                                                                                                      160

                                                              Learning Objectives
            1. Review the use of the =MAX function.
            2. Examine the Quick Analysis Tool to create standard calculations, formatting, and charts very

                 quickly.
            3. Create Percentage calculation.

                 - Use the Smart Lookup tool to acquire additional information about percentage calculations.
                 - Review the use of Absolute cell reference in a division formula.

ANOTHER USE FOR =MAX

Before we move on to the more interesting calculations we will be discussing in this chapter, we
need to determine how many points it is possible for each student to earn for each of the assign-
ments. This information will go into Row 25. The =MAX function is our tool of choice.
Download Data File: CH3 Data

       1. Open the data file CH3 Data and save the file to your computer as CH3 Gradebook and
            Parks.

       2. Make B25 your active cell.
       3. Start typing =MAX (See Figure 3.2) Note the explanation you see on the offered list of

            functions. You can either keep typing ( or double click MAX from the list.

                                                                                                      162
163  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

             Figure 3.2 Entering a function

       4. Select the range of numbers above row 25. Your calculation will be: =MAX(B5:B24).
       5. Press Enter after selecting the range.
       6. Now, use the Fill Handle to copy the calculation from Column B through Column N.

            Note that as you copy the calculation from one column to the next, the cell references
            change. The calculation in column B reads: =MAX(B5:B24). The one in column N reads:
            =MAX(N5:N24). These cell references are relative references.
By default, the calculations that Excel copies change their cell references relative to the row or
column you copy them to. That makes sense. You wouldn't want column N to display an answer
that uses the values in column L.
Want to see all the calculations you have just created? Press Ctrl ~ (See Figure 3.3.) Ctrl ~ displays
your calculations (formulas). Pressing Ctrl ~ a second time will display your calculations in the
default view - as values.

Figure 3.3 Relative References - Displayed as calculations.

QUICK ANALYSIS TOOL

The Quick Analysis Tool allows you to create standard calculations, formatting, and charts very
quickly. In this exercise we will use it to insert the Total Points for each student in Column O.

   Mac Users: the Quick Analysis Tool is not available with Excel for Mac. We
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019                                 164

have alternate steps for Mac Users below. Skip down below Figure 3.5 to con­
tinue.)

Be sure to press Ctrl ~ to return your spreadsheet to the normal view (the formula results should
display, not the formulas themselves).

       1. Select the range of cells B5:N25
       2. In the lower right corner of your selection, you will see the Quick Analysis tool (see Fig­

            ure 3.4).

     Figure 3.4 Quick Analysis Tool

3. When you click on it, you will see that there are a number of different options. This time
    we will be using the Totals option. In future exercises, we will use other options.

4. Select Totals, and then the SUM option that highlights the right column (see Figure 3.5).
    Selecting that SUM option places =SUM() calculations in column O.

Figure 3.5 Quick Analysis Tool - Totals, Sum Column
165  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

    Alternate steps for Mac Users:

       1. Select the range B5:O25 then click the AutoSum button on the Ribbon (Home tab or For-
            mulas tab)

       2. Select the range O5:O25 and click the Bold button.

PERCENTAGE CALCULATION

Column P requires a Percentage calculation. Before we launch into creating a calculation for this, it
might be handy to know precisely what it is we are looking for. If you are connected to the internet
and are using Excel 365, you can use the Smart Lookup tool to get some more information about
calculating percentages.

In general, the Smart Lookup tool allows you to get more information and definitions about unfa-
miliar terms or features. This tool is available in all of the Microsoft Office applications.

       1. Select cell P4.
       2. Find the Smart Lookup tool on the Review tab (see Figure 3.6) and click it. You can also

            "Right-click" the specific cell and choose Smart Lookup.
                 Mac Users: The Smart Lookup tool is only on the Review tab in the latest versions

            of Excel for Mac. If you can't find the Smart Lookup tool on the Review tab, you will find
            it by clicking on the "Tools" menu bar option.
            Note for all users: there is a keyboard shortcut for using the Smart Lookup tool. You
            can hold down the Control key and click in the specific cell (in this case, P4)
       3. If this is the first time you have used the Smart Lookup tool, you may need to respond to
            a statement about your privacy. Press the Got it button. We think the Wikipedia article
            does a pretty good job explaining the calculation, don't you?
       4. Close the Smart Lookup pane after reading through the definitions.
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  166

Figure 3.6 Smart Lookup tool

Now that we know what is needed for the Percentage calculation, we can have Excel do the calcu-
lation for us. We need to divide the Total Points for each student by the Total Points of all the
Points Possible. Notice that there is a different number on each row - for each student. But, there
is only one Total Points Possible - the value that is in cell O25.

       1. Make sure that P5 is your active cell.

       2. Press = then select cell O5. Press /, then cell O25. Your calculation should look like this:
            =O5/O25. The result of the formula should be 0.95641026. (So far, so good. DeShea
            Andrews is doing well in this class - with a percentage grade of almost 96%. Definitely an
            "A"!)

       3. Next use the Fill handle to copy the calculation down through row 24 to calculate the
            other students' grades. You should get the error message #DIV/0!. This error message
            reminds us that you can't divide a number by 0 (zero). And that is just what is happening.
            If you look at the calculation in P9, the calculation reads: =O9/O29. The first cell refer-
            ence is correct - it points to Moesha Gashi's total points for the class. But the second ref-
            erence is wrong. It points to an empty cell - O29.

Before copying the calculation, we have to make the second reference (O25) an absolute cell ref­
erence. That way, when we copy the formula down, the cell reference for O25 will be locked and
will not change.

       1. Make P5 your active cell. In the Formula Bar click on O25 (see Figure 3.7).

       2. Press F4 (on the function keys at the top of your keyboard). That will make the O25 refer-
            ence absolute. It will not change when you copy the calculation (see Figure 3.8). (If you
167                           DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

         are working on a laptop and do not have an F4 function key, you can type in a $ before
         the O and another one before the 25.)

     3. The calculation now looks like this: =O5/$O$25.

     4. Use the Fill Handle to copy the formula down through P24 again. Now, when you copy
         the formula, you will get correct values for all of the students.

         1. Click in front of the column letter of a cell reference in a formula or function that you do not
              want altered when the formula or function is pasted into a new cell location.

         2. Press the F4 key or type a dollar sign ($) in front of the column letter and row number of the
              cell reference.

                 tistical function to a contiguous range of cells.

             · To prevent Excel from changing the cell references in a formula or function when they are
                 pasted to a new cell location, you must use an absolute reference. You can do this by placing a
                 dollar sign ($) in front of the column letter and row number of a cell reference or by using the
                 F4 function key.

             · The #DIV/0 error appears if you create a formula that attempts to divide a constant or the
                 value in a cell reference by zero.

In addition to doing arithmetic, Excel can do other kinds of functions based on the data in your
spreadsheet. In this section, we will use an =IF function to determine whether a student is passing
or failing the class. Then, we will use a =VLOOKUP function to determine what grade each student
has earned.

IF FUNCTION

The IF function is one of the most popular functions in Excel. It allows you to make logical compar-
isons between a value and what you expect. In its simplest form, the IF function says something
like:
If the value in a cell is what you expect (true) - do this. If not - do that.
The IF function has three arguments:

        · Logical test - Here, we can test to see if the value in a selected cell is what we expect.
            You could use something like "B7=14" or "B7>12" or "B7<6"

        · Value_if_true - If the requirements in the logical test are met - if B7 is equal to 14 - then
            it is said to be true. For this argument, you can type text - "True", or "On budget!" Or you
            could insert a calculation, like B7*2 (If B7 does equal 14, multiply it by 2). Or, if you want
            Excel to put nothing at all in the cell, type "" (two quotes).

        · Value_if_false - If the requirements in the logical test are not met - if B7 does not equal
            14 - then it is said to be false. You can enter the same instructions here as you did
            above. Let's say that you type the double quotes here. Then, if B7 does not equal 14,

                                                                                                      169
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019                                                   170

            nothing will be displayed in this cell.

In column Q we would like Excel to tell us whether a student is passing - or failing the class. If the
student scores 70% or better, he/she will pass the class. But, if he/she scores less than 70%, he/
she is failing.

                   1. Make sure that Q5 is your active cell.
                   2. On the Formulas tab, in the Function Library group, find the IF function on the

                        Logical pulldown menu (see Figure 3.9).
                             Mac Users: There is no "Function Library" group for Excel for Mac. Mac

Users should click on the Formulas tab, then click the "Logical" tool  list

arrow, and choose IF (see Figure 3.9).

                          Figure 3.9 IF Function

Now you will see the IF Function dialog box, with a place to enter each of the three arguments.
    Mac Users: There is no "dialog box". The "Formula Builder" pane will display at the right side of

the Excel window. It has the same layout as Figure 3.10 below.

       1. Click in the box for Logical Test. We need to test whether a student's score is less than
            .7. So, in this box, type P5<.7

       2. Click in the box for Value_if_true. If the student's score is less than .7, then they are fail-
            ing the class. In this box, type Fail.

       3. Click in the box for Value_if_false. If the student's score is NOT less than .7, then they
            are passing the class. In this box, type Pass.

       4. Make sure that your dialog box matches Figure 3.10.
171  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

          Figure 3.10 IF Function Dialog Box

         While we are here, let's take a look at the dialog box. Notice that as you click in each box,
         Excel gives you a brief explanation of the contents (in the middle below the boxes.) In the
         lower left-hand corner, you can see the results of the calculation. In this case, DeShae is
         passing the class. Below that is a link to Help on this function. Selecting this link will take
         you to the Excel help for this function - with detailed information on how it works.

     5. Once you have typed in the required arguments and reviewed to make sure they are
         correct, press OK.

              Mac Users should click the "Done" button, then close the Formula Builder pane.
         (The text Pass should be displayed in Q5 because DeShae is passing the class.)

     6. Use the Fill handle to copy the IF function down through row 24.

     7. Click on Q5. When you look in the formula bar, you will see the IF calculation:
         =IF(P5<0.7,"Fail","Pass") (see Figure 3.11).
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  172

VLOOKUP FUNCTION

You need to use a VLOOKUP function to look up information in a table. Sometimes that table is on
a different sheet in your workbook. Sometimes it is in another file entirely. In this case, we need
to know what grade each student is getting based on their percentage score. You will find the table
that defines the scores and the grades in A28:B32.

There are four pieces of information that you will need in order to build the VLOOKUP syntax.
These are the four arguments of a VLOOKUP function:

        · The value you want to lookup, also called the Lookup_value. In our example, the lookup
            value will be the student's percentage score in column P.

        · The Table_array is the range (table) where the lookup values and the values you want
            returned by the function are located. In our example, this is the table of percentages and
            corresponding letter grades in the range A28:B32. The lookup value should always be in
            the first column in the table array for VLOOKUP to work correctly. For example, in our
            table_array the lookup value is in cell A28, so the range should start with A.

        · The Col_index_num is the column number in the range that contains the value to
            return. In our example, when you specify A28:B32 as the Table_array range, you should
            count A as the first column (1), B as the second column (2), and so on. You will enter the
            appropriate column number in this box as 1, 2, or 3 and so on.

        · In the Range_lookup, you can optionally specify TRUE if you want an approximate match
173  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

            or FALSE if you want an exact match of the return value. If you leave this blank, the
            default value will always be TRUE, or approximate match.

Let's create the VLOOKUP to display the correct Letter Grade in column R.

       1. Make sure that R5 is your active cell.
       2. On the Formulas tab, in the Function Library, find the VLOOKUP function on the Lookup

            & Reference pull-down menu (see Figure 3.12).

         Mac Users should click the Lookup and Reference tool list arrow  to find the
     VLOOKUP function.

          Figure 3.12 VLOOKUP Function

     3. Fill in the dialog box so that it looks like the image in Figure 3.13.

          Mac Users will use the "Formula Builder" pane at the right side of the Excel Window.

                   Lookup_value - In this case, we will use the Percentage score. So, P5 for the
                     first lookup value.

                   Table_array - This is the range that contains the value you want returned by
                     the function. In this case, that range is A28:B32. Note that this range does NOT
                     include the label in row 27; just the actual data. The cell references for the
                     Table_array need to be absolute - $A$28:$B$32. When we copy this function to
                     the other cells, we do not want these cell references to change. It should always
                     be $A$28:$B$32. This is very important! They must have the absolute refer­
                     ence symbols or the calculations will not work.

                   Col_index_number - This is the column in the table array range that includes
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019                      174

                the information that we are looking up. In our case, the actual grades are in the
                2nd column of the range. So, the column index will be 2.
              Range_lookup - In some cases, you will need something in the Range_lookup
                box. Since we are looking for an approximate match for the percentages, we
                want the default value of TRUE, so we do not need to enter anything for this
                argument.

2. While you are in the dialog box, be sure to look at all the helpful definitions that Excel
    offers.

3. When you have filled in the dialog box, press OK.

         Mac Users should click the "Done" button, then close the Formula Builder pane.

4. The calculation you will see in the formula bar is: =VLOOKUP(P5,$A$28:$B$32,2)

5. Use the fill handle to copy the function down through row 24. The results displayed
    should match Figure 3.14.

Figure 3.13 VLOOKUP completed dialog box
175  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

Figure 3.14 VLOOKUP Complete

Note: What if it didn't work? What if you get a result different from the one predicted? In this case,
either you have made a previous error, resulting in different % scores than this exercise antici-
pated, or you made a mistake entering your VLOOKUP function.

To make repairs in the function, make sure that R5 is your active cell. On the Formula bar, press
the Insert Function button (see Figure 3.15). That will reopen the dialog box so you can make your
repairs. Did you forget to make the cell references for the Table_array absolute? Did you use the
wrong cell for the Lookup_value? Press OK when you are done and recopy the corrected function.

ERROR MESSAGES

Sometimes Excel notices that you have made errors in your calculations before you do. In those
cases Excel alerts you with some slightly mysterious error messages. A list of common error mes-
sages can be found in Table 3.1 below.

Table 3.1 - Common Error Messages

Message  What Went Wrong
#DIV/0!
#NAME    You tried to divide a number by a zero (0) or an empty
         cell.
#N/A
         You used a cell range name in the formula, but the name isn't
#NULL    defined. Sometimes this error occurs because you type the name
#NUM     incorrectly.
#REF
#VALUE   The formula refers to an empty cell, so no data is available
         for computing the formula. Sometimes people enter N/A in a cell as
         a placeholder to signal the fact that data isn't entered yet.
         Revise the formula or enter a number or formula in the empty
         cells.

         The formula refers to a cell range that Excel can't understand.
         Make sure that the range is entered correctly.

         An argument you use in your formula is invalid.

         The cell or range of cells that the formula refers to aren't
         there.

         The formula includes a function that was used incorrectly,
         takes an invalid argument, or is misspelled. Make sure that the
         function uses the right argument and is spelled correctly.

DATE FUNCTIONS

Very often dates and times are an important part of Excel data. Numbers that are correct today
may not be accurate tomorrow. So, it is frequently useful to include dates and times on your
spreadsheets.

These dates and times fall into two categories - ones that:

        · Remain the same. For instance, if a spreadsheet includes data for May 15th, you don't
            want the date to change each time you re-open the spreadsheet.

        · Change to reflect the current date/time. When it is important to have the current
            date or time on a spreadsheet, you want Excel to update the information regularly.

Take a look at the list of Date and Time functions offered in the Function Library on the Formulas
tab (see Figure 3.16).

Figure 3.16 Date & Time Functions

For our gradebook, we want the date and time to be displayed in A2, and it needs to update when-
ever the workbook file is opened.

       1. Make A2 your active cell. Notice that A2 extends all the way from column A to Column R.
            Previously, someone has used the Merge & Center tool on this cell to make it match the
            title above.

       2. On the Formulas tab, in the Function Library, select NOW from the Date & Time drop-
            down list and then click OK.
                 Mac Users click the "Done" button in the "Formula Builder" pane at the right side of
            the Excel window; then close the pane.

       3. The result you will see in the formula bar is: =NOW(). The result you will see in A2
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019                                        178

            depends on the current date and time. The NOW function is a very handy function. It
            takes no arguments and is Volatile! That is not as alarming as it may seem. This just
            means that you don't need to give it any more information to do its job and that your
            results will change frequently. You can update the date and time whenever you want -
            you don't have to wait until you open the workbook again.

       4. Make sure that A1 is your active cell and press the F9 function key (along the top of your
            keyboard.) The time will update.

Excel will update this field independently whenever you save and re-open the file, or print it. It may
happen more frequently than that - depending on how you have set this up in your installation of
Excel.

Another variation of the current date is the TODAY function. Let's try that one next.

       1. Make sure A2 is your active cell. Press Delete to remove the NOW function.

       2. From the Date & Time drop-down list in the Function Library on the Formulas tab (see
            Figure 3.16), select TODAY and then click OK.

                 Mac Users click the "Done" button in the "Formula Builder" pane; then close the
            pane.

       3. The result you will see in the formula bar is: =TODAY(). The result you will see in A2
            depends on the current date. Since we haven't asked for the time, the time you are see-
            ing is likely 12:00. That is not very helpful so we need to change the format of the date.

       4. On the Home tab, in the Number group, press the Number Format Launcher button (see
            Figure 3.17).

     5. In the Format Cells dialog box, click the Number tab. Choose the
         Date category and select Wednesday, March 14, 2012 (this format is
         called Long Date).

                 Mac Users: there is no Number Format Launcher button or "Format Cells" dialog
            box.

Click the list arrow next to "Date" and choose "Long Date"

6. The current day and date will display in A2.

                                                              Keyboard Shortcuts

   Sometimes you want the date or the time to show up in your spreadsheet, but you don't want it to
   change. You can simply type in the date or time. Or, you can use shortcut keys.

             · CTRL ; (semi colon) will bring you the current date
                         Mac Users: same as above

             · CTRL : (colon or CTRL SHIFT ; ) will bring you the current time.

                                                                 Key Takeaways

             · Functions don't always have to be about arithmetic. Excel provides functions that will help you
                 perform logical evaluations, look things up, and work with dates and times.

             · Excel displays error messages when your formulas and functions are not constructed prop-
                 erly.

3.3 Conditional Formatting

                                                              Learning Objectives
             · Use Conditional Formatting techniques to provide flexible highlighting, applying specified for-

                 matting only when certain conditions are met. Techniques include:
                             Data bars -- to make it easy to visualize values in a range of cells.
                             Cells Rules -- to highlight values that match the requirements you specify.

You now have all the calculations you need in your CAS 170 Grades spreadsheet. There is a lot of
data here. To make it easier to pick out the most important pieces of data, Excel provides Con­
ditional Formatting. The best thing about Conditional Formatting is that it is flexible, applying
specified formatting only when certain conditions are met.

       1. Select the values in the Total Points column (O5:O24).
       2. At the bottom of your selection, click on the Quick Analysis Tool. On the Formatting tab,

            select Data Bars (see Figure 3.18).
                 Mac Users: as stated previously, there is no Quick Analysis Tool for Excel for Mac.

            Use the alternate steps as shown below.
Excel places blue bars on top of your values; long blue bars for larger numbers, shorter ones for
smaller numbers. This makes it easier to see how well each student did in the class - without hav-
ing to look at the specific numbers.

                                                                                                      181
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019                                                                        182

Figure 3.18 Data Bars on the Quick Analysis tool

Another way to apply Data Bars is to:
        · Select the range that needs data bars
        · On the Home tab, in the Styles group, select Data Bars from the Conditional Formatting
            tool.
        · From there you can select data bars of different colors and opacities (see Figure 3.19).

    Mac Users: Alternate Steps:

· On the Home tab select Data Bars from the Conditional Formatting tool  .

· From there you can select data bars of different colors and opacities (see Figure 3.19).
183  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

Figure 3.19 Data Bars on the Conditional Formatting tool

It is even more important to highlight the students who are failing in the class. To practice further
with Conditional Formatting we will do that in two places, in the Percentages column and on the
Letter Grade column. To start with, we want any F letter grades to be formatted with a light red
fill color and dark red text.

       1. Select the Letter Grades (R5:R24).
       2. On the Home tab, in the Styles group, select Highlight Cell Rules from the Conditional

            Formatting tool (see Figure 3.20).
       3. Select Equal To
       4. Fill out the Equal to dialog box so that cells that are equal to: F have Light Red Fill with

            Dark Red Text (see Figure 3.21).
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019                         184

Figure 3.20 Conditional Formatting Equal To

Figure 3.21 Conditional Formatting Equal To Dialog Box

Let's try that one more time - to highlight those students who are passing the class. This time we
will use the Pass/Fail text in the Pass/Fail column. If the text for a student is Pass we want the cell
to be formatted with a yellow fill with dark yellow text.

       1. Select the Pass/Fail grades (Q5:Q24).
185  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

       2. On the Home tab, in the Styles group, select Highlight Cell Rules from the Conditional
            Formatting tool (see Figure 3.20).

       3. Select Equal To

       4. Fill out the Equal to dialog box so that cells that are equal to: Pass have Yellow Fill with
            Dark Yellow Text. (To find the Yellow Fill with Dark Yellow text option, click the the
            down arrow at the end of the last (with) box).

You do not have to use the default styles to make your data stand out. You can set any formatting
you want. When you do, it is probably a good idea to include other styling in addition to color. Your
spreadsheet might be printed in black and white. You would hate to lose your Conditional format-
ting. Now we are going to use conditional formatting to display any Percentages that are less than
60% with red text formatted in bold and italic.

       1. Select the Percentage grades (P5:P24).

       2. On the Home tab, in the Styles group, select Highlight Cell Rules from the Conditional
            Formatting tool (see Figure 3.20).

       3. Select Less Than

       4. Fill out the Less Than dialog box so that cells that are less than .6 will be have conditional
            formatting. But, instead of using the default red text on a light red fill, press the down
            arrow at the end of that box and select Custom Format.

       5. On the Font tab of the Format Cells dialog box, in the Font style box, select Bold Italic.
            In the Color box, select Red (see Figure 3.22).

       6. Press OK. Then press OK again.
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  186

Conditional Formatting is valuable in that it reflects the current data. It changes to reflect changes
in the data. To test this, delete DeShea's final exam score. (Select N5. Press Delete on your key-
board.) Suddenly, DeShae is failing the course and the Conditional Formatting reflects that. This
is a little unfair to DeShae - who has worked so hard this quarter. Let's give him back his grade.
Press CTRL Z (Undo). His test score reappears and the Conditional formatting reflects that as well.

MAKING CHANGES

What if you have made a mistake with your Conditional Formatting? Or, you want to delete it alto-
gether? You can use the Conditional Formatting Manage Rules tool. In our example, we want to
remove the conditional formatting rule that formats the Pass text with yellow. We are also going
to modify the minimum passing percentage for the conditional formatting rule that is applied to
the percentages.

       1. On the Home Tab, in the Styles Group, select Manage Rules at the very bottom of the
            Conditional Formatting drop-down list.

       2. Show formatting rules for: This Worksheet (see Figure 3.23).
       3. We don't really need to highlight the students who are passing the class, so select that
187                                                                DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

     rule in the Rules Manager and press the Delete Rule button.   Mac Users should click
     the minus symbol - at bottom left corner to delete the rule.

          Figure 3.23 Conditional Formatting Manage Rules

         In a previous exercise (the IF function), we decided that students were failing if they got a
         percentage score of less than 70%, so the Conditional Formatting rule in the Percentage
         column needs repair.
     4. Select the rule that reads Cell Value <0.6.
     5. Select the Edit Rule button, and change the .6 to .7 (see Figure 3.24).
     6. Click OK (or Apply) twice. Double check that your completed workbook matches Figure
         3.25.

SETTING THE PRINT AREA

Before you consider this workbook finished, you need to prepare it for printing. The first thing
you will do is set the Print Area so that the table of Letter Grades in A27:B32 does not print.

       1. Select A1:R25. This is the only part of the worksheet that you want to have print.
       2. On the Page Layout ribbon, click the Print Area button. Choose Set Print Area from

            the menu.
Next you will preview the worksheet in Print Preview to check that the print area setting worked,
as well as make sure it is printing on one page.

       1. View the workbook in Print Preview.
                 Mac Users should choose Print from the File menu to view Print Preview.

       2. Set the page orientation to Landscape.
       3. Change the page scaling if needed so that the entire worksheet prints on one page.
       4. Save the CH3 Gradebook and Parks workbook.

                                                              Learning Objectives
             · Locate and fix formatting consistency errors.
             · Apply new formatting techniques.
             · Use Print Titles to repeat rows and columns on each page of a multiple page worksheet.
             · Control where page breaks occur in a multiple page worksheet.

In this section, we will review a worksheet for formatting consistency, as well as learn two new
formatting techniques. This worksheet currently prints on four pages, so we will learn new page
setup options to control how these pages print. A new data file will be used for this section.

REVIEWING FORMATTING FOR CONSISTENCY

Open the "CH3-Gradebook and Parks" workbook if it isn't already open.
Click on the "Park Size" sheet tab within your "CH3-Gradebook and Parks" workbook

                             .
You have been given a spreadsheet with data about the national parks in the western United
States. Your coworker formatted the workbook and has asked you to review it for consistency. You
also need to prepare it for printing. Figure 3.26 shows how the second page of the finished work-
sheet will appear in Print Preview.

                                                                                                      190

REVIEWING FORMATTING FOR INCONSISTENCIES

The first thing you are going to do is review the worksheet for formatting inconsistencies.

       1. Scroll through the worksheet and locate the following formatting errors:
                     The formatting of the Utah label does not match the other states.
                     The Year Established values for Hawaii are not center aligned like the other
                        years.
                     The cells for the Nevada data should have the same green fill color as the other
                        alternating states.
                     The number of digits after the decimal place for the Size values is inconsistent.
                        Also, these values should be formatted with Comma style to make them easier
                        to read.
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019                                                        192

2. To fix these errors, complete the following steps:

              Merge & Center A34:A38. Change the font size to 16 and apply Bold format.
              Center align C28:C29.
              Apply the green fill color to A31:E31 (be sure to match the green fill color of the

                other states).
              Select E4:E43 and apply Comma Style. Use Increase Decimal and/or Decrease

                Decimal until one digit appears after the decimal place for all values.

3. While you're fixing errors, proofread the sheet and correct any typos.
4. Finally, let's add color to the two sheet tabs. The use of colored tabs assists in navigating

    between sheet tabs.

 Right-click the "Park Size" sheet tab (  Mac users hold down Ctrl key and
   click the sheet tab)

 Point to Tab Color and choose a "blue" color.

 Now right-click the "Grades" sheet tab, point to Tab Color and choose an
   "orange" color. That's it!

FINE-TUNING FORMATTING

Now that you have fixed the inconsistencies in the formatting, you decide to apply some format-
ting techniques to make the worksheet look even better. You are going to start by vertically align­
ing the names of the states within the cells.

       1. Select A4:A43 (the cells with the state labels).
       2. Click the Home tab on the ribbon.
       3. In the Alignment group, click the Middle Align button (see Figure 3.26). Notice that the

            names of the states are now centered between the top and bottom borders of the cells.

Figure 3.26 Alignment Group

The next new formatting skill is to change the label in E3 from Size (km2) to Size (km2) with the 2
after km formatted with superscript.
193                                                 DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

     1. Double-click on cell E3 to enter Edit mode
     2. Select just the 2 (be careful not to select anything else).
     3. On the ribbon (Home tab) click the dialog box launcher arrow in the Font group.

            Mac Users: there is no dialog box launcher for Excel for Mac. Instead,

     choose Format from the Menu Bar, click Cells:  then con­
     tinue with Steps 4 and 5

     4. In the Effects section of the Format Cells dialog box, check the box for Superscript (see
         Figure 3-27). Click OK.

     5. Save the CH3 Gradebook and Parks file.

Figure 3.27 Font Tab in Format Cells Dialog Box

REPEATING COLUMN (AND ROW) LABELS

Now that you have fixed the cell and text formatting, you are ready to review the worksheet in
Print Preview. You will notice that the worksheet is printing on multiple pages, and you cannot tell
what each column of data represents on some of the pages.

       1. With the CH3-Gradebook and Parks file still open, and the Parks tab selected, go to Back-
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  194

    stage View by clicking the File tab on the ribbon. Select Print from the menu.

         Mac Users: choose File from the Menu Bar, and then choose Print

2. Click through each of the pages. The worksheet is currently printing on four pages (
     Mac users may only see three pages but that is ok), with the City and Sizes columns
    printing on separate pages from the rest of the data.

3. Change the Orientation from Portrait to Landscape. This fits all of the columns on one
    page. All of the columns are now on the same page, but the second and third pages have
    no column labels to identify what information is in each column. You are going to use
    Print Titles to repeat the first three rows of the worksheet on each of the printed pages.
    To set Print Titles you need to exit Print Preview.

4. Exit Backstage View then click the Page Layout tab on the ribbon.

5. Click the Print Titles button in the Page Setup group on the ribbon. The dialog box shown
    in Figure 3.28 should appear.

6. Click the Sheet tab if necessary.

7. Click in the Rows to repeat at top: box. Be sure your insertion point is blinking in that box
    before moving on to the next step.
195  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

       8. In the worksheet, select Rows 1 through 3. The text $1:$3 should now appear in the
            Rows to repeat at top: box.

       9. Click OK.

You will not see a change to the worksheet in Normal view, so you will need to return to Print Pre-
view. While looking in Print Preview, you will notice that the pages are breaking in inconvenient
places.

       1. Go to Print Preview and look at each of the pages. Notice that the first three rows are
            now repeated at the top of each page.

       2. Exit Backstage View.

                                                              Skill Refresher

Creating Print Titles
         1. Open the Page Setup dialog box and click the Sheet tab.
         2. Click in the Rows to repeat at top: box or the Columns to repeat at left: box.
         3. Click in the worksheet and select the row(s) or column(s) that you want to repeat on each page.

INSERTING PAGE BREAKS

Notice that the data for California is split between the first and second pages. You want all of the
data for each state to be together on the same page, so you need to control the page breaks. You
are going to start by inserting a page break before the California data to force it to start on the sec-
ond page, then you will move the page break for the third page if needed. To make these changes
you are going to work in Page Break Preview.

       1. Click the View tab on the ribbon then click Page Break Preview in the Workbook Views
            Group. Your screen should look similar to Figure 3.29.
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  196

Figure 3.29 Page Break Preview

    Mac Users: in the next paragraph below, the location of the automatic page breaks may be in
different locations. That's ok.

In Page Break Preview, automatic page breaks are displayed as dotted blue lines. Notice the dotted
blue lines after rows 13 and 28. These lines indicate where Excel will start a new page. For this
worksheet, you want the first page to break before the California data, so you are going to insert
a manual page break.

       1. Select cell A15. When inserting a page break, you select the cell below where you want
            the page break to appear.

       2. Click the Page Layout tab on the ribbon.
       3. Click the Breaks button in the Page Setup group (see Figure 3.30).
       4. Select Insert Page Break from the menu. There is now a solid blue line after row 14,

            which indicates a manual page break that was inserted.
       5. Go to Print Preview. Notice that the California data now starts on the second page.
197  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

Figure 3.30 Breaks Button on Page Layout tab

While looking at each page in Print Preview you decide that the third page should start with Mon-
tana. To make this change you are going to move the automatic page break that appears after
Nevada.

       1. Exit Backstage View. Switch back to Page Break Preview if needed.
       2. Locate the next dotted blue line (automatic page break).
       3. Put your pointer over the dotted blue line and it will switch to a vertical double-headed

            arrow. Click on the dotted blue line and drag it above Montana.
       4. Release the mouse button when the line is above row 30 (above Montana). The line will

            now be a solid blue line, indicating a manual page break.
       5. Go to Print Preview. The Montana data now appears at the top of the third page.

While evaluating the pages in Print Preview you decide that there is too much white space at the
bottom of the pages. To fix this, you are going to center the contents vertically on the pages.

       1. Click the Page Setup link at the bottom of the Settings section of Backstage View to open
            the Page Setup dialog box.

             Mac Users: there is no "Page Setup link" in Print Preview for Excel
         for Mac. Click the Margins list arrow instead, and choose "Manage
         Custom Margins" then continue with the steps below.

       2. Click on the Margins tab.
       3. In the Center on page section, check the box for Vertically then click OK.
       4. Review each page in Print Preview to see the changes. Exit Backstage View.

CREATING A HEADER AND FOOTER USING PAGE LAYOUT VIEW

Now that the worksheet is printing on three pages, with page breaks in appropriate places, you
are ready to add a header with the current date and filename. You will also add a footer with the
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019                          198

page number and the total number of pages that will appear as Page 1 of 3. You are going to edit
the header and footer in Page Layout View.

       1. Click the View tab on the ribbon and click the Page Layout button in the Workbook Views
            group.

       2. The white space at the top of the worksheet should say Add header. Place the mouse
            pointer over the left section of the Header and click to activate that section.

                 Mac Users should make sure the mouse pointer turns into a small page icon
            then click in the left section of the Header

       3. Click the Header & Footer Tools Design tab on the ribbon.

       4. Click the Current Date button in the Header & Footer Elements group (see Figure 3.31).
            Inserting the date this way will insert a field that will update every time the workbook is
            opened.

       5. Click in the right section of the Header. Click the Filename button in the Header &
            Footer Elements group (see Figure 3.31). Inserting the filename this way will insert a
            field that will update if the filename is changed.

       6. Click the Go to Footer button in the Navigation group of commands.

       7. In the center section of the footer, type the word Page with a space after it.

       8. Click the Page Number button in the Header & Footer Elements group (see Figure 3.31),
            then type a space after the &[Page] code that appears.

       9. Type the word of with a space after it, then click the Number of Pages button in the
            Header & Footer Elements group (see Figure 3.31). The footer should match Figure
            3.32.

     10. Click anywhere on the worksheet to close the Footer editing.

     11. Review the worksheet again in Print Preview. Pay careful attention to the page numbers
            in the footer to ensure they will print correctly, then exit Backstage View.

     12. View the correct print preview screenshot below in Figure 3.33

     13. Check the spelling on all of the worksheets and make any necessary changes. Save and
            submit the CH3-Gradebook and Parks workbook.

Inserting Page Numbers

         1. In Page Layout View, click in the section of the header or footer where you want the page num-
              ber to appear.

         2. Type the word Page, followed by a space, and then click the Page Number button in the
              Header & Footer Elements group on the Header & Footer Tools Design ribbon. This will create
              Page 1.

         3. If desired, type a space after the &[Page] code then type the word of followed by a space. Then
              click the Number of Pages button. This will create Page 1 of 4.

                                                                 Key Takeaways

             · Always check the formatting of your worksheets for consistency.
             · If a worksheet is printing on multiple pages, use Print Titles to repeat rows at the top and/or

                 columns at the left of every page to make it easier to interpret the data.
             · Insert manual page breaks as needed in Page Break Preview to control where a new page

                 begins.
             · Multiple page worksheets should include the page number in either the header or footer. Be

                 sure to insert the Page Number element so that the correct page number will display on each
                 page of the worksheet.

HOUSEHOLD BUDGET

Download Data File: PR3 Data

Etta and Lucian Redding are a recently married couple living in Portland, Oregon. Lucian works
part time and attends the local community college. Etta works as a marketing manager at a cloth-
ing company in North Portland. They are trying to decide if they can afford to move to a better
apartment, one that is closer to work and school. They want to use Excel to examine their house-
hold budget. They have started their budget spreadsheet, but they need your help with it.

    1. Open the file named PR3 Data and then save it as PR3 Redding.
    2. Insert two new rows at the top of the worksheet.
    3. Enter the following text:

A2  Category

B2  Item

C2  January

O2  Yearly Total (adjust column width as needed to fit this text)

1. Using the text in cell C2, use Autofill to fill in the months February through December in
    cells D2:N2. Adjust column widths as needed to fit the names of the months in these
    columns.

2. Bold and center align all of the headings in Row 2.

3. Type "Redding Family Budget" in A1. Merge & Center A1:O1. Make this text 22 point
    bold.

4. Next you need to complete the monthly values for some of the income and expense
    items. In the rows for Income #1, Income #2, Mortgage/Rent, Homeowners/Rent Insur-
    ance, Car Insurance, Car Payment, and Gym Fees/Memberships, copy the values for Jan-
    uary to the cells for February through December.

5. Use the Totals tab in the Quick Analysis tool to add the SUM to Column O. Delete the for-
    mulas from O7, O17, O24, O32, and O38.

        Mac Users should use the AutoSum tool to calculate the totals in Column O. Since you
    are using the AutoSum tool, you may not have to delete any formulas in the cells listed

                              202
203  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

           in Step 5 above. Also, the Quick Analysis tool will automatically bold the values in Col-
           umn O. Mac Users should bold cells O3:O45.

      6. In C6: N6, use the SUM function to calculate the Total Income for each month.

      7. Similar to step 6, use the SUM function to calculate the Total Home Expenses, Total Daily
           Living Expenses, Total Transportation Expenses, Total Entertainment Expenses, and
           Total Personal Expenses for each month.

      8. Use the SUM function to calculate the Yearly Total Personal Expenses in cell O45.

      9. Format the numerical data in Row 3 as Currency with no decimal places, and with a top
           border. Format all the total rows as Currency with no decimal places and with a top bor-
           der (Rows 6, 16, 23, 31, 37, and 45).

     10. Apply the Comma format with no decimal places in all the other rows.

     11. In A47, type "Total Expenses".

     12. In C47, enter a formula that adds together all of the expense category totals for Janu-
           ary. Copy the formula in C47 to D47:O47.

     13. In A49, type "Net Income". Bold and indent this text. Also bold C49:N49

     14. In C49, enter a formula that calculates the difference between Total Income and Total
           Expenses (=Total Income-Total Expenses) for January. Copy this formula to D49:O49.

     15. Format the data in Rows 47 and 49 as Currency with no decimal places. Bold O47 and
           O49. Add a Top and Double Bottom Border to the data in Row 49.

     16. Select C49:N49. Use the Quick Analysis tool to add data bars to this data. Mac Users
           should use the Conditional Formatting tool on the Ribbon. The negative values should
           automatically have a red data bar and the positive values will have a blue data bar.

     17. In B50, type "New Home?". Enter an IF statement in C50 that displays the word "No" if
           the amount in C49 is less than or equal to zero and "Maybe" if the amount is greater
           than zero. Copy C50 to D50:N50.

     18. Check to see if your IF statement worked correctly in row 50. If the cells say "No" when
           the data bar in the cell above it is red and "Maybe" when the data bar in the cell above it
           is blue, your IF statement is correct.

     19. Review the worksheet in Print Preview. Make any changes needed to make the work-
           sheet print on one page with landscape orientation.

     20. Rename the "Sheet 1" sheet tab:

                     Double-click the "Sheet 1" tab
                     Type: Budget and press Enter

     21. Change the color of the sheet tab:

                     Right-click the "Budget" sheet tab
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  204

                Mac Users should hold down the CTRL key and click the Budget sheet tab
                Point to "Tab Color", choose a green color

22. Check the spelling on all of the worksheets and make any necessary changes. Save the
      PR3 Redding workbook.

23. Compare your work with the self-check answer key below and then submit the PR3 Red­
      ding workbook as directed by your instructor.

            Samantha Raitt
            4270 SW Cooper Ln, Portland, OR 97225
            503-674-1632
            samantha.raitt@zmail.com

       4. For the Shipping Information, create formulas using cell references to display the corre-
            sponding information from the Billing Information section. For example, the Customer
            cell will display the name of the customer in cell C11.

       5. In the range B19:E22, enter the following item orders:

Item #  Description                              Qty  Unit Price
K56     Dark Mocha K-Cups (12 pack)
G03     Decaf Dark Roast - Ground (1 lb.)        1    11.99
B07     Organic Dark Roast - Whole Bean (1 lb.)
K52     Chai Latte K-Cups (12 pack)              3    12.99

                                                 2    14.99

                                                 3    10.99

6. In cell F19, enter an IF function that tests whether the order quantity in cell D19 is
    greater than 0 (zero). lf it is, return the value of the Qty (in D19) multiplied by the Unit
    Price (in E19); otherwise, return no text by entering "". Hint: You will need to use a formula

                     205
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  206

      for the Value if True argument.

 7. Copy/fill this formula into the other cells in the range F19:F25. Hint: be sure to copy the
      formula to all of the Item Total cells, even if it is a blank row. You want the worksheet to be
      prepared for orders with more items in the future.

 8. In cell F26, calculate the sum of all of the Item Total cells.

 9. In cell F27, use an IF function to calculate the discount amount for this order based on
      the customer's status (which is found in F16). If the customer's status is Preferred, the
      discount amount will be the Order Subtotal times the discount percentage found in cell
      B29; otherwise the discount amount will be 0 (zero). Hint: You will need to use a formula
      for the Value if True argument.

10. Test your IF function to make sure that it still works if the customer is NOT preferred by
      deleting the word Preferred in F16. Make sure you do not end up with an error mes-
      sage! If you get an error message, check the IF function and make the changes needed.

11. Calculate the Discounted Total for this order in cell F28. Hint: Use a simple subtraction for­
      mula.

12. In cell F29, use an IF function to display the correct Shipping Charge, based on the
      amount of the Discounted Total. If the Discounted Total is greater than or equal to the
      Free Shipping Minimum found in cell B28, the Shipping Charge is 0 (zero); otherwise, the
      Shipping Charge is 5% of the Discounted Total. Hint: You will need to use a formula for the
      Value if False to calculate what 5% of the Discounted Total will be.

13. Calculate the Invoice Total in cell F31. Hint: This will be the total of the Discounted Total and
      the Shipping Charge.

14. Take a critical look at your worksheet to ensure that all of the number and cell format-
      ting is professional.

15. Review the worksheet in Print Preview. Make any changes needed to make the work-
      sheet print on one page.

16. Check the spelling on all of the worksheets and make any necessary changes. Save the
      SC3 MidasCoffee workbook.

17. Submit the SC3 Midas Coffee workbook as directed by your instructor.

     CHAPTER 4 - PRESENTING
     DATA WITH CHARTS

One of the most important things to consider when using charts in Excel is that they are intended
to be used for communicating an idea to an audience. Your audience can be reading your charts
in a written document or listening to you in a live presentation. In fact, Excel charts are often
imported or pasted into Word documents or PowerPoint slides, which serve this very purpose of
communicating ideas to an audience. Although there are no rules set in stone for using specific
charts for certain data types, some chart types are designed to communicate certain messages
better than others. This chapter explores numerous charts that can be used for a variety of pur-
poses. In addition, we will examine formatting charts and using those charts in Word and Power-
Point documents.

This section reviews the most commonly used Excel chart types. To demonstrate the variety of
chart types available in Excel, it is necessary to use a variety of data sets. This is necessary not only
to demonstrate the construction of charts but also to explain how to choose the right type of chart
given your data and the idea you intend to communicate.

CHOOSING A CHART TYPE

Before we begin, let's review a few key points you need to consider before creating any chart in
Excel.

       1. The first is identifying your idea or message. It is important to keep in mind that the
            primary purpose of a chart is to present quantitative information to an audience. There-
            fore, you must first decide what message or idea you wish to present. This is critical in
            helping you select specific data from a worksheet that will be used in a chart. Through-
            out this chapter, we will reinforce the intended message first before creating each chart.

       2. The second key point is selecting the right chart type. The chart type you select will
            depend on the data you have and the message you intend to communicate.

       3. The third key point is identifying the values that should appear on the X and Y
            axes. One of the ways to identify which values belong on the X and Y axes is to sketch

                                                                                                      208
209                                                     DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

     the chart on paper first. If you can visualize what your chart is supposed to look like, you
     will have an easier time selecting information correctly and using Excel to construct an
     effective chart that accurately communicates your message. Table 4.1 "Key Steps Before
     Constructing an Excel Chart" provides a brief summary of these points.

Carefully Select Data When Creating a Chart

Just because you have data in a worksheet does not mean it must all be placed onto a chart. When creating
a chart, it is common for only specific data points to be used. To determine what data should be used when
creating a chart, you must first identify the message or idea that you want to communicate to an audience.

Table 4.1 Key Steps before Constructing an Excel Chart

Step                 Description

Define your          Identify the main idea you are trying to communicate to an audience. If there is no main point or important
message.             message that can be revealed by a chart, you might want to question the necessity of creating a chart.

Identify the data    Once you have a clear message, identify the data on a worksheet that you will need to construct a chart. In some
you need.            cases, you may need to create formulas or consolidate items into broader categories.

Select a chart type. The type of chart you select will depend on the message you are communicating and the data you are using.

Identify the values  After you have selected a chart type, you may find that drawing a sketch is helpful in identifying which values
for the X and Y      should be on the X and Y axes. In Excel, the axes are:
axes.                The "category" axis. Usually the horizontal axis - where the labels are found.

                     The "value" axis. Usually the vertical axis - where the numbers are found.

TIME SERIES TREND: LINE CHART 1

The first chart we will demonstrate is a line chart. Figure 4.1 shows part of the data that will be
used to create two line charts. This chart will show the trend of the NASDAQ stock index.
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  210

Read more: http://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq.asp

This chart will be used to communicate a simple message: to show how the index has performed
over a two-year period. We can use this chart in a presentation to show whether stock prices have
been increasing, decreasing, or remaining constant over the designated period of time.

Before we create the line chart, it is important to identify why it is an appropriate chart type given
the message we wish to communicate and the data we have. When presenting the trend for any
data over a designated period of time, the most commonly used chart types are the line chart
and the column chart. With the column chart, you are limited to a certain number of bars or data
points. As shown below in Figure 4.1, as the number of bars increases on a column chart, it
becomes increasingly difficult to read. In our first example, there are 24 points of data used to
construct the chart. This is generally too many data points to put on a column chart, which is why
we are using a line chart.
211  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

                        Figure 4.1 Chart Types

Our line chart will show the Volume of sales for the NASDAQ on the Y-axis and the Month num-
ber on the X-axis. Notice when we select the information we are including the column headings/
labels. Excel will use the column headings/labels to identify each axis. Excel named the horizon-
tal axis labels Month and the Vertical axis series Volume.
The following steps explain how to construct this chart:

Download Data file: CH4 Data

         1. Open data file CH4 Data and save a file to your computer as CH4 Charting.

         2. Navigate to the Stock Trend worksheet.

         3. Highlight the range B4:C28 on the Stock Trend worksheet. (Note - you have selected a
        label in the first row and more labels in column B. Watch where they show up in your com-
        pleted chart.)
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019                       212

4. Click the Insert tab of the ribbon.

5. Click the Line button in the Charts group of commands. Click the first option from the
list, which is a basic 2D Line Chart (see Figure 4.2). Notice Excel adds, or embeds, the line
chart into the worksheet.

Why?

Line Chart vs. Column Chart

We can use both a line chart and a column chart to illustrate a trend over time. However, a line chart is
far more effective when there are many periods of time being measured. For example, if we are measuring
fifty-two weeks, a column chart would require fifty-two bars. A general rule of thumb is to use a column
chart when twenty bars or less are required. A column chart becomes difficult to read as the number of bars
exceeds twenty.

Figure 4.3 shows the embedded line chart in the Stock Trend worksheet. Do you see where your
labels showed up on the chart?
Notice that additional tabs, or contextual tabs, are added to the ribbon. We will demonstrate the
commands in these tabs throughout this chapter. These tabs appear only when the chart is acti-
vated.

Note: Excel 2010 uses three contextual tabs for charts. Later versions use only two. Each has all the same
tools. They are just organized a little differently.
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  214

            Figure 4.3 Embedded Line Chart in the Stock Trend Worksheet

As shown in Figure 4.3, the embedded chart is not placed in an ideal location on the worksheet
since it is covering several cell locations that contain data. The following steps demonstrate com-
mon adjustments that are made when working with embedded charts:

          1. Moving a chart: Click and drag the upper left corner of the chart to the corner of cell
        B30.

Note: Keep an eye on your pointer. It will change into when you are in the right place to move your chart.

         2. Resizing a chart: Place the mouse pointer over the bottom lower corner sizing handle,
        drag and drop to approximately the end of Column I, and Row 45.

Note: keep an eye on your pointer. It will change into  when you are in the right place to resize your chart

         3. Adjusting the chart title: Click the chart title once. Then click in front of the first letter.
        You should see a blinking cursor in front of the letter. This allows you to modify the title of
        the chart.

         4. Type the following in front of the first letter in the chart title: May 2014-2016 Trend for
        NASDAQ Sales.

         5. Click anywhere outside of the chart to deactivate it.

         6. Save your work.

Figure 4.4 shows the line chart after it is moved and resized. Notice that the sizing handles do not
appear around the perimeter of the chart. This is because the chart has been deactivated. To acti-
vate the chart, click anywhere inside the chart perimeter.

         Figure 4.4 Line Chart Moved and Resized

Integrity Check
When using line charts in Excel, keep in mind that anything placed on the X-axis is considered a descriptive
label, not a numeric value. This is an example of a category axis. This is important because there will never
be a change in the spacing of any items placed on the X-axis of a line chart. If you need to create a chart using
numeric data on the category axis, you will have to modify the chart. We will do that later in the chapter.

                                                                 Skill Refresher
   Inserting a Line Chart

            1. Highlight a range of cells that contain data that will be used to create the chart. Be sure to
217  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

                 include labels in your selection.
            2. Click the Insert tab of the ribbon.
            3. Click the Line button in the Charts group.
            4. Select a format option from the Line Chart drop-down menu.

ADJUSTING THE Y-AXIS SCALE

After creating an Excel chart, you may find it necessary to adjust the scale of the Y-axis. Excel auto-
matically sets the maximum value for the Y-axis based on the data used to create the chart. The
minimum value is usually set to zero. That is usually a good thing. However, depending on the
data you are using to create the chart, setting the minimum value to zero can substantially min-
imize the graphical presentation of a trend. For example, the trend shown in Figure 4.4 appears
to be increasing slightly in recent months. The presentation of this trend can be improved if the
minimum value started at 500,000. The following steps explain how to make this adjustment to
the Y-axis:

         1. Click anywhere on the Y (value or vertical) axis on the May 2014-2016 Trend for NASDAQ
        Sales Volume line chart (Stock Trend worksheet).

         2. Right Click and select Format Axis. The Format Axis Pane should appear, as shown
        in Figure 4.5.

                       Mac Users: Hold down the Control key and click the Y axis. Then choose Format
                Axis.

Note: If you do not see "Format Axis . . . on your menu, you have not right-clicked in the correct spot. Press
"Escape" to turn the menu off and try again

     3. In the Format Axis Pane, click the input box for the "Minimum" axis option and delete
     the zero. Then type the number 500000 and hit Enter. As soon as you make this change, the
     Y axis on the chart adjusts.

         5. Save your work.

Figure 4.6 shows the change in the presentation of the trend line. Notice that with the Y axis start-
ing at 500,000, the trend for the NASDAQ is more pronounced. This adjustment makes it easier for
the audience to see the magnitude of the trend.

Adjusting the Y-Axis Scale

         1. Click anywhere along the Y-axis to activate it.
         2. Right Click.

              (Note, you can also select the Format tab in the Chart Tools section of the ribbon.)
         3. Select Format Axis . . .
         4. In the Format Axis pane, make your changes to the Axis Options.
         5. Click in the input box next to the desired axis option and then type the new scale value.
         6. Click the Close button at the top right of the Format Axis pane to close it.

TREND COMPARISONS: LINE CHART 2

We will now create a second line chart using the data in the Stock Trend worksheet. The purpose
of this chart is to compare two trends: the change in volume for the NASDAQ and the change in
the Closing price.

Before creating the chart to compare the NASDAQ volume and sales price, it is important to review
the data in the range B4:D28 on the Stock Trend worksheet. We cannot use the volume of sales
and the closing price because the values are not comparable. That is, the closing price is in a range
of $45.00 to $115.00, but the data for the volume of Sales is in a range of 684,000 to 3,711,000. If
we used these values - without making changes to the chart -- we would not be able to see the
closing price at all.

The construction of this second line chart will be similar to the first line chart. The X axis will be the
months in the range B4:D28.

     1. Highlight the range B4:D28 on the Stock Trend worksheet.
     2. Click the Insert tab of the ribbon.
     3. Click the Line button in the Charts group of commands.
     4. Click the first option from the list, which is a basic line chart.

Figure 4.6.5 shows the appearance of the line chart comparing both the volume and the closing
price before it is moved and resized. Notice that the line for the closing price (Close) appears as a
straight line at the bottom of the chart.
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  220

Figure 4.6.5 Trend Comparison Line Chart

The line representing the closing values is flat along the bottom of the chart. This is hard to see and not very
useful as is. Fear not. We will fix that.

        1. Move the chart so the upper left corner is in the middle of cell M1.
        2. Resize the chart, using the resizing handle so the graph is approximately in the area of
        M1:U13.

FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION: COLUMN CHART 1

A column chart is commonly used to show trends over time, as long as the data are limited to
approximately twenty points or less. A common use for column charts is frequency distributions.
A frequency distribution shows the number of occurrences by established categories.

For example, a common frequency distribution used in most academic institutions is a grade dis-
tribution. A grade distribution shows the number of students that achieve each level of a typical
grading scale (A, A-, B+, B, etc.). The Grade Distribution worksheet contains final grades for some
hypothetical Excel classes.

To show the grade frequency distribution for all the Excel classes in that year, the Numbers of
Students appear on the Y-axis and the Grade Categories appear on the X-axis. In this situation,
notice we do not select the Total row. The totals are a representation of all data and would skew
the graph. Essentially you would be graphing the information twice. If you want to display the
totals in a chart, the best approach is to create a separate chart that only displays the total values.

The following steps to create the column chart:

         1. Select the Grade Distribution worksheet.

         2. In Row3, replace the red text at states [Insert Current Year] and replace it with the
        actual current academic term and year.

         3. Select two non-adjacent columns by selecting A3:A8.

         4. Press, and hold down the Crtl key.

                     Mac Users: Hold down the Command key instead.

         5. Without letting go of the Ctrl key, select C3:C8

         6. From the ribbon click the Insert tab. Choose the Column button.

         7. Select the Clustered Column format. (First option listed.)

         8. Click and drag the chart so the upper left corner is in the middle of cell H2. Resize the
        graph to fit in the area of H2: O13.

Figure 4.10 shows the completed grade frequency distribution chart. By looking at the chart, you
can immediately see that the greatest number of students earned a final grade in the B+ to B-
range.

       Figure 4.10 Grade Frequency Distribution Chart

Why?
Column Chart vs. Bar Chart
When using charts to show frequency distributions, the difference between a column chart and a bar chart
is really a matter of preference. Both are very effective in showing frequency distributions. However, if you
are showing a trend over a period of time, a column chart is preferred over a bar chart. This is because a
period of time is typically shown horizontally, with the oldest date on the far left and the newest date on the
far right. Therefore, the descriptive categories for the chart would have to fall on the horizontal - or category
axis, which is the configuration of a column chart. On a bar chart, the descriptive categories are displayed on
the vertical axis.

CREATING A CHART SHEET

The charts we have created up to this point have been added, or embedded in, an existing work-
sheet. Charts can also be placed in a dedicated worksheet called a chart sheet. It is called a chart
sheet because it can only contain an Excel chart. Chart sheets are useful if you need to create
several charts using the data in a single worksheet. If you embed several charts in one work-
sheet, it can be cumbersome to navigate and browse through the charts. It is easier to browse
through charts when they are moved to a chart sheet because a separate sheet tab is added to
the workbook for each chart. The following steps explain how to move the grade frequency distri-
bution chart to a dedicated chart sheet:

       1. Click anywhere on the Final Grades for All Excel Classes chart on the Grade Distribu-

FREQUENCY COMPARISON: COLUMN CHART 2

We will create a second column chart to show a comparison between two frequency distributions.
Column B on the Grade Distribution worksheet contains data showing the number of students
who received grades within each category for the Current Excel Class Class. We will use a column
chart to compare the grade distribution for the current class (Column B) with the overall grade
distribution for Excel courses for the whole year (Column C).
However, since the number of students in the term is significantly different from the total number
of students in the year, we must calculate percentages in order to make an effective comparison.
The following steps explain how to calculate the percentages:

         1. Highlight the range B4:C9 on the Grade Distribution worksheet.
227  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

     2. Click the AutoSum button in the Editing group of commands on the Home tab of the rib-
     bon. This automatically sums the values in the selected range.

     3. Select cell E4. Enter a formula that divides the value in cell B4 by the total in cell B9. Add
     an absolute reference to cell B9 in the formula =B4/$B$9. Autofill the formula down to cell
     E8.

     4. Select cell F4 . Enter a formula that divides the value in cell C4 by the total in cell C9. Add
     an absolute reference to cell C9 in the formula =C4/$C$9.

     5. Autofill the down to F8.

     6. Select A3:A8, press and hold down the Ctrl key and select E3:F8.

                  Mac Users: Hold down the Command key

     7. Click the Insert tab of the ribbon.

     8. Select the Column button. Select the first option from the drop-down list of chart for-
     mats, which is the Clustered Column.

     9. Click and drag the chart so the upper left corner is in the middle of cell H2.

     10. Resize the chart to the approximate area of H2:N12.

     11. Change the chart title to Grade Distribution Comparison. If you do not have a chart
     title, you can add one. On the Design tab, select Add Chart Element. Find the Chart Title.
     Select the Above Chart option from the drop-down list.

     12. Save your work.

Figure 4.13 Completed Data Series for the Class Grade Distribution

Figure 4.13 shows the final appearance of the column chart. The column chart is an appropriate
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  228

type for this data as there are fewer than twenty data points and we can easily see the comparison
for each category. An audience can quickly see that the class issued fewer As compared to the col-
lege. However, the class had more Bs and Cs compared with the college population.

Integrity Check

Too Many Bars on a Column Chart?
Although there is no specific limit for the number of bars you should use on a column chart, a general rule of
thumb is twenty bars or less.

MAP CHARTS

Data visualization brings more depth in how information, in this case geographically, connects.
You can use a map chart to compare values and show categories across geographical regions like
countries/regions, states, counties or postal codes. Excel will automatically convert data to geo-
graphical locations and will display values on a map. As shown below, in Figure 4.14, in the next
steps we will compare West Coast Community College enrollments for Fall of 2019 using a map
chart.

BAR CHART VS COLUMN CHART

We will statistical data to compare a bar and column chart. Both the Bar and the Column chart dis-
play data using rectangular bars where the length of the bar is proportional to the data value. Both
235  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

charts are used to compare two or more values. However, the difference lies in their orientation.
A bar chart is oriented horizontally whereas the column chart is oriented vertically. Although alike,
they cannot be always used interchangeably. The difference in their orientation, meaning typically
the more data values the harder it is to read in a column format. This is where visually a bar chart
would be a better choice. Complete the below steps to insert both a bar and column chart com-
paring not only the gender and age differences of enrolled students but the type of graphs you
are viewing the data in.

       1. From the Enrollment Statistics sheet, select A3:A13. Press and hold the CTRL key and
            select G3:H13.

       2. From the Insert tab, choose Recommended Charts. Scroll down and select the Stacked
            Bar chart option. Click Ok.

       3. Move and resize the graph so it fits approximately in L1:U13.

             · Identifying the message you wish to convey to an audience is a critical first step in creating an
                 Excel chart.

             · Both a column chart and a line chart can be used to present a trend over a period of time.
                 However, a line chart is preferred over a column chart when presenting data over long periods
                 of time.

             · The number of bars on a column chart should be limited to approximately twenty bars or less.
             · When creating a chart to compare trends, the values for each data series must be within a rea-

                 sonable range. If there is a wide variance between the values in the two data series (two times
                 or more), the percent change should be calculated with respect to the first data point for each
                 series.
             · When working with frequency distributions, the use of a column chart or a bar chart is a mat-
                 ter of preference. However, a column chart is preferred when working with a trend over a
                 period of time.
             · A pie chart is used to present the percent of total for a data set.
             · A stacked column chart is used to show how a percent total changes over time.

                                                              Learning Objectives

            1. Apply formatting commands to the X and Y axes.
            2. Assign titles to the X and Y axes that clarify labels and numeric values for the reader.
            3. Apply labels and formatting techniques to the data series in the plot area of a chart.
            4. Apply formatting commands to the chart area and the plot area of a chart.

You can use a variety of formatting techniques to enhance the appearance of a chart once you
have created it. Formatting commands are applied to a chart for the same reason they are applied
to a worksheet: they make the chart easier to read. However, formatting techniques also help you
qualify and explain the data in a chart. For example, you can add footnotes explaining the data
source as well as notes that clarify the type of numbers being presented (i.e., if the numbers in a
chart are truncated, you can state whether they are in thousands, millions, etc.). These notes are
also helpful in answering questions if you are using charts in a live presentation.

X AND Y-AXIS FORMATS

There are numerous formatting commands we can apply to the X and Y axes of a chart. Although
adjusting the font size, style, and color are common, many more options are available through the
Format Axis pane. The following steps demonstrate a few of these formatting techniques on the
Grade Distribution Comparison chart. Follow the below steps to make some changes to the per-
centage numbers on the Y (vertical) axis.

       1. In the Grade Distribution worksheet, click on the Grade Distribution Comparison
            chart. Double-click the vertical (value) axis. This opens the Format Axis pane.

       2. Select Axis Options. Change the Minimum Bound to .05 to make the differences in the
            columns more dramatic.

       3. Click the Close button at the top of the Format Axis pane.
       4. Save your work.

                                                                                                      239
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  240

             Figure 4.22 Format Axis Pane Changes

X AND Y-AXIS TITLES

Titles for the X and Y axes are necessary for defining the numbers and categories presented on a
chart. For example, by looking at the Grade Distribution Comparison chart, it is not clear what the
percentages along the Y-axis represent. The following steps explain how to add titles to the X and
Y axes to define these numbers and categories:

       1. Click anywhere on the Grade Distribution Comparison chart in the Grade Distribution
            worksheet to activate it.

       2. In the upper right corner of the graph, choose the Charts Element plus sign. Select the
            Axis Titles, then Primary Horizontal and Primary Vertical. This inserts the place holders
            that you will type text in.
                 Mac Users click the "Add Chart Element" button in the Design tab, point to "Axis
            Titles" and click on "Primary Horizontal". Do this one more time and click on "Primary
            Vertical".

       3. Click at the beginning of the Y-axis title and delete the generic title. Type Percent of
            Enrolled Excel Students.
241  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

     4. Click at the beginning of the X-axis title and delete the generic title. Type Final Course

            1. Click anywhere on the chart to activate it. Choose to open the Charts Element menu.
            2. Select one of the options from the second drop-down list.
            3. Click in the axis title to remove the generic title and type a new title.

DATA SERIES LABELS AND FORMATS

Adding labels to the data series of a chart is a key formatting feature. A data series is an item that
is being displayed graphically on a chart. For example, the blue bars on the Grade Distribution
Comparison chart represent one data series. We can add labels at the end of each bar to show
the exact percentage the bar represents. In addition, we can add other formatting enhancements
to the data series, such as changing the color of the bars or adding an effect. The following steps
explain how to add these labels and formats to the chart:

       1. Click on any of the red columns representing the All Excel Classes data series, then
            Right-Click to open the menu.
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  242

         Mac Users should hold down the CTRL key and click on any of the red columns.
2. From the menu, select Format Data Series.
3. From the Format Data Series pane, click the Fill and Line (paint bucket) button to bring

    up the Fill and Border group of commands.
4. Click the word Fill (if needed) to expand the list of Fill options.
5. Select Pattern Fill. Then select 40% (last option in the top row). Change the Foreground

    to white, and the Background to Red.
6. Close the Format Data Series pane.

         Figure 4.24 Changing the Fill of a Data Series

Now we are going to add the Data Labels at the end of the columns.

       1. Be sure that your entire chart is selected, not just one of the data series. Click the Design
            tab in the Chart Tools section of the ribbon.

       2. On the Design tab select the Add Chart Element button, then Data Labels, then Out­

            side End (see Figure 4.25.)

       3. Click on one of the Data Labels. Note that all of the data labels for that data series are
            selected.

       4. Check the spelling on all of the worksheets and make any necessary changes. Save your
            work.

Figure 4.25 shows the Grade Distribution Comparison chart with the completed formatting
adjustments and labels added to the data series. Note that we can move each individual data label.

4.3 Using Charts with Microsoft® Word® and
Microsoft® PowerPoint®

                                                              Learning Objectives

            1. Learn how to paste an image of an Excel chart into a Word document.
            2. Learn how to paste a link to an Excel chart into a PowerPoint slide.

Charts that are created in Excel are commonly used in Microsoft Word documents or for presenta-
tions that use Microsoft PowerPoint slides. Excel provides options for pasting an image of a chart
into either a Word document or a PowerPoint slide. You can also establish a link to your Excel
charts so that if you change the data in your Excel file, it is automatically reflected in your Word or
PowerPoint files. We will demonstrate both methods in this section.

PASTING A CHART IMAGE INTO WORD

For this exercise you will need two files:
        · The Excel spreadsheet you have been working on this chapter -- CH4 Charting.
        · A Word document data file -- CH4 CC Enrollment

Excel charts can be valuable tools for explaining quantitative data in a written report. Reports that
address business plans, public policies, budgets, and so. For this example, we will assume that the
total enrollment per state from the Enrollment Statistics Map chart is being used in a student's
written report. (see Figure 4.26). The following steps demonstrate how to paste an image, or pic-
ture, of this chart into a Word document:

       1. Open CH4 CC Enrollment. Save it as CH4 Enrollment Totals Per State.
       2. Move your cursor to the bottom of the document by clicking below the heading that

            reads: Figure 1: Enrollment by State. The image of the Map chart will be placed below
            this heading.
       3. If needed, open the Excel file you have been working with (CH4 Charting). Activate the

                                                                                                      245

PASTING A LINKED CHART IMAGE INTO POWERPOINT

For this exercise you will need two files:

        · The Excel spreadsheet you have been working on in this chapter -- CH4 Charting.
        · A PowerPoint data file - CH4 PowerPoint CC
        · Microsoft PowerPoint is perhaps the most commonly used tool for delivering live pre-

            sentations. The charts used in a live presentation are critical for efficiently delivering
            your ideas to an audience. Similar to written documents, a wide range of presentations
            may require an explanation of quantitative data. This demonstration includes a Power-
            Point slide that could be used in a presentation. We will paste the linked Budget chart
            into the PowerPoint slide. As a result, if we change the chart in the Excel file, the change
            will be reflected in the PowerPoint file.

       1. Open CH4 PowerPoint CC .pptx. Save it as CH4 PowerPoint CC Enrollment.
       2. Navigate to Slide 6 - Budget To Increase Enrollment. This is the slide where you will

            place the linked chart.
       3. If needed, open the Excel file you have been working with (CH4 Charting). Activate the

            Budget chart. Click copy, (not Copy as Picture.)
       4. Go back to the CH4 PowerPoint CC Enrollment presentation.
       5. Make sure you are still on Slide 6. Click into the empty prompt box on the right.
       6. Click the Paste button dropdown arrow in the Home tab of the ribbon in the PowerPoint

            file, choose the Paste Option Use Destination Theme and Link Data (L).

                    Mac Users should choose "Use Destination Theme"
249  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

     This pastes an image of the Excel chart into the PowerPoint slide yet changing the
     appearance to match the current theme of the PowerPoint slide.

Figure 4.27 Use Destination Theme & Link_Data (L)

The benefit of adding this chart to the presentation as a link is that it will automatically update
when you change the data in the linked spreadsheet file.

       1. Return to your CH4 Charting Excel file.
       2. Select the Expenses worksheet. The Advertising cost for June was cut. Update the

            spreadsheet to change. Change the value in cell G5 to 1000.
       3. Select the Budget worksheet. Notice how the chart has changed.
       4. Return to the PowerPoint file. On Slide6, you should see the updated chart.
       5. Save your work. You will submit both the Word and PowerPoint files, along with the

            Excel file, at the end of the next section.

Integrity Check
Refreshing Linked Charts in PowerPoint and Word
When creating a link to a chart in Word or PowerPoint, you must refresh the data if you make any changes
in the Excel workbook. This is especially true if you make changes in the Excel file prior to opening the Word
or PowerPoint file that contains a link to a chart. To refresh the chart, make sure it is activated, then click the
251  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

Refresh Data button in the Design tab of the ribbon. Forgetting this step can result in old or erroneous data
being displayed on the chart.

Integrity Check

Severed Link?
When creating a link to an Excel chart in Word or PowerPoint, you must keep the Excel workbook in its orig-
inal location on your computer or network. If you move or delete the Excel workbook, you will get an error
message when you try to update the link in your Word or PowerPoint file. You will also get an error if the
Excel workbook is saved on a network drive that your computer cannot access. These errors occur because
the link to the Excel workbook has been severed. Therefore, if you know in advance that you will be using
a USB drive to pull up your documents or presentation, move the Excel workbook to your USB drive before
you establish the link in your Word or PowerPoint file.

                                                                 Skill Refresher:

             · When pasting an image of an Excel chart into a Word document or PowerPoint file, use the
                 Picture option from the Paste drop-down list of options - if you want the image to act as an
                 image. You will not be able to make any changes to the content of the picture.

             · When creating a link to a chart in Word or PowerPoint, you may need to refresh the data if you
                 make any changes in the originating spreadsheet. You should not use the Picture option.

                                                              Learning Objectives

            1. Review each worksheet in a workbook in Print Preview.
            2. Modify worksheets as needed to professionally print data and charts.

In this section, we will take a look at each of the worksheets created in the previous sections. Since
these worksheets contain a combination of data and charts, there are specific things to watch for
if you will be printing the sheets.
We will start by looking at each worksheet in Print Preview in Backstage View. We will then make
any changes necessary, such as changing the orientation and scaling or moving charts around on
the worksheet. To make sure we don't miss any worksheets, we are going to review the work-
sheets in the order they appear in the tabs.

PREVIEWING CHART SHEETS FOR PRINTING

Data file: Continue with CH4 Charting.
The All Excel Classes is a chart sheet. This means that it does not contain any data; remember
that chart sheets just contain charts. We still need to review it in Print Preview.

       1. Click on the All Excel Classes worksheet tab.
       2. Go to Print Preview by clicking Print in Backstage View.
       3. Notice that the chart will print on the entire page, in Landscape orientation.
       4. There is nothing to change. Exit Backstage View.

PRINTING WORKSHEETS WITH DATA AND CHARTS

The Stock Trend worksheet has a lot of data and multiple embedded charts. We need to print the
data and the charts, which will require modifications to the page setup.

                                                                                                      253
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  254

1. Click on the Stock Trend worksheet tab.

2. Go to Print Preview by clicking Print in Backstage View.

             Mac Users choose "File/Print..." from the Excel File menu option.

3. Notice that this worksheet is currently printing on seven pages.

4. As you click through each page you should make the following observations:
                         The data is split between the first and third pages.
                         The line chart starts on the first page, but part of it is also on the sec-
                            ond page.
                         The double-line chart starts on the third page and then finishes on the
                            fifth page.
                         The fourth and sixth pages are blank.
                         The last page (page 7) has a column of seemingly random numbers.

5. Exit Backstage View.

6. The first thing we are going to do is hide the numbers that are appearing on page 7. We
are going to hide the column, instead of deleting the numbers, in case
the numbers are being utilized somewhere else in the workbook.

7. Scroll to the right on the worksheet until you find the numbers in column AH.

8. Click anywhere in column AH.

9. On the Home ribbon, click the Format button in the Cells group.

10. In the Visibility section, select Hide & Unhide then select Hide Columns.
255  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

     Figure 4.29 Hide Columns in Format Menu
             11. The visible column headings should now go from AG to AI.
             12. Return to Print Preview in Backstage View to see the changes to the printed work-
             sheet.
             13. Notice that there are now five pages. The data and charts are still splitting across
             multiple pages, but the numbers in column AH are no longer going to print.
             14. Remain in Backstage View for the next steps.

     The data is still split between pages 2 and 3, and the charts are splitting oddly as well. The
     first step we will try to fix these issues is to change the page orientation and scaling.

              1. While still in Backstage View, change the page orientation to Landscape (use the
             Orientation drop-down menu in the Settings section).

                          Mac Users click the Landscape Orientation button
             2. This puts all of the data on one sheet, but the charts are still split between multiple
             pages.
             3. Change the page scaling to Fit Sheet on One Page (use the Scaling drop-down
             menu in the Settings section).

                          Mac Users click the Scale to Fit option
             4. This fits everything on one page, but it is too small to be able to read.
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  256

        5. Change the page scaling back to No Scaling.

                     Mac Users: uncheck the Scale to Fit option

The next thing we will try is moving one, or both, of the charts. In order to move the charts,
we need to exit out of Backstage View.

         1. Exit Backstage View.

         2. Switch to the View ribbon and then select Page Break Preview. Your screen should
        look similar to Figure 4.30. (Remember that the dotted blue lines indicate automatic
        page breaks.)

         3. Move the 24 Month Comparison (double-line) chart closer to the top of its page.

         4. Move the May 2014-2015 Trend for NASDAQ Sales Volume (line chart) so that it is
        under the 24 Month Comparison chart.

         5. The link to the data source is still at the bottom of page 2 (in A50:A51) so you
        need to move it as well. Using your preferred method, move the text from A50:A51 to
        M31:M32.

Now your screen should look similar to Figure 4.30.

                                                                   We don't want the data source link text to
                                                                   print on its own page, but there is no room
                                                                   to move it onto the same page as the
                                                                   charts. To fix this, we are going to remove
                                                                   the automatic page break between the
                                                                   charts and the text in M31:M32.

         1. Place your pointer on the horizontal blue dashed line (automatic page break)
        between the line chart and the Data Source link text.

        2. When your pointer changes to the double arrow (pointing up and down), drag the
        page break down into the gray area. This removes the page break.

        3. If your vertical automatic page break between columns K and L moves, drag it back
        between columns K and L. This will make it a solid blue line, which will no longer adjust
        automatically.

Note: you may need to slightly re-size the two charts in order to make your screen look like
Figure 4.31. Your "goal" is to only have two pages.
257                                             DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

                                                Now you need to do one final check of this
                                                worksheet in Print Preview.

                                                1. Go to Print Preview and look at both
                                                pages. Page 1 should contain just the data
                                                and page 2 should have both charts and the

     Data Source link text.

     2. Exit Backstage View and save the file.

     PREVIEW REMAINING WORKSHEETS FOR PRINTING

     The remaining worksheets need to be reviewed. Some of them will need minor changes and
     some will not need any changes. You will need to preview each one and then make the spec-
     ified changes. In the following steps, you will preview and modify all other worksheets.

             1. Grade Distribution, Enrollment Statistics, and Admissions sheets - the charts
             split across two pages. Fix this by changing the orientation (Landscape) and scaling (Fit
             Sheet on One Page).

             2. The remaining chart sheets should not need any changes.

     PRINTING A CHART ONLY

     Sometimes you might have a worksheet that has data and a chart, but you only want the
     chart to print. That is the case with the Enrollment Statistics worksheet.

              1. Switch to the Enrollment Statistics worksheet.

             2. Select the Gender Comparision chart.

                          Mac Users: Steps 3-5 will not work in Excel for Mac. See alternate steps below
                     step 5.

             3. Go to Print Preview. Only the chart is printing. (If it shows the data printing along
             with the chart, exit Backstage View and be sure to select just the chart on the worksheet.)

             4. If needed, change the orientation to Landscape. This orientation looks better when
             printing just a chart.

             5. Exit Backstage View.
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  258

                     Mac Users: the only way to print a Chart separately is to click on the chart
                you want to print move it to a new sheet by clicking on the chart, click the Move
                Chart button on the Chart Design tab, click New Sheet then choose File/Print
                from the Excel menu and switch to Landscape Orientation if necessary.

HIDING A WORKSHEET

You have actually decided that you do not want the Expenses sheet to be visible at all, but
you do not want to delete it. We are going to hide it from anyone looking at the workbook.

         1. Right-click on the Expenses tab.

                     Mac Users should hold down the CTRL key and click on the Expenses tab
        2. Select Hide from the menu that appears. The sheet should no longer be visible.
        3. Save the CH4 Charting workbook.
        4. Submit all three files from this chapter: CH4 Charting.xlsx, CH4 CC Enroll­
        ment.docx, and CH4 PowerPoint CC Enrollment.pptx as directed by your instructor.

To assess your understanding of the material covered in the chapter, please complete the follow-
ing assignments.
Although Excel is primarily used in business and scientific applications, you will find it useful in
other areas of study as well. In these exercises, we will use Excel to create charts using historical,
and health data.

CHARTING HISTORICAL DATA (COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW)

Download Data File: PR4 Data
Excel is an excellent tool for helping display historical data. In this exercise, we will be examining
ways to display information on minimum mage data and life expectancy.

TASK1 - NATIONAL MINIMUM WAGES CHANGES IN THE UNITED STATES 2019-2020

Since the beginning of the previous century, the United States has set a minimum wage, in order
to set a "floor" beneath which wages cannot fall. Most states have set their own minimum wages,
but none are lower than the national minimum wage. Follow the below steps to insert a Map Chart
outlining what the current minimum wage is per state.

         1. Open the file named PR4 Data and then Save As PR4 Historical Data.
         2. On the Minimum Wage worksheet, select the range B4:B55. Press and hold
        the CTRL key and select D4:D55.

                    Mac Users: hold down the "Command" key not the CTRL key
         3. Select the Insert tab, then the Map Chart tool in the Charts group.
         4. Move the Chart as a New Sheet. Rename the sheet Map.
         5. Update the Chart Title to US Minimum Wage 2020.

                                                                                                      259

TASK 2 - OREGON: PROJECTED LIFE EXPECTANCY AT BIRTH
In the past 40 years, between 1970 and 2010, life expectancy for Oregon men improved by 8.7
years and for women by 5.5 years. Oregon's life expectancy has remained slightly higher than the
U.S. average. The life expectancy will continue to improve for both men and women. However,
the gain for men has been outpacing the gain for women. Consequently, the difference between
men's and women's life expectancies has continued to shrink.
261  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

     CHAPTER 5 - TABLES

Excel is the leading application for storing, managing and analyzing data. In Chapter 5, you will
explore how to import, organize, and analyze data effectively. To manage and analyze a group of
related data, users can turn a range of cells into an Excel table.
A table, also called a database, is an organized structure of rows and columns of related data in
a worksheet; for example, a list of employee information. In a table of employees, each employee
would have a separate record; as shown below, each record might include several fields, such as
the Employee ID Number, their Last Name, and First Name, etc. Each row of a table stores records,
and each column stores one field for the record. A record also can include fields that contain ref-
erences, formulas, and functions. Additionally, a row of column headings at the top of the table
stores field names that identify the data being collected and stored.
Excel has a vast collection of database and tabling tools that allow users to import, clean, sort, fil-
ter, total, subtotal, analyze, visualize, and report. This chapter explores how to import, insert, edit,
and examine data with Excel table and PivotTable tools. Demonstrate skills by studying the pro-
vided 2017-2018 employee database. Examine employee relations, payroll, benefits, and training
options.

Turning a range of cells into an Excel table makes related data easier to analyze, visualize, and
report. Structuring and planning table layouts are vital for data integrity. Below are guidelines to
consider when designing and building a table from scratch:

Figure 5.2 Table Layout Guidelines

OVERVIEW

Excel tables behave independently from the rest of the information on the worksheet. Excel treats
the table area as a database locking the record entries together. There are several advantages of
Excel treating the data independently. For example, using integrated filters and sort functions you
can effortlessly drill down data based on questions and in return get results. Excel will also auto-
matically expand the table to accommodate new data entries and allows for automatic formatting,
such as recoloring of banded rows or columns.

You will also notice Excel treats formulas and calculations differently in a table, showing structured
column names, along with automatically filling a calculated field to the entire table or offering
quick and easy table totaling tools.

When graphing and charting table data you will also see Excel automatically adjusts of associated
charts and ranges based on what the user is sorting or filtering at the time.

In industry, data is commonly stored in databases or multiple Excel files. Databases vary drasti-
cally, therefore in some cases, it is necessary to import data types into Excel. In our example, we
will work with an Excel file that has imported data from a human resources database. The data
downloaded from the database is stored in an Excel workbook, however, it's in a Comma Sepa-
273  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

rated Values (CSV) format. We will import the Excel file into our CH 5 Data file, turn the data into a
table for further analysis.

IMPORT AND FORMAT DATA AS A TABLE

                                 CH-5-HR_

Keeping the above table guidelines in mind, import human resource data into Excel, as a table.
Demonstrate tabling skills by examining employee relations, payroll, and benefits. Note you will
need to save the CH 5 HR file on your computer as you will import this file into the CH 5 Data file
in the below steps.

         1. Open data file CH 5 Data and save the file as CH5 HR Report.

         2. In the EmployeeData sheet, click on cell A5.

                     Mac Users: Excel for Mac does not have the tool for "Getting Data" from an
                Excel Workbook. You will set up this data using alternate steps. Please skip steps
                3-11. The alternate steps can be found below after Step 11.

         3. From the Data tab, choose Get Data.

     10. Congrats! You just converted the data to an Excel table. Continue following the steps in
            the section below.

TABLE TOOLS DESIGN TAB
Excel tables require specific tools. The Table Tools Design tab houses these specific tools used for
formatting and editing tables. The Table Tools tab is considered a contextual tab; meaning the
tabs appear when you are clicked in a table area. When you click out of a table, the Table Tools
disappear.
Explore the table tools now. Notice the specific checkboxes to turn on table options, for example,
you can choose to display banded rows or banded columns, or a total row etc. We will explore
table tools in the following steps.
When importing data as a table, Excel automatically applied table formatting. Follow the below
steps to format and edit the table.
279  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

     1. Click the Table Tools/Design tab on the ribbon.

               Mac Users: you don't have a Table Tools/Design tab. Just
           make sure the Table tab is selected.

     2. From the provided Table Styles, choose the Blue, Table Style
     Medium 2 option.

               Mac Users: the table you just created may already have the
           "Blue, Table Style Medium 2 option.

                                     Figure 5.9 Blue Table Style Medium 2 Option

Another option for inserting a table is using the Insert button. The Insert Table button, located on
the Insert tab will turn a range of information into an unformatted table. We will use the insert
table option later on in the chapter.

                                                                  Skill Refresher
   Format Data as a Table
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  280

1. Click on the top-left cell in your data.
2. Click the Format As Table menu from the Home tab on the Ribbon. Choose a style.
3. Make sure "My table has headers" is checked. Click OK.
4. Click on the top-left cell again.
5. Adjust the widths of the columns so that you can see the complete headings with the filter

    arrows showing.

VIEWING TABLE DATA

USING PANES

Data sets can bridge thousands of records with dozens of fields and extend beyond a workbook
window. It can be difficult to compare fields and records in widely separated columns and rows.
One way of dealing with this problem is by dividing the workbook window into viewing panes by
using the Split view option. Excel can split the workbook window into four sections called panes
with each pane offering a separate view into the worksheet. By scrolling through the contents
of individual panes, you can compare cells from different sections of the worksheet side-by-side
within the workbook window.

To split the workbook window into four panes, select any cell or range in the worksheet, and then
on the View tab, in the Window group, click the Split button. Split bars divide the workbook win-
dow along the top and left border of the selected cell or range. To split the window into two ver-
tical panes displayed side-by-side, select any cell in the first row of the worksheet and then click
the Split button. To split the window into two stacked horizontal panes, select any cell in the first
column and then click the Split button. To turn off the Spilt window option, simply click Split again
on the View tab.

In our specific example the data set is manageable, however freezing the first column, and the top
heading could be useful when scrolling through data.

FREEZE PANES

To keep an area of a worksheet visible while you scroll to another area of the worksheet use
Freeze Panes. Follow the steps below to freeze, based on selection, the first column, and heading
row.

         1. If needed, adjust column widths so all heading names in row 5 are visible.
281                                                          DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

     2. Click cell B6 in the table. (By selecting this specific cell, when we apply the freeze pane
     option, Excel will freeze the table where the first column ends and the heading row is view-
     able.)

     3. Click the View tab.

     4. Select Freeze Panes, and for the listed options choose Freeze Panes (See Figure 5.10
     below). The column and rows will remain visible based on the cell that was selected above.

        Mac Users should just click the Freeze Panes button
     under the View tab.

                            Figure 5.10 Freeze Panes

FORMATTING TABLE DATA

After reviewing the table, two columns have data that need to be formatted accordingly. In large
data sets, it is useful to know data selection short cuts. In this example, we are going to use key-
board short cuts to select a column of information in the table and apply number formatting.
Format data by following the below steps:

         1. In the EmployeeData sheet, click cell E6.
         2. On the keyboard press and hold the CTRL and SHIFT and DOWN keys.
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019                                 282

3. With the "Years of Service" data selected, click the Home tab. In the Numbers category,
format the data as a Number. The number should automatically decrease the decimal to
two decimal places.

Mac Users: click the "list arrow" next to "General,  and

then choose "Number" from the list.

4. Click in cell J6. (Be sure you have clicked J6 so that you are in the first cell in the Current Salary
column). Using the same selection process, select the Current Salary column, and format the
data as Currency, zero decimal place.

5. Using the non-adjacent selection method, select column headings E, G, and I, and center
the data.

Figure 5.11 Number Formatting

NAMING A TABLE
Each time a table is created, Excel assigns a default name. The default naming convention is sim-
ilar to the way new workbooks are named (Book1, Book2, etc.), however in this case Excel recog-
nizes the area as a table and will assign the name table instead of book: Table1, Table2, Table3,
and so on.
Why name a table range? Referring to the table by name rather than by range will make it easier to
refer to a table in the future, for example, in a workbook that contains many tables. Seeing tables
283  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

named Jan or Feb is more informational then seeing Table1 or Table 2. You can custom name each
table and in the future connect named tables for reporting purposes.

There are two rules to consider when naming tables. One, Excel does not allow spaces in table
names, and two, Excel also requires that table names begin with a letter or underscore.

Follow the next step to assign a custom name to the table.

         1. Click anywhere in the table and then display the Table Tools Design tab.

                 Mac Users: there is no "Table Tools Design" tab in Excel for Mac.
            Simply click the Table tab and follow steps 2 and 3 below to give the
            table a new name.

         2. Click the Table Name text box, in the Properties group.

         3. Type Employee_DB and then press enter to name the table.

 Figure 5.12 Name a Table Range

ENTERING & DELETING RECORDS

Tables require constant updating and may need calculations. When your table needs updating you
can add/delete data, by adding/deleting rows, or columns. Excel adjusts the table automatically to
the new content. The format applied to the banded rows updates to accommodate the new data
set size.

When calculations are needed you can create a calculated column or use the built-in Total Row
tool. Excel tables are a fantastic tool for entering formulas efficiently in a calculated column. Excel
allows you to enter a single formula in one cell, and then that formula will automatically expand to
the rest of the column by itself. There's no need to use the Fill or Copy commands. This feature can
be incredibly time-saving, especially if you have a lot of rows. And the same thing happens when
you change a formula; the change will also expand to the rest of the calculated column. The Total
Row tool, available on the Table Tools Design tab automatically adds a total row to the bottom of
the table. To add a new row, uncheck the Total Row checkbox, add the row, and then recheck the
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019                                                                               284

Total Row checkbox. From the total row drop-down, you can select a function, like Average, Count,
Count Numbers, Max, Min, Sum, StdDev, Var, and more.

Follow the steps below to update the employee table. You will insert new information just below
the table. Data entered in rows or columns adjacent to the table becomes part of the table. Excel
will format the new table data automatically.

      1. Press and hold the Ctrl and End button to move to the last record in the table.

               Mac Users: there is no "End" key on most Mac keyboards. Press and hold

             the "Command" key and tap the right arrow key. Then press and hold the Com­
             mand key, again, and tap the down arrow key. That should move to the last record
             in the table.

      2. Click tab to start a new record.

      3. Type the new entries below. Click tab to move to the next column.

As you enter the data, notice that Excel tries to complete your fields based on previous common
entries.

REMOVE DUPLICATES

Duplicate entries may appear in tables. Why? Duplicates sometimes happen when data is entered
incorrectly, by more than one person, or from more than one source. The following steps remove
duplicate records in the table. In this particular table, Robert Griffin was entered twice by mistake.
Delete the duplicate record by following the below steps:

         1. Click anywhere in the table.

         2. From the Table Tools Design tab click the Remove Duplicates button.

                Mac Users: Click the Table tab and click the Remove Dupli­
            cates button

      3. The Remove Duplicates dialog box will open.

      4. If necessary, click the Select All button to deselect all columns.

      5. Click OK to remove duplicate records from the table.

CREATE NEW COLUMNS
In this next exercise, we will explore how to add two new columns in the table. Take note, Excel
automatically adds the column to the table's range and copies the format of the existing table
heading to the new column heading. The first new column will use the VLOOKUP function to deter-
mine what cost of living adjustment (COLA) the employee qualifies for based on the region the
employee lives in. The second column added will calculate the projected salary increase based on
the COLA. When you use a formula in a table it is considered a calculated column.
A calculated column uses a single formula that adjusts for each row and automatically expands
to include additional rows in that column. The formula is immediately extended to those rows.
You only need to enter a formula to have it automatically filled down to create a calculated col-
umn--there's no need to use the Fill or Copy commands.
As mentioned in the previous section, Excel assigns a name to the table, and to each column
header in the table. When you add formulas to an Excel table, those names can appear automati-
cally as you enter the formula and select the cell references in the table instead of manually enter-
ing them.
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  286

As a visual reference compare the differences to a formula entered in a cell, compared to in a
table:
Formula - Cell References  Formula - Table: Excel shows field names
=SUM(J6:K6)                =SUM([Current Salary]:[COLA])
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  288

Excel displaying table and or field names in a formula is called a structured reference. The names
in structured references adjust whenever you add or remove data from the table headings. Struc-
tured references also appear when you create a formula outside of an Excel table that references
table data. The references can make it easier to locate tables in a large workbook. To include struc-
tured references in your formula, use point mode method to click the cells you want to reference
instead of typing their cell reference in the formula.

Complete the following steps to enter two new columns to determine each employee's COLA and
their projected salaries.

1. Click cell K5, and type COLA. Autofit the column width.

2. Click cell L5, and type Projected Salary Increase. Autofit the column width.

3. Click cell K6. From the Formulas tab, choose the VLOOKUP function (it is located within
the "Lookup and Reference" tool) to look up each employee's Store location. Matching their
store location to the COLA table, located on the COLA sheet, bring over their percentage of
increase listed in the second (2) column of the col_index. Note this is an EXACT match, so
eliminate all FALSE possibilities in the Range_lookup area:

        Figure 5.15 COLA VLOOKUP

4. The Excel table will request you to overwrite all cells in the column with the formula. Click
the icon, and choose the Overwrite command as shown below:
289  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

         Mac Users: Excel for Mac will automatically fill in the rest of the cells in the col-

     umn. You do not have to click the icon. Close the Formula Builder pane.

               Figure 5.16 Table AutoCorrect Option

     5. Using point mode method click the table cells to calculate the employees Projected Salary
     Increase by multiplying the Current Salary by the COLA increase:

                     =[@[Current Salary]]*[@COLA]

     6. The Excel table will again request you to overwrite all cells in the column with the formula.
     Click the icon, and choose the Overwrite command.

               Mac Users: You do not have to click the icon. Excel for Mac will auto-fill the rest

             of the cells in the column.

     7. Format the COLA and Projected Salary Increase columns by selecting K6:K107, and apply-
     ing the percentage number format, and increase the decimal to one place. Autofit the col-
     umn widths.

             (Suggestion: Use the short cut selection method; click in K6, press and hold the CTRL
             and SHIFT and DOWN arrow keys to select the column data.)

     8. Select L6:L107, and apply the Currency number format.

             (Suggestion: Use the short cut selection method; click in L6, press and hold the CTRL
             and SHIFT and DOWN arrow keys to select the column data.)

TOTAL ROW

A useful table tool for data analysis is the Total Row. You can quickly total data in an Excel table by
enabling the Total Row option, and then use one of several built-in functions provided in a drop-
down list, per column. The Total row, which is added to the end of the table after the last data
record can calculate summary statistics, including the average, sum, minimum, and maximum of
select fields within the table. The Total row is formatted with values displayed in bold, the double
border line option is separating the data records from the Total row.

Apply a Total Row, and follow the below steps to sum three columns of data:

       1. Click anywhere in the table and choose the Table Tools Design tab, and click on the Total
            Row option.

Follow the below steps to center the title in cell A1:L2 using the Center Across Selection tool
located in the Format Cells dialog box. In prior chapters, we used the `Merge & Center' button
to center text across a range. The Merge & Center tool centers the title but removes access to
individual cells. This restriction can present a problem when trying to autofit column widths in a
table. The Center Across Selection format centers text across multiple cells but does not merge
the selected cell range into one cell making it a better formatting choice when working with tables.

         1. Select cell A1:L2, and right-click to access the short cut menu.

                 Mac Users: hold down CTRL key and click the selected cells to access the short

                cut menu

         2. Choose Format Cells.

         3. In the Format Cells dialogue box, choose the Alignment tab.

         4. From the Horizontal alignment menu, choose Center Across Selection. Click OK to
        return to the table.

SORT, FILTER, AND ANALYZE DATA WITH PIVOT TABLES & SUBTOTALS
SORTING
Sorting is one of the most common tools for data management. By arranging data sequentially the
information becomes more meaningful. Arranging records in a specific sequence is called sorting.
If you sort by one column this is considered a single sort. If you need to sort by more than one
column, this is considered a custom sort.
The field or fields you select to sort are called sort keys. In Excel, you can sort your table by
ascending or descending order. Data in ascending order appears lowest to highest, earliest to
most recent, or alphabetically from A to Z. Data in descending order in arranged by highest to
lowest, most recent to earliest, or alphabetically from Z to A.
Excel will sort a range of data that is not in a table. However, when working with large sets of infor-
mation it is wise to make the data a table for integrity. Excel locks the row of information creating
a record, thus when sorted, the record remains intact, just reorganized. For example, when you
sort the table by last name, all of the records in each row move together. It is always a good idea
to save a copy of your worksheet before applying sorts.

                                                                                                      294
295  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

There are multiple places you can find and use sorting tools:

        · When you first create a table, Excel automatically enables AutoFilter buttons; a tool used
            to sort, query, and filter the records in a table. The filter buttons appear to the right of
            the column headings. When you click the filter button sorting options appear on the
            menu options.

Figure 5.23 AutoFilter Buttons

        · From the Home tab, in the Editing group, click the `Sort & Filter' button, and then click
            one of the sorting options on the Sort & Filter menu.

Figure 5.24 Sort and Filter Menu

        · From the Data tab, use the `Sort A to Z' or `Sort Z to A' buttons or for multiple levels select
            the Sort button to open the Custom Sort dialogue.

Complete a single level sort by following the steps:
         1. In the EmployeeID heading, click the filter button.
         2. Choose to Sort Smallest to Largest.

                     Mac Users: Click the A-Z Ascending button
Notice Excel arranges in chronological order all the employee data based on the EmployeeID num-
ber, however keeping each record together. You will also notice the filter button now displays an
up arrow denoting an ascending sort.

            2. Click on the choice AZ or ZA to sort your data by that column.

CUSTOM SORT
When you need to sort by more than one level, you must use the Custom Sort option. Complete
the following steps to organize the data by Store, Last Name, Current Salary, all in Ascending Order
(A-Z).

         1. Select the Data tab, and click the Sort button. Notice the last column sorted by is listed.
        Change the column heading name by dropping down the Sort by menu and select Store.
         2. Click Add Level.

                 Mac Users: click the + symbol

         3. Click the down arrow in the Then by section, and choose the column heading names as
        shown below in Figure 5.29. Note to click Add Level to add the next column heading. The
        order you select the headings will determine how the table information is sorted.

3. Click the down arrow in the Column field and choose the column heading to sort by.
4. Repeat the above steps to add another level and select the next column heading to sort by.
5. The order you select the headings will determine how the table information is sorted.

CUSTOM LIST SORT

When sorting you can create custom lists that allow sorting by characteristics
that do not sort alphabetically. Example, text items such as high, medium,
and low--or S, M, L, XL. Dates commonly require custom lists so you can vary
in the way data is sorted by days of the week or months of the year.
In our case, we want to create a custom list that sorts our stores, which is not,
in ascending or descending order. The human resources office likes to order
the stores based on the location size. The company headquarters is in Seat­
tle and employs the most people. The next biggest location is San Diego etc.
Follow the below steps to create a custom list ordering the stores as shown
below:

                Seattle

                San Diego

                Portland

                San Francisco

    Mac Users: The steps to create a custom sort list are different for Excel for Mac. Please
skip the below steps and follow the alternate steps below Figure 5.34.

Follow the below steps to create a custom list ordering:

       1. While clicked in the table, choose the Data tab and click the Sort button.

FILTER DATA

If your worksheet contains a lot of data, it can be difficult to find information quickly. Applying Fil­
ters is an efficient and effective way to only show the information needed. Typically when filtering
you are searching the data for specific information. Generally speaking, you are searching the data
based on a question, or in other words, querying the data, and returning only the information that
satisfies the question. The process of filtering records based on one or more filter criteria is called
a query. Filtering data hides the rows whose values do not match the search criteria. The infor-
mation that does not display is not deleted, it is just hidden, and will be redisplayed by removing
the filter or applying a new filter.

Like sorting, Filter options are located in the filter button alongside each field name. By clicking the
filter button, you can choose which values in that field to display, hiding the rows or records that
do not match that value. The filter lets you choose to display only those records that meet speci-
fied criteria such as color, number, or text. In this situation, criteria is defined as; a logical rule by
which data is tested and chosen.

For example, you can filter the table to display a specific name or item by typing it in a Search
box. The name you selected acts as the criterion for filtering the table, which results in Excel dis-
playing only those records that match the criterion. The selected checkboxes indicate which items
will appear in the table. By default, all of the items are selected. If you deselect an item from the
filter menu, it is removed from the filter criterion. Excel will not display any record that contains
the unchecked item. As with the previous sort techniques, you can include more than one column
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  304

when you filter by clicking a second filter button and making choices. After you filter data, you can
copy, find, edit, format, chart, or print the filtered data without rearranging or moving it.

                                               Figure 5.35 Filter Search Menu

Complete the following steps and filter data according to each query.
How many employees are at a Part-Time (PT) status?

       1. Click the filter button on the Job Status column heading.
       2. Click Select All, to deselect options.
       3. Click the PT box to only display the part-time employees.
       4. From the total row, in cell I108, choose the Count function count the number of

            employees at a PT status.

The answer to the question is there are currently are 11 employees at a PT time status. The total
row will display the part-time total current salaries, and what the projected salary increase for
part-time help will be after COLA adjustments.

Figure 5.36 PT Filter Visual

USING CRITERIA FILTERS

The filters created are limited to selecting records for fields matching a specific value or set of val-
ues. For more general criteria, you can use criteria filters, which are expression involving dates and
times, numeric values, and text strings. Excel will identify what criteria filter to display based on
the information in the column. For example, you can filter the employee data to show only those
employees hired within a specific date range. Notice the criteria filter changes to Date Filters. If
we were looking at the Current Salary column, the filter would be a Numbers Filter.

Using criteria filters, follow the below steps to search for employees who have been with the com-
pany for a specific time period.

             Identify employees who have been with the company between 2013-2016.

     1. While clicked in the table, clear any sort or filter applied by clicking the Data tab. In the
     Sort & Filter group choose the Clear button.

     2. Click the Filter button in the Hire Date column. Select Date Filters, and choose the
     Between criteria.

     Mac  Users: uncheck  the Select  All checkbox before  choosing

     the Between option.
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  306

3. Search for employees with a hire date between 2013, and 2016. In the "is after or equal
to" section type 1/01/2013, and typing in the "is before or equal to" section type 12/31/
2016. Then click OK.

            Mac Users: Excel for Mac sections simply say "After" and "Before"

        5. In the total row section, count the last name names of the employees by applying the
        count function in cell B108.

        6. In the total row, select cell I108, and choose None to turn off the count function in the
        Job Status Column.

Notice the table total row show 47 employees hired between the specified dates. These employees
will be evaluated for a COLA adjustment.

Notice the filter button displays a filter symbol and an up arrow indicating the column is filtered
and sorted in ascending order.

Figure 5.39 Date Filter and Sort

SLICERS

Another way to filter an Excel table is with slicers. Slicers, generally speaking, are visual filter but-
tons you can click to filter the table data. Slicers show the current filtered category, which makes it
easy to understand what exactly is displayed. For example, a slicer for the Store field would have
buttons for the Seattle, San Diego, Portland, and San Francisco locations.

When slicer buttons are selected, the data is filtered to show only those records that match the
criteria. Multiple buttons can be selected at the same time, and a table can have multiple slicers,
each linked to a different field. When multiple slicers are used, Excel uses the AND logical operator
so filtered records must meet all of the criteria indicated in the slicer. When selecting multiple but-
tons in a Slicer, use the shift key to select adjacent field names. If the field names are not adjacent,
use the non-adjacent selection method, pressing the CTL button, and selecting the field names
needed.

Follow the below steps to filter the table using visual Slicer buttons.

         1. Click in the table area. From the Data tab, choose Clear to remove the current sort and
        filter applied to the data.
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019             308

2. To make room for the Slicer buttons at the top of the table, we will add 4 rows between
the title and the table area. Right-click cell A3. Choose Insert. Select Entire Row. Repeat
these steps until the table heading starts in row A9.

             Mac users should hold down CTRL key and click cell A3. Then repeat until the
        table heading starts in row A9.

Figure 5.40 Added Rows

        3. Click back into the table area. Choose the Insert tab. Click Slicer. When the Insert Slicers
        dialogue box opens, click the Store and Job Status field names to display as slicers. Click
        OK.

309  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

     4. Move, and re-size the Slicer boxes to fit in the approximate area of I1:J8 and K1:L8. Make
     sure the buttons remain visible. Below is a visual example.

Figure 5.42 Slicer Layout Example

      5. From the Store slicer, click the San Diego button. Notice the data fil­
      ters to only show the data for San Diego.

        6. From the Job Status slicer click PT. Notice the data filters to only show the data for PT
        employees in San Diego.

Figure 5.43 Slicer Solution

         7. Return to the Store slicer and choose Seattle and Portland. Note the non-adjacent
        selection method is needed. Select Seattle first, then press and hold the Ctrl button on the
        keyboard, and then select Portland.

             Mac Users: hold down the Command key not the Ctrl key before you click on Port­
        land.

ADVANCED FILTERS
Filter buttons are limited to combining fields using advanced logic or complex criteria. If the data
you want to filter requires complex criteria, you can use the Advanced Filter dialog box. The
Advanced Filter works differently from the Filter command in several important ways:

        · It displays the Advanced Filter dialog box instead of the AutoFilter menu.
        · You type the advanced criteria in a separate criteria range in a worksheet and above the

            range of cells or table that you want to filter. Excel uses the separate criteria range in the
            Advanced Filter dialog box as the source for the advanced criteria.

For example, you searched records for employees in the Seattle and San Diego offices AND for
employees working at full-time bases, AND have a base salary between the below Salary Ranges:
311  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

Figure 5.45 Advanced Filter Criteria

To run the above complex criteria mentioned above follow the below steps:

       1. From the EmployeeData sheet, click in the table, then select the Data tab and clear the
            current filters by selecting the Clear button.

       2. Select the Table Tools Design tab and turn off the Total Row.
                 Mac Users: just click the Table tab and turn off the Total Row

       3. Select the Advanced Filter sheet. Click cell A10. The criteria mentioned in the above
            example has already been entered for this advanced filter exercise. Next, you will use an
            advanced filter to copy the records that match these criteria.

       4. From the Data tab, click the Advanced button. The Advanced Filter dialog box opens.
       5. Click the Copy to another location option button to copy matching records from the

            data range.
       6. Click in the List range box to make it active, and then navigate to the EmployeesData

            sheet, click cell A9, and then press and hold the CTRL and SHIFT and SPACEBAR to
            select the entire table. In the List range box, you will see Employee_DB[#All] in the list
            range box.

                 Mac Users: The keyboard shortcut of "CTRL, SHIFT, SPACEBAR" does not work in
            Exel for Mac. You should click in Cell A9, scroll down to the end of the data, hold down
            the Shift key and click in Cell L112 to select the entire table
       7. Click, or press the tab key, to move to the Criteria Range box.

ANALYZING WORKSHEET DATA

INTRODUCTION TO PIVOT TABLES
Another way to analyze table information is with PivotTables. A PivotTable is a powerful tool that
calculates, summarizes, and analyzes table data to compare, patterns, and trends. PivotTables are
inserted directly from a table, linking the table data. Generally speaking, when you pivot on the
table data you are reorganizing the table information to reveal different levels of detail that allow
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  314

you to analyze specific subgroups of information and summarize data quickly and easily without
having to change the structure or layout of the original table area.

When you pull table data into a PivotTable there are four main area fields: Rows, Columns, Values,
and Filters. The Rows and Columns fields can interchange quickly to summarize the data in dif-
ferent ways or to run new reports based on the question or criteria being asked. The Value field
is data from the table that can be calculated, or that contain values that the PivotTable will sum-
marize. The Values field has multiple settings to choose how you want to calculate the data; SUM,
COUNT, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX, and can even show the displayed values as a percentage of the total,
column total, grand total, and so on. Lastly, is the Filters area, which restricts the PivotTable to only
show the values matching specified criteria.

Four Primary PivotTable Areas:

In our situation, shown below, we will create a PivotTable to summarize employee data to show
Projected Salary Increases, for both Part-Time (PT) and Full -Time (FT) employees for all store loca-
tions.

FORMATTING PIVOT TABLES

After creating a PivotTable and adding the fields that you want to analyze, you may want to
enhance the report to include slicers, or graphs and or format the data to make it easier to read
and scan for details. When clicked in the PivotTable area you will see a contextual tab appear on
the ribbon, containing PivotTable Tools and two specific tabs; Analyze and Design. Mac Users:
there is not a "PivotTable Tools" tab but you will see two tabs named: PivotTable Analyze
and Design. They are only visible when you have clicked inside the PivotTable area.

The Analyze tab contains tools specifically for examining data, for example, the ability to insert
Slicers, or PivotCharts. The Design tab contains tools that specifically tie to how the table and data
visibly display. For example, when you have a lot of data in your PivotTable, it may help to show
banded rows or columns for easy scanning or to highlight important data to make it stand out.

Follow the below steps to add format the PivotTable, and add a PivotChart.

       1. Click in the PivotTable. From the PivotTable Tools choose the Design tab.
       2. In the PivotTable Styles gallery select the Light Blue, Pivot Style Medium Style 2 format.

         Figure 5.57 Light_Blue Medium Style Pivot 2

        3. To format the PivotTable numbers, select B5: D9. Click the Home tab. Apply the Currency
        number format and decrease the decimal place to zero decimals.

(The alternative method to number formatting in a PivotTable is to expand the menu on value field;
Sum of Projected Salary Increase. Click the Value Field Settings. Choose Number Format and apply the

desired number format option. Mac Users should click the small circle with an "i" next to "Sum Pro­
jected Salary Increase" in the Values section then click the Number button to change the Number For­

mat.  )

NOW LET'S CREATE A PIVOTCHART!

      4. Click in the PivotTable. Click the Analyze tab. Choose the PivotChart button on the Ribbon.

      5. From the listed chart types, choose Column. And select the 3D Clustered Column option.
      Click OK.

          Mac Users: Only a basic, 2D column chart is available when clicking the Pivot
      Chart button. In order to select a different chart type, such as the 3D clustered column
      option, you must do the following:

                       Click on the 2D chart that was just inserted
                       Click the Design tab on the Ribbon
                       Click the Change Chart Type button

                          Figure 5.58 3D Clustered_Column Chart

        6. Move the PivotChart under the PivotTable area. Resize accordingly. Save your work.
Note the formatting changes in the new chart below. The "Job Status" and "Store" buttons are col-
umn and row "filters" for the Pivot Chart.

             Mac Users: Excel for Mac does not insert these formatting changes within a Pivot Chart.
        You can add a chart title by clicking the "Add Chart Element" button from the Design tab. It
        is not possible to add the "chart filter" buttons as shown in Figure 5.59. The filters on the
        pivot table can be used to also filter the columns and rows in the Pivot Chart.

SUBTOTALS

Another way to summarize data is by using subtotals. Analyzing a large data range usually includes
making calculations on the data. You can summarize the data by applying summary functions such
as COUNT, SUM, and AVERAGE to the entire organized range of information. Subtotals, in general,
are summary functions applied to parts of an organized data range.

For example, you can SUM Current Salaries for employees from each Store location. To subtotal
the information the data must first be sorted by the Store field. For subtotals, the field that you
sort is referred to as the control field. For example, if you choose the Store location as your con-
trol field, all of the Seattle, San Diego, Portland, and San Francisco entries will be grouped together
within the data range. The SUM function then can be applied to SUM the Current Salary fields
for each Store location. Excel calculates and displays the subtotal each time the Store location
changes.

A new row containing a subtotal of that particular location will be inserted, and wherever the field
changes a value will display; a subtotal group of records. Excel updates the subtotal automatically
when the control field is changed. In theory, when subtotaling, you are adding a calculation row
to the set of data. Adding rows that total information in the middle of a table would compromise
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  324

the integrity of data in the table. The table tools would look at the total as a record, not a calcula-
tion. Therefore the Subtotal feature cannot be used in tabling, and can only be applied to a normal
range of data. You must convert all tables to a range prior to subtotaling.

Multiple functions can be applied within the same Subtotal. For example, we will explore how you
can SUM Current Salary's and also provide the AVERAGE Current Salary for each Store location
within the same Subtotal. Note Subtotal data can also be filtered.

The best practice when subtotaling is to follow four rules:

Figure 5.60 Subtotal Rules

Follow the below steps to Subtotal the Employee Data and provide a total Current Salary per Store.

       1. Select the Employee Data sheet. If necessary clear any filters applied to the data by
            clicking the Data tab and choosing the Clear filter option.

       2. From the Data tab, choose Sort button. Sort the Store Location, using the preferred Cus-
            tom List order of Seattle, San Diego, Portland, and San Francisco. If the list we set up pre-
            viously is not available type the entries in the List entries area. Choose Add, and then OK.

                      Figure 5.61 Custom Sort, Custom List Dialogue Box.

     3. Choose the Table Tools Design tab. Mac Users: just click the "Table" tab.
             Select "Convert to Range." Excel will display a message asking if you really want to
             convert the table back to a normal range. Choose Yes.

4. Click the Data tab, in the Outline group find and select the Subtotal Command. (Notice the
heading row no longer has filters buttons. The data looks like a table but is not a table. The
table tools are not active, and the information is a normal range.)

5. In the Subtotal dialogue box, choose the Store field in the "At each change in." For the
"Use Function," choose Sum, and only check Current Salary. Click OK.

SUBTOTAL OUTLINE VIEW

The Outline views, located on the left side panel, show summary statistics. The Outline tool, with
levels, allows you to control the expanse of detail displayed in the worksheet. The EmployeeData
worksheet has three levels in the outline of its data range:

        · Level 1, displays only the grand totals.
        · Level 2, displays the total spent at each Store.
        · Level 3, displays the total Salary.

Figure 5.66 above shows the Level 3 Outline, all the employee detail per store location. Clicking
the outline buttons located to the left of the row numbers lets you choose how much detail you
want to see in the worksheet. (Note that the three level numbers are at the top left side of the
worksheet, just below the Name box.)

You will use the outline buttons to expand and collapse different sections of
the data range.

       1. Click level 1. Notice it displays the Grand Total.
       2. Click level 2. Notice the totals for all store locations are displayed.

             · A table is made up of a data set that is organized into columns and rows representing fields
                 and records, such as employee information.

             · You can create a table by clicking formatting the data set as a table, or using the Insert Table
                 feature.

             · Excel offers pre-built table styles, and options to choose from to format a table.
             · You can add records (rows) and our fields (columns) to a table. You can then sort to reorganize

                 your data.
             · Freezing heading keeps your column headings displayed while you scroll through your table

                 data.
             · You can use the filter arrows in the table headings to sort by a single column. When sorting by

                 more than one field, use the Custom Sort option.
             · Custom List Sorts can be used when a field needs to be sorted in a special way.
             · A slicer is a visual filter button (object) used to filter data in an Excel table. Each unique value
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  330

                 in the field is a button.
             · A PivotTable is an interactive table that summarizes data from a data source such as a data

                 range or an Excel table.
             · The Subtotal tool includes summary statistics for each group of records. Excel organizes subto-

                 tals using an outline that can be expanded or contracted to view or hide details about the data.

ness. This exercise illustrates how to use the skills presented in this chapter to generate the data
needed on a daily basis by a retail company.

         1. Open the data file SC5 Data and save the file to your computer as SC5 Dynamite Cus­
        tomer Sales.

         2. Click the Sales Sheet. Format the data set as a table. Choose a style from the styles
        gallery.

        3. Create the following calculated columns.

                a) In I4, and J4, use a VLOOKUP function that will look up the Product Price and Prod­
                uct Cost based on the Product Sold column which lists an ID number. [Hint: The
                Product Table sheet lists the Price and Cost] If any error messages appear, check the
                Range Lookup.

            b) In K4, use a formula to calculate Profit. Hint: Profit =(Product
            Price-Product Cost)*Units Sold

        4. Format columns I, J, and K as currency with two decimal places.

      5. Make a copy of the Sales sheet and rename it Online Sales by Date.
      Place this sheet to the right of the Sales sheet. Answer the following
      question by filtering the data accordingly. What was the total Profit for
      Online Sales? Sort the results by Date Sold (A/Z).

        6. Make a copy of the Sales sheet and rename it June Sales by Country. Place this new
        sheet to the right of the Online Sales by Date sheet. Answer the following question by fil-
        tering the data accordingly. In June, for all products sold, what was the total profit
        earned? Sort the results by Country, then Name both in (A/Z).

                                                                                                      344
345  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

     7. Make another copy of the Sales sheet and rename it Sales by Product. Place this new
     sheet to the right of the June Sales by Country sheet. Using a slicer, filter the data accordingly
     to display the average Product Price, Product Cost, and Profit for DETA100 and DETA200
     items. Sort the filtered sheet by Product Sold. [Hint: In the total row make sure to type the
     word Average in column A.]

     8. Make one final copy of the Sales sheet and rename it Subtotals by
     Sales Type. Place this new sheet to the right of the Sales by Product
     sheet. Subtotal the sheet by Sales Type, summing the Profit column.

     9. Add a 2nd subtotal to the Subtotals by Type sheet that subtotals by Sales Type and aver-
     ages the Profit column.

     10. From the Sales sheet, create the below PivotTable totaling per product type the Product
     Cost for Online and Retail sales. Insert the PivotTable as a new sheet. Name the sheet Pro­
     ductPT.

                Figure 5.77 ProductPT

     11. For each worksheet, add a footer with the worksheet name in the center and your
     name in the right panel.
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  346

12. Preview each worksheet in Print Preview and make any necessary changes for profes-
sional printing. (Hint: Orientation, page scaling, and print titles might need to be used.)

13. Check the spelling on all of the worksheets and make any necessary changes. Save the
SC5 Dynamite Customer Sales workbook, and submit the file as directed by your instruc-
tor.

     CHAPTER 6 - MULTIPLE SHEET
     FILES

Excel workbooks often contain a large amount of data, and worksheets can quickly become over-
whelming. When one worksheet becomes cumbersome, data can be broken out into smaller sub-
sets and placed in separate worksheets within the same Excel file. Separating out spreadsheet
data into smaller pieces can lead to better data organization within a file and increase its ease of
use. When a retail company needs to track overall sales, as well as, individual store sales, it makes
sense to place each store's sales data in a separate sheet within a file. Adding a summary sheet
that sums across all the sheets will allow for total company sales data in the same file. This chapter
will show how to set up a workbook to make multi-sheet formulas quick and easy.
Other examples of when multiple sheets make the most sense are when you are comparing
regional data for a salesforce and wish to evaluate individual salesperson performance along with
overall sales, and data over a period of time where sheets can be broken out by year or by month.
When comparing data across several sheets, it is essential that all the sheets are laid out in the
same way. To facilitate this, a template can be used. A template is the basic pattern for each new
sheet that can be used repeatedly to make sure each new sheet has the same setup, formatting,
formulas, etc. as the existing sheets in a file. In this chapter, we will use both pre-made, Microsoft
Excel templates, as well as, ones we will create from scratch to meet the specific needs of our
work.

                                                              Learning Objectives
            1. Navigating through a multiple sheet file.
            2. Adding, deleting, copying, and moving sheets.
            3. Grouping and ungrouping sheets.

Throughout our textbook, we have worked with Excel files that have included multiple sheets.
Depending on the version of Excel you are using, a new Excel file may start with one or several
sheets. In this chapter, we will be working with a personal budget file that contains income and
expenses for an entire year. Our file contains a sheet for each month of the year, as well as, a
Summary sheet that will add all twelve monthly sheets of data together. To begin with, we'll get
comfortable with moving through the sheets, organizing them, and making sure that all twelve
monthly sheets are consistent.
Figure 6.1 shows the January sheet in the Personal Budget file along with all the sheet tabs along
the bottom of the window.

                                                                                                      348

NAVIGATING THROUGH A MULTIPLE SHEET FILE

Download Data file: CH6 Data
1. Open the data file CH6 Data and save the file to your computer as CH6 Personal Budget. Notice
that the file has an Expenses Summary sheet at the far left followed by monthly sheets.
2. Click on the different sheets at the bottom of the screen to move through the sheets. Notice
that the Expenses Summary sheet is formatted differently from the monthly sheets. Notice also
that all the monthly sheets are identical in layout and format.
3. Take a second look at the months at the end of the year. Not all the data has been entered for
September through November... and there is no sheet for December. We will enter the remaining
data and add an additional sheet for December.
4. Add the following data in the September, October, and November sheets:
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019                                350

COPYING A SHEET

       1. To make a December sheet, we are going to copy the November sheet.
       2. Point your mouse at the November sheet tab at the bottom of the screen.
       3. Hold down your left mouse button and then press and hold down the CTRL key.

                 Mac Users: hold down your left button while pointing at the November sheet
            tab and then press and hold down the Option (alt) key
       4. At this point, you will see a black down-pointing arrow to the left of the November sheet
            tab and your mouse cursor will become a small piece of paper with a plus sign on it.
       5. Drag your mouse to the right (still holding down the left-mouse button and the CTRL key)
            until the black down-pointing arrow is to the right of the November sheet tab.
       6. Let go of the mouse button and then the CTRL key. You should now have a November
            (2) sheet to the right of the November sheet as shown in Figure 6.2.
351  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

Figure 6.2 Additional November Sheet

Next, we'll update the November (2) sheet to turn it into our December sheet.

       1. Right-click on the November (2) sheet name at the bottom of the screen and choose
            Rename.
                 Mac Users: hold down the Ctrl key and click the November (2) sheet name. Choose
            Rename

       2. Type "December" and press Enter.
            Note for all users: you can also double-click a sheet tab name to rename it.

       3. Click on the December sheet.
       4. Click on B1 and change "November" to "December". Be careful not to click on the

            "Monthly Budget" image.
       5. Make the following data changes:

6. Save your work.
7. Point your mouse at the December sheet tab at the bottom of the screen.

8. Hold down your left mouse button and then press and hold down the CTRL key (  Mac
    Users hold down Option key)

9. Drag your mouse to the right (still holding down the left-mouse button and the CTRL key)
    until the black down-pointing arrow is to the right of the December sheet.

10. Let go of the mouse button and then the CTRL key. You should now have a December
      (2) sheet to the right of the December sheet.

11. Rename the December(2) sheet Practice.

                      Skill Refresher

Copying a Sheet

1. Point your mouse at the sheet you want to copy at the bottom of the screen.

2. Hold down your left mouse button and then press and hold down the CTRL key (  Mac
    Users hold down the Option key)

3. Drag your mouse to the right (still holding down the left-mouse button and the CTRL key) until
    the black down-pointing arrow is to the right of your existing sheet.

4. Let go of the mouse button and then the CTRL key. You should now have a Sheetname (2) to
    the right of the original sheet.

5. Rename the Sheetname (2) sheet as desired.

MOVING AND DELETING SHEETS

Sometimes your sheets do not end up in the right order, and you need to move them in order to
fix this. Let's try moving our "Practice" sheet to see how this is done.

       1. Point to the Practice sheet and hold down your left mouse button.
       2. Notice this time that there is still a black arrow to the left of the Practice sheet, but the

            piece of paper is blank. It does not have a plus sign (+) because we are moving, instead
            of copying, the sheet.
       3. Left-drag the mouse to the left until the black arrow marker is between the October and
353  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

            November sheets.
       4. Release the mouse button.
       5. Try moving the Practice sheet back to the right of the December sheet.

Since our Practice sheet is not a sheet we will need in our Budget file, we'll go ahead and delete it
now.

       1. Right-click on the Practice sheet tab at the bottom of the screen.
                 Mac Users hold down the Ctrl key and click the Practice sheet tab

       2. Click Delete. Figure 6.3 shows the warning message box that will appear on your screen.
            Your message box might look slightly different depending on the version of Excel you
            are using. It is important to note that you cannot Undo once you delete a sheet!

             Figure 6.3 Warning Message Box

       3. Click Delete.

GROUPING AND UNGROUPING SHEETS

Take a look at the monthly sheets again. Notice that there is a place in each of these sheets in
the range F11:F13 to calculate three pieces of Summary data: Income, Expenses, and Balance; but
there aren't any formulas in these cells. There is also a place for the % of Income Spent (in cell I5),
but we will need to add a formula in I6:I7 to calculate this. If we entered these formulas individ-
ually in each of the 12 month sheets, it would take a long time! Because this task would be very
repetitive, it would also be fairly likely that we would make some mistakes along the way entering
the same formulas over and over again. By grouping all the month sheets together, we can enter
each of the formulas once and have them appear in all the sheets.

       1. Click on the January sheet to make it active.
       2. Hold the SHIFT key down and click on the December sheet.

Now all 12 sheets should be selected. You can tell this in two ways: the sheet tabs that have been
selected are now bold at the bottom of your screen. Also, notice in the Title bar at the top of the
screen the word [Group] or - Group (depending on your version of Excel) added to the end of the
title. You can see both of these in Figure 6.4.
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  354

Figure 6.4 Grouped Sheets

IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT ANY CHANGES WE MAKE TO THE JANUARY SHEET WILL BE
MADE TO ALL THE SHEETS!! This is a very good thing when we want to make changes to all the
sheets at once, but we need to be sure to ungroup them when we're done making these changes.
Let's go ahead and add the formulas to all twelve of the sheets at once:

       1. Click in F11 in the January grouped sheet.
       2. Enter the formula =SUM(F5:F8).
       3. In F12, enter the formula =SUM(C5:C13).
       4. In F13, subtract Expenses from Income. In the January sheet, your balance should be

            $690. HINT: if your answer is negative, you subtracted Income from Expenses.
       5. Click on I6. (I6 and I7 are formatted and merged together - this is fine.)
       6. Enter a formula that divides Expenses (F12) by Income (F11). Your answer will show as a

            percentage since this cell has already been formatted to do this. HINT: If you percentage
            is greater than 100%, you have your numbers reversed.

Notice that a data bar was set up in I5 to visually show the income spent. Do you remember how
to do this from earlier in our textbook? Your January sheet should now look like Figure 6.5.
355  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

Figure 6.5 January Sheet with Formulas

7. Now that we are done making changes to all the monthly sheets at once, we need to ungroup
them. Right-click on one of the grouped sheets and choose Ungroup Sheets.

    Mac Users hold down Ctrl key click on one of the grouped sheets and
choose Ungroup Sheets.

Notice the sheets tabs are no longer bold and the word [Group] is no longer in the title bar.

8. Click on several of the month sheets to see that all the formulas have been added.

9. Click on the December sheet. Your sheet should now look like Figure 6.6.
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  356

Figure 6.6 December Sheet with Formulas

       1. Take a look at the Notes in the September sheet. It says that the rent was raised in Sep-
            tember, so we need to cancel our Gym Membership and show $0 for the Gym amount in
            October, November, and December.

       2. Group the October, November, and December sheets. If you do this successfully,
            these three sheet names should be bold and the word [Group] or - Group will appear in
            the Title bar.

       3. Click on C13 and change the amount to $0. Press Enter.
       4. Ungroup the sheets. The balances should be: October $605, November $530, and

            December $430.

                                                                  Skill Refresher

   To Group Sheets:
   Click on the leftmost sheet you want to group; then hold the SHIFT key down and click on the rightmost
   sheet you want to group. Same for Excel for Mac.
357  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

   To Ungroup Sheets:
   Right-click on one of the grouped sheets and choose Ungroup Sheets.

      Mac Users hold down Ctrl key click on one of the grouped sheets and
  choose Ungroup Sheets.

                                                                 Key Takeaways

             · You can easily move, copy, delete, and rename sheets in your Excel file.
             · Grouping sheets allows you to change a group of identically formatted sheets at the same

                 time.

                                                              Learning Objectives

             · Entering formulas that reference another sheet.
             · Using the SUM function to add up multiple sheets.

The Summary sheet in many multiple sheet workbooks is utilized to present totaled information
from the other sheets in the file. This is done to give a quick synopsis of all the other sheets in one
convenient location. For this reason, the Summary sheet is usually the first sheet in multiple sheet
files. Summary sheets "pull" data from the other sheets using three-dimensional (3-D) cell refer-
ences. In order to distinguish between A3 in the Summary sheet, A3 in the January sheet, A3 in the
February sheet, etc.; a 3-D cell reference includes the sheet name along with the cell reference.
The syntax to reference a cell in a different sheet is =SheetName!CellRange. So, the cell reference
for A15 in the March sheet would be =March!A15.

Let's start working on our summary sheet by trying out some 3-D formulas:

       1. Click on the Expenses Summary sheet tab at the bottom of the screen.
       2. Click on C5 and enter the formula =January!C5. Press Enter.

            This will return the amount $700 from cell C5 in the January sheet.
       3. Delete the formula in C5 in the Expenses Summary sheet.
       4. This time, click on C5 and type =. Then click on the January sheet, and then click on C5.
       5. Press Enter. This will put the same formula, =January!C5, in cell C5 in the Expenses Sum­

            mary sheet and will return the value $700. This is the point and click method. This
            method reduces the potential for making errors, such as misspellings or typing the
            wrong amount.
       6. In cell C6 in the Expenses Summary sheet, try entering a formula for the Power amount
            in the April sheet. You should get $135 as the Power amount, and the formula should be
            =April!C6.
       7. Delete the formulas in cells C5 and C6 in the Expenses Summary sheet.

For the Annual Amounts in C5:C13 in the Expenses Summary sheet, we don't need the amount

                                                                                                      358
359  DIANE SHINGLEDECKER

from a single month's sheets; instead, we need the sum of all the entries in all the monthly sheets.
So, we need to sum three-dimensionally through all twelve month sheets.
Let's try adding up all the monthly amounts in our Expenses Summary sheet:

       1. Click in C5 in the Expenses Summary sheet.
       2. Type =SUM(. (Make sure to type the open parentheses!)
       3. Click on the January sheet.
       4. Hold the SHIFT key down and click on the December sheet.
       5. Click on C5 again and press ENTER. Cell C5 should display the sum amount of $8,400.
       6. Click on C5 in the Expenses Summary sheet. In the formula bar, you should see the fol-

            lowing formula: =SUM(January:December!C5). This formula tells Excel to SUM cell C5 in
            the sheets January through December.
       7. Let's try another 3-D SUM together. Click on C6.
       8. Type =SUM(. (Make sure to type the open parentheses!)
       9. Click on the January sheet.
     10. Hold the SHIFT key down and click on the December sheet.
     11. Click on C6 again and press ENTER. Cell C6 should now display the sum amount of
            $1,610.
     12. Click on C6 in the Expenses Summary sheet. In the formula bar, you should see the fol-
            lowing formula: =SUM(January:December!C6).

If you feel comfortable with these 3-D formulas, you can copy C6 down through C13 to fill in the
rest of the formulas. If you're not quite comfortable yet, keep practicing the above steps to add
3-D formulas to cells C7:C13. When you're done, your Expenses Summary sheet should match Fig­
ure 6.7.
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  360

Figure 6.7 Complete Expenses Summary Formulas

While our 3-D formulas are complete in the Expenses Summary sheet, our summary feels like it is
lacking something. Let's add a visual representation of our summary numbers to the sheet.

       1. Highlight cells B5:C13 in the Expenses Summary sheet.
       2. Click on Pie Chart in the Insert tab in the ribbon and select the 2-D pie.
       3. Move and resize the pie chart so that it fills cells D3:J15.
       4. Delete the chart title.
       5. Move the legend to the right side of the chart. Resize the legend as needed.
       6. Add percentage data labels to the pie slices. Format the data labels to be bold with white

            font color. Your complete Expenses Summary sheet should look like Figure 6.8 below.
       7. Check the spelling on all of the worksheets and make any necessary changes.
       8. Save your file. If you're printing your assignment at this point, print ONLY the Summary

            sheet in regular and formula view. Close your file.

                                                 Learning Objectives
1. Use existing Microsoft Excel templates to create new spreadsheets.

A template is a predefined pattern for a spreadsheet that has already been created for you. Hun-
dreds of templates, already created by Microsoft, are available for you to use in Excel. These tem-
plates are very helpful if you have limited time to get a new task done in Excel, and you don't know
where to start. Templates do a lot of the work for you! Templates include all the formulas, format-
ting, etc. needed in a professional Excel spreadsheet. All that's left to do is enter the data. Prede-
fined Microsoft templates include everything from billing statements to blood pressure trackers
to business cards. Depending on your version of Excel or Office 365, template categories may
include: Business, Personal, Planners and Trackers, Lists, Budgets, Charts, and Calendars. In this
chapter we will explore using existing Microsoft templates.

To access the templates in Excel, do the following:

1. Click the File tab in the ribbon.

2. Click New in Backstage View.       Mac Users: Click the File menu option and
    choose New from Template

3. The top of your screen should look similar to Figure 6.9. If you have opened templates
    previously, these may show in this screen as well.

     1. Change the Name to your name.
     2. Change the Department to Technology.
     3. Hold down CTRL and click ~ to see where the formulas are in the sheet. Working in for-

         mula view helps you see where the formulas are, so you won't delete them.
     4. In formula view, carefully delete just the data, including the Description of Expense and

         the dollar amounts. Don't delete any formulas!
     5. Hold down CTRL and click ~ again to return to Normal view.
     6. Enter Dates, Descriptions and expenses for a trip of your imagining in the first three

         rows under the column headings.
     7. Save the completed file as CH6 Travel Expenses. Close the file.

We will practice using one more Excel template to create a class schedule. If you already know
your schedule for next term, you can use it to complete this template. Otherwise, use your current
class schedule.

     1. Click the File tab in the ribbon.

     2. Click New in Backstage View.       Mac Users: Click the File menu option and
         choose New from Template

     3. Click in the Search for online templates box.

     4. Type Class Schedule and press Enter.

     5. Click on the Student schedule that looks like Figure 6.11 below and click Create. NOTE:
          If this template is not available, select a similar one.

                                                                  Key Takeaway
             · There are many pre-designed templates in Excel developed in Excel that you can use. This will

                 save you the time and effort of designing and creating these files from scratch.

                                                              Learning Objectives

            1. Printing all of the worksheets in a workbook at one time.
            2. Preparing multiple worksheets for printing using grouping.

Just like consistency in formatting is important when working with workbooks containing multiple
worksheets with the same type of data, so is consistency in page setup. Now that the CH6 Personal
Budget workbook is complete, you are going to prepare it for printing by changing the page orien-
tation and adding a header. You will also print all 13 worksheets at one time.

APPLYING PAGE SETUP OPTIONS TO GROUPED WORKSHEETS

Data file: Continue with CH6 Personal Budget.
As always, you need to review your workbook in Print Preview before considering it complete.
When you do that with this workbook, you notice that the worksheets are each printing on two
pages. You decide to switch all the worksheets to Landscape orientation to see if that helps. You
will also add a footer with the worksheet name to each of the worksheets.

       1. Go to Print Preview. To view all of the worksheets at one time, select Print Entire Work-
            book in the first box in the Settings section. You should now have 26 pages to scroll
            through in Print Preview. If you were to click the Print button, all of the worksheets
            would print, not just the active sheet.

       2. Exit Backstage View. You want to change the page orientation of all the sheets, but you
            cannot change all of them at one time in Print Preview.

       3. Group all of the worksheets together, including the Expenses Summary sheet through
            the December sheet.

       4. Click on the Page Layout tab on the ribbon, then select Landscape using the Orientation
            button in the Page Setup group.

       5. Click the Page Setup dialog box launcher arrow in the Page Setup group then click the

                                                                                                      367
BEGINNING EXCEL 2019  368

    Header/Footer tab.

         Mac Users: Click the Page Setup button (there are no "dialog box launcher arrows)
    in Excel for Mac

6. Click the Custom Footer button. In the center section, insert the sheet name using the
    Insert Sheet Name button. The Footer dialog box should look like Figure 6.12.

             Figure 6.12 Insert Worksheet Name

       7. Click OK to close the Footer dialog box. Click OK again to close the Page Setup dialog
            box.

       8. Return to Print Preview to confirm that each worksheet is printing on one page, in land-
            scape orientation, with the correct worksheet name appearing in the footer.

                 Mac Users: the monthly sheets may still show as printing on multiple pages. If that is
            the case, close Print Preview, make sure all of the sheets are still grouped, click the Page
            Layout tab, click the Page Setup button, and click the Fit to scaling option. It should
            show "1 pgs wide by 1 tall". Then click OK.

In Print Preview you notice that the Expenses Summary sheet is not set to print correctly. Part of
the chart is appearing on a second page. You can easily fix this by changing the Scaling, but you
only want to change the scaling of the Expenses Summary sheet, not the entire workbook. If you
make the change in Print Preview while the worksheets are grouped it will change all of the work-
sheets.

             Mac Users can skip steps 1-7 below. You should see in Print Preview that all sheets are
        now displaying on one page including the Expenses Summary sheet. Continue with Step 8
        below.

CREATING A MULTIPLE SHEET WORKBOOK FOR A SPORTS TEAM

Data file: PR6 Data

You have just been hired by Pacific Northwest Soccer Club, and you quickly realize that there isn't
a consistent way for all the coaches to keep track of their team statistics. To help with this, you
decide to create a multiple sheet workbook for Season Stats for each team. Since you are also the
coach of the High Flyers Team this season, you will need to use the workbook to enter your team's
statistics.

       1. Open the data file PR6 Data and save the file to your computer as PR6 Pacific NW
            Sports Team.

       2. Copy the range B11:G22 in the Season Stats sheet to the same range in the Player
            Stats sheet.

       3. You will add formulas to this worksheet before entering the data later in the assignment.
            Group the sheets and add the following formulas to both sheets:

       4. In C22 and D22, you will need to count the Xs (that you will enter later) in rows 12
            through 21. To do this, use the COUNTA function. If necessary, review the COUNTA func-
            tion in Chapter 2. Your formulas will return zeros for now, until you enter the data.

       5. In E22 and F22, sum rows 12 through 21.
       6. In G12, calculate the Goal Percentage by dividing the number of Goals by the number of

            Shots. This formula will display an error message because there is no data in column E
            (Excel shows the #DIV/0! error when a number is divided by zero). We don't want to dis-
            play error messages, so an IF statement that tests the value of column E will solve this
            problem.
       7. Change the formula in G12 to an IF Function with the following three arguments:

                     Test - is E12 greater than zero
                     If the Test is True - divide the number of Goals by the number of Shots
                     If the Test is False - enter a zero

       8. Copy G12 down the column through G22. Format these cells as percentages.

                                                                                                      371

 9. Ungroup the sheets.
10. Save the file.
11. In the Season Stats sheet, enter the following data:

                D3 - High Flyers
                D4 - Fall and the current year (i.e. - Fall 2020)
                D5 - Pacific Northwest Soccer

12. Enter your name, phone number, and email address in row 8.
13. Make two copies of the Player Stats worksheet. Rename the Player Stats worksheets

      Player 1, Player 2 and Player 3.
14. Group the Player sheets only. Enter the following formulas:
15. A formula in D4 that points (links) to cell D3 in the Season Stats sheet. Your formula

      should be ='Season Stats'!D3.
16. A formula in D5 that points to cell D4 in the Season Stats sheet.
17. A formula in D6 that points to cell D5 in the Season Stats sheet.
18. Ungroup the sheets.
19. Click on the Player 1 sheet. Enter the Player Name: Juan Ramirez. Enter the following

      data from Table 1 below:
      Table 1: Player 1 Sheet

Game 1                Played  Started  Shots  Goals

              x       x        1      1

     22. Go to the Season Stats sheet and click on cell C12. Enter a 3-D formula to COUNTA
           (count the x's) in C12 for the Player 1 through Player 3 sheets. Copy the formula in C12
           through D21.

     23. Change the formulas in C22 and D22 from COUNTA to SUM.

     24. Click on E12. Enter a 3-D formula to SUM cell E12 in the Player 1 through Player 3
           sheets. Copy the formulas through F21.

     25. Preview the worksheets in Print Preview. Notice that only part of the data is printing for
           each worksheet. This is because a Print Area was incorrectly set when the file was first
           created. You need to clear this Print Area for each worksheet individually (modifying
           print areas cannot be done on grouped sheets). Exit Backstage View and for each work-
           sheet, click the Print Area button on the Page Layout tab and select Clear Print Area.

     26. Group the sheets and add a Custom Footer that shows the Sheet Name in the center of
           the footer.

27. Double check Print Preview to make sure each sheet is printing on one page, and that
      the Sheet Name shows in the center of the footer.

28. Your completed Seasons Stats sheet should look like Figure 6.14.

A MULTIPLE SHEET WORKBOOK FOR NATIONAL PARKS DATA

Data file: none
You are working at the Headquarters of the National Parks Department. One of your jobs this
week is to develop a workbook for individual park visitor data, along with a Summary sheet of four
of the parks visitation data. To do this, you will need to design and create a workbook with sum-
mary and individual park worsheets, and then enter park data for four national parks: Blue Ridge
Parkway, Crater Lake, Yellowstone, and Yosemite.
When designing your worksheets, be intentional about your formatting choices. Think about font
sizes, fill colors, bold and number formatting to make your worksheet aesthetically pleasing. Make
sure that all of your worksheets are formatted consistently. In addition, search for and insert a
relevant park image into every worksheet. You will enter the visitor data later in the assignment
after you have created the individual park and summary worksheets.

       1. Open a blank Excel workbook. Save the file as SC6 National Parks.
       2. Design a professionally formatted worksheet that will be used to display the individual

            park visitor data (this worksheet will be copied in later steps). Include an area to enter
            the name of the individual park and the park visitor categories listed in Table 4. Name
            the worksheet Park Data.
       3. Create four copies of the Park Data worksheet, one for each of the national parks listed
            in Table 4. Be sure to rename each worksheet!
       4. Enter the data from Table 4 below into the correct park worksheet. Insert a picture of
            the park and place it appropriately on the worksheet.
