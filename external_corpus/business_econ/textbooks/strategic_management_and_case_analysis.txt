Strategic Management and Case Analysis: An Integrated Approach provides a fresh
take on a familiar subject. Readers learn how strategic leaders analyze, formulate,
and implement strategy. In addition to considering corporate- and business-level
strategy, the text also reviews current megatrends and their impact on innovation,
sustainability and ethics, technology, and multinational strategy. Throughout the
book, students are invited to practice strategic management by conducting case
analyses that apply the theories, concepts, and analytical frameworks and tools of
the field. The text introduces analysis instruments that guide students through
analyzing, interpreting, and evaluating data in cases, which supports critical
thinking and evidenced-based decision making. The book integrates strategic
management as a research-led field of study with an experiential learning
approach to conducting a case analysis. Instructors are supported with a platform
of supplemental materials. Available in multiple formats that are free of cost, the
text provides a quality suite of resources to support both students and instructors.

INTRODUCTION

Target Audience

This textbook is intended for students in undergraduate business programs who are taking courses in strategic management. Since
strategic management synthesizes many business topics to develop a holistic view of business, strategic management courses
are often senior-level capstone courses. Most undergraduate business school students begin their business educations with broad
introductory business courses before concentrating on courses in their majors; then they return to a broader view of business to
cap off their business educations at a higher-level of learning. This textbook supports this level of comprehensive learning. If used
with a senior-level capstone course, this textbook supports seniors in synthesizing business education through the lens of strate-
gic management and helps them understand how businesses become successful by leveraging their competitive advantages. This
textbook integrates strategic management and case analysis, with cases linked from an open access collection of business strategy
cases, RMIT Strategic Management Case Studies. This textbook is most beneficial if it is used alongside cases that students analyze.

About This Book

Strategic Management and Case Analysis: An Integrated Approach integrates strategic management as a research-led field of study and
practice-informed area of business, taking on an experiential learning approach to conducting a case analysis. The book explains
how strategic leaders and managers analyze their firm's organizational performance and its external and internal environments;
how they formulate corporate-level and business-level strategy (which includes strategies related to innovation, sustainability and
ethics, technology, and multinational business); and how they implement strategy across an organization. Students maintain an
active and engaged role with the subject and practice of strategic management as they apply the theories, concepts, and analytical
frameworks and tools of the field. The text teaches students how to conduct a case analysis and introduces analysis instruments
that facilitate robust case analyses that are based on analysis, interpretation, and evaluation of data in a case. A platform of supple-
mental materials are provided to lend support to instructors. The book illustrates how strategic management is relevant to multiple
majors, at multiple stages in their careers, and in multiple work environments. This ensures that undergraduate students clearly
understand how strategic management is relevant to them.

The book is an original work available free of cost in electronic formats. We hope it reflects Virginia Tech's motto, Ut Prosim ("That I
May Serve"). We also hope it embodies Virginia Tech's Principles of Community:

      Virginia Tech is a public land-grant university committed to teaching and learning, research, and outreach to the Commonwealth of Vir-
      ginia, the nation, and the world community. Learning from the experiences that shape Virginia Tech as an institution, we acknowledge
      those aspects of our legacy that reflected bias and exclusion. Therefore, we adopt and practice the following principles as fundamental
      to our ongoing efforts to increase access and inclusion and to create a community that nurtures learning and growth for all of its mem-
      bers:

        · We affirm the inherent dignity and value of every person and strive to maintain a climate for work and learning based on mutual
            respect and understanding.

        · We affirm the right of each person to express thoughts and opinions freely. We encourage open expression within a climate of
            civility, sensitivity, and mutual respect.

        · We affirm the value of human diversity because it enriches our lives and the university. We acknowledge and respect our differ-
            ences while affirming our common humanity.

        · We reject all forms of prejudice and discrimination, including those based on age, color, disability, gender, gender identity, gender
            expression, national origin, political affiliation, race, religion, sexual orientation, and veteran status. We take individual and col-
            lective responsibility for helping to eliminate bias and discrimination and for increasing our own understanding of these issues
xiv | INTRODUCTION

            through education, training, and interaction with others.
        · We pledge our collective commitment to these principles in the spirit of the Virginia Tech motto, Ut Prosim ("That I May Serve").

Use of Color

Students experiencing the complexity and interrelated nature of strategic management concepts and theories may find the analyt-
ical frameworks and tools demanding. Students can also find it challenging to shift between focusing on strategy for strategic lead-
ers and managers to the perspective necessary for conducting case analyses. Color is used in the book to facilitate learning complex
and interrelated ideas by successfully shifting between vantage points. Because of the interrelated nature of the material, choices
were sometimes necessary when assigning an item in the book a color. When this was the case, a practical perspective guided the
decision: the color assigned is the one most supportive of clarity and learning. Elements that use color are clearly identified using
text so that readers with sight disabilities have full access to the intended meaning.

The analysis, formulation, implementation (AFI) framework frames the book. Strategic management concepts and theories as well
as analytical frameworks and tools that relate primarily to strategic analysis are blue. Those that deal mostly with strategy formu-
lation are green. An orange-brown is used when strategy implementation is the predominant focus.1

Levels of Cognitive Gain

There are multiple taxonomies of learning among several different dimensions, such as cognitive, affective, and psychomotor.
These taxonomies have evolved over time, and there is debate about their specifics. We offer one based on Bloom's taxonomy as a
heuristic that guides the book. When students engage with the complex subject of strategic management and conduct robust cases
analyses, they have multiple opportunities to engage with levels of learning in Bloom's taxonomy. The following table illustrates a
few of the ways students demonstrate each level of cognitive gain in Bloom's taxonomy when using the book.3

 xx | INTRODUCTION

Development

Strategic Management and Case Analysis: An Integrated Approach is a new collaborative work by three colleagues in the Pamplin College
of Business at Virginia Tech. Lori Anderson, who also serves as the course coordinator, was lead author and project manager for the
project.

Anita Walz, Assistant Director of Open Education in the University Libraries at Virginia Tech, guided the book through ideation and
development. Kindred Grey, Graphic Design and Production Specialist, managed review, design, and production of the book, lead-
ing up to its publication by Virginia Tech Publishing. Multiple staff formatted the text in Pressbooks, offered feedback to the editor-
ial team, and provided copyediting and proofreading. The resulting book has been published in online formats (Pressbooks, EPUB,
and PDF) and in a print-on-demand version.

Impact

Our hope is that this textbook enlightens and prepares students to enter the business world. After engaging with the material in the
book, students can understand and apply strategic management theories, concepts, and analytical frameworks and tools, instilled
with a much better grasp of the ways organizations achieve success at the strategic level. Throughout the book, students practice
analyzing, interpreting, and evaluating complex data by conducting robust case analyses. This integrated approach serves to make
students better specialists in their fields and better prepares them as employees, especially as they rise in responsibility and take on
more strategic roles in their organizations. Ultimately, we hope to support students in becoming better critical thinkers, prepared
to analyze the full range of situations they will face in their professional lives.

Finally, this book is meant to provide instructors in other colleges and universities with a no-cost textbook solution with high-qual-
ity content and structure.

       Tesla's Market Share Growth
       Perhaps best known to many consumers as a producer of electric vehicles (EVs), Tesla has beaten well-known legacy automotive com-
       panies like Ford and GM in the U.S. market to become the most profitable automaker in U.S. history despite the intense competition
       in the U.S. automotive sector. With a valuation of over $81 billion, Tesla is more than an automaker. Founded as Tesla Motors in 2003
       in San Carlos, California, by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, today Tesla is a successful multinational company headquartered
       in Austin, Texas, that also specializes in renewable energy solutions, such as energy storage devices and solar panels, in addition to
       EVs. An early investor, Elon Musk became CEO in 2008. Tesla continuously innovates in many areas, especially in sustainable technol-
       ogy. This is evident not only in its products but also throughout its production, which includes the advanced use of robotics.
       Despite its outstanding accomplishments, Tesla has encountered a number of external and internal challenges. Infrastructure has
       been slow to support long-distance EV travel, making traveling beyond a vehicle's range a challenge due to a lack of readily available
       charging stations, especially in remote and rural areas. Some consumers express concerns over the capacity of the power grid to sup-
       port the increase in EVs.
4 | 1. INTRODUCTION TO STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT

       An industry characteristic of automakers is that they can face
       long-term reliability challenges--to greater and lesser degrees,
       of course. While automakers new to the industry may have a
       brief honeymoon period before long term reliability issues are
       evident, Tesla vehicles have now been on the market long
       enough for these issues to become evident.
       Elon Musk is known for being outspoken about his views, espe-
       cially through his social media posts mostly on X. The successor
       to Twitter, Inc., X is a wholly owned subsidiary of X Holdings
       Corp., which is mostly owned by Musk. In a display of his influ-
       ence, on May 1, 2020, when he posted that Tesla's stock price
       was too high, the company's stock price immediately dropped.
       Within the organization, persistent challenges have included
       employee dissatisfaction, loyalty issues, and retention prob-
       lems. These internal problems, which frequently result from
       highly demanding work environments, high standards, and
       leadership concerns, have made it difficult to attract and retain
       a steady and loyal employee base and have impacted the com-
       pany's work culture.

                                                                                             Figure 1.1: Elon Musk follows through on Tesla's Master Plan

1.1 Introduction

The problems mentioned in the example above about Tesla raise significant questions:

· Will relating and supporting industries, such as charging stations and power grid capacity, grow to meet the demand of EVs?
· To what degree will Tesla integrate with these industries to control them or partner with them to influence their growth?
· How will Tesla address the emergence of reliability issues in its vehicles?
· How will Elon Musk's leadership style influence company success?
· How will Tesla address its talent attraction and loyalty concerns?
· Will Tesla be able to maintain its position as the leading electric vehicle manufacturer with the biggest market share in the

   United States?
· What emphasis will Tesla place on its EVs and other product lines, such as energy storage devices and solar panels, in the

   future?
· How will the company sustain its competitive advantage in the automotive industry and its success in renewable energy

   industries as the business expands?

As the market evolves and competition increases, the answers to these questions will depend on how well Tesla navigates its chal-
lenges, applies the right strategies, adapts to changing consumer preferences, and continues to innovate. These concerns, which are
not unique to Tesla, are a few of the questions and issues addressed by strategic management.

1.2 Organization, Business, Company, Firm, Industry

Before we introduce strategic management, it is important to understand how the terms organization, business, company, firm, and
industry are used in the book. Organization is the broadest term used to describe a specific entity and applies to entities in all sec-
tors: private (for-profit), governmental (public), and not-for-profit (including nonprofit, nongovernmental organizations [NGOs],
and voluntary organizations). Strategic management is important to all sectors. As a business textbook, the book focuses primarily
on organizations in the private sector. A few examples of organizations in other sectors are given throughout the book, as you may
work in the governmental and not-for-profit sectors at some stage in your career.

Organizations in the private sector are also referred to as businesses, companies, and firms. Therefore, all four terms can be cor-
rectly applied to entities in the private sector that engage in commerce and aim to make a profit. The terms organization, business,
company, and firm are used interchangeably in the book.

Industry is a group of organizations, businesses, companies, or firms that offer similar products and services while competing in
the marketplace for profit. The term industry is used to indicate this group of competing organizations, businesses, companies, or
firms.

In the example of Tesla above, Tesla may be referred to as an organization, business, company, or firm. Tesla competes in at least
two industries: the automotive industry and the renewable energy industry. Large multinational firms often compete in more than
one industry.

Unlike businesses like Tesla, units in the governmental or public sector, such as departments in the federal government like the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), are referred to as organizations. This also is true for not-for-profit organizations, like the
Red Cross.
6 | 1. INTRODUCTION TO STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT

     Key Takeaways

     Organization is the broadest term used to describe a specific entity and applies to entities in all sectors: private (for-profit), governmental
     (public), and not-for-profit (including nonprofit, NGOs, and voluntary organizations). Organizations in the private sector are also referred
     to as businesses, companies, and firms. Therefore, all four terms can be correctly applied to entities in the private sector that engage in com-
     merce and aim to make a profit. Industry is a group of organizations, businesses, companies, or firms that compete in the marketplace
     for profit.

1.3 Strategic Management Concepts and Theories & Analytical Frameworks
and Tools

As a multidisciplinary field of study, strategic management incorporates concepts and theories from many disciplines. Concepts are
ideas. Theories are collections of concepts that explain something. Common examples include the concept of gravity, which is an
idea that is part of the theory of relativity; likewise, the concept of genetic mutation is a part of the theory of evolution. In business,
theories are collections of concepts that explain something that occurs in the business world. For example, the concept of power is
a part of leadership theories, such as shared leadership theory.
An analytical framework provides a structured format for analyzing data. Continuing with the example of the concept of power as
an essential building block of leadership theories, there are multiple analytical frameworks that support analyzing power dynam-
ics, such as French and Raven's five bases of power--legitimate, reward, expert, referent, coercive power--that can be used to eval-
uate how leaders influence others.
Strategic management frameworks provide a structured format to analyze company data as it relates to a major area of strategic
management. Strategic management analytical frameworks may also be referred to as strategic management tools.
Strategic management concepts and theories inform the analytical frameworks and tools used in strategic management. The terms
frameworks and tools are used interchangeably in the textbook.
You learn many strategic management concepts and theories throughout the book, with frequent opportunities to apply multiple
strategic management frameworks to analyze companies.

       Application
            · Think of additional examples of concepts, theories, and analytical frameworks. How many more examples can you identify?
               1. INTRODUCTION TO STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT | 7

Key Takeaways

Concepts are ideas. Theories are collections of concepts that explain something. An analytical framework provides a structured format
for analyzing data. Strategic management frameworks provide a structured format to analyze company data as it relates to a major area
of strategic management. Analytical frameworks for strategic management may also be referred to as strategic management tools.

1.4 What is Strategic Management?

Just as it is important to understand what strategic management is and how to apply its concepts and theories, analytical frame-
works and tools are central to successful strategic management. The process of applying the concepts and theories through analyt-
ical frameworks and tools is known as case analysis. This chapter introduces you to the subject of strategic management; the next
chapter teaches you how to apply the concepts, theories, and tools of strategic management through the process of conducting case
analysis.

Strategic management is an area of business that is grounded in research. Like most areas of business, strategic management is
both a focused area of business practice and a field of study supported by robust research. In this introductory chapter to strategic
management, you first learn about strategic management in the context of business practice, and then you learn about strategic
management as a field of study. The remainder of the book approaches strategic management as a research-grounded field of busi-
ness practice.

Strategic management is a multidisciplinary subject, relying on and synthesizing all areas of business expertise, such as accounting
and information systems, business information technology and cybersecurity, finance, insurance and business law, hospitality and
tourism management, human resource management, business management, management consulting and analytics, entrepre-
neurship, innovation and technology management, marketing, and real estate. The primary aim of strategic management is to con-
tinuously apply evidenced-based analysis to formulating and implementing strategies that allow a firm to differentiate itself in the
market. Strategic management uses many frameworks and tools that are based on many interrelated concepts and theories. To
support you in learning these interrelated complex ideas and effectively applying them, we introduce you to the broad landscape of
strategic management so that you can see the big picture of how the ideas fit together and then break them down in more detail so
that you can apply them.

To understand the broad field of strategic management from both business practice and field of study perspectives, you need to
understand the terms strategic leadership, strategic management, strategy, strategic analysis, strategy formulation, and strategy implemen­
tation. We introduce each of these below as a way for you to see the big picture of strategic management before addressing them in
greater detail.

Strategic Leadership

Think about leadership and management. How are they similar? How are they different? One way to consider these different roles
is that leaders define the direction the organization is going, while managers identify the roadmap for getting there. In practice,
many employees both lead and manage, depending upon the size of a company and whether the management style of the firm
is centralized or decentralized. When it comes to strategic management, both strategic leadership and strategic management are
important.
8 | 1. INTRODUCTION TO STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT

Strategic leadership includes the responsibility, talent, capacity, power, and actions necessary to steer an organization strategically
though a dynamic market to create and sustain a competitive advantage and to become and remain an industry leader. Strategic
leaders direct the strategic management process.

Strategic leadership is an essential focus for top leaders in a company, such as those in the C-suite and the board of directors. Elon
Musk, his colleagues in the C-suite, and Tesla's board of directors provide strategic leadership for Tesla. However, strategic leader-
ship is not always the exclusive focus of those at the very top of an organization, depending on whether a firm relies on a centralized
or decentralized leadership style. In companies with a decentralized leadership style, leadership may be shared among more com-
pany leaders.

Strategic Management

Strategic management is the dynamic and ongoing process of managing a firm's approach to strategy. Strategic management fol-
lows a structured process to methodically and thoroughly analyze the environment, industry, and firm as well as to formulate and
implement strategy.

Large companies often have departments or teams focused exclusively on leading strategic management. Managers in a firm also
participate in strategic management. To support their data driven decisions, managers solicit data from areas of business expertise
such as accounting and information systems, business information technology and cybersecurity, finance, insurance and business
law, human resource management, and marketing.

You will likely be asked for data that supports strategic management early in your career. Demonstrating that you understand how
this data can support broader strategic management efforts can accelerate your career. Below, we explore exactly how competency
in strategic management is a vital skill to all business majors in all career settings and at all career stages, an assertion that will be
explained in greater detail later in the book.

Strategy

Think about the strategies you use to be successful in your coursework. They may include studying, time management, and remain-
ing up to date on assignments.

Strategic management focuses on strategy. Strategy is a collection of organizational plans and processes that focus on creating
and sustaining superior firm performance relative to a company's competitors, which creates a sustainable competitive advantage.
Strategies are broad and long range, with few specifics. They do not typically address actions.

The strategies this book covers in detail include corporate-level strategy, business-level strategy, innovation strategy, sustainability
and ethics strategy, technology strategy, and multinational strategy. We introduce those in section 1.5 and cover them in detail in
their own dedicated chapters.

Strategic Analysis

In firms, strategic analysis is the process of applying strategic management concepts and theories with analytical frameworks and
tools to conduct a thorough 360-degree analysis of a firm. This enables strategy managers to make evidenced-based decisions
about strategy formulation and strategy implementation in all areas of the company's operations.

You conduct strategic analysis of a company by conducting a case analysis, which the next chapter describes in detail so that you
may apply the knowledge throughout the remainder of the book.
                                                                                                        1. INTRODUCTION TO STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT | 9

When you graduate, you likely will be involved in strategic analysis either imme-
diately or very early in your career, depending on the size company you join and
its management style, whether you serve as an internal or external consultant or
you begin an entrepreneurial venture of your own. Competency in strategic analy-
sis is essential to both navigating a career and to starting your own business.

Strategy Formulation

Strategy formulation is the process of designing strategies throughout all levels
and areas of an organization. Successful strategy formulation relies on evidenced-
based decisions that are grounded in strategic analysis.

Strategic leaders and managers in firms formulate strategy. You analyze the com-    Figure 1.2: Strategic leaders align strategic analysis,
pany strategies when you conduct a case analysis. As with strategic analysis, you   strategy formulation, and strategy implementation,
learn exactly how understanding strategy formulation is important for your          much like fitting puzzle pieces together correctly
career as you progress though the book.

Strategy Implementation

Strategy implementation is the process of executing the strategies that a company has formulated.

Employees at all levels of a firm are responsible for implementing the company's strategies. You will be involved in strategy imple-
mentation immediately in your career. Knowing how strategy is analyzed and formulated gives you an advantage in implementing
strategy.

     Key Takeaways

     Strategic management is both a focused area of business practice and a field of study supported by robust research. Strategic leadership
     includes the responsibility, talent, capacity, power, and actions necessary to steer an organization strategically though a dynamic market
     to create and sustain a competitive advantage and to become and remain an industry leader. As a focused area of business practice,
     strategic management is the dynamic and ongoing process of managing a firm's approach to strategy. Strategic management follows a
     structured process to methodically and thoroughly analyze the environment, industry, and firm as well as to formulate and implement
     strategy. Strategy is a collection of organizational plans and processes that focus on creating and sustaining superior firm performance
     relative to a company's competitors, which creates a sustainable competitive advantage. Strategy formulation is the process of relying on
     evidence-based decisions that are grounded in strategic analysis to design strategies throughout all levels and areas of an organization.
     Strategy implementation is the process of executing the strategies that a company has formulated.

1.5 The Analysis, Formulation, Implementation (AFI) Framework

The practice and research of strategic management includes the three pillars of strategic analysis, strategy formulation, and strat-
egy implementation. These are represented in the analysis, formulation, implementation (AFI) framework that guides the focus
and structure of this book.
Figure 1.3 shows the AFI framework. We cover each element below.
                                                                                                        1. INTRODUCTION TO STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT | 11

Figure 1.3: The analysis, formulation, implementation (AFI) framework
At the center of the AFI framework are strategic management and strategic leadership, with which you are now familiar.
Below you learn more about the three stages of the strategic management process--strategic analysis, strategy formulation, and
strategy implementation--and the three essential questions that guide each stage. Next you learn what you're specifically analyz-
ing in the strategic analysis stage and in what order. Then the chapter focuses on strategy formulation, which is addressed at three
organizational levels of strategy (corporate-level strategy, business-level strategy, and functional-level strategy) and by the more
focused strategies that are embedded into business-level strategy (innovation strategy, sustainability and ethics strategy, technol-
ogy strategy, and multinational strategy). Finally, you consider strategy implementation.
Strategic management's foundations rest in three essential questions that align with the three stages of strategic management:

 1. Where are we?
 2. Where are we going?
 3. How are we going to get there?
Strategic analysis addresses "Where are we?" Strategy formulation begins to answer, "Where are we going?" And strategy imple-
mentation addresses "How are we going to get there?"
12 | 1. INTRODUCTION TO STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT

Strategic Analysis

Strategic analysis addresses the broad question "Where are we?" and includes multiple steps. In this section, we review the steps to
strategic analysis so that you can see the overall approach to strategic analysis. Later chapters discuss what is involved in each step
of strategic analysis. You learn how to conduct a strategic analysis when you conduct a case analysis using strategic management
tools.
The order of the steps is important. First, analyze organizational performance, which assesses the robustness and congruence of a
firm's mission, purpose, vision, values, and goals as well as its financial position, its market position, and other relevant quantitative
data. This step also includes a review of the firm's balanced scorecard. Next, review the external environment of the firm, which con-
siders the company's general, industry, and competitive environments. Then analyze the internal environment of the firm, which
assesses a firm's resources, capabilities, core competencies, and value chain. Once you have analyzed an organization's organiza-
tional performance and its external and internal environments, synthesize the analysis using a strengths, weaknesses, opportuni-
ties, and threats (SWOT) analysis. Finally, identify a strategic issue and strategic alternatives.
Each of these steps in strategic analysis is the subject of a chapter, ensuring that you learn them in much greater detail as you make
your way through the book.
Consider figure 1.4. The order of the steps in strategic analysis is important, as each step progressively narrows the focus until you
can define a strategic issue and how to address it.

                            Figure 1.4: Strategic analysis
                                                                                                        1. INTRODUCTION TO STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT | 13
A firm's strategic issue and strategic alternatives are central to strategic management. They are introduced here and elaborated
upon in detail in subsequent chapters.
A firm's strategic issue is the most important, urgent, broad, long-term matter that the company is facing. Strategic issues are the
result of multiple causes in multiples areas of a business and require significant organizational talent and resources to resolve.
Addressing a strategic issue moves a firm toward its mission, purpose, and vision, and it should therefore be congruent with the
firm's values and goals. A strategic issue focuses on the present and specific organizational context, addressing what is happening
with this firm at this time, in this place, and under these circumstances. What a strategic issue is and how to determine it is elabo-
rated on in subsequent chapters.
A strategic alternative is an action that addresses and has the potential to resolve every aspect of a strategic issue. Strategic alter-
natives are also explained in greater detail in later chapters.

Strategy Formulation

Once strategic analysis is complete, strategy formulation begins. This process addresses the broad question "Where are we going?"
Strategy formulation is presented in order from broadest to narrowest (in relation to the level of the organization where it is
addressed).
Figure 1.5 illustrates strategy formulation, and the text below explains each element in the figure.

Figure 1.5: Strategy formulation

There are three levels of strategy in an organization: corporate-level strategy, business-level strategy, and functional-level strategy.
Strategy is formulated at all levels of a company.

Corporate-Level Strategy

The corporate level of a company consists of senior executives in the C-suite, and if the company is large enough, it includes the
board of directors. Corporate-level strategy is a companywide strategy that focuses on creating and maintaining a firm's compet-
itive advantage by creating synergy within and between multiple industries, markets, market segments, and businesses, across
14 | 1. INTRODUCTION TO STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT

multiple industry value chains, and in different geographical locations. Corporate-level strategy is the responsibility of senior exec-
utives and the board of directors.

When you conduct a case analysis, you may analyze a company's corporate-level strategy.

Business-Level Strategy

Business-level strategy focuses on how to compete within an organization's chosen market and market segments to create and
sustain competitive advantage. Business-level strategy addresses a firm's strategic market position (cost leadership and differenti-
ation) and strategic market size (whether it competes in a focused market segment or a broad market).

Business-level strategy is the strategy of a strategic business unit. A strategic business unit is a fully functional unit of a business
that has its own vision and direction and may be part of a larger organizational unit like a division. The unit's focus and structure
may be based on factors such as markets served, products offered, or regions served. Smaller firms may have only one strategic busi-
ness unit, and large corporations may have more than one strategic business unit.

Strategic business units focus on one business-level strategy. Smaller firms that have only one strategic business unit have only one
business-level strategy. In large companies with more than one strategic business unit, different strategic business units may have
different business-level strategies. Therefore, large corporations that have more than one strategic business unit potentially have
multiple business-level strategies.

All strategy should be specific and differentiating. Though business-level strategies include a finite number of strategies that are
common to all companies, companies implement them in ways that reflect their specific company conditions.

In addition to each strategic business unit's business-level strategy, there are additional strategies that are embedded into business-
level strategies at the strategic business unit level. The four embedded strategies that are covered in this text are innovation, sus-
tainability and ethics, technology, and multinational strategy.

When you conduct a case analysis, you may analyze a company's business-level strategy and its innovation, sustainability and
ethics, technology, and multinational strategies.

Innovation Strategy

All companies of all sizes and stages of development and growth must address innovation and formulate innovation strategies.
Innovation strategies are strategies that are embedded into business-level strategies at the strategic business unit level that focus
on a firm's approach to innovation so that it can create and sustain a competitive advantage.

Sustainability and Ethics Strategy

Sustainability strategies are strategies that are embedded into business-level strategies at the strategic business unit level that
focus on a company's approach to reducing its adverse environmental and social impacts while establishing competitive differenti-
ation through the firm's positive environment and social performance (usually measured against environmental, social, and gover-
nance [ESG] metrics).

Business ethics strategies are strategies that are embedded into business-level strategies at the strategic business unit level that
focus on a company's approach to increasing ethical behavior and remaining legally compliant.
                     1. INTRODUCTION TO STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT | 15

Technology Strategy

Technology strategies are strategies that are embedded into business-level strategies at the strategic business unit level that focus
on a company's approach to using technology as a source of competitive differentiation and that align the firm's use of new and
emerging technologies with the firm's roadmap to reach its vision and overall business objectives.

Multinational Strategy

Multinational corporations (MNCs) are firms that have operations in more than one country.

Though all successful companies formulate innovation, sustainability and ethics, and technology strategies, not all businesses are
MNCs and therefore not all companies formulate multinational strategies. Multinational corporations formulate multinational
strategies, which are embedded into business-level strategies at the strategic business unit level, and are strategies that address
different ways to position the company in multinational markets. They include international, multidomestic, global, and transna-
tional strategies.

Three Critical Strategic Questions

Strategy can be described as a firm's answer to three strategic questions that are critical for every organization:

1. Where to play?
2. How to win?
3. Right to win?

The first two questions ("Where to play?" and "How to win?") are addressed at the two broad levels of strategy. "Where to play?"
is answered at the corporate level with corporate-level strategy. "How to win?" is addressed through business-level strategy at the
strategic business unit level. The third question ("Right to win?") is addressed by the specific strategies that are embedded into busi-
ness-level strategies at the strategic business unit level: innovation strategy, sustainability and ethics strategy, technology strategy,
and multinational strategy. All three questions drive the firm's formulation of a roadmap and action plan toward sustained superior
performance.

Where to play?

This first question is addressed at the corporate level of a company and considers which industries, markets, market segments,
businesses, and regions in which the firm wants to operate (play). The answers to the question are largely determined by the firm's
assessment of the attractiveness and profit potential of alternative markets, market segments, businesses, and synergies between
them. The answers also provide important solutions to the allocation of limited company resources to different businesses. In this
sense, it is also important for every organization to decide where not to play. Overall, the strategy that focuses on where to "play" can
be described as the firm's search for markets and market segments that are attractive today and in the future.

How to win?

After the first question has been addressed, the firm needs to decide how it will win in its chosen markets, and this is approached
through business-level strategy at the strategic business unit level of a company. Answers to this question are largely determined by
the firm's ability to develop a winning strategy around its resources, capabilities, and core competencies that are superior to those
of its competitors and that will create value for the firm's customers. There are various drivers of how a firm can win in its chosen
markets, like differentiation and cost leadership or whether the firm chooses to operate in a focused or broad market. Overall, the
"How to win?" question addresses the firm's search for a sustainable competitive advantage.
16 | 1. INTRODUCTION TO STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT

Right to win?

Once the question of where to play has been resolved at the strategic business unit level through business-level strategy, the ques-
tion "Right to win?" can be considered. All companies have the ambition to win in their chosen markets. They want to gain market
share, increase revenue and profit, and enter new markets and regions. However, strategy is more than a wish list of what a com-
pany would ideally want to do and achieve. Strategy is a company-specific roadmap for navigating its industry, directing how a firm
moves from its current state toward the firm's vision.

With this conception of strategy in mind, the company's right to win is addressed by the specific strategies that are embedded into
business-level strategies at the strategic business unit level: innovation strategy, sustainability and ethics strategy, technology strat-
egy, and multinational strategy. An organization needs a clear right to win in its chosen markets. This right is supported by truly
differentiating and valuable resources, capabilities, and core competencies that are unique for the specific organization.

Let's take the example of your university's volleyball team. The team surely has the ambition to do well, win as many games as pos-
sible, and maybe even win the conference title. Going beyond just the hope to win requires a clear right to win. This right (or reason
or justification) to win could be that the team has the best coach, the best training conditions, the best infrastructure, the best team
captain, or outstanding individual players. Maybe it is not the superior quality of individual players but the superior chemistry and
teamwork that makes the team win. Whatever it may be, without a true right to win, strategy just becomes wishful thinking-- an
exercise written on paper.

On a business level, the right to win needs to be clearly anchored in business-level strategy because it is in strategic business units
where a firm decides how it wants to win in its chosen markets.

Functional-Level Strategy

The third level of strategy formulation is functional-level strategy. Functional-level strategy, or just functional strategy, focuses on
implementing strategy in business support units. Business support units focus on single business functions, such as accounting,
business information technology, business law, finance, human resource management, marketing and sales, supply chain manage-
ment, operations, and procurement.

Many of you will join firms in business support units in your first professional positions after graduation. All types of strategy cas-
cade down to business support units, influencing strategy implementation at each level. Because functional-level strategy is the
focus of most courses in your major, it is not addressed in detail in this book.

Strategy Implementation

Once strategy formulation is complete, each type of strategy must be implemented. Strategy implementation addresses the ques-
tion "How are we going to get there?" Unless it is concerning a new strategy area for a company, then strategy implementation often
begins with analyzing the gap between the previous strategy and the newly formulated strategy. Strategy implementation involves
setting goals, allocating resources to operationalize the strategy, communicating and cascading the strategy, ensuring the organi-
zational design and control systems support the strategy, hardwiring the strategy throughout the organization, aligning culture
to support the strategy, and managing the changes required to implement the strategy. Strategy implementation is the subject of
Chapter 13.

  Application
       · Think about your career aspirations. Maybe you would like to join a large firm as a subject expert in an area such as accounting
          or marketing. Perhaps you plan to start an entrepreneurial venture (or already have) or maybe you want to work as a consul-
          tant. Now think about your career from the point of view of the AFI framework and the roles of strategic analysis, strategy
          formulation, and strategy implementation.
                What analysis are you conducting to support your strategy? Are you analyzing your strengths and preferences? Per-

                   concise sentence.
                Have you begun implementing your strategy? What else do you need to do before implementing your strategy?

Key Takeaways

The analysis, formulation, implementation (AFI) framework represents the stages of the strategic management process: strategic analy-
sis, strategy formulation, and strategy implementation. Strategic analysis addresses the question "Where are we?" Strategy formulation
begins to answer "Where are we going?" Strategy implementation addresses the question "How are we going to get there?" Strategy
formulation includes three levels of strategy in an organization: corporate-level strategy, business-level strategy, and functional-level
strategy. This text discusses four specific strategies that are embedded into business-level strategies at the strategic business unit level:
innovation, sustainability and ethics, technology, and multinational strategy. Strategy addresses three critical strategic questions that
every organization has to answer. "Where to play?" is addressed through corporate-level strategy. "How to win?" is addressed through
business-level strategy in a strategic business unit. "Right to win?" is addressed through the four specific strategies that are embedded
into business-level strategies at the strategic business unit level. Strategy implementation is executing strategy at all levels across a firm.

1.6 Intended, Deliberate, Emergent, Realized, and Unrealized Strategies

The AFI framework is a popular and useful model
of strategic management. It is a top-down, ratio-
nal model that is driven by managers focused on
managing the strategic management process
and by strategic leaders steering a firm strategi-
cally. It is planned and methodical.

There are other approaches to strategy, such as
Mintzberg and Waters's (1985) model that consid-
ers intended, deliberate, emergent, realized, and
unrealized strategies. This view considers how
strategies evolve over time.

The AFI framework and Mintzberg and Waters's        Figure 1.6: Intended, deliberate, emergent, realized, and unrealized strategies
approach are two schools of strategic thought
that business leaders often find complementary.

Intended Strategy

An intended strategy is the strategy that an organization plans to implement. The structured strategic management process
described above produces intended strategies.

Deliberate Strategy

Many things can happen between planning a strategy and implementing it, potentially requiring changes to the intended strategy.
A deliberate strategy is the strategy that a firm implements in such a situation. It is a planned response to alter, but not completely
change, an intended strategy in the face of dynamic conditions. Sometimes the factors that lead to the difference between an
intended and deliberate strategy are internal to the organization, such as talent and managerial capacity. Often these differences
can come from sources external to the organization, like the COVID-19 global pandemic, climate change, and changing competi-
tion.

Emergent Strategy

An emergent strategy is a completely new and unplanned strategy that is formulated in response to an unexpected circumstance,
which most often originates from a firm's external environment (such as the emergence of a new technology). Emergent strategies
are as important to a firm's success as intended and deliberate strategies. Firms that are skilled at horizon scanning for new oppor-
tunities and are nimble in response to changing conditions are better positioned to take advantage of these dynamic conditions
and formulate effective and profitable emergent strategies.

Companies formulate emergent strategies and deliberate strategies in response to changing circumstances. The distinction is that
deliberate strategies alter, but do not completely change, the intended strategy. They tend to be dynamic tweaks to the intended
strategy. Emergent strategies, on the other hand, are completely new strategies that are formulated in response to surprising and
unforeseen conditions. An emergent strategy is completely different than the intended strategy and requires a change of strategic
direction.
                   1. INTRODUCTION TO STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT | 19

Realized Strategy

A realized strategy is the strategy that an organization follows over time. Realized strategies include a firm's intended strategy and
deliberate strategy if the company has altered but not completely changed the intended strategy in the face of dynamic conditions.
Realized strategies may also include an emergent strategy if an unanticipated and completely new opportunity has arisen and the
firm has been nimble and quick enough to capitalized on it by formulating an emergent strategy.

One way to think about intended, deliberate, and realized strategies is as an evolution of strategy over time. The company initially
plans an intended strategy. A deliberate strategy is the part of the intended strategy a firm implements after taking into account
dynamic conditions either in the company's external environment, such as a new competitor, or in the firms' internal environment,
like a change in CEO. The deliberate strategy alters, but does not completely change, the intended strategy. A firm's realized strategy
is the strategy that an organization follows over time that includes the intended and deliberate strategies and also incorporates any
emergent strategies that have been formulated in response to conditions that were unforeseen when the intended and deliberate
strategies were formulated. A firm's realized strategy can be different than the intended and deliberate strategy if the company has
formulated an emergent strategy.

The Southern Bloomer manufacturing company is an example that illustrates intended, deliberate, emergent, and realized strat-
egy. Managers of prison facilities believed that the underwear brands currently on the market were not suitable for harsh prison
activities and constant laundry processes. Southern Bloomer saw this need and responded. They planned well and made an
intended strategy to meet this market demand. This involved a structured approach to analyzing factors external to the company,
such as a market assessment and competition analysis, as well as an evaluation of factors in their internal firm environment, such
as talent and managerial capacity.

Southern Bloomer started selling underwear made from mostly cotton fabric to cope with prison activities and the institutional
environment. They responded to customer feedback and market conditions and grew their business to a solid customer base within
that market, eventually supplying institutional underwear to 125 prisons. This was Southern Bloomer's deliberate strategy because
it was closely aligned to their intended strategy and amended to respond to external and internal factors.

An emergent strategy arose from an unexpected challenge related to the excess scrap fabric produced during production. The com-
pany had been discarding the leftover fabric. One day, cofounder Don Sonner visited a gun shop with his son, where he spotted a
potential use for his scrap fabric. The patches that the gun shop sold to clean the inside of gun barrels were of poor quality. Accord-
ing to Sonner, when he saw those flimsy woven patches that unraveled when touched, he thought, "That's what I can do with the
scrap fabric!" Unlike other gun-cleaning patches, the patches made by Southern Bloomer didn't shed threads or lint, which can hurt
a gun's accuracy and reliability. Patches produced by Southern Bloomer quickly became popular with the military, police depart-
ments, and gun enthusiasts. Soon, Southern Bloomer was selling thousands of pounds of patches each month. A simple trip to a
gun store unexpectedly led to a profitable new strategy (Wells, 2002).

In summary, the intended strategy of Southern Bloomer was to produce durable underwear for institutional settings like prisons.
The company pursued this strategy closely and executed a deliberate strategy based on this intended strategy, amended to respond
to dynamic conditions both in its external and internal environments. This strategy was successful and profitable, and the company
continued to pursue this strategy. An emergent strategy arose that allowed Southern Bloomer to use the scrap fabric it had been
sending to landfills. Southern Bloomer was quick to spot this new opportunity and nimble enough to capitalize on it. They seized
the opportunity to produce gun-cleaning patches from their scrap material left over from their manufacturing of prison underwear,
turning that into a second profitable line of business. Rather than sending this scrap fabric to landfills, the company found a new
alternative way to make use of the material. They turned a challenge into an opportunity. Southern Bloomer's realized strategy was
formed from a combination of its intended strategy, deliberate strategy, and emergent strategy. They continued to manufacture
and sell underwear to prisons and opened a new successful business line in a new market to sell patches to clean guns to a variety
of customers.
20 | 1. INTRODUCTION TO STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT

Unrealized Strategy

An unrealized strategy is an abandoned part of the intended strategy. There are many reasons why parts of strategies are aban-
doned, creating a gap between strategy formulation and implementation. These are elaborated on in detail in Chapter 13.

Let's now consider all the strategies with another example. David McConnell was an aspiring author who faced difficulty selling his
books. He tried several strategies and conventional marketing methods before he discovered the idea of giving out free perfume to
those who bought his books. This innovative approach not only attracted attention but also helped him find success, leading him to
lay the foundation of what would become the California Perfume Company, which was formed to market perfumes. This company
developed into the massive personal care goods company that is now known as Avon. Though McConnell's dream of becoming a
successful writer remained an unfulfilled plan, he created a successful strategy through Avon that was mostly driven by his capac-
ity to seize the moment by adjusting to changing circumstances and making use of newly emerging tactics. Ultimately, his journey
transformed a setback into a remarkable opportunity.

Let's look at Avon's story through the lens of intended, deliberate, emergent, realized, and unrealized strategies. David McConnell
had an intended strategy to sell books he had written. He executed this intended strategy with little initial success. His books were
not selling well, and his business was not profitable. In the face of this market information, McConnell decided to offer perfume as
an incentive to buy his books. This was his deliberate strategy because he amended his original intended strategy of selling books
to take into account lagging sales by adding the gift of perfume. His deliberate strategy altered but did not completely change his
intended strategy. His focus was primarily on selling books and adding the gift of perfume was an innovation that tweaked his
intended strategy. When the perfume sales proved to be a hit with customers, this provided a market opportunity that McConnell
had not anticipated. The emergence of a market for the perfume independent of the books was new and unanticipated. McConnell
acted quickly and decisively to take advantage of this new and unforeseen market opportunity and formulated a new emergent
strategy of selling only perfume. The emergent strategy of selling only perfume was completely different than his original planned
intended strategy of selling books and significantly different than his deliberate strategy of adding perfume as a gift to incentivize
customers to buy his books. He capitalized on this emergent strategy that came from his own innovation. The strategy he followed
over time, his realized strategy, is selling perfume. He discarded his original intended strategy of selling books and this became an
unrealized strategy in the end because he abandoned that all together.

Key Takeaways

An intended strategy is the strategy that an organization plans to implement. The structured strategic management process described
above produces intended strategies. A deliberate strategy is a planned response to alter, but not completely change, an intended strategy
in the face of dynamic conditions. An emergent strategy is a completely new and unplanned strategy that is formulated in response to an
unexpected circumstance. A realized strategy is the strategy that an organization follows over time. Realized strategies include a firm's
intended strategy and deliberate strategy if the company has altered but not completely changed the intended strategy in the face of
dynamic conditions. Realized strategies may also include an emergent strategy if an unanticipated and completely new opportunity has
arisen and the firm has been nimble and quick enough to capitalized on it by formulating an emergent strategy. An unrealized strategy
is an abandoned part of the intended strategy.

1.7 Why Strategic Management Is Important

As you have learned, strategic management is a dynamic and ongoing process consisting of strategic analysis, strategy formulation,
and strategy implementation. Strategic management is a critical business activity.

Strategy addresses the fundamental business question of how to create and sustain a competitive advantage by positioning a firm
for superior performance relative to its competitors. This is a question all firms must ask throughout each step of the strategic man-
agement process.

Strategic leaders are responsible for ensuring their company has the human talent and organizational capacity to carry out robust
and dynamic strategic management. They have the power to direct actions to ensure a sound, evidence-based strategy is formu-
lated and implemented throughout all levels of the firm and in all areas of strategy. Strategic leadership is essential to successful
strategic management.
22 | 1. INTRODUCTION TO STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT
Strategic management and strategic leadership are central to whether a company survives, grows, is successful, adapts to changing
conditions, and becomes a market leader. Business success rests on strategy and its successful management and leadership.

1.8 The History of Strategic Management

When studying any field of study, it is important to understand its history and the pivotal events that shaped it. Strategy is a part
of human history. Prior to written histories, indigenous nations employed strategy to form complex alliances. For example, before
European contact in the Americas, many indigenous nations formed elaborate federations and complex trade agreements (Black-
hawk, 2023).
Strategy appears in historical, religious, and literary texts:

  · Published in the late spring and autumn period, which corresponds to approximately the fifth century BC, Sun Tzu's The Art of
      War is an ancient Chinese treatise on military strategy that has influenced both Eastern and Western military strategy. Among
      its advice, is "to win without fighting is the best."

  · In the Latin poem the Aeneid (written between 29 and 19 BC), Virgil recounts the story of the Trojan Horse. After an unsuccessful
      ten-year siege of Troy, the Greeks build a large wooden horse that hides a military force; they station it outside Troy and then
      pretend to sail away. Intrigued, the Trojans roll the wooden horse into their city and unknowingly roll their enemy inside along
      with it.

  · The Prince is a political treatise written by Florentine Niccolò di Bernardo dei Machiavelli (1469-1527). It contains the famous
      maxim "the ends justify the means."

Military strategy is also studied across all nations. A few examples include Napoleon's military defeat at Waterloo in 1851, which
illustrates how spreading resources too thinly can lead to defeat. In the American Civil War (1861-1865), although the Confederacy is
credited with having better generals, the Union won. This is assessed to be due in part because the Union possessed better resources
and employed them more successfully. Many battles of World War II (1939-1945) are still studied today. Among them is the D-Day
invasion that aimed to liberate Europe from Nazi control. This is credited as bringing together many important factors for strategic
success, including excellent intelligence, superior planning, and detailed preparation.
Strategic management as a field of study emerged over the last century, with several pivotal events focusing its formation.
                                                                                                    1. INTRODUCTION TO STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT | 23

· In 1911, Frederick W. Taylor publishedThe Principles of Scientific Management, which advocated "one best way" of performing
   important tasks. Although the merits of "one best way," are largely disputed today, Taylor's emphasis on maximizing organiza-
   tional performance became the core focus of strategic management as the field developed.

· Building on ideas about efficiency from Taylor and others, Henry Ford pioneered assembly lines for creating automobiles. Low-
   ering costs dramatically allowed a once luxury item to become much more affordable.

· In 1959, the Ford Foundation widely circulated a report that recommended all business schools offer a capstone course to inte-
   grate knowledge across different business fields. The aim was to teach students to address complex business problems by
   emphasizing critical thinking skills. This propelled strategic management to the foreground of business education.

· In 1962, Sam Walton opened the first Walmart in Rogers, Arkansas. A decade later, Walmart was the largest company in the
   world. Strategic management needed to adapt to address companies like Walmart.

· In 1980, the Strategic Management Journal was created, which facilitates research and focuses a community of scholars.
· Also in 1980, Harvard professor Michael Porter published Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competi­

   tors. Porter is a significant thought leader in strategic management.
· In 1995, Jeff Bezos launched Amazon, changing the landscape of shopping to online. Strategic management needed to adapt

   to address the rise of companies like Amazon.
· In the early 2000s, a series of companies such as the Enron Corporation, WorldCom, Tyco, Qwest, and Global Crossing brought

   ethics to the foreground of business as executives were imprisoned, investors lost money, and jobs were lost.
· In 2005 Thomas L. Friedman published The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century, which argues that firms in

   developed countries are losing the advantage they had taken for granted. One implication is that these firms will need to
   improve their strategies if they are to remain successful. This brought the implications of multinational competition to the
   foreground for strategic management.
· Although the causes of climate change have been present since nineteenth century, it was not until 1938 that amateur scientist
   Guy Callendar collected records from 147 weather stations across the world, and doing all his calculations by hand, discovered
   that global temperatures had risen 0.3°C over the previous fifty years. He argued that carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from
   industry were responsible for global warming. In 1967, researchers Syukuro Manabe and Richard Wetherald produced the first
   accurate computer model of Earth's climate. However, it was not until 2006, when former U.S. Vice President Al Gore published
   An inconvenient Truth, that climate change became a household phrase in the U.S. Climate change is a major force behind the
   rise of sustainability as an essential business focus. Strategic management needed to adjust to this change.
· In 2018, Apple became the first company to be worth $1 trillion.
· Leading technology company NVIDIA is well-known for its graphics processing units (GPUs). Today, NVIDIA continues to inno-
   vate through technology, integrating deep learning, artificial intelligence (AI), and gaming. Through its advancements in AI
   and gaming, the corporation has been important in bringing technology to the center of social media. As one of the biggest
   firms by market capitalization, NVIDIA has sometimes out-performed Apple throughout the years, showing its growing sig-
   nificance in the technology sector, particularly with the rise of AI-driven technologies. Strategic management needed to adapt
   to address companies like Apple and NVIDIA. It also needed to integrate the megatrend of technology as a primary focus.

  Key Takeaways

  When studying any field of study, it is important to understand its history and the pivotal events that shaped it. Strategy is a part of
  human history. Prior to written histories, indigenous nations employed strategy to form complex alliances. Strategy appears in historical,
  religious, and literary texts. Strategic management as a field of study has evolved and matured over the last century.

1.9 Contemporary Critique of Strategic Management

In addition to understanding a field of study's history, it is also valuable to understand its criticisms. Strategic management is a
dynamic and evolving field of practice. Along with the pivotal events presented in section 1.8, criticism of strategic management
influences the direction in which the field continues to grow.

Criticism about strategic management as a field of study captures the ways in which scholars and business leaders think critically
about the subject and process of managing strategy. Since strategic management is a field that requires critical thinking, scholars
and business leaders embrace criticism as an opportunity to thoughtfully consider it and respond so that the field continuously
improves.

Strategic management is a resource-intensive process. Some strategic leaders are concerned about the time and cost to focus on
a thorough strategic management process. Firm executives can be skeptical whether strategic management achieves its intended
outcome of formulating and implementing evidence-based strategies that are grounded in analysis. A few critics of strategic man-
agement suggest that it constrains firms from adapting rapidly to changing circumstances.

To be open to criticism is not to suggest that the value of strategic management is under question. The value of strategic manage-
ment is well established. To be open to criticism reflects a confidence in the value of strategic management and a commitment to
continuously improving it. Continuous assessment and improvement is not only central to strategic management; it is a primary
focus of all areas of business practice and functional expertise, including accounting and information systems, business information
technology and cybersecurity, finance, insurance and business law, hospitality and tourism management, human resource man-
agement, business management, management consulting and analytics, entrepreneurship, innovation and technology manage-
ment, marketing, and real estate.

1.10 Why Strategic Management Is Valuable in All Career Settings and at All
Career Stages

In section 1.9, you learned the impor-
tance of strategic management to
business. It is also important to con-
sider the ways in which strategic
management is valuable to you. In
doing so, we consider different career
paths as well as varying career stages.

Students studying business usually       Figure 1.7: Amount of time spent on strategy in your first position as a functional area expert for a large

26 | 1. INTRODUCTION TO STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT
management, human resource management, business management, management consulting and analytics, entrepreneurship,
innovation and technology management, marketing, or real estate.
Many business graduates join large companies with formalized structures for strategic management. Although new business grad-
uates in large companies usually focus on their functional areas of expertise early in their careers, there are multiple reasons that
functional area experts need to understand strategic management when entering their first professional positions. In these roles,
you immediately implement functional-level strategies, which address all areas of strategy, including corporate-level strategies and
business-level strategies. You may also implement innovation strategies, sustainability and ethics strategies, technology strategies,
and possibly multinational strategies. A thorough knowledge of each is essential to being successful as a functional expert in a
functional business unit. Analysis in strategic management considers data at all levels of a company, so a functional expert such as
yourself may be asked to participate in strategic management analysis as it relates to your functional area of expertise. When this
opportunity arises, it is wise to demonstrate competence in strategic management, as this knowledge is needed even more in future
positions.
As your career progresses, the amount of time spent focusing on strategic analysis, strategy formulation, and strategy implemen-
tation increases. Therefore, it is important to demonstrate competence with strategic management early, placing you on the com-
pany's radar for future promotions. To secure future positions, it is essential to demonstrate in your current position the strategic
management ability needed for the next.

Figure 1.8: Amount of time spent on strategy as your career progresses in a large company

Some business graduates join smaller companies. In smaller firms, strategic management may be managed through more informal
structures. In a smaller organization, there is an even greater chance that skills in strategic management are needed earlier in your
career.
Other business graduates enter internal or external consulting roles that require competence with strategic management as a pri-
mary focus. Even if the consultation is not directly related to strategic management, consultants make presentations to business
managers responsible for strategic management and organizational executives responsible for strategic leadership. It is essential
to be fluent in strategic management to be competent in consulting roles.
Some business graduates already are or will become entrepreneurs. As an entrepreneur, you must understand strategic manage-
ment because you may need to lead every stage of strategic management to ensure your startup is successful. It is necessary to cre-
ate a competitive advantage immediately and keep that in focus as your entrepreneurial enterprise grows.
                                                                                                       1. INTRODUCTION TO STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT | 27
Of course, your career path may include several or all of these options. You may begin your career with a large company, then
become a consultant, and then start your own business. Understanding how strategic management applies to you and your career
is important to your success in any area of business throughout your career. Strategic management is not something someone else
does. It will be your immediate focus in any business career.

       Application
            · You have now considered your career plans from the point of view of the AFI framework and through the lens of Mintzberg
                and Waters's model. Now that you understand why strategic management is valuable to you in any career setting and at all
                stages of your career, consider:
                     How specifically will you use your strategic management knowledge and skills in your first professional position after
                        graduation?

     Key Takeaways

     As a new business graduate entering your first professional position at a large company, you need to understand strategic management
     because you will immediately implement functional-level strategies that reflect corporate-level strategy, business-level strategy, and
     strategies that are embedded into business-level strategy, such as innovation, sustainability and ethics, technology, and possibly multi-
     national strategies; you may be asked to participate in strategic management analysis as it relates to your functional area of expertise;
     and it is wise to demonstrate competence in strategic management because this knowledge is needed in future positions. As your career
     progresses in a large company, the focus on strategic management increases. If you graduate and join a smaller company where strategic
     management is managed through more informal structure, you are likely to participate in more of the strategic management process
     immediately. Internal or external consultants require strategic management competence as the primary focus of your role. Entrepre-
     neurial business graduates need to understand strategic management to ensure your startup is successful.

1.11 Conclusion

In this introduction to strategic management, you learned how a few essential terms are used in the book, including organization,
business, company, firm, industry, strategic management concepts and theories, and analytical frameworks and tools. You considered
what strategic management is and reviewed the analysis, formulation, implementation (AFI) framework, which guides the book.
You learned an alternative and complementary approach to the AFI framework's planned and methodical approach, involving
intended, deliberate, emergent, realized, and unrealized strategies. You considered why strategic management is important to
businesses. You reviewed the history of strategic management and the contemporary critique of the field. Finally, you learned how
strategic management is valuable to you in all career settings and at all career stages. Now that you have learned what strategic
management is, the next chapter introduces you to conducting a case analysis.

2. INTRODUCTION TO CASE ANALYSIS

     Learning Objectives

     After you have engaged with the concepts in this chapter, you will understand and be able to apply the following key case analysis con-
     cepts:

         1. How the terms case, case analysis, data, analysis, interpretation, evaluation, Iine of sight, and congruence are used in the textbook
        2. Case analysis process
         3. Case analysis steps
        4. Abbreviated case analysis steps

2.1 Introduction

In the previous chapter, you were introduced to strategic management as an area of practice in businesses and as a field of study.
This chapter introduces you to case analysis. After an explanation of how some essential terms are used in the book, you then learn
what is involved in conducting a case analysis--both full and abbreviated versions.

2.2 Case and Case Analysis

First, it is important to understand how the terms case and case analysis are used in the textbook.

Case

Imagine you are asked to read a case about a real company and that case contains real information about what the firm has faced.
This may be a case from a well-known publisher, such as a Harvard Business case, or it could be an open-source case (free to you).
You may even be asked to read a case about a hypothetical company that uses realistic but hypothetical data about the business.
Hypothetical cases are sometimes used to illustrate especially sensitive areas of business that a real company would hesitate to dis-
close. Both real and hypothetical cases are written cases, which means they can cover only a limited timeframe. Some of the case
data may be written as a narrative about the company, and other data may be presented as quantitative or qualitative data in tables,
charts, and graphs, for example. Perhaps you have read cases like these during your business education so far.
Therefore, in the context of strategic management, cases are written scenarios about companies, such as Harvard Business cases or
open-source cases, that present real business issues faced by firms. Sometimes they contain real facts about real companies, while
other times, cases are written scenarios about a hypothetical company that uses realistic but hypothetical data.
Whether about real or hypothetical companies, cases are usually limited in the timeframe they cover. Cases often focus on a narrow
range of company information to support students seeking in-depth understanding of an area of strategic management.
32 | 2. INTRODUCTION TO CASE ANALYSIS

Case Analysis

Engaging in experiential learning by applying strategic management concepts and theories and analytical frameworks and tools to
cases is an excellent way for you to learn "by doing." Early in learning about strategic management, you may apply one concept and
one analytical framework to a case. For example, you may apply what you learn about a firm's external environment using a PESTEL
framework (which you will learn more about in Chapter 4) to information about a real company. As your learning progresses, you
may be asked to apply more of what you know about strategic management using multiple analytical frameworks.

Therefore, in strategic management, case analysis is a broad term used to encompass multiple possible approaches to conducting a
strategic management review of a company. A case analysis is a thorough and methodical analysis, interpretation, and evaluation
of a case or company.

There are two important things to notice about the term case analysis. The first is the use of the word case. As you have just seen,
a case is a written scenario about a real or hypothetical company. In case analysis, a case can be a written scenario about a real or
hypothetical company. If the case uses current real data about a real company, you can obtain this data in one of two ways. You can
conduct research about a real company in the form of a desk review, meaning you do not meet with the leaders of the company.
You gather data from sources to conduct a case analysis in this instance. The other option would be to provide consulting services to
a real company, both collecting data about the company and using data the leaders of a company provide you to conduct the case
analysis.

The second important thing to notice about case analysis is the use of the word analysis. Though the term case analysis only mentions
analysis, the process of analysis includes three steps: analysis, interpretation, and evaluation. Analysis, interpretation, and evalua-
tion are reviewed in detail below.

You can see that case analysis is an umbrella term that means applying strategic management concepts and theories and analytical
frameworks and tools to analyze, interpret, and evaluate company information provided in a written scenario that uses real or hypo-
thetical data about a company; case analysis can also be carried out in researching a company or working directly with a company
through a consultancy project.

Case analysis is used as a pedagogical tool in strategic management because it requires you to step into the shoes of strategic lead-
ers and managers and see the company from their perspective. By conducting case analysis, you strategically analyze a firm's orga-
nizational performance and its external and internal environments. Then, by analyzing strategies, you learn how strategic leaders
and managers formulate strategy. Finally, you consider strategy implementation by using the tools of strategic leaders and man-
agers to assess the success of implemented strategies.

     Key Takeaways

     Cases are written scenarios about companies that present real business issues that real firms face. Cases may also focus on a hypothetical
     company that uses realistic but hypothetical data about the organization. Case analysis is an umbrella term that means applying strategic
     management concepts, and analytical tools to analyze, interpret, and evaluate company information that is provided through a written
     scenario that uses real or hypothetical data about a company, or researching a company; it's also part of researching a company or work-
     ing directly with a company through a consultancy project.

2.3 Data, Analysis, Interpretation, and Evaluation

When conducting a case analysis, it is important to consider the difference between data, analysis, interpretation, and evaluation
and how they relate. Conducting a case analysis follows a structured process that involves analyzing data, interpreting the analysis,
evaluating the analysis and interpretation, and ensuring line of sight and congruence.

The purpose of the following section is to introduce you to these ideas so they can serve as a reference for you as you continue your
learning throughout the book. Subsequent chapters introduce analysis instruments that support you in conducting case analysis
using many of the key strategic management analytical frameworks and tools. These analysis instruments rely on a robust applica-
tion of the concepts of data, analysis, interpretation, evaluation, line of sight, and congruence.

Dictionary definitions of analysis, interpretation, and evaluation are narrow, and most methodological scholarship either uses these
terms without explicit definitions or offers definitions that are ambiguous, overlapping, technical, or related to specific contexts.
There is also little agreement between sources about the distinctions of these processes. Therefore, a different approach is needed
to understand these ideas in the context of strategic management.

For the purposes of this textbook, these ideas are approached from a pragmatic and applied perspective, that considers how they
support case analysis. They are informed by the experience of organizational executives who focus on strategic analysis, strategy
formulation, and strategy implementation. They are also vetted by internal and external strategic management consultants to
organizational leaders.

Each of these ideas--data, analysis, interpretation, and evaluation--is considered in turn to add conceptual clarity to the process
of conducting a thorough case analysis. In practice, the distinctions between each idea may be less delineated, combining with and
informing each other.

The first important term is data.

Data

Data is the information in the case being reviewed, the company being researched, or the company receiving consulting services.
For example, data may include information such as whether a company is a domestic or multinational firm, what industry, market,
and market segments in which the business operates, whose its major competitors are, and whether the company follows a central-
ized or decentralized management style, to name just a few.

Analysis

Analysis is the process and result of examining all the data available for the firm and identifying and classifying all the data for
each category in a strategic management tool. Many cases contain a lot of data, and your task when conducting a case analysis is to
sift through a large volume of data to determine which of the data is important and which data is to be placed into which strategic
management tool. This requires a thorough understanding of the case and the strategic management framework you are applying.

For example, the PESTEL framework is one of the strategic management frameworks you use to analyze a company's external envi-
ronment. The first and broadest level of a firm's external environment is the general environment, which consists of the societal
events and trends that impact all firms in an industry including political, economic, sociocultural, technological, environmental,
and legal factors. You will learn about a firm's external environment and how to analyze it in Chapter 4. Imagine that you analyze
a firm's external environment and identify a growing consumer preference for healthier food options that impacts the sales of the
company's product. You also notice that phone app sales are increasing among customers over thirty-five. You then place both of
34 | 2. INTRODUCTION TO CASE ANALYSIS
these observations in a PESTEL strategic management tool, identifying the growing consumer preference for healthier food options
as a sociocultural factor and phone app sales increasing among customers over thirty-five as a technological factor.
To conduct an analysis of the data, follow these steps:
Step 1

  · Methodically and thoroughly examine all the data available for the firm.
Step 2

  · Identify all the data about the firm that the strategic management framework addresses.
  · Question to ask: What information about the company relates to this strategic management framework?
Step 3
  · Cassify all the data about the company for each category in the strategic management tool.
  · Question to ask: Where in the strategic management tool does this information best fit?
Step 4
  · Complete the analysis section of a strategic management instrument.
Analyzing data is different than placing data from the company in the strategic management instrument. Analysis requires critical
thinking and a thorough knowledge of the company that can only come from reading the case or company research multiple times.

Figure 2.1: Analyze the data

So far, analyzing the data in the case has produced a large quantity of information by examining, identifying, and classifying all the
data about the company. After analyzing an aspect of a firm using a strategic management framework (such as analyzing the gen-
eral external environment using the PESTEL tool), you can narrow the focus by considering why the situation is occurring and its
meaning for the company. Interpretation and evaluation begin to narrow the focus.

Interpretation

Once you have analyzed the data, it is possible to interpret the analysis.
Once you have analyzed the case, you now review your analysis. Interpretation is the process and result of examining the analysis
to identify and explain relationships in the analysis as well as underlying root causes of the situation.
                                                                                                                     2. INTRODUCTION TO CASE ANALYSIS | 35
For example, when you review your analysis, you notice that food and drink sales are stronger on phone apps than those placed in
the drive-through. When you examine the analysis in more detail, you notice that phone app sales are increasing among customers
over thirty-five. When you consider this analysis along with a growing consumer preference for healthier food options, you may see
a correlation between customers preferring healthier food that they can purchase on an app.
You should also consider which aspects of your analysis relate to each other and in what ways. When you consider the root causes of
the increase in phone app usage in customers over thirty-five, you may find the underlying cause of this trend is that, for those over
thirty-five, adoption of phone apps to order food requires a change in behavior, whereas those under thirty-five have been using
phone apps for most purchases throughout their buying years. Changes in behavior always take more time.
Interpretation is not found in the case or company research. Interpretation is the process and result of applying critical thinking to
the analysis conducted so far.
Interpret the analysis of the data by following these steps:
Step 1

  · Examine the analysis.

Step 2

  · Identify and explain whether, how, and in what ways the information in the analysis is related.
  · Questions to ask:

         How does one element of the analysis in the strategic management tool relate to another element of the analysis in the
            tool?

         How does the analysis in each section of the strategic management framework relate to each other?
         What elements of the analysis in the strategic management tool were expected?
         What elements of the analysis in the strategic management tool were unexpected?
         Are there incongruencies between the elements of the analysis in the strategic management tool?

Step 3

  · Identify and explain underlying root cause(s) of the situation.
  · Question to ask: What may be causing the information identified in the analysis?

Step 4

  · Complete the interpretation section of a strategic management instrument.

Figure 2.2: Interpret the analysis
36 | 2. INTRODUCTION TO CASE ANALYSIS

Interpretation requires discernment and judgment. Answer the questions and complete the steps above that are relevant to the
firm and the strategic management tool. It is not realistic or productive to answer every question and complete every step for each
element of your analysis. The goal of interpretation is to begin to narrow the focus of your analysis of all the data on the company to
that which is most important.

Evaluation

Once you have interpreted the analysis, the next step is to evaluate the information produced from the analysis and interpretation.
Evaluation continues to narrow the focus of your analysis.

Evaluation is the process and result of examining the analysis and interpretation to identify and explain the meaning of the infor-
mation to the company by considering its impact, relevance, and importance to the company and by identifying the company's cur-
rent, potential, or needed assets, organizational capacity, and managerial ability that may support or mitigate the areas of highest
impact, relevance, and importance for the firm.

In considering the interpretation you have conducted so far, you decide that because your primary target market segment is those
18-25 years old, the trend of increased usage of phone apps in those over thirty-five is likely to impact the business less, making the
trend less relevant and important to this company. You also determine that knowing that the drive-through is used less frequently
for ordering is important for the company because up to now it has made location decisions based on the need for a drive-though.
This may be relevant and important to the company, potentially having a significant impact on its future expansion decisions. To
consider a change in expansion strategy, the organization needs resources in marketing research, capitol assessment, and technol-
ogy development (including cybersecurity), to name just a few.

Like interpretation, evaluation is not found in the case or company research. Evaluation is the process and result of applying critical
thinking to the analysis and interpretation conducted so far.

Follow these steps to evaluate the analysis and interpretation:

Step 1

  · Examine the analysis and interpretation.

Step 2

  · Identify and explain whether, how, and in what ways the information in the analysis and interpretation impacts the company.
  · Questions to ask:

         How does each element of the analysis and interpretation in the strategic management tool impact the company?
         From a holistic point of view, looking across all the information in the analysis and interpretation in the strategic man-

            agement tool, how does this information impact the company?

Step 3

  · Identify and explain whether, how, and in what ways the information in the analysis and interpretation is relevant to the com-
      pany.

  · Questions to ask:
         How is each element of the analysis and interpretation in the strategic management tool relevant to the company?
         From a holistic point of view, looking across all the information from the analysis and interpretation in the strategic man-
            agement tool, how is this information relevant to the company?
                                                                         2. INTRODUCTION TO CASE ANALYSIS | 37

Step 4

· Determine how important the information is to the firm.
· Action to take (if helpful): Rank the information from the analysis and interpretation according to strength of importance, such

   as strong, moderate, or weak.

Step 5

· Identify the company's current, potential, or needed assets, organizational capacity, and managerial ability that may support

   or mitigate the areas of highest impact, relevance, and importance for the firm.

· Questions to ask:
      What are the company's current, potential, or needed assets, that may support or mitigate the areas of highest impact,

         relevance, and importance for the firm?
      What is the company's organizational capacity that may support or mitigate the areas of highest impact, relevance, and

         importance for the firm?
      What managerial ability does the company possess that may support or mitigate the areas of highest impact, relevance,

         and importance for the firm?

Step 6

· Complete the evaluation section of a strategic management instrument.

Figure 2.3: Evaluate the analysis and interpretation

Like interpretation, evaluation requires discernment and judgment. Answer the questions and complete the steps that are relevant
to the firm and the strategic management tool. The goal of evaluation is to continue to narrow the focus of your analysis of all the
data on the company to that which is most important.

       Application
            · Think about one of the times you enjoyed a project in your business education where you analyzed, interpreted, and evalu-
                ated data.
                     Can you identify some of the steps above in that project?
                     What was different in that project compared to the steps above?

     Key Takeaways

     Data is the information in the case being reviewed, the company being researched, or the company receiving consulting services. Analy-
     sis is the process and result of examining all the data available for the firm and identifying and classifying all the data for each category
     in a strategic management tool. Interpretation is the process and result of examining the analysis to identify and explain relationships
     in the analysis and underlying root causes of the situation. Interpretation is not found in the case or company research. Evaluation is the
     process and result of examining the analysis and interpretation to identify and explain the meaning of the information to the company
     by considering its impact, relevance, and importance to the company and by identifying the company's current, potential, or needed
     assets, organizational capacity, and managerial ability that may support or mitigate the areas of highest impact, relevance, and impor-
     tance.

2.4 Line of Sight and Congruence

Strategic analysis requires that steps in the process have a direct and clear line of sight and strong congruence. The ideas of line of
sight and congruence are similar yet distinct.
When thinking about analysis, interpretation, and evaluation through the lens of strategic analysis, confirm line of sight and con-
gruence from three perspectives.

 1. Within a strategic management tool, from analysis to interpretation to evaluation
 2. Among strategic management frameworks
 3. Across the entire case analysis

Line of Sight

Line of sight means there is a direct, unobstructed line between an observer and the object being observed. Imagine you are attend-
ing a match of your favorite women's tennis team, perhaps your university's team. Your seat is slightly raised from the seats in front
of you, giving you an unobstructed view of your team winning. You have a clear and direct line of sight to players and the game. In
strategic analysis, and in business generally, line of sight is used metaphorically to refer to a direct and clear logic connecting two or
more concepts or ideas. In strategic analysis, you identify and state specifically what that line of sight is.
                                                                                                                     2. INTRODUCTION TO CASE ANALYSIS | 39

Investigate the questions below to identify and explain a direct and clear logic connecting two or more concepts or ideas.

  · Is there a direct and clear logic connecting two or more ideas within an element of a strategic management tool during analy-
      sis, interpretation, or evaluation?
         For example, when you consider a firm's external environment, you can use a PESTEL framework as a tool, which consid-
            ers sociocultural factors, among others. Imagine you identify two sociocultural factors in your PESTEL analysis. One is a
            growing consumer preference for healthier food options and another is a shift in demographics, with more Muslims and
            Hindus living in the area. Ask yourself if there is a connection here. Identifying a line of sight between these two socio-
            cultural factors may lead you to a connection between not only healthier food options but also anticipating a growing
            demand for halal, vegan, and vegetarian menu items.

  · Is there a direct and clear logic connecting two or more ideas between elements of a strategic management tool?
         For example, consider that you identify in your PESTEL analysis a shift in demographics with more Muslims and Hindus
            living in the area as a sociocultural factor and stronger food and drink sales on phone apps than those placed in the drive-
            through as a technological factor. Can you see a relationship between these? By identifying a line of sight between the
            sociocultural and technological factors, you may identify the need not only to offer more non-alcoholic drinks but also to
            show more images on your phone app for mango lassis, which may appeal to a broad audience.

  · Is there a direct and clear logic connecting two or more concepts or ideas among strategic management frameworks?
         For example, you use a PESTEL framework to analyze a firm's external environment and a VRIO framework for its internal
            environment (more on each of these in later chapters). Imagine that in your internal analysis of the business, you identify
            partnerships with organic and regenerative suppliers as a strategic resource. What lines of sight can you trace between
            your internal and external analyses? Perhaps you see a connection between organic and regenerative suppliers and a
            growing consumer preference for healthier food options. You recognize that here may not necessarily be a 100 percent
            overlap in these two elements of your analysis. After all, classic Oreos are vegan. You further understand that many con-
            sumers who are interested in healthier food seek out organic and regenerative food options. Drawing this line of sight
            across different strategic management frameworks may support the business in considering foregrounding its organic
            and regenerative products in its marketing, expanding its organic and regenerative options, or even acquiring a supplier.

  · Is there a direct and clear logic connecting two or more concepts or ideas across the entire case analysis?
         When you finish your entire case analysis, you consider all of your analysis, interpretation, and evaluation, looking for as
            many lines of sight as possible, just as you searched within and among strategic management tools. This time, you con-
            sider the whole case analysis. The more connections and lines of sight you identify, the more robust your case analysis.

Figure 2.4: Confirm line of sight

Congruence

The concept of congruence also is important to case analysis.

Congruence means there is a one-to-one relationship or agreement between two or more things. There is harmony or compatibility
between two things that are congruent. The two things do not necessarily have to be identical and in most cases are not exactly
alike. Imagine you and your friend share similar taste is music. You both love a particular genre and like many of the same songs.
However, you also dislike some of the songs your friend likes. Because your taste is compatible and you like more of the same songs
as your friend than you dislike, your taste in music is congruent. In case analysis, congruence means there is a one-to-one agreement
40 | 2. INTRODUCTION TO CASE ANALYSIS

or reconciliation between steps in the case analysis process or across an entire case analysis. All the main elements are compatible.
Congruence is more relevant for some phases of case analysis.

Ensure there is robust congruence by considering the following steps.

Step 1

  · Identify and explain how everything that is relevant in one aspect of the case analysis is also included in another aspect of the
      case analysis.

  · Questions to ask:
         Among specific steps in the case analysis, is everything that is relevant in one step of the case analysis also included in
            another step of the case analysis?
               For example, as you learn in section 2.6, the case analysis process includes multiple steps such as analyze a firm's
                  organizational performance, external environment, and internal environment. Then you synthesize this analysis by
                  conducting a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis. It is important that all essential
                  details that are relevant from the analysis of the firm's organizational performance, external environment, and
                  internal environment are also present in the SWOT analysis.
         Across the entire case analysis, is everything that is relevant in one step of the case analysis also included in another step
            of the case analysis?
               For example, as you also learn in section 2.6, the case analysis process consists of thirteen steps. Now ensure every-
                  thing that is relevant in one step in the case analysis process is carried through and is present in all the steps in the
                  entire case analysis. Step one focuses on ensuring all essential details are included among steps in the case analysis
                  and across the entire case analysis.

Step 2

  · Identify and explain how nothing that is relevant in one aspect of the case analysis is absent from another aspect of the case
      analysis.

  · Prompts to consider:
         Among specific steps in the case analysis, ensure nothing relevant in one step of the case analysis is absent from another
            step of the case analysis.
               For example, ensure nothing that is relevant from the analysis of a firm's organizational performance, external envi-
                  ronment, and the internal environment is omitted in the SWOT analysis.
         Across the entire case analysis, ensure nothing relevant in one step of the case analysis is absent from another step of the
            case.
               For example, now ensure nothing that is relevant in one step in the case analysis is omitted in another step in the
                  case analysis. Review the entire case analysis to confirm each essential detail is carried through across all the steps
                  in the entire case analysis process. Step two focuses on confirming that no essential details are omitted among steps
                  in the case analysis and across the entire case analysis. As you conduct case analyses, what information is relevant
                  to be included in each step of the case analysis and what information in important to be present across the entire
                  case analysis will become clear.

You ensure congruence, which is a one-to-one reconciliation among and across all steps in the case analysis process, by making sure
everything that is essential is included and nothing essential is omitted among and across all steps in the case analysis.
                                                                                                                     2. INTRODUCTION TO CASE ANALYSIS | 41

Figure 2.5: Confirm congruence

As you have just learned, line of sight and congruence are similar and distinct. You often assess both together in case analysis, and
the difference can be a matter of emphasis. Line of sight focuses primarily on a direct and clear logic between ideas, and congru-
ence focuses primarily on agreement, compatibility, and harmony between ideas. As you learn in section 2.6, the final step in the
case analysis process is presenting the case analysis. This is not a description or summary of all the preceding steps. This is a rich
and robust narrative that presents the analysis, conclusions, and suggestions for future actions. The presentation needs to be log-
ical and have a clear line of sight between all aspects of the case analysis. This ensures a rational, cohesive presentation. Ensuring
congruence in the case analysis means the conclusions and recommendations are based on the analysis and the presentation does
not suddenly introduce new and unexpected information that has not been previously supported by the analysis. It also ensures no
essential information is omitted. Often in case analysis, when line of sight is strong, congruence is also robust, but this is not always
the case. It is possible that either line of sight or congruence may be strong and the other weak. That is why it is important to under-
stand how these ideas are related and different.
Now that you understand line of sight and congruence and have a clear conception of data, analysis, interpretation, evaluation, and
how they relate, it is now possible to conduct case analysis.

     Key Takeaways

     Line of sight means there is a direct and clear logic connecting two or more concepts or ideas. Congruence means there is a one-to-one
     relationship between two or more things, with agreement, compatibility, and harmony between ideas. In case analysis, it means there
     is a one-to-one reconciliation between steps in the case analysis process or across an entire strategic analysis.

2.5 Case Analysis Process

Chapter 1 introduced you to the subject of strategic management. In this chapter, you learn how to apply strategic management
concepts, and analytical frameworks in conducting a case analysis.
Business is fundamentally a profession of doing, of action. To be successful, that action needs to be grounded in knowledge and
evidenced-based decisions. To be industry leading, it needs to reflect inspiration, creativity, and insight.
Business is full of multiple dynamic tensions, and as an area of business, strategic management reflects many of these tensions.
Strategic management embodies tensions between planning methodically and capitalizing on unexpected opportunities; between
making decisions based on evidence and analytics or based on creativity and insight; between focusing on important details and
seeing the bigger picture.
42 | 2. INTRODUCTION TO CASE ANALYSIS
When conducting a case analysis, you use all of your capabilities, some of which are your preferred ways of operating and some that
may challenge you. For example, though a successful career and life require the ability to consider both minute details and the big
picture, most will naturally prefer one or the other, perhaps showing more skill with one.

In light of this potential difference in skills across expertise, strategic management and its application through case analysis is most
often the focus of diverse and cross-functional teams. Such a team offers the advantage of a diverse range of topic expertise, such
as accounting, business information technology and cybersecurity, finance, insurance and business law, human resource manage-
ment, and marketing. It also utilizes a diverse range of talents and capabilities, ensuring, for example, that the team can focus on
details and the big picture.

Case analysis starts with the objective data mining of company data and becomes more subjective as the process progresses
through analysis, interpretation, and evaluation. A structured case analysis process incorporates both a micro, detail-oriented focus
and a macro, big-picture orientation that considers the entire situation facing a firm.

Case analysis is central to strategic management. Conducting a case analysis follows a structured process. This requires a methodi-
cal approach that relies on a solid cross-functional understanding of business, thorough knowledge of the company, critical think-
ing, insight, judgment, intuition, and creativity.

First consider all the data in a company, and then gradually narrow the focus. Thoroughly analyze all the data available about the
firm. Interpret and evaluate the information that is relevant and useful.

Because the ideas and process build upon each other, the early stages of conducting a case analysis require you ti sequentially
analyze the data, interpret the analysis, and evaluate the information produced so far through analysis and interpretation. As the
review of a firm progresses, return to previous stages and consider the other ideas as well.

2.6 Case Analysis Steps

Utilize the following process to conduct a case analysis that follows a structured process. There are multiple steps, and conducting a
case analysis in order is important. The overview presented here can be used as a reference as you conduct case analyses throughout

2.7 Abbreviated Case Analysis Steps

When learning case analysis, students often conduct an abbreviated case analysis for their first case analysis. An abbreviated case
analysis differs from the longer and more thorough case analysis detailed in section 2.6 by omitting the following steps: (5) As
appropriate to the case, analyze strategies: corporate-level, business-level, innovation, sustainability and ethics, technology, and
multinational strategies; (9) Evaluate strategic alternatives; and (11) Design implementation plan.

2.8 Conclusion

Cases are written scenarios about companies that present real business issues that real firms face. Sometimes they contain reals
facts about real cases. Other times, cases are about a hypothetical company, using realistic but hypothetical data about the organi-
zation. Case analysis is an umbrella term that means applying strategic management concepts and analytical frameworks and tools
to analyze, interpret, and evaluate company information that is provided through a written scenario; this information can also come
from researching a company or working directly with a company through a consultancy project.

Conducting a case analysis follows a structured process that involves analyzing data, interpreting the analysis, evaluating the analy-
sis and interpretation, and ensuring line of sight and congruence. Analysis is the process and result of examining all the data avail-
able for the firm and identifying and classifying all the data for each category in a strategic management tool. Interpretation is the
process and result of examining the analysis to identify and explain relationships in the analysis and underlying root causes of the
situation. Evaluation is the process and result of examining the analysis and interpretation to identify and explain the meaning of
the information to the company by considering its impact, relevance, and importance to the company and by identifying the com-
pany's current, potential, or needed assets, organizational capacity, and managerial ability that may support or mitigate the areas of
highest impact, relevance, and importance for the firm. Line of sight means there is a direct and clear logic connecting two or more
concepts or ideas. Congruence means there is a one-to-one relationship between two or more things. When learning case analysis,
students may conduct an abbreviated case analysis as their first case analysis, removing three steps from the full process.

Now that you have learned what strategic management and case analysis are in Part I, you focus on analyzing a firm's organizational
performance and its external and internal environments in Part II.

PART II: ANALYZE ORGANIZATIONAL
PERFORMANCE AND A FIRM'S EXTERNAL AND
INTERNAL ENVIRONMENTS

In Part I, we introduced strategic management and case analysis. Part II continues to follow the AFI framework, expanding on the
case analysis process as you learn how to analyze a firm's organizational performance and its external and internal environments.

In Chapter 3, you consider a company's organizational performance, which provides critical information about a firm's external and
internal environments. You learn what mission, purpose, vision, and values mean to a company, why they are important, and how to
analyze them. This chapter also discusses the difference between performance measures and benchmark measures and the impor-
tance of considering a range of measures to ensure a thorough and robust analysis. Therefore, you learn multiple approaches to
analyze a company's organizational performance, focusing on and analyzing a firm's financial position, market position, and other
relevant quantitative measures. You also learn a model for measuring organizational performance, the balanced scorecard, and
how to analyze it to provide a more comprehensive view of a firm's organizational performance. Finally, you learn what a competi-
tive advantage is and why it is central to strategic management.

In Chapter 4, you learn the strategic management concepts, and analytical tools that support strategically analyzing a firm's exter-
nal environment. A firm's external environment provides a critical outside-in perspective and helps companies to determine attrac-
tive markets in which to operate. A firm's external environment includes those factors, forces, and competitive industry groups
outside the firm's direct control. Part of understanding a firm's external environment is being familiar with the structure of its exter-
nal environment. The chapter teaches you how to analyze the general environment, the industry environment, and the competi-
tive environment. You also learn the role of external analysis in case analysis. The chapter concludes by having you use the PESTEL
analysis instrument to analyze a firm's general environment, the Porter's Five Forces analysis instrument to analyze a firm's industry
environment, and the strategic group analysis instrument to analyze a firm's strategic group.

In Chapter 5, you consider a company's internal environment, which provides a critical inside-out perspective of the firm. A company
has direct control over its internal environment. You learn what resources, capabilities, and core competencies are and how these
relate to creating and maintaining a competitive advantage. Next you learn what a resource-based view of a firm is and why it is
important to organizations. The next topic, the VRIO framework, is derived from such a research-based view. You also learn how
isolating mechanisms, including intellectual property, social complexity, and path dependence, serve as a value-added resource for
organizations. After learning what a firm's value chain is and how it is used to identify strengths and weaknesses of an organiza-
tion, you will be prepared to analyze the internal environment of a firm using a VRIO analysis instrument and a value chain analysis
instrument. Analyzing both the external and internal environments of an organization provides a balanced and 360-degree analy-
sis for the firm.

3.1 Introduction

In Part I, you were introduced to strategic management and case analysis. This chapter continues to follow the AFI framework,
expanding on the case analysis process and teaching you how to analyze a firm's organizational performance.
You now know that strategic management's foundations rest in three questions:

 1. Where are we?
 2. Where are we going?
 3. How are we going to get there?

You also know that these three questions align with the three major stages of strategic management according to the AFI frame-
work: strategic analysis, strategy formulation, and strategy implementation. Strategic analysis addresses the broad question
"Where are we?" Strategy formulation begins to answer "Where are we going?" Strategy implementation addresses the final ques-
tion, "How are we going to get there?"
In this chapter, you learn key organizational performance measures and how to analyze them. You learn what mission, purpose,
vision, and values mean to a company, why they are important, and how to analyze them. This chapter also discusses the difference
between performance measures and benchmark measures and the importance of considering a range of measures to ensure a thor-
ough and robust analysis. Therefore, you learn multiple approaches to analyze a company's organizational performance, focusing
54 | 3. ANALYZE ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE
on and analyzing a firm's financial position, market position, and other relevant quantitative measures. You also learn a model for
measuring organizational performance, the balanced scorecard, and how to analyze it to provide a more comprehensive view of
a firm's organizational performance. Finally, you learn what a competitive advantage is and why it is central to strategic manage-
ment.
This is step one in case analysis.

       1. Analyze a firm's organizational performance.
           a. Use the organizational performance analysis instrument to analyze a firm's organizational performance.
                    i. Analyze, interpret, and evaluate the firm's mission, purpose, vision, values, and goals.
                           a. Evaluate line of sight and congruence among the firm's mission, purpose, vision, and values.
                   ii. Analyze, interpret, and evaluate the firm's financial position.
                  iii. Analyze, interpret, and evaluate the firm's market position.
                   iv. Analyze, interpret, and evaluate additional relevant quantitative measures of organizational performance.
                   v. Analyze, interpret, and evaluate a firm's balanced scorecard.

3.2 Analyze Mission, Purpose, Vision, and Values

Collectively, a firm's mission, purpose, vision, and values set clear organizational direction that guides all firm decisions and strate-
gies. Organizational leaders define these factors for the firm and then express them in statements for their stakeholders. It is impor-
tant that there is a clear line of sight and congruence among these essential organizational elements. If there is no congruence or
weak congruence between any or all of these, the organization will not have clear direction, and this can lead to poor decisions,
weak strategies, and overall poor organizational performance. Of course, strong guiding statements do not guarantee superior firm
performance. A company may have excellent mission, purpose, vision, and values and still make misguided strategic leadership
decisions. However, this does not make it any less important for those four elements to be strong, clear, and congruent.
                                                                                                          3. ANALYZE ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE | 55

It is not enough for strategic leaders to just ensure that an organization's mission, purpose, vision, and values are aligned; they also
need to align their leadership approach with these factors. Strategic leadership that is aligned to a company's mission, purpose,
vision, and values has the potential to inspire employees, who feel the firm's leadership is authentic and that they are empowered
to contribute meaningfully to the firm's performance. This powerful authenticity has the potential to lead an organization toward
excellent performance.

Collectively, an organization's mission, purpose, vision, and values serve as the foundation for all strategic decisions. They inform
every aspect of a business, both external and internal. For example, among other things, they inform marketing approaches,
asset management approaches, and decisions to cooperate with other organizations. They also influence organizational structure,
human resource policies, and organizational culture.

The primary emphasis for a firm defining and expressing these guiding factors is to capture the organization's distinctiveness. Mis-
sions, purposes, visions, and values that are both distinct and authentic have the potential to drive excellent performance.

The first step in analyzing a firm's organizational performance is to assess its mission, purpose, vision, and values. In analyzing
them, the first important question to ask is whether they are effective. Then consider whether there is a clear line of sight among
them and whether they are congruent. If the answer to either is no, recommend that the company revisit these and bring them into
alignment.

Not only does there need to be a clear line of sight and congruence among the mission, purpose, vision, and values, strategies must
align with them as well. If strategies do not align, they either need to be adjusted or dropped, or in some cases, the mission, pur-
pose, vision, and values should be revised to stay relevant.

It is important to understand how mission, purpose, vision, and values relate and how they are distinct. It is most important to
understand the concepts behind each and what each aims to accomplish because not all organizations consider and communicate
through all four of the guiding statements. Some companies combine the ideas behind two of the factors, and sometimes compa-
nies use different names for the same ideas. When analyzing a company, it is more important to assess whether each broad concept
is dealt with and communicated than whether a company uses each of these exact terms.

We now review each of these in turn.

Analyze Mission

Missions and mission statements are important for all firms. They are essential for industry leaders who seek to maintain their posi-
tions and drive continued success. When working to revitalize an organization, leaders often focus on reaffirming its commitment
to a clear mission.

A mission statement explains why an organization exists. A well-crafted mission statement captures the essence of the organiza-
tion and answers the questions "Why do we exist?" and "What is our purpose?" For example, a nonprofit might have a mission "to
provide access to clean water in underserved communities," which clearly expresses why it exists. The mission defines the organiza-
tion's role within society. Just as important as the firm's purpose is its identity, addressed in questions like "What defines us?" and
"Who are we?" A mission is rooted in the firm's past foundation and current identity. Since a mission statement captures the essen-
tial elements of the company's identity from its founding to its reason to exist in the present, mission statements are often written
in the present tense.

In practice, a mission statement also serves to inform key stakeholders why they should invest their trust, resources, and support in
the organization. For an organization to succeed, it must gain the support of key stakeholders such as employees, owners, suppliers,
partners, and customers.

For example, Google's mission is "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful" (Google.com).
Early on, Google pursued this mission by developing a widely popular search engine. Today, the company continues to align with its
mission through various strategic efforts, such as providing the Google Chrome browser, offering free email services through Gmail,
and making books available for online browsing.

Deloitte offers professional services such as consulting, auditing, and advising to assist businesses in resolving difficult problems
and accomplishing their objectives. In this regard, it is clear Deloitte has concentrated on its mission statement: "To make an impact
that matters by delivering measurable, sustainable results to clients and communities" (Deloitte).

Another example is Peloton. Peloton makes fitness accessible by providing the most effective tools, software, content, and guid-
ance. With its linked stationary bikes and streaming fitness classes, they engage in interactive at-home workouts and fitness tech-
nology. In efforts to strengthen its brand and direction, Peloton has focused on its mission statement: "Peloton uses technology and
design to connect the world through fitness, empowering people to be the best version of themselves anywhere, anytime" (Pelo-
ton.com).

Mission statements are often brief and easy to remember. In the
past, they tended to be much longer, sometimes spanning sev-
eral paragraphs, which made it difficult for employees and
other stakeholders to recall or recite them. Over time, compa-
nies have simplified their mission statements, making them
shorter and more memorable. When employees know and
embrace their organization's mission, it boosts their engage-
ment and overall satisfaction. For instance, Nike's simple mis-
sion "to bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the
world" (Nike.com) is easy for employees to internalize and work
toward.

When you analyze a firm's mission statement, consider to what        Figure 3.1: Peloton
degree it addresses the criteria of a strong mission statement. It
is not necessary that the mission statement meets every one of
these criteria. After all, strong mission statements are short. Use
this list as a guide to make your own assessment:

· Does the mission statement explain why the organization exists?
· Does the mission statement define the organization's role within society?
· Is the mission statement rooted in the firm's past foundation and current identity?
· Does the mission statement capture the essential elements of the company's identity?
· Is the mission statement written in the present tense?
· Does the mission statement inform key stakeholders, such as employees, owners, suppliers, partners, and customers, why they

   should invest their trust, resources, and support in the organization?

The mission of an organization serves as a foundation for its purpose, vision, and values. We now turn our attention to an organiza-
tion's purpose.

Analyze Purpose

In recent years, many organizations have increasingly embraced the concept of using a purpose statement to articulate their reason
for existence beyond just profit-making, which differentiates them from mission statements.
                                                                                                          3. ANALYZE ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE | 57

Purpose statements are designed to inspire and unite stakeholders, ranging from employees to customers, around a central pur-
pose. Unlike mission statements, purpose statements often focus on the broader impact an organization seeks to have on society
or its industry. By highlighting the company's contributions beyond its products or services, purpose statements can help organiza-
tions foster trust, loyalty, and a sense of shared responsibility. Purpose statements often reflect a company's stance toward sustain-
ability. Sometimes a company will publish a separate sustainability statement. Sustainability is reviewed in detail in Chapter 10.

A well-crafted purpose statement also serves as a strategic guide, helping organizations navigate complex decisions by providing a
clear framework for evaluating opportunities and challenges. When a company's actions and initiatives are aligned with its stated
purpose, it ensures consistency in decision-making. This alignment fosters long-term success, as organizations are more likely to
prioritize initiatives that resonate with their purpose and contribute to their broader goals. In turn, this can enhance the firm's rep-
utation and attract not only customers but also partners and talent who share a similar vision for the future. With this focus on the
current actions the company is taking, purpose statements are usually written in the present tense.

For example, PwC's purpose is to "build trust in society and solve important problems" (PwC.com). This statement reflects the com-
pany's commitment to addressing critical challenges facing global communities, positioning itself as a trusted partner in fostering
societal progress. By aligning their operations and goals with a clearly defined purpose, organizations like PwC are better able to
engage their workforce, attract like-minded clients, and create lasting, meaningful impact.

Not every company defines a purpose separate from its mission. Some companies address their purpose beyond profit-making
in their mission statements. When analyzing a firm's broad guidance as it is communicated through its missions, purpose, vision,
and values, it is most important to assess whether the company defines and articulates its purpose in addition to profit-making,
whether this is expressed separately in a purpose statement, presented as part of the mission, or even included in another state-
ment.

When you analyze a firm's purpose statement, consider to what degree it addresses the criteria of a strong purpose statement. As
with your analysis of the firm's mission statement, it is not necessary that the purpose statement meets every one of these criteria.
Use this list as a guide to make your own assessment:

  · Does the purpose statement articulate a firm's reason for existence beyond just profit-making?
  · Does the purpose statement focus on the broader impact an organization seeks to have on society or its industry?
  · Is the purpose statement written in the present tense?
  · Does the purpose statement inspire and unite stakeholders?
  · Does the purpose statement foster trust, loyalty, and a sense of shared responsibility?
  · If a company has not articulated a separate purpose statement, has it addressed the criteria above somewhere else?

With mission and purpose defined, company leaders define their vision and communicate this through a vision statement.

Analyze Vision                                                                     "Where there is no vision, there is no
                                                                                   hope"
An organizational vision statement is a forward-looking or aspirational            --George Washington Carver
statement that captures what a company wants to achieve in the long run. It's
meant to inspire and guide the organization, offering a clear sense of direc-
tion. A good vision paints a picture of a hopeful future, helping to align every-
one around the same vision. Vision statements are usually concise, easy to
understand, and motivate people by showing them what they're working
toward. Unlike mission and purpose statements, they are usually written in
the future tense.
58 | 3. ANALYZE ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE

A compelling vision statement can be a powerful tool that leaders can use to energize and align the organization toward where it
wants to be. A clear vision defines what the company aspires to become and helps to shape its strategies. For instance, LinkedIn's
vision is to "[c]reate economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce" (LinkedIn.com). This succinct yet ambitious
vision highlights the company's aspirations to reach every member of the global workforce and assist them by creating economic
opportunities. Consequently, one might expect LinkedIn to feverishly pursue expansion of its offerings around the globe.

One might question the importance of vision statements. How much effect could they have, after all? More than fifty studies have
demonstrated a relationship between vision statements and achieving desired outcomes (Kirkpatrick & Locke, 2012). Not all vision
statements are good, and not all lead to success. Effective vision statements are generally clear, future focused, abstract and chal-
lenging, idealistic, concise, unique, and define success (Hauser, House, Kirkpatrick, & Locke, 2017).

While a well-defined vision can inspire employees, customers, and other stakeholders, strong and effective visions are relatively
uncommon. Vision is the starting point of strategy. Strategy defines the roadmap of how an organization will move from where it is
today to where it wants be according to its vision.

An organization can't thrive if its mission and vision are not aligned. When a company's mission and vision point in different direc-
tions, confusion and inefficiency affect the strategy. For example, early in the development of some companies in the tech industry,
their missions were focused on providing accessible and innovative products for consumers. However, as they grew, some shifted
their visions toward dominating markets or expanding into unrelated areas, creating a conflict between what they originally stood
for and what they aspired to become.

A more recent example comes from higher education. Many universities started with missions centered around providing quality
education to students. As the need for research and innovation grew, the visions of some universities shifted to prioritize global
research prestige. This created confusion among faculty: should they focus on teaching, as the mission suggests, or on research, as
the vision demands? Even today, some institutions struggle to reconcile this tension, as the different emphases create competing
priorities for faculty and staff.

Ultimately, organizations are most successful when mission and vision are aligned. A tech company that aims for both customer-
centric innovation and market leadership, for example, will be more effective if its mission and vision work together to guide
employees in the same direction despite having two potentially conflicting goals.

When you analyze a firm's vision statement, consider to what degree it addresses the criteria of a strong vision statement. As with
your analysis of the firm's mission and purpose statements, it is not necessary that the purpose statement meets every one of these
criteria. Use this list as a guide to make your own assessment:

  · Is the vision statement a forward-looking or aspirational statement that captures what a company wants to achieve in the long
      run?

  · Does the vision statement inspire and offer a clear sense of direction?
  · Does the vision statement paint a picture of a hopeful future?
  · Is the vision statement concise and easy to understand, with the potential to motivate people by showing them what they're

      working toward?
  · Is the vision statement written in the future tense?
  · Is the vision statement aligned with the mission statement?

Once a company has confirmed their current position with strong mission and purpose statements and articulated their aspirations
for the future through their vision, they can then consider their values. A company's vision serves as the foundation for its values
and goals, which in turn guide the organization toward achieving that vision.
                                                                               3. ANALYZE ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE | 59

Analyze Values

In addition to crafting mission, purpose, and vision statements, companies also create corporate value statements that define the
core principles they stand by and expect their employees to uphold. These values are often showcased on company websites to com-
municate what the organization believes in and strives for.

Value statements are important because they not only guide internal culture but also influence how the company is perceived by
stakeholders. Employees are expected to align with these values, and those who don't may find their tenure short-lived. Customers
often choose companies whose values resonate with their own and firms that clearly communicate their principles. When Nike
faced backlash over labor practices, the company revised its value system to emphasize fair labor conditions, showing how values
impact both internal policies and public image. Likewise, Ben & Jerry's commitment to social justice can build strong brand loyalty.
Values statements are usually written in the present tense.

Values are also tightly intertwined with strategic management. When formulating strategies and goals, companies must ensure
alignment with their value statements. For example, if a strategy conflicts with a core value like sustainability, it must be recon-
sidered or adjusted. Companies like Tesla, which prioritizes environmental sustainability (Tesla.com), would likely reject strategies
that compromise that value, even if profitable in the short term. Adhering to corporate values ensures that companies maintain
their integrity while progressing toward their long-term goals.

Figure 3.2: Values and values statements

Companies like Microsoft emphasize values such as innovation (Microsoft.com), while others, like Patagonia, are known for pro-
moting sustainability and environmental responsibility (Patagonia.com).

Some companies articulate both purpose and values statements, and some only define one. Purpose and values are similar and
distinct. Purpose statements articulate the firm's reason for existence beyond just profit-making, instead focusing on the broader
impact an organization seeks to have on society or its industry, such as AT&T's purpose statement, "Connecting people to greater
possibility--with expertise, simplicity, and inspiration." Value statements define the core principles that companies stand by and
expect their employees to uphold, such as RSM's value of impactful innovation. While purpose statements may explain the goals of
the firm, the value statement explains why those goals are important. When analyzing a company, it is more important to assess
whether the firm addresses the broader impact it seeks to have on society or its industry (purpose) and defines the core principles it
stands by (values) than it is to focus on where exactly this is communicated.

When you analyze a firm's values statement, consider to what degree it addresses the criteria of a strong values statement. As with
your analysis of the firm's mission, purpose, and vision statements, it is not necessary that the values statements meet every one of
these criteria. Use this list as a guide to make your own assessment:
60 | 3. ANALYZE ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE
  · Does the values statement define the core principles the firm stands by and expects its employees to uphold?
  · Does the values statement have the potential to guide organizational culture and also influence how the company is perceived
      by stakeholders?
  · Does the company articulate a separate sustainability statement?
  · Is the purpose statement written in the present tense?

A company's values reflect their current commitment to a set of guiding principles. Values focus on where the company is headed
by setting the parameters for the firm's goals. The company defines and executes its goals by remaining true to its values.

       Application
            · The same principles that guide successful organizations in defining their mission, purpose, vision, values, and goals can be
                just as useful for individuals. Thinking strategically about your personal aspirations and how you plan to achieve them can
                offer new insights and approaches. Consider applying these concepts to your own life to help clarify your goals, stay focused
                on your purpose, and map out the steps needed to move forward effectively.

Key Takeaways

Organizational leaders define the firm's mission, purpose, vision, and values then express them in statements for their stakeholders.
These are usually published on company websites and easy to find. A mission statement explains why an organization exists. A firm's
purpose statement articulates the reason for the company's existence beyond just profit-making. A vision statement is a forward-looking
or aspirational statement that captures what a company or organization wants to achieve in the long run. Value statements define the
core principles that companies stand by and expect their employees to uphold. It is important that there is a clear line of sight and con-
gruence among these essential organizational elements. When analyzing an organization's mission, purpose, vision, and values, the first
important question to ask is whether they are effective. Then ask whether there is a clear line of sight among them and whether they are
congruent. If not, recommend that the company revisit these and bring them into alignment.

3.3 Performance Measures and Performance Benchmarks

Once you have analyzed a firm's mission, purpose, vision, and values, next consider the firm's performance in others critical areas
using comparative measures--specifically performance measures and performance benchmarks.
Performance measures are metrics used to track an organization's progress, such as profits, stock prices, or sales figures. These met-
rics provide insights but only offer a partial view of overall performance.
Performance benchmarks, on the other hand, provide context by comparing an organization's metrics to its previous results or to
those of competitors. For example, a company showing a profit margin of 20 percent in 2024, might seem like a strong performance.
However, if that same company had a profit margin of 35 percent in the previous year, and the industry average for 2024 was 40 per-
cent, this new result would indicate a decline.

       Application
            · Consider the ways your performance is measured. How is your academic success measured? For example, your grades and
                GPA are performance measures. Your class standing is a measure of your academic standing as measured against other stu-
                dents in your class.
                     Think of other ways your performance is measured. Do you work out or play sports? Do you play a musical instrument
                        or sing? Do you have a job? How is your performance measured in non-academic settings? What is the value of using
                        both performance measures and performance benchmarks in evaluating your work?

     Key Takeaways

     Performance measures are metrics used to track an organization's progress, such as profits, stock prices, or sales figures. Performance
     benchmarks are standards or reference points used to evaluate an organization's metrics by comparing them to historical data, industry
     standards, or the performance of competitors. You can analyze a firm's performance using both performance measures and performance
     benchmarks.

3.4 Analyze a Firm's Financial and Market Positions and Other Relevant
Quantitative Data

Once you have analyzed a firm's mission, purpose, vision, and values, the next step is to analyze a firm's financial and market posi-
tions and other relevant quantitative data.
We begin by analyzing a firm's financial position.
                                                                                3. ANALYZE ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE | 63

Analyze a Firm's Financial Position

An essential measure of organizational performance is a firm's financial land-  "[W]hile we don't run the company worry­
scape, which is visualized through analysis of financial data from the indus-   ing about the stock price in the short run,
try, competitors, and the firm.                                                 in the long run we consider our stock price
                                                                                a measure of our progress over time."
Conducting a financial analysis of a firm is not always straightforward. The    --Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, April 8,
method and calculations are simple enough, and the key measures are             2024
reviewed below. The complexity lies in finding useful data, deciding which
data is meaningful in this context, and presenting the data in an easily        "Our financial focus is on long-term, sus­
digestible format.                                                              tainable growth in free cash flows."
                                                                                --Amazon Annual Report, 2020
The challenge of grasping the complex nature of organizational financial per-
formance stems from the conflicting views that can arise from using different   "Trumpeting EBITDA is a particularly per­
benchmarks and metrics. For instance, the Fortune 500 ranks the largest U.S.    nicious practice."
companies based on sales, but these companies are not necessarily the best      --Warren Buffett, 2002 Letter to Share-
performers in terms of stock price growth. Due to their size, companies like    holders
Apple (as of 2024) would find it nearly impossible to double their revenue,
whereas a smaller pharmaceutical company launching a new drug could see
exponential revenue growth. In the late 1990s, many internet-based busi-
nesses experienced rapid sales and stock price growth despite posting losses.
Investors who focused solely on sales growth suffered significant losses when
the market shifted its attention to profits and stock prices plummeted.

Despite the problems with these metrics, almost all publicly traded companies discuss measures such as revenue and net income
(Certo, Jeon, Raney, & Lee, 2024). This demonstrates the need for executives to carefully select a balanced yet manageable set of
performance indicators to focus on, ensuring they capture a comprehensive picture without being swamped by excessive data.

Financial measures are key tools for evaluating an organization's profitability and overall effectiveness. These include essential met-
rics like return on assets (ROA), which measures how effectively a company turns its assets into profit. A high ROA suggests efficient
asset use, while a low or negative ROA signals inefficiency. Additional financial measures include return on equity (ROE) and return
on investment (ROI), which offer insight into how efficiently a company is using its resources.

Other popular financial indicators include earnings per share (EPS), net profits, and stock price, which together help answer the cru-
cial question "How do we appear in the eyes of our shareholders?"

These financial metrics are typically featured in annual (10-K) and quarterly (10-Q) reports, providing stakeholders with a transpar-
ent snapshot of the organization's fiscal health. For these numbers to be meaningful, they need to be paired with relevant com-
parisons, such as the company's performance over time or industry benchmarks. For instance, in Tesla's 2022 annual report, the
company highlighted its financial performance over the past five years, focusing on revenue growth, operating margins, and cash
flow, which allowed shareholders to gauge the company's progress and future potential.

This method of financial analysis revolves around ratio analysis, which enables comparisons across companies or time periods,
regardless of size or scale. Ratios like profit margins, debt-to-equity ratios, and asset turnover provide an even playing field for com-
paring firms across different operational scales.

Analyze a Firm's Market Position

Analyzing a firm's market position assesses how a firm compares to its competitors within the market. Two common measures for
evaluating a company's market position are market share and price-earnings (PE) ratio.
Market Share
Formula: Firm's Total Product Revenue / Total Revenue in the Industry
                                                                                                          3. ANALYZE ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE | 65
Market share reflects the percentage of the market controlled by a company. For example, if Netflix generates 35 percent of the total
revenue in the global streaming industry, then its market share in that sector is 35 percent.
Price-Earnings (PE) Ratio
Formula: Stock Price / Earnings per Share (EPS)
The PE ratio shows how much investors are willing to pay for $1 in earnings. If a company's stock is priced at $50 per share and gener-
ates $5 in annual earnings per share, the PE ratio is 10. A lower PE ratio suggests better value, while a higher PE ratio might indicate
strong market confidence in the company's future growth prospects. For instance, a company like Tesla often has a high PE ratio due
to market optimism about future earnings growth.

Analyze a Firm's Other Relevant Quantitative Data

Other data sets and trends can offer valuable insights. Trend analysis, for example, can reveal year-over-year changes in production
volume or help forecast economic conditions. Insight can come from company-related data like customer satisfaction rates derived
from surveys, employee satisfaction, strength of the brand, and innovation strengths (measured in new patents and new products
launched). Demographic data can also be useful, such as forecasts for population growth. Analyzing the age and gender forecasts in
a population can give important insights into potential new customers. Additionally, industry-specific data can offer useful bench-
marks, enabling the analysis of a company's performance relative to average sector growth or innovation rates. By focusing on these
different areas--financial, market-based, and general quantitative measures--organizations ensure they have a well-rounded
view of their performance and are positioned for long-term success.

3.5 Use a Range of Measures to Address the Complexity of Organizational
Performance

Analyzing firm performance is crucial in strategic management, as leaders need to understand how well their organization is per-
forming to determine if any adjustments are necessary. However, there are many ways to measure performance, and opinions vary
on which metrics matter most. The complexity lies in not just choosing the right measures but also interpreting outcomes, which
may not always reflect the quality of decisions made. Sometimes, good decisions can lead to poor results due to unexpected circum-
stances, such as external crises. For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted many solid strategies that were previously thought
to position organizations for success.

Using a range of performance measures and benchmarks is essential, as each provides different perspectives on how the organiza-
tion is functioning. Without considering multiple angles, organizations risk missing key insights, which can lead to a skewed under-
standing of their true performance. To get an accurate picture, leaders must analyze performance from a variety of perspectives,
ensuring they grasp both the strengths and weaknesses of their organization's progress.

With so many potential performance metrics and benchmarks, understanding an organization's performance can feel overwhelm-
ing. A study of restaurant companies' annual reports, for example, identified 788 different combinations of performance metrics
and benchmarks used within just that one industry in a single year (Short & Palmer, 2003).

Leaders analyze their firm by evaluating their current position, focusing on trend examination, and comparing themselves with
industry benchmarks or competitors. For example, return on assets (ROA) measures how effectively a company turns its assets into
profit. A high ROA suggests efficient asset use, while a low or negative ROA signals inefficiency. This analysis goes beyond financial
metrics, incorporating other performance indicators like product quality, employee satisfaction, retention, productivity, and cus-
tomer satisfaction. For instance, Software as a Service (Saas) is a cloud-based software delivery model where applications are hosted
by a service provider and made available to users over the internet. Instead of purchasing and installing software on individual com-
puters or servers, users subscribe to the software on a pay-as-you-go basis, often through monthly or annual plans. In SaaS com-
panies like Netflix or Steam, monthly active users (MAU) is a crucial metric. Assessing various factors from multiple angles enables
companies to gauge their overall performance.

Figure 3.5 shows a few additional key performance measures that are helpful when analyzing a company's organizational perfor-
mance.

3.6 Analyze a Firm's Balanced Scorecard

Understanding organizational performance requires a multidimensional approach. Just as a pilot must monitor multiple gauges,
such as altitude, airspeed, and fuel level, managers must track various performance metrics to ensure their organizations stay on
course. While various financial performance measures are essential indicators, they are only one component of the bigger picture.

To help managers assess performance beyond just financial measures, Harvard professors Robert Kaplan and David Norton devel-
oped the balanced scorecard. This tool encourages a broader evaluation of an organization's performance by focusing on multiple
key areas. The balanced scorecard framework emphasizes a balance between financial indicators and other critical measures that
influence long-term success.

The balanced scorecard suggests that managers track performance across four perspectives: financial, customer, internal business
processes, and employee learning and growth. We reviewed the financial measures in section 3.4. Here we focus on the additional
measures in the balanced scorecard: customer measures, internal business processes measures, and employee learning and growth
measures.
68 | 3. ANALYZE ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE

Analyze Customer Measures

Customer measures reflect how well a company attracts, satisfies, and retains customers. These measures answer the question
"How do customers view us?" Examples include metrics like new customer acquisition rates, customer satisfaction scores, and
repeat customer percentages.

For instance, Amazon emphasizes customer retention by offering services like Amazon Prime, which encourages loyalty through
faster shipping, exclusive content, and personalized shopping experiences. Additionally, Amazon gathers extensive customer data
to anticipate consumer needs and adapt its offerings accordingly.

Analyze Internal Business Process Measures

Internal business process measures focus on organizational efficiency and answer the question "What must we excel at?" Internal
business process measures include production times, delivery efficiency, and new product development speed.

For example, Toyota's commitment to lean manufacturing focuses on reducing waste in its production processes. By streamlining
assembly lines and improving supply chain coordination, Toyota continuously works to reduce the time it takes to manufacture
vehicles while maintaining quality standards.

Analyze Learning and Growth Measures

Learning and growth measures provide insights into how an organization can continue to innovate and create future value. These
metrics answer the question "Can we keep improving and adding value?" They often focus on employee development, innovation
capabilities, and adapting to changing market conditions.

A company like Google, for example, prioritizes learning and growth by offering employees continuous opportunities for training
and skill development. This not only keeps the workforce agile and innovative but also ensures that the company remains competi-
tive in a fast-evolving tech landscape. Metrics in this category might include the number of new technologies introduced or the per-
centage of employees who undergo skill upgrades annually.

3.7 Competitive Advantage

Although financial metrics like accounting measures and stock market returns provide insight into a firm's short-term performance,
they often fail to capture long-term success. These indicators can be misleading, as they are influenced by random market fluctu-
ations. A company might experience a stroke of good fortune that results in high profits despite having a weak strategic position.
On the other hand, a company with solid business fundamentals may suffer temporary setbacks and report disappointing profits.
Another limitation of relying solely on these measures is that some companies, especially in growth phases, intentionally reinvest
profits to fuel future expansion. This means their financial statements may not reflect their true health, even if they are thriving.

In strategic management, the focus often shifts from these financial measures to the concept of competitive advantage. This can
be better understood through economic value creation (EVC), a concept that measures the difference between what a customer is
willing to pay for a product (WTP) and the cost of producing that product.

                                                                 EVC = WTP - Cost

In this equation, WTP is the maximum amount a customer would pay, while cost represents the expense the firm incurs to produce
the product. The price a consumer actually pays is not included in this calculation.

Economic value creation can vary between companies, even when they sell similar products. This is because production costs and
customers' willingness to pay may differ from one firm to another. Consequently, some firms generate more economic value than
their competitors, leading to differences in competitive standing.

A company is said to have a competitive advantage when its economic value creation exceeds that of its competitors. For example,
if Firm A and Firm B produce similar goods, but Firm A creates more economic value (either through lower production costs, higher
customer willingness to pay, or both), then Firm A holds a competitive advantage over Firm B. The magnitude of this advantage is
the difference in the economic value created by each firm.

Competitive advantage is valuable for several reasons. Unlike profits and stock prices, which are influenced by market volatility,
competitive advantage reflects deeper, more stable dynamics. If a firm increases its competitive advantage, it means either its costs
have decreased, consumers' willingness to pay has increased, or both, signaling true strategic improvement.

Additionally, competitive advantage accounts for the success of firms that reinvest their earnings; a company might report minimal
accounting profits because it reinvests heavily in innovation or product development, yet it can still have a strong competitive posi-
                                                                                                          3. ANALYZE ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE | 71
tion if its economic value creation remains high. For example, if Firm A reinvests most of its profits back into the business, it may
report low accounting profits, but its competitive advantage could grow, as customers see more value in its product.
In practice, economic value creation is a more widely used and recognized concept than similar measures like economic value added
(EVA), especially when discussing competitive advantage in strategic management. EVC focuses more directly on the relationship
between customer value and production costs, making it a useful tool for understanding long-term strategic success.
Competitive advantage is the unique characteristics and capabilities of a firm that allow a firm to outperform its competitors.

     Key Takeaways

     In analysis carried out for strategic management, the focus often shifts from financial measures to the concept of competitive advantage.
     A company is said to have a competitive advantage when its economic value creation exceeds that of its competitors. Competitive advan-

3.8 Conclusion

By analyzing a wide range of areas related to organizational performance in this chapter, you are now able to provide a more com-
prehensive analysis of a firm's organizational performance. The process begins with analysis of a firm's mission, purpose, vision,
and values. When analyzing organizational performance data, it is useful to consider a wide range of performance measures and
benchmark measures to ensure you capture a thorough and robust picture of the firm. Analyze a firm's financial position, its mar-
ket position, and other relevant quantitative measures. Analyze a company's balanced scorecard, including customer measures,
internal business process measures, and employee learning and growth measures. This thorough review of an organization's per-
formance supports a more holistic view of their operations and informed evidenced-based decisions that promote sustained suc-
cess. This approach helps managers understand where the organization stands and where improvements can be made. Analyzing a
firm's organizational performance produces analysis that relates to both the external and internal environments of the company. A
company has a competitive advantage if its economic value creation exceeds that of its competitors. Competitive advantage reflects
deeper, more stable dynamics.

         1. Describe mission, purpose, vision, and values and how they are similar and distinct. Do companies always define each one? Dis-
             cuss the most useful way to approach these when you conduct a case analysis.

        2. Explain performance measures and performance benchmarks. Give an example of each, and explain how your examples illustrate
             each.

         3. Review figure 3.4 to ensure you understand how to use each measure in case analysis. Test your knowledge by writing down each
             ratio and filling in the type of measure, the formula, and its purpose without referring to the figure. If there are any areas you need
             to study further, we encourage you to do this now, as they will be highly useful throughout the rest of the course.

        4. Describe market share and PE ratio. Explain how they are used to analyze a firm's market position.
         5. What other types of relevant quantitative data may be useful when you conduct a case analysis? Explain their roles in case analy-

             sis.
        6. Discuss why using a range of measures is important when you analyze a case.
         7. Review figure 3.5 to ensure you understand how to use each organizational performance measure in case analysis. Test your

             knowledge by writing down each metric and filling in the formula and its purpose without referring to the figure. If there are any
             areas you need to study further, we encourage you to do so now.
        8. Describe what a company's balanced scorecard measures and why this is a useful tool. Explain how considering alternative mea-
             sures in addition to financial measures is useful and how this gives a broader measure of an organization's performance.
        9. Discuss competitive advantage. Explain the concept, the formula, and its role in strategic management.
     You are now competent at analyzing a firm's organizational performance. Congratulations!

4.1 Introduction

As you have learned, strategic management and case analysis follow a structured process through strategic analysis, strategy for-
mulation, and strategy implementation. Case analysis begins with analyzing a company's organizational performance, which you
learned in Chapter 3.
In this chapter, you learn the strategic management concepts and theories and the analytical frameworks and tools that support
strategically analyzing a firm's external environment. This includes understanding what is included in a firm's external environment
and how the environment is structured. You learn how to analyze the general environment, the industry environment, and the com-
petitive environment. You also learn the role of external analysis in case analysis, as analyzing the external environment of a com-
pany provides a critical outside-in perspective and helps companies to determine attractive markets in which to operate.

4.2 The External Environment

Before you can analyze the external environment of a company, you must first know what makes up the external environment and
why analyzing it is important. All organizations operate in an external environment. The external environment includes everything
outside a company that influences its ability to create and sustain a competitive advantage. The forces, factors, and actions of com-
petitors that operate in a firm's external environment are all outside the direct control of a firm.
74 | 4. ANALYZE THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT
Understanding a firm's external environment is crucial because it is a source of opportunities that can be harnessed to support a
firm's competitive advantage. The external environment is also a source of threats that must be mitigated to ensure continued com-
pany success.

     Key Takeaways

     The external environment includes everything outside a company that influences its ability to create and sustain a competitive advan-
     tage. The forces, factors, and actions of competitors that operate in a firm's external environment are all outside the direct control of a
     firm. The external environment is a source of opportunities that can be harvested to support a firm's competitive advantage and threats
     that must be mitigated to ensure continued company success.

4.3 The Structure of the External Environment

In strategic management, the structure of a firm's external environment consists of the general environment, the industry environ-
ment, and the competitive environment. This section introduces analytical instruments you use to support your analysis of each of
these elements.

The General Environment

The first and broadest level of a firm's external environment is the general environment (also known as the macro environment).
The general environment consists of the societal events and trends that impact all firms in an industry, including political, eco-
nomic, sociocultural, technological, environmental, and legal factors. The PESTEL framework is the strategic management frame-
work used to analyze the general environment. The factors in an organization's general environment are the furthest away from the
firm in origin, and the firm has the least influence over these factors.

The Industry Environment

The second level of the external environment is the industry environment, and it is narrower in focus. Sometimes the industry envi-
ronment is referred to as the task environment. A firm's industry environment consists of the forces that exert influence and pres-
sure over the firm's entire industry. To assess the market attractiveness and profit potential of the industry, you use a Porter's Five
Forces analysis instrument to analyze the bargaining power of suppliers, the bargaining power of buyers, the threat of substitute
products, the threat of new entrants, and the rivalry among existing competitors. In contrast to the factors in the general environ-
ment, the forces and dimensions in an organization's industry environment are closer in proximity to the firm, and the firm has
more influence over these forces.

The Competitive Environment

The third level of the external environment is the competitive environment, and it is the narrowest in focus, consisting of compa-
nies that pursue similar strategies in the same industry--strategic groups. A firm has the most influence over the dynamic influ-
ences in its competitive environment.

4.4 Define the Industry, Market, and Market Segment

Before you can analyze a firm's external environment, you must determine the firm's industry, its market, and the market segment
it is focusing on. A firm's industry, market, and market segments play a crucial role in shaping strategy and performance. Industry is
a group of organizations, businesses, companies, or firms that compete in the marketplace for profit, engaging in similar business
activities and producing or selling similar products or services. A market refers to the overall pool of potential customers for a prod-
uct or service within a specific industry, and a market segment is a distinct group within a market that is identified by shared char-
acteristics like demographics, needs, or behaviors.

Companies in an industry are related in their main activities (the activities that generate the most revenue for the firm). For exam-
ple, many companies finance their products. Automakers finance automobiles, and technology firms finance new technology prod-
ucts. Finance is an important business support unit for the company and one that new business graduates may join and manage.
However, finance is not the main activity of either an automaker or a technology firm, so neither belongs to the finance industry.
Automakers are members of the auto industry, and technology firms are members of the technology industry.

It is important to consider industry and competitor analysis when consider-
ing the company's positioning and performance. Let's consider Chipotle.

Chipotle is considered to be in the food service industry, which places it
alongside all types of restaurants, from other fast-food restaurants, such as
McDonald's, to exclusive restaurants and even institutional cafeterias, such
as those found on university campuses, and catering services. Although it is
accurate that Chipotle is in the food service business, this is not a useful
industry to consider for most analyses of Chipotle. The restaurant industry
is another possibility. This includes all types of restaurants, from other fast-
food restaurants, such as Kentucky Fried Chicken, to exclusive restaurants,
such as Ruth's Chris Steak House. This is likely still too broad to be helpful in
analyzing Chipotle. Considering restaurants that serve Mexican food is
another potential perspective. This would include food trucks and local
Mexican restaurants. Again, this is likely too broad.

A more pragmatic and useful approach is to consider what other restau-

rants Chipotle directly competes against. Additional choices still need to be

made to determine Chipotle's direct competitors. A competitor is a business

within the same industry that offers similar products or services and com-

petes for customers.

                                                                                   Figure 4.2: Chipotle

Competitors selling products that customers tend to buy one at a time may

compete for the same customer, with only one competitor winning. This applies to products that garner high brand loyalty from

customers. This happens in different circumstances, such as when competitors sell products that are expensive relative to their cus-

tomer's ability and willingness to pay. For example, for many buyers, a vehicle is a major purchase, and many customers have high

brand loyalty to vehicle makers. Many customers buy only one vehicle at a time. In this case, one competitor wins the sale of the

vehicle. Phones, being less expensive than vehicles, are typically purchased more frequently by customers, but they still tend to

show strong brand loyalty to manufacturers. Again, only one competitor wins.

When businesses sell products or services that are less expensive relative to their customer's ability and willingness to pay, a com-
pany is competing for customers at each decision point and each point of sale. This is especially true for consumable goods, such as
food. In the case of eating at fast-food restaurants, although many customers have brand loyalty, many customers eat at multiple
fast-food restaurants.
                                                                                                             4. ANALYZE THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT | 77

This complicates the identification of Chipotle's industry, market, and market segment. Chipotle's direct competitors could include
all fast-food restaurants. On the other hand, Chipotle could be seen as competing directly with Mexican fast-food restaurants. Addi-
tional competitors could be restaurants that focus on fresh ingredients or Mexican grills that serve fresh food. All of these are com-
petitors, to varying degrees.

Chipotle's most direct competitors include Qdoba Mexican Eats, Moe's Southwest Grill, Baja Fresh Mexican Grill, and Rubio's Coastal
Grill. Chipotle also competes, but less directly, with Taco Bell. Finally, other fast-food restaurants, such as Wendy's and McDonald's
are more distant competitors.

When considering Chipotle's market and market segment, there are several important considerations to keep in mind. Remember:
a market refers to the overall pool of potential customers for a product or service within a specific industry, and a market segment is
a distinct group within a market that is identified by shared characteristics like demographics, needs, or behaviors.

An important element of defining the market and market segments correctly is the determination of the size of the market and
its growth rates. If a company defines its market and market segments too narrowly, the firm may celebrate a high market share
but may also miss out on opportunities in the broader market. If a company defines its market too broadly, there could be a mis-
match between what the company can really offer and what the market demands. Companies must avoid trying to be everything to
everyone. It is also important to define the company's total market, accessible market, and strategically relevant market (SRM). For
strategic analysis, formulation, and implementation, the strategically relevant market is the main framework to use when assess-
ing the market size and growth rates, the market dynamics, markets trends, and market attractiveness.

From a strategic management perspective, it is pragmatic and useful approach to consider what restaurant subsector Chipotle
inhabits. The restaurant industry has many subsectors, including fast food, fast casual, casual, full-service, and fine dining. Chipotle
can be considered to operate in the fast casual sector of the restaurant industry. Chipotle's market includes fast casual Mexican
restaurants. Chipotle's strategically relevant market can be defined as urban and suburban customers who want quick customizable
Mexican-inspired food in a casual dining atmosphere. Chipotle's market segment is college students and younger millennials, aged
18-30, who want a healthy meal that is sustainably sourced at a reasonable price point. Customers value convenience, such as being
able to access Chipotle through digital platforms, and transparency in food sourcing.

Ideally, every company wants to operate in an attractive market. One important factor that determines the attractiveness and profit
potential of different industries is the size of the market--more specifically, the size of the firm's strategically relevant market. A
big market is more attractive because there is more demand and more space for various companies to succeed. A second important
factor of market attractiveness is the growth rates of the market. A growing market offers growth opportunities for various compa-
nies and competitors in an industry, whereas growth in a stagnating or even declining market can only be achieved by taking mar-
ket share away from competitors. Typically, companies analyze past growth rates as the compound annual growth rate (CAGR). A
robust and data-driven forecast of the market's future CAGR is critical when determining the attractiveness and profit potential of
an industry. Beyond the size and growth rates, firms need to understand the industry dynamics in their industry.

Every company that engages in the process of strategy formulation must gain a full understanding of the industry in which the
firm operates as well as its market, market segments, and the dynamics affecting the company. This allows the firm to determine
the strategic opportunities and threats that the industry, market, and market segments present to the firm, as well as the firm's
strengths and weaknesses that may be leveraged to address these opportunities and threats.

Following the logic of the "3 Cs" of industry players, a firm needs to thoroughly analyze its competitors, its customers, and its com-
pany. As it relates to a firm's external environment, a firm's competitors include the industry in which a firm operates. A firm's cus-
tomers make up the firm's markets and market segments. The company includes all the internal dynamics of the firm, which is
covered in the next chapter, which focuses on analyzing the internal environment.

Understanding a firm's industry, market, strategically relevant market, and market segment are essential when analyzing a com-
pany. When you conduct a case analysis, begin by defining the firm's industry, market (especially its strategically relevant market),
and its market segment.

       Application
            · Now that you have seen an example of Chipotle's industry, market, and market segment, identify and discuss the industry,
                market, and market segment for one of your favorite restaurants.

     Key Takeaways
     A firm's industry, market, and market segments play a crucial role in shaping strategy and performance. An industry is a group of busi-
     nesses that engage in similar business activities and that produce or sell similar products or services. A market refers to the overall pool
     of potential customers for a product or service within a specific industry, and a market segment is a distinct group within a market that is
     identified by shared characteristics like demographics, needs, or behaviors.

4.5 Analyze the General Environment

The general environment is the broadest level of the external environment of a firm and includes societal events and trends that
impact all firms in an industry.

Although factors in a company's general environment are the furthest away from the firm and include those factors that the firm
has the least influence over, these factors influence the success of a business. Executives must continuously scan and monitor devel-
opments in the general environment.

An organization's general environment presents both opportunities and threats. For example, the rapidly changing landscape of
technology, with developments in AI and cloud computing, offers potential opportunities for many companies. Advances in solar
and wind power also can be sources of opportunities in the external environment as many companies move toward goals of net-
zero emissions.

The general environment is also a source of threats that must be mitigated to ensure continued company success. For example, wars
pose threats to supply chains. Changing tariffs on imports threatens trade balances. Successfully navigating these external forces is
key to ensuring a company's sustained success and maintaining its competitive position.

The PESTEL Framework

The PESTEL framework is the strategic management framework that you use to analyze the general environment. Each letter of the
acronym PESTEL represents a factor in the general environment: political, economic, sociocultural, technological, environmental,
and legal.

There are many elements that make up each factor in the PESTEL framework. Figure 4.4 and the explanation following it include an
illustrative list of elements that make up each PESTEL factor.

Figure 4.4: PESTEL framework

Political

The political factor in the PESTEL framework focuses on the ways in which governments shape businesses.

It can be easy for students first learning the PESTEL framework to confuse the political category with the legal category. We review
the legal factor later in this section. One distinction is that governmental regulations are best categorized as political.

To understand governmental regulations that are best categorized as political and how this differs from what is best categorized
as legal, it is helpful to briefly review how government regulation is created through the federal executive branch of government
because this is the governmental regulation the PESTEL framework's political factor concerns.

In the U.S., there are three branches of government: the executive, legislative, and judicial. There are also three levels of govern-
ment: federal, state, and local. There are multiple types of law, and they are created through different governmental processes by
different branches of government.

Federal executive governmental agencies, such as the Occupation Safety and Health Organization (OSHA), make administrative
law. The administrative law made by governmental agencies form the basis of federal governmental regulations. Administrative
law that regulates business is binding, and companies must follow it. A few of the governmental regulations that business must
follow are tax regulations, immigration regulations, foreign trade regulations, and OSHA regulations that address employee health
and safety.

In addition to promulgating regulations, the federal executive branch of government in the U.S. also issues presidential executive
orders. For example, a July 9, 2021, presidential executive order by then-President Joe Biden titled "Executive Order on Promoting
Competition in the American Economy" directly impacts businesses. Statutory and case law are reviewed under the legal section of
the PESTEL framework.

Types of governmental regulation differ in different countries. When U.S. companies operate outside of the United States, it is
important for company legal teams to understand under what conditions U.S. regulations apply and when regulations of the other
country apply.

In addition to governmental regulation and presidential orders, there are other aspects of the general environment that are
impacted by political factors. Corruption and political instability in a country can also impact the general environment.

Economic

The economic segment of the PESTEL framework focuses on the broad economic events and trends that impact the general envi-
ronment. These include, and are not limited to, the degree of growth in the economy, inflation rates, exchange rates, and interest
                                                                                                             4. ANALYZE THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT | 81

rates. It also includes the recent and long-term stability or volatility of the stock market(s). The amount of available household dis-
posable income impacts the general environment. The job market is an essential element of the economic picture of the general
environment. This includes job market growth and unemployment rates. The gross domestic product (GDP) of a country is also an
important indication of the economic factor for the general environment.

Sociocultural

The sociocultural factor in the PESTEL framework includes a society's culture, norms, and values. A sociocultural aspect to consider
when analyzing the general environment is composition of the population, including population growth and decline and its den-
sity. Considering the percentage of the population that lives in urban, suburban, and rural communities is valuable. It is also valu-
able to analyze the age, gender, and ethnic distribution across a population. Perspectives can vary among different groups.

Understanding attitudes and values across multiple dimensions of the population can give a helpful picture of the sociocultural fac-
tor of the PESTEL framework. Consider attitudes and values toward the role of family in society and health consciousness. Attitudes
and values about work-life balance and general lifestyle, as well as attitudes and values toward careers, can be important sociocul-
tural factors to consider.

Changing values at work that are relevant for business now could be:

  · Desire and expectation to partially work from home (hybrid work)
  · Rights movements like #BLM or #MeToo
  · Heightened sensitivity regarding climate change and expectations that business plays its role in fighting it
  · Individualism continuing to grow

Analyzing the tolerance for risk can also be helpful when assessing the sociocultural factor of the PESTEL framework.

Technological

Technology influences the general environment in multiple ways. The level of technology in the general environment is important,
as is the life cycle of technology. The life cycle of technology, which covers the commercial journey of a new technology from devel-
opment and growth to decline, may have an influence on the level of technological innovation, which influences the rate of new
technology development. Technology is dependent upon the appropriate infrastructures to enable its use. Consider internet and
communications infrastructures and how urban and rural environments impact these. The digital divide considers access to tech-
nology along geographical and socioeconomic lines. Automation has been important for a while. Robotics is a growing technology
that influences the technological factor of the PESTEL framework. Specific new technologies are always important, such as genera-
tive artificial intelligence (AI), cloud and quantum computing, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR).

Environmental

Environmental factors are important when analyzing the general (or macro) environment. The climate crisis is an essential focus
of this factor. Weather and natural disasters impact the general environment. Pollution has a large impact. Although many share a
value to reuse, repurpose, and recycle, there can be significant variations in the infrastructures that support these values and activi-
ties. Regenerative agriculture seeks to balance the needs for food production and the needs of the environment. As more consumers
become interested in organic and recycled products, the market for securing organic and recycled supplies is increasing. As many
companies set carbon-neutral or net-zero goals, the demand for green energy sources is increasing. The infrastructure to support
green energy is an important aspect of the environmental factor for the PESTEL framework.
82 | 4. ANALYZE THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

Legal

In addition to administrative law and presidential executive orders discussed above under the political factor, there is statutory law
that is passed by the legislative branch of government, Congress. There also is case or common law that is based on cases adjudi-
cated in the judicial system, the courts. Case law sets precedents that guide future actions. Both types of law must be followed and
are categorized under the legal factor of the PESTEL tool. In addition to understanding where law is made, it is also useful to under-
stand at what level of government the law has been passed--federal, state, or local--because this indicates the jurisdiction of the
law. Some of the federal law that impacts businesses include import and export laws, antitrust laws, and copyright and patent laws.
Federal laws that govern consumer protection, labor, and antidiscrimination are also crucial focuses of the legal factor. Federal envi-
ronmental laws address ways businesses interact with the environment.

Now that you understand the PESTEL framework, it is time to conduct an analysis of the general environment. The PESTEL analysis
instrument introduced below supports you when you conduct an analysis of PESTEL factors in the general environment. Once you
have conducted the analysis, the instrument structures your interpretation of the analysis and your evaluation of the analysis and
interpretation. You then make recommendations to the firm based on your analysis, interpretation, and evaluation.

The first step when you analyze the general environment using the PESTEL analysis instrument is to analyze the case data related
to each PESTEL factor.

       PESTEL analysis instrument

Analyze Data about the General Environment

Step 1

  · Methodically and thoroughly examine all the data available about the general environment that relates to each PESTEL factor:
      political, economic, sociocultural, technological, environmental, and legal.

Step 2

  · Identify and classify all the data about the general environment that relates to each PESTEL factor: political, economic, socio-
      cultural, technological, environmental, and legal.

  · Questions to ask:
         What information about the general environment relates to each PESTEL factor?
         In which PESTEL factor does this information fit best?

Step 3

  · Complete the analysis section of the PESTEL analysis instrument.

Be specific about what data in the case applies to each of the PESTEL factors. Your analysis needs to focus on the present and specific
organizational context and must address what is happening with this firm, at this time, in this place, and under these circum-
stances. Avoid making general statements that apply either to many industries or to this company always.
                                                                                                             4. ANALYZE THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT | 83

For example, imagine you are analyzing Ford Motor Company,
and you are considering the impact of governmental regula-
tions and policy on sales. Avoid statements like, "Governmental
regulation impacts sales." This statement applies to many
industries and has applied to Ford for some time. Although the
statement is true, being more specific is helpful. Instead, you
may analyze the influence of governmental regulations and
policy on Ford, writing something along the lines of "The IRS
$7,500 tax credit for new plug-in electric vehicles (EVs) or fuel
cell vehicles (FCVs) influenced Ford sales in 2023 by X%. Presi-
dent Trump's retrenching of governmental support for clean
technologies threatens Ford's sales of EVs and FCVs." It takes a
thorough knowledge of the case to be able to provide this
much more robust analysis of the influence of political regula-
tion and policy on Ford. Continue to analyze the influence of Figure 4.5: Ford
governmental regulation and policy on Ford until you have
exhausted an analysis of all the data in the case that relates to the political factor. When you have exhausted your analysis of the
influence of the political factor on Ford, move onto analyzing the economic, sociocultural, technological, environmental, and legal
factors. This level of detail in your analysis supports the next steps in the analysis process: interpretation and evaluation.

After completing your analysis related to each PESTEL factor, your next step is to interpret the analysis.

Interpret the Analysis

Step 1

  · Examine the analysis of each PESTEL factor: political, economic, sociocultural, technological, environmental, and legal.

Step 2

  · Identify and explain whether, how, and in what ways the information in the analysis is related.
  · Questions to ask:

         How does your analysis within each PESTEL factor relate?
               How do the political factors relate?
               How do the economic factors relate?
               How do the sociocultural factors relate?
               How do the technological factors relate?
               How do the environmental factors relate?
               How do the legal factors relate?

         How does your analysis in each PESTEL factor relate to your analysis of other PESTEL factors?
               For example: How does your analysis of the political factor relate to your analysis of the legal factor? Continue this
                  until you have considered all combinations of factors that are relevant to the case.

         What elements of your analysis of PESTEL factors were a surprise?
         Are there incongruencies between the elements of analysis of PESTEL factors?
84 | 4. ANALYZE THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT
Step 3

  · Identify and explain underlying root cause(s) of the situation.
  · Question to ask:

         What may be causing the information identified in your analysis of PESTEL factors?

Step 4

  · Complete the interpretation section of the PESTEL analysis instrument.

The next step is to evaluate the interpretation of your analysis.

Evaluate the Analysis and Interpretation

Step 1

  · Examine the analysis and interpretation you have just completed.

Step 2

  · Identify and explain whether, how, and in what ways the information in the analysis and interpretation in the PESTEL analysis
      instrument impacts the industry and company.

  · Questions to ask:
         How does each element of the analysis and interpretation in the PESTEL analysis instrument impact the industry and
            company?
         From a holistic point of view, looking across all the information in the analysis and interpretation in the PESTEL analysis
            instrument, how does the information impact the industry and company?

Step 3

  · Identify and explain whether, how, and in what ways the information in the analysis and interpretation PESTEL analysis instru-
      ment is relevant to the industry and the company.

  · Questions to ask:
         How is each element of the analysis and interpretation in the PESTEL analysis instrument relevant to the industry and
            company?
         From a holistic point of view, looking across all the information in the analysis and interpretation in the PESTEL analysis
            instrument, how is the information relevant to the industry and company?

Step 4

  · Determine how important the information is to the industry and the firm.
  · Action to take (if helpful):

         Rank the analysis and interpretation PESTEL analysis instrument according to strength of importance, such as strong,
            moderate, or weak.
                                                                  4. ANALYZE THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT | 85

Step 5

· Identify the company's current, potential, or needed assets, organizational capacity, and managerial ability that may support

   or mitigate the areas of highest impact, relevance, and importance for the firm.

· Questions to ask:
      What are the company's current, potential, or needed assets that may support or mitigate the areas of highest impact,

         relevance, and importance for the firm?
      What is the company's organizational capacity that may support or mitigate the areas of highest impact, relevance, and

         importance for the firm?
      What managerial ability does the company possess that may support or mitigate the areas of highest impact, relevance,

         and importance for the firm?

Step 6

· Complete the evaluation section of PESTEL analysis instrument.

The final step is to recommend action to the firm based on your analysis, interpretation, and evaluation.

Recommend Action to the Firm

Step 1

· Make recommendations to the company to leverage opportunities in the general environment.

Step 2

· Make recommendations to the company to mitigate threats in the general environment.

Step 3

· Place the recommendations in the instrument in the section titled "Recommendations."

A PESTEL framework takes a snapshot of the general environment. Building on this snapshot, the PESTEL analysis instrument
enables you to interpret the analysis, evaluate the analysis and interpretation, and make recommendations to the firm. This trans-
forms a PESTEL analysis from a static picture of the general environment to a dynamic process that considers the elements within
the PESTEL analysis, which is much more helpful to a firm than a static snapshot.

When you analyze a case, use the strategic management framework and the analysis instrument to support your analysis. The goal
is not to complete every aspect of the analysis instrument with the same degree of information. The goal is to thoroughly analyze
the data in the case.

When you analyze a case, you analyze the specific PESTEL factors present in the case. Each factor in a case does not necessarily
impact the case to the same degree. For example, you may find that the political, sociocultural, technological, and legal factors have
the greatest influence on a case and that economic, sociocultural, technological, and environmental factors influence another case.

We have now considered the general environment, which is the first and broadest level of a firm's external environment. We also
reviewed the PESTEL framework, which is the strategic management framework that is used to analyze the general environment.
You have completed a PESTEL analysis using the PESTEL analysis instrument. It is now time to turn your attention to the next level
of the external environment: the industry environment.

     Key Takeaways

     The PESTEL framework is the strategic management framework that you use to analyze the general environment. Each letter of the
     acronym PESTEL represents a factor in the general environment: political, economic, sociocultural, technological, environmental, and
     legal.

4.6 Analyze the Industry Environment

The industry environment is the second level of the external environment, and it is narrower in focus than the general environment.
Sometimes the industry environment is referred to as the task environment.
The industry environment is important because it includes the dynamics that shape the profit potential and market attractiveness
of an industry and the influence of direct competitors on a firm. How profitable a firm may be in an industry is important for many
reasons. When company executives are considering entering a new industry, the market attractiveness and profit potential of the
industry is essential information. The industry environment also considers the impact of direct competitors. Understanding the
industry environment can help executives decide where in an industry to position a company. This is also valuable information
when a firm is deciding whether to divest a company in an industry.

The Porter's Five Forces Framework

The Porter's Five Forces (P5) framework is the strate-
gic management framework used to analyze the
industry environment. The Porter's Five Forces
framework was introduced in a 1979 article by
Michael Porter of Harvard Business School.

The framework considers five forces in an industry
that influence the profit potential and industry
attractiveness in the industry. Executives of compa-
nies currently competing in the industry and those
considering entering or exiting an industry utilize
the Porter's Five Forces framework to make essential
decisions.

The framework is made up of four factors on the out-
side surrounding a central factor (see figure 4.6). The
four outside factors represent opportunities and
threats to existing companies in the industry and
those firms considering entering or exiting the
industry. Executives of companies already compet-
ing in the industry need to continuously scan the
industry environment and analyze these opportuni- Figure 4.6: Porter's Five Forces framework
ties and threats. Businesses considering entering or
exiting the industry consider these factors when making their decision. Rivalry among existing competitors, which is in the center
of the Porter's Five Forces framework, represents the relationships of companies currently competing in the industry.

Porter's Five Forces framework is a dynamic framework, as the forces interrelate and impact each other. When none of the five forces
work to undermine profits, then the profit potential of the industry is strong. If all the forces work to undermine profits, then the
profit potential of the industry is weak. Most industries fall between these extremes.

Bargaining Power of Suppliers

When suppliers have a high bargaining power, there is less industry profit potential, and when suppliers have a low bargaining
power, there is more industry profit potential.

High Bargaining Power of Suppliers Means Less Industry Profit Potential

When suppliers have greater leverage over the competitors in an industry than the competitors in the industry have over the sup-
pliers, then the bargaining power of suppliers is high. Suppliers can increase their prices either incrementally or suddenly. A price
increase from suppliers reduces competitors' profit margins and can have a detrimental impact on their success. Suppliers can also
analyze the potential value of entering the market as a competitor.
88 | 4. ANALYZE THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

             Figure 4.7: High bargaining power of suppliers
As seen in figure 4.7, there are multiple factors that contribute to suppliers in an industry having high bargaining power, including
the following.

 1. Incumbent firms experience high switching costs as they change suppliers.
         When incumbent firms experience high switching costs when changing suppliers, this gives the current supplier a high bar-
         gaining power. There are many reasons an incumbent firm may experience high switching costs. For example, a company
         may experience financial switching costs due to a disruption in supply chains during a change in suppliers. Firms may also
         experience high psychological switching costs when they have longstanding and productive relationships with suppliers
         that enable quick resolutions of any potential problems. In both instances, the supplier has a high bargaining power over
         the incumbent firm.

 2. There are no substitutes for the supplier's products or services.
         When there are no substitutes for the supplier's products or services, the current supplier has a high bargaining power.
         Imagine a company that has no immediate alternatives of suppliers to choose from. Until other suppliers arrive in the mar-
         ket, the current supplier has a monopoly on the company's supply, giving the supplier very high bargaining power.

 3. The supplier's products are differentiated.
         When the supplier's products are differentiated, the supplier has multiple product lines, meaning a single product is a
         smaller portion of the supplier's total business. In this case, the supplier is less dependent on a single product and can afford
         to hold out for favorable prices, distribution contracts, or other conditions. This gives the current supplier a high bargaining
         power.
                                                        4. ANALYZE THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT | 89

4. The supplier can compete in the new industry.

When the supplier can compete in the new industry, it is possible for the supplier to enter the industry as a competitor to
incumbent firms. This gives the current supplier a high bargaining power because incumbent firms are motivated to keep
out a new competitor.

5. Incumbent firms rely on suppliers to be profitable.

When incumbent firms rely on suppliers to be profitable, any changes to the supply quantity, quality, and availability will
have an immediate impact on the incumbent firm's bottom line. In this case, the current supplier has a high bargaining
power.

6. Suppliers are dominated by a few companies.

When suppliers are dominated by a few companies, incumbent firms have fewer choices of suppliers. This gives the current
supplier has a high bargaining power.

Low Bargaining Power of Suppliers Means More Industry Profit Potential

When suppliers have less leverage over the competitors in the industry than the competitors in the industry have over the suppliers,
then suppliers have less bargaining power. Suppliers may need to lower their prices to remain suppliers to the industry. This
strengthens competitors' profit margins and increases the probability of their success.

Bargaining Power of Buyers

Buyers are the customers to the industry's incumbent firms. When buyers have a high bargaining power, there is less industry profit
potential, and when buyers have a low bargaining power, there is more industry profit potential.

High Bargaining Power of Buyers Means Less Industry Profit Potential

When buyers have greater leverage over the competitors in an industry than the competitors in the industry have over the buyers,
then the competitors may be forced to lower their prices or increase the quality of their products. This weakens competitors' profit
margins and makes them less likely to be prosperous. The power of buyers increases when they demand a lower price or higher-
quality product because this impacts the profit margin of the industry's incumbent firms. Buyers can also analyze the potential
value of entering the market as a competitor.
90 | 4. ANALYZE THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

  Figure 4.8: High bargaining power of buyers

Low Bargaining Power of Buyers Means More Industry Profit Potential

When buyers have less leverage over the competitors in an industry than the competitors in an industry have over the buyers, then
competitors can raise their prices and enjoy greater profits.

Industry Concentration

Both suppliers and buyers have more bargaining power in concentrated industries. Industry concentration refers to the extent to
which large firms dominate an industry; since there are both suppliers and buyers in highly concentrated industries, both benefit
from greater concentration.
One way to measure industry concentration is to examine the percentage of total industry output that is produced by the four
biggest competitors. An industry has a high concentration when the four biggest competitors in an industry represent 80 percent to
100 percent of the total industry output. When the four biggest competitors have a total industry output of 50 percent to 79 percent,
the industry has a medium concentration. An industry has a low concentration when the four biggest competitors in an industry
represent less than 50 percent of the total industry output.

Threat of Substitute Products

A substitute is a product or service that comes from outside the existing industry but fills the same need for existing industry cus-
tomers while offering some additional value. Because they are products or services from outside the industry, substitute products
may come close to meeting the current customer need but by a different means. Sometimes substitute products generate a new
                                                                                                             4. ANALYZE THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT | 91

demand for a product or service that did not previously exist in the industry. A substitute product or service is not the same thing as
a product or service offered by a competitor, which is covered under competitive rivalry.

High Threat of Substitutes Means Less Industry Profit Potential

A high threat of substitutes limits the price incumbent firms can charge for their goods. Therefore, a high threat of substitutes
reduces industry profit potential.

Sometimes substitutes are so effective that they disrupt the industry, meaning that all or most of the industry demand for the pre-
vious product or service becomes obsolete. For example, navigation systems were a big market with products like TomTom that sold
many different navigation devices. Customers also paid substantial premiums for cars with an in-bult navigation system. With the
emergence of Google Maps, Wayz, Apple Maps, and other navigation apps that are part of everyone's smart-phone, the market has
shrunk significantly. Navigation apps on smart-phones have substituted dedicated navigation devices, disrupting the industry. An
industry that is threatened by such a disruption due to possible substitute products and services is unattractive.

Low Threat of Substitutes Means More Industry Profit Potential

A low threat of substitutes has little impact on the price incumbent firms can charge for their products and services. A low threat of
substitutes increases industry profit potential.

Threat of New Entrants

New entrants are companies that are not currently competitors in the industry but may become competitors in the future. A pri-
mary difference between the threat of substitutes and the threat of new entrants in the Porter's Five Forces framework is that the
threat of substitutes concerns products or services that come from outside the industry but fill the same need for existing industry
customers while offering some additional value, while the threat of new entrants analyzes the threat of companies that are not cur-
rently competitors in the industry but may become competitors in the future. The more profit potential an industry has, the more
attractive it is to potential new entrants.

High Threat of New Entrants Means Less Industry Profit Potential

There are many factors that contribute to a high threat of new entrants. The three previous forces we have considered--threat
of substitute products, bargaining power of buyers, and bargaining power of suppliers--can contribute to a high threat of new
entrants. When suppliers consider entering the market as a competitor, they become a threat as a new entrant. When buyers con-
sider entering the market as a competitor, they become a threat as a new entrant. The company that makes a substitute product or
service is likely to become a new entrant. This illustrates the interrelationships of the forces in the Porter's Five Forces framework.

Low Threat of New Entrants Means More Industry Profit Potential

There are barriers that reduce the threat of potential new entrants to existing firms in the industry. These are referred to as entry
barriers.

Figure 4.9: Entry barriers to new entrants

Economies of Scale

Economies of scale are cost advantages that firms with large outputs have because they can spread their fixed costs across more
units of production. Some of these fixed costs include, but are not limited to, many of the functional business units, such as finance,
accounting, human resource management, information technology, and sales and marketing. They also may be able to capture
some efficiencies by using technology in more innovative ways and creating a more specialized work force. When the scale needed
for the lowest possible production cost is high for a potential new entrant into the industry, the threat of entry is lowered.

Capital Requirements

Capital requirements are related to economies of scale. Capital requirements include the investment required to enter a new indus-
try. When capital requirements to enter a new industry are high, the threat of entry is lowered.

Advantages Independent of Size

Incumbent firms in an industry have advantages independent to size. Some of these include high levels of brand loyalty, favorable
locations, and proprietary technology. In addition to these advantages, incumbent firms also have the advantage of the cumulative
learning and experience they have acquired from being successful in their industries. They may also have established preferential
access to supplies and distribution channels. When incumbent firms possess high levels of brand loyalty, favorable locations, pro-
prietary technology, cumulative learning and experience, and preferential access to supplies and distribution channels, the threat
of entry is lowered.

Switching Costs

Switching costs are the costs that customers incur when they switch from one vendor to another. Switching costs are most often
monetary. They can also be psychological. When a customer is loyal to a brand and switches to another brand, there can be a psy-
chological cost to the customer in switching to the new vendor. There are mental or emotional barriers to making a switch. Brand
loyalty is a classic example. Customers of music streaming platforms might resist switching to a competitor because of familiarity
and comfort with the service they use. A Spotify customer may be hesitant to switch to Apple Music and may experience a drain
on their mental energy as they navigate the learning curve of using a new system. They may also experience an emotional drain as
                                                                                                             4. ANALYZE THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT | 93
music platform loyalty may be shared by friends and their friends may not be using the new service. When switching costs are high,
the threat of entry is lowered.

Network Effects

Network effects are the positive effects one user has on other users of a product or service. The stronger the network effect, the
higher the value of a product or service when the number of users increases. Network effects can be encouraged through friends
and families. They can also be encouraged through social media and the use of influencers to be associated with a product or ser-
vice. When network effects are present, the threat of entry is lowered.

Government Policy

Governmental policy can have either positive or negative effects on the threat of potential new entrants to an industry. When gov-
ernmental policy encourages competition, the threat of entry is raised. When governmental policy restricts competition, the threat
of entry is lowered.

Expected Retaliation

Incumbent firms with longevity in an industry have the capacity to enter and withstand a price war when a new firm enters the
industry. The new entrant may not have the capacity to withstand this tactic. The fact that incumbent firms may enter a prolonged
price war is an example of expected retaliation. The expected retaliation must be credible to deter a potential new entrant to an
industry. When a new entrant expects incumbent firms to retaliate, such as by initiating a price war when they enter the industry,
the threat of entry is lowered.

Rivalry among Existing Competitors

Unlike the four aspects on the outside of the Porter's Five Forces framework, which represent opportunities and threats to existing
companies in the industry and opportunities for firms considering entering or exiting the industry, rivalry among existing competi-
tors represents the relationships of companies currently competing in the industry.

Competition among rival firms in an industry can be intense. Companies seek to differentiate their products and services from those
of their competitors.

Differentiation is how a company makes its products distinct from its competitors. How Apple makes a Mac distinct from a PC and
an iPhone different from a Galaxy phone are examples of differentiation.

Businesses use a variety of marketing approaches to communicate the ways in which their products and services are differentiated
from those of their competitors. Companies also compete in a highly competitive market through new offerings and price cuts to
maintain and attract new customers. High levels of rivalry in an industry reduce the profit potential of the industry.

          Figure 4.10: High rivalry between competitors
As the arrows in the Porter's Five Forces framework show, the four forces on the outside of the framework--the bargaining power of
suppliers, and the bargaining power of buyers, the threat of substitutes, and the threat of new entrants--all exert pressure on the
rivalry of competitors.

When the five forces are low, then the profit potential and market attractiveness of the industry is strong.
Now that you understand the Porter's Five Forces framework, it is time to conduct an analysis of the industry environment using the
Porter's Five Forces analysis instrument included in Appendix 3. The instrument structures your interpretation of the analysis and
your evaluation of the analysis and interpretation, enabling you to then make recommendations to the firm based on your analysis,
interpretation, and evaluation.

Follow a similar process as that outlined in section 4.5 for the PESTEL analysis.
The Porter's Five Forces framework is a valuable framework for analyzing the industry environment. It is most productive to consider
each aspect of the framework in turn. A Porter's Five Forces analysis is generally framed as analyzing more dynamic features of the
external environment than does the PESTEL framework. This is because the five elements of the framework are dynamic and inter-
related.
In using the Porter's Five Forces analysis instrument, you interpret the analysis, evaluate the analysis and interpretation, and make
recommendations to the firm, which is made more effective thanks to the dynamic nature of Porter's Five Forces analysis.

Collaboration

Porter's Five Forces framework is useful, but it has limitations. The Porter's Five Forces framework assumes the amount of profit
potential in an industry is fixed and that, if a firm is to make more profit, it must take that profit from a rival, a supplier, or a buyer.
This is not always the case. Some companies collaborate, which creates a larger pool of profit that benefits all parties in the collab-
oration. Collaboration is reviewed in greater detail in Chapter 9.

Analyze Customers' Current and Future Needs

While Porter's Five Forces analysis covers the customer perspective through the perspective of the buying power of buyers, compa-
nies need to embark on an even more specific and thorough analysis of customers' current and future needs to formulate strategy.
Every strategy developed must allow the firm to meet or exceed customer needs better than its competitors. Hence, a robust under-
standing of present and future customer needs is critical for the success of every strategy. The firm must understand who its current
and future main customers are. Which market segments, customer groups, and main customers will drive strategic success for the
firm? Will the firm serve a variety of smaller customers, or will its future success depend on winning with a few industry-leading
customers?

When formulating strategy with a clear right to win, winning with customers is the guiding star of strategy formulation. Hence, the
firm must understand the following customer-related key areas.

  · Who are the main customers with whom the firm's future success stands and falls? Who are the industry leaders and drivers
      in the market that command a high market share that the firm needs to win?

For example, BASF Care Chemicals'
business (producing chemical ingredi-
ents for the home and personal care
industry) relied heavily on a few key
customers like Procter & Gamble,
Unilever, L'Oreal, Johnson & Johnson,
and Colgate, among others. Without
winning with these key customers,
BASF's Care Chemicals business would
never be able to reach its visions and
strategic objectives.

  · Understand and estimate the Figure 4.12: BASF Care Chemicals
      share of wallet the firm holds with
      the most important customers who will drive its success. The share of wallet is a metric that measures how much of a cus-
      tomer's spending goes toward a particular company compared to its competitors. The share of wallet indicates the depth of a
      client relationship and how well a firm is performing with key customers and against its competitors. A typical strategic objec-
      tive is to increase the share of wallet with key customers.

  · For all customers, but especially the above key customers, the firm must understand the customers' strategy. Where will key
      customers go, and how can the firm's customers strategize through their own products and services? The firm wants to help its
      (key) customers implement their strategy, which makes the firm a strategic partner and key supplier.
                                                                                                             4. ANALYZE THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT | 97

Staying with the BASF Care Chemicals example, Unilever's corporate strategy revolves around sustainability leadership. Integrating
the innovation of sustainable and environmentally friendly chemical ingredients into BASF's Care Chemicals strategy aligns the
firm's strategy with the strategy of key customers in the market, allowing BASF to form a strategic partnership with key customers
and helping them to reach their own strategic objectives.

  · What are the customers' met and unmet needs? The firm wants to understand the key customers' current and future needs. It
      is important to understand unmet customer needs because they present an opportunity to drive competitive differentiation
      by offering solutions for currently unsolved customer problems. This approach also links closely to innovation management
      as one element of business strategy.

  · What are the principle buying factors in the market, and what is the main source for competitive differentiation (like price,
      technology, innovation, customer service, product portfolio, etc.)?

  · What is the cost to serve versus the willingness to pay for key customers?

The process for finding answers to the above strategic questions is called customer exploration. This process of understanding
potential and existing customers to uncover their needs, preferences, and buying behaviors is a critical step in developing a cus-
tomer-centric business strategy. Customer exploration allows organizations to align their products, services, and strategy with what
their target customers truly value and are willing to pay for. In a dynamically evolving business environment, successful companies
prioritize customer exploration as a continuous activity. It informs product innovation, improves customer relationships, and pro-
vides a competitive advantage by adapting to market changes and to shifting customer expectations. Primary and secondary mar-
ket research are used to better understand customer needs as a guiding star of strategy development.

An easy and effective approach to customer exploration is simply asking key customers what they expect from the firm. Seeking
input from key customers is essential for a successful strategy. These input and feedback mechanisms include direct surveys or polls,
online reviews and ratings, social media interactions and the use of "big data." Another important approach in customer exploration
is customer journey mapping. This involves tracking the steps a customer takes when interacting with the firm, from initial aware-
ness to post-purchase behavior. A customer journey map highlights the customer's pain points and areas of opportunity that can be
integrated into the strategy development as a means to identify opportunities and threats in the industry.

     Key Takeaways

     The Porter's Five Forces framework is the strategic management framework used to analyze the industry environment. The Porter's Five
     Forces framework considers five forces in an industry that influence the profit potential and industry attractiveness of that industry: the
     bargaining power of suppliers, the bargaining power of buyers, the threat of substitute products, the threat of new entrants, and the
     rivalry among existing competitors. Porter's Five Forces framework is useful, but it has limitations. The Porter's Five Forces framework
     assumes the amount of profit potential in an industry is fixed and that, if a firm is to make more profit, it must take that profit from a
     rival, a supplier, or a buyer. This is not always the case. Some companies collaborate, which creates a larger pool of profit that benefits
     all parties in the collaboration. While Porter's Five Forces analysis covers the customer perspective through the perspective of the buying
     power of buyers, companies need to embark on an even more specific and thorough analysis of customer's current and future needs to
     formulate strategy. Customer exploration is the process of understanding potential and existing customers to uncover their needs, pref-
     erences, and buying behaviors. It is a critical step in developing a customer-centric business strategy, allowing organizations to align their
     products, services, and strategy with what their target customers value and are willing to pay for.

4.7 Analyze the Competitive Environment

The third level of the external environment is the competitive environment, and it is the narrowest in focus, consisting of compa-
nies that pursue similar strategies in the same industry. A firm has the most influence over the dynamic influences in its competitive
environment.

Strategic Group

A company is a member of a strategic group, which includes firms that pursue similar strategies in the same industry. A strategic
group consists of industry competitors that have similar characteristics to each other and differ in important ways from the com-
panies in other strategic groups. Each firm in the strategic group seeks to create and sustain a competitive advantage. There are
important differences among strategic groups, such as research and development investment, the use of technology and technol-
ogy innovation, product differentiation, distribution channels, and even customer service approaches.

Firms in the same strategic group are direct competitors. Competition tends to be more intense among firms in the same strategic
groups, which is known as intragroup rivalry. Competition among different strategic groups is intergroup rivalry and is less intense
than intragroup rivalry.

To create and sustain a competitive advantage, executives need to know as much as they can about their competitors. This includes
understanding their direct competitors in their strategic group as well as dynamics among strategic groups. This analysis supports
decisions about where to position a firm relative to its competitor. When considering strategic moves, the strategies being consid-
ered or implemented by other members of a strategic group are often the best examples for executives to consider. The strategies
pursued by firms in other strategic groups are alternative paths to success and can inform a firm's strategic choices.

Strategic Group Mapping

Strategic group mapping is the strategic management framework used to analyze strategic groups. It analyzes performance differ-
ences among clusters of firms in the same industry. Figure 4.13 shows a strategic group map for the competitive environment of the
American automotive industry.

                               Figure 4.13: Strategic group mapping

Analyzing strategic groups using the strategic group mapping analysis instrument follows Porter's Five Forces analysis well because
there are similarities between the rivalry among existing competitors in the Porter's Five Forces analysis and strategic groups in
strategic group mapping.

Strategic groups in most industries differ along a few essential dimensions. To map competitors in the same industry into strategic
groups, follow these steps:

 1. Identify the most important dimensions that characterize the strategic groups. These represent company commitments that
      are both difficult and costly to reverse. They include, but are not limited to, product price, product line, research and develop-
      ment investment, the use of technology and technology innovation, product differentiation, distribution channels, and even
      customer service. This varies by industry.

 2. Choose two dimensions from this list of the most important dimensions that characterize the strategic groups.
 3. Map these two dimensions. Use an X (horizontal) for one dimension, with low on the left and high on the right. Use a Y (verti-

      cal) axis for the other dimension, with low at the bottom and high at the top.
 4. Graph the firms in the strategic group based on these two dimensions using bubbles.
 5. Indicate the market share of each firm by the size of its bubble.
 6. Circle those firms with the most in common.

An example of a common X- and Y-axis pair is price and product line. Another common example for one of the axes is business-level
strategy.

a similar process as outlined for the PESTEL analysis. The strategic group mapping analysis instrument structures your analysis.

Analyze Competitors' Strategy and Expected Competitive Moves Using a SOAR
Analysis

The strategic group framework provides important information as to the most relevant and most important competitors of the
firm. Additional competitive intelligence with information about the main competitors and rivals is necessary and important in
anticipating competitors' next strategic moves. The firm needs to integrate assumptions about these strategic moves into the for-
mulation of the firm's own strategy. For example, in strategy formulation, it is critical to know if a main competitor intends to enter
or leave market segments of strategic importance for the firm. In addition, understanding whether competitors are doing well or
not or whether they want to grow aggressively or are satisfied with their current both present critical input to the formulation of a
meaningful and robust strategy.
The SOAR framework provides a systematic approach to analyzing and understanding the expected strategic moves of main com-
petitors. SOAR is an acronym that stands for strategy of the rival, objectives of the rival, assumptions of the rival, and resources of
the rival.

                           Figure 4.14: SOAR framework
                          4. ANALYZE THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT | 101

S: Strategy of the Rival

A robust understanding of a competitor's expected strategic moves starts with the analysis of the competitor's current strategy. The
firm needs to understand the strategic importance of its own targeted market and market segments the understand the strategy of
the competitor. The firm also wants to understand the competitiveness of its rivals today and in the future.

O: Objectives of the Rival

In the second step, the firm analyzes the strategic and performance objectives of its competitor. What are the business aims of the
competitor for individual business support units and as a whole? What are the competitor's objectives for regional and global mar-
kets? This will help the firm further understand how intense future rivalry may be and the implications for future market attractive-
ness.

A: Assumptions of the Rival

In the third step, the firm analyzes the assumptions that a competitor holds about itself and the industry. What is the competitor's
definition of the market, and what are the competitor's assumptions regarding the development of the market and the industry?
Are there any historical (emotional) ties to the business? Are there any national influences that would impact the competitor's strat-
egy and competitive actions? What is the competitor's attitude to risk?

R: Resources, Capabilities, and Core Competencies of the Rival

In the fourth step, the firm looks at the resources, capabilities, and core competencies of its rival. The firm wants to understand the
strengths and weaknesses of the competitor as well as their possible market exit barriers. For example, knowing that the competi-
tor faces high possible market exit barriers means that it will be more challenging for the firm to push this specific competitor out
of the market as part of its own strategy.

Understanding these four elements of the SOAR analysis helps the firm to integrate these dimensions of its main competitors into
its own new strategy. This includes answers to these questions:

· Is the competitor happy with the present situation?
· How will the competitor act in all probability?
· What changes could appear in the strategy of the competitor?
· In which areas is the competitor vulnerable?
· Which strategic actions of the firm would provoke a serious strategic response from the competitor?
· Which strategic move would trigger the strongest counterreaction?

After conducting a thorough SOAR analysis, the firm has a much better understanding of competitive moves and responses that
the firm needs to integrate into its own strategy formulation process. This allows the firm to make a well-informed decision regard-
ing the strategic "battlefield" in relation to its main competitors.

The idea that a company chooses its battlefield is based on the premise that ideally, a firm wants to offer distinct resources, capabil-
ities, and core competencies to unique markets and market segments. A company aims to avoid a strategy that leads to an overlap
in resources, capabilities, and core competencies and/or overlaps in markets and market segments with its competitors.
102 | 4. ANALYZE THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT
A firm wants to avoid a strategy that leads the firm to operate
in markets and market segments with strong competitive rival-
ries. The company also aims to avoid competing in the same
markets with firms with similar resources, capabilities, and
core competencies.
Ideally, the firm wants to avoid a strategy that leads to an over-
lap in both market segments and resources with its competi-
tors. A strategy that leads the firm to operate in markets and
market segments with strong competitive rivalries and com-
pete in the same markets as firms with similar resources, capa-
bilities, and core competencies is a less attractive strategic
choice.

                                                                                   Figure 4.15: Choice of battlefield

4.9 Conclusion

The external environment includes everything outside a company that influences its ability to create and sustain a competitive
advantage. The forces, factors, and actions of competitors that operate in a firm's external environment are all outside the direct
control of a firm. The structure of the external environment consists of the general environment, the industry environment, and
the competitive environment. Before you analyze a firm's external environment, determine its industry, its market, and the market
segment it is focusing on. The general environment consists of the societal events and trends that impact all firms in an industry,
including political, economic, sociocultural, technological, environmental, and legal factors. The PESTEL framework is the strategic
management framework used to analyze the general environment with the PESTEL analysis instrument. The industry environment
is narrower in focus. The Porter's Five Forces tool analyzes the industry environment. When you conduct a case analysis, you use a
Porter's Five Forces analysis instrument to analyze the market attractiveness and profit potential of the industry by considering the
bargaining power of suppliers, the bargaining power of buyers, the threat of substitute products, the threat of new entrants, and
the rivalry among existing competitors. Analyze customers' current and future needs. When you conduct a case analysis, you must
analyze the competitive environment by considering strategic groups with the strategic group mapping analysis instrument. Lastly,
case analysis involves analyzing competitors' strategy and expected competitive moves using a SOAR analysis.

5.1 Introduction

You now understand how the AFI framework provides a structured process for managing strategy. You also know that the analysis
phase of strategic management answers the question "Where are we?" and includes analyzing a firm's organizational performance,
external environment and internal environment, synthesizing the external and internal analysis, and determining a firm's strategic
issue and strategic alternatives. The analysis phase of strategic management provides an important starting point for strategy for-
mulation.
You have now analyzed a company's organizational performance, which provides critical information about a firm's external and
internal environments. You have also analyzed a company's external environment, which provides a critical outside-in perspective
and helps companies to determine attractive markets in which to operate. A firm's external environment includes those factors,
forces, and competitive industry groups outside a firm's direct control. Analyzing a firm's external environment supports identifying
a company's opportunities and threats.
In this chapter, you consider a company's internal environment, which provides a critical inside-out perspective of the firm. A com-
pany has direct control over its internal environment. Analyzing both the external and internal environments of an organization
provides a balanced and 360-degree analysis for the firm. You also learn what resources, capabilities, and core competencies are
and how these relate to creating and maintaining a competitive advantage. Next you learn the resource-based view (RBV) of firms.
Then you learn what the VRIO framework is and how it is based on the resource-based view of a firm. You also learn the ways iso-
lating mechanisms, including intellectual property, social complexity, and path dependence, serve as a value-added resource for
organizations. The chapter explains a firm's value chain before teaching you to analyze the internal environment of a firm using
108 | 5. ANALYZE THE INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT
a VRIO analysis instrument and a value chain analysis instrument. Analyzing a firm's internal environment supports identifying a
company's strengths and weaknesses.

5.2 Analyze the Internal Environment

Analyzing the internal environment of a firm provides critical information about key features internal to the organization over
which the company has direct control.

A company has direct control over its internal resources, capabilities, and core competencies. An internal analysis of a firm identifies
whether a company has the appropriate internal resources, capabilities, and core competencies to perform well and be competitive
in attractive industries, markets, and market segments. The internal analysis helps to identify which internal resources, capabilities,
and core competencies a firm needs to develop internally or acquire externally to be successful in the chosen markets.

At the end of the day, an organization needs to make sure that it has differentiating resources, capabilities, and core competencies
that will drive a competitive advantage and will allow the organization to meet customer needs better than its competitors. While
it is not possible for an organization to be superior to all its competitors in all relevant resources, capabilities, and competencies, it is
important to identify and leverage a few success-critical factors that are unique to the organization, superior to its competitors, and
relevant for the customers' buying decisions. The starting point of the internal analysis is a thorough understanding of the relevant
resources, key capabilities, and core competencies of the firm and how they are different from each other.

An internal analysis also identifies where value is added in a firm's value chain.

While analyzing a firm's external environment helps determine a company's opportunities and threats, analyzing a company's
internal environment helps determine strengths and weaknesses of the company that it needs to consider in the strategy formula-
tion process. Strengths can be leveraged to address opportunities in the market and to counteract threats. Weaknesses need to be
addressed through the internal development or external acquisition of competencies if they are relevant and important for success
in the market.

     Key Takeaways

     The internal environment of a firm consists of resources, capabilities, and core competencies. Companies have direct control over their
     internal environments.

5.3 Resources, Capabilities, and Core Competencies

Resources, capabilities, and core competencies can all serve as the source of competitive differentiation in a winning strategy.
Hence, they make up the basic building blocks of strategy, and it is important to start with a thorough understanding of these con-
cepts and the differences between them.

Resources are the tangible or intangible assets that an organization owns. Tangible resources are resources that can be seen,
touched, and quantified. These include physical assets, such as a firm's property, plant, land, buildings, labor, supplies, equipment,
capital, and cash. Intangible resources are difficult to see, touch, or quantify. Intangible resources include the knowledge and skills
of employees, a firm's reputation, brand equity, intellectual property, and a firm's corporate culture.
                                                                                                            5. ANALYZE THE INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT | 109

For example, NVIDIA has strong strategic intangible resources, such as expert employee knowledge and skills and a positive and
empowering corporate culture.

A strategic resource is a resource that has the potential to drive competitive differentiation and that can serve as a source of sustain-
able competitive advantage. Both tangible and intangible resources can be the source of a sustainable competitive advantage and
are therefore strategic in nature.

For example, BASF is the world's largest chemical company and has         Figure 5.1: BASF
strategic tangible resources, such as huge fully integrated chemical
plants that allow the company to manage the complete chemical
value chain with synergies and economies of scale. On the other
hand, Apple excels in its strategic intangible resources. Success-criti-
cal intangible resources are often the decisive strategic differentiator
as it relates to corporate culture, innovation strength, and superior
skills of the workforce as strategic resources.

Capabilities refer to what the organization can do with its tangible and intangible resources. Capabilities are the outcome and
result of organizations using, bundling, managing, and leveraging their resources in a way that drives competitive differentiation
and that adds value to its customers. Capabilities are born out of the resources that a firm has, and they are developed over
time. A firm's capabilities are its organizational and managerial abilities to orchestrate a diverse set of resources and deploy them
strategically. Since different firms have different approaches for resources utilization, it is possible that different firms with similar
resources have different capabilities.

NVIDIA uses its leadership excellence to effectively capitalize on its intangible resources of expert knowledge and skills and its
positive and empowering corporate culture to create strategic capabilities such as designing highly parallel GPUs that can process
many tasks simultaneously and developing frameworks like CUDA to enable programmers to take full advantage of its GPUs. These
related capabilities drive NVIDIA's competitive differentiation and adds value for its customers.

Core competencies are unique strengths embedded deep within a firm that allow the firm to differentiate its products and services
from those of its rivals, creating higher value for the customer or offering products and services of comparable value at lower cost.
Core competencies comprise a deep proficiency that enables a company to deliver unique value to customers. They embody the
organization's collective learning and help the firm to branch into a wide variety of related markets. If they are truly differentiating,
they are hard for competitors to copy or procure. Core competencies play a key role in formulating strategy because they define the
firm's position and competitive advantage, and they create a sustainable competitive advantage for a company.

Returning to NVIDIA, the company has a core competency of leading the industry in AI computing. This is a deeply embedded and
unique strength that allows NVIDIA to differentiate its products and services from those of its rivals and create higher value for its
customers.

The term dynamic capability refers to an organization's ability to continually use its existing resources to create new core compe-
tencies and enhance, upgrade, and improve existing capabilities to win with customers and beat competition.

NVIDIA has a dynamic capability of capitalizing on its intangible resources such as employee expert knowledge and skills and its
positive and empowering corporate culture to rapidly innovate using the latest technology to create new solutions and bring those
solutions to the market ahead of its competitors.

The process of developing core competencies is sophisticated and requires strong leadership, a robust strategy, and management
expertise. The first step of identifying and leveraging core competencies is to isolate key abilities and hone them into organization-
wide strengths. It is important to compare them with other firms with the same skills to ensure that the firm is developing unique
competencies. After that, the firm needs to develop an understanding of what competencies customers value, investing accordingly
to develop and sustain the valued competencies. Hence, core competencies need to be customer-perceivable and valued by the cus-
110 | 5. ANALYZE THE INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

tomers. Then the organization can create an organizational roadmap that sets goals for competence building, pursuing alliances,
acquisitions, and licensing arrangements that will further build the organization's core competencies. It is advisable to encourage
communication and involvement in core competency development across the organization. Non-core competencies can be out-
sourced or divested to free up resources that can be used to deepen the firm's core competencies.

Consumer giant Procter & Gamble identified the five core competencies below that meet the criteria and
that make them the premier marketing company in the world (us.pg.com).

1. Consumer understanding. Uncovers the unarticulated needs of consumers.                                                    Figure 5.2: P&G
2. Innovation. Translates consumer desires into new products.
3. Brand-building. Shapes purpose-inspired, benefit-driven brands.
4. Go-to-market capabilities. Reaches retailers and consumers at the right place and time.
5. Scale. Drives efficiency and consumer value.

Unilever is one of P&G's main competitors and identifies the three differenti-
ating strengths below as Unilever's core competencies (unilever.com). Firms
often refer to their core competencies by different terms. When you analyze a
firm's core competencies, it is most important that you understand what a core
competency is and are able to recognize it, whether the company refers to its
core competencies as core competencies, differentiating strengths, or some
other term.

 1. Powerful portfolio of leading category and brand positions
 2. Strong presence in growth markets of the future
 3. The global leader in sustainable business

                                                                                                       Figure 5.3: Unilever
These examples of P&G and Unilever illustrate how different companies that
are direct rivals within the same industry determine different core competencies.

                       The Coca-Cola Company describes its core competencies as the ability to lead the world's most sophis-
                       ticated system of independent bottling partners while creating value for retail and restaurant cus-
                       tomers (coca-cola.com).

                       These examples illustrate that core competencies need to go beyond topics that just sound good or that
                       are just a wishlist of what a company wants to be. Core competencies need to be specific to the firm,
                       relevant to customers, and capable of beating competition.

Figure 5.4: Coca-Cola  Lastly, let us consider how the concepts of resources, capabilities, and core competencies are connected
                       and how they work together. The starting point is the firm's resources, which are the tangible and intan-

gible assets that a firm possesses to create value. However, just having physical assets is not sufficient to create a sustainable com-

petitive advantage for a firm. The firm needs to use resources and translate them to customer-perceivable value that is relevant for

customers' buying decisions and that drives competitive differentiation.

This is where capabilities and core competencies come into play. Capabilities include the firm's ability and aptitude to perform a
certain task. A capability is a combination of personal and technical skills, knowledge, processes, tools, and behaviors that are criti-
cal to an organization's success and future needs.

Core competencies focus on the application of organizational capabilities. The core competencies ultimately drive strategic success
in the competitive arena.
                                                                                                             5. ANALYZE THE INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT | 111
Hence, a firm needs to define, refine, and continuously enhance its resources and capabilities to command core competencies
that will drive a sustainable competitive advantage. If the firm does this successfully, it will win in its chosen markets and will be
rewarded with a competitive advantage and superior financial performance. The positive financial results will then be reinvested in
further honing the firm's resources and capabilities that will lead to sustainably differentiating core competencies.

       Application

            · Consider your own personal resources, capabilities, and core competencies as they relate to your future career in business.
                     Describe the tangible resources you have. Your university degree will be one tangible resource. What other tangible
                        resources do you have that will support your business career?
                     Describe the intangible resources you have. The knowledge you gain earning your university degree will be one intan-
                        gible resource. What other intangible resources do you have that will support your business career?
                     Discuss the capabilities you have. What capability will you create by organizing, using, bundling, managing, and lever-
                        aging your degree and knowledge in a way that gives you a competitive differentiation in the job market? What other
                        capabilities do you have that will support your business career?
                     Discuss your personal core competencies. What are your unique strengths that are deeply embedded in your behavior
                        and mindset that allow you to differentiate your talents and skills from other job applicants that will create a higher
                        value for your employer?
                     Rank your dynamic capability. Describe your ability you have to continually use your existing resources to create new
                        core competencies and to enhance, upgrade, and improve your existing capabilities to continuously improve your
                        employability.
                     Consider this assessment of your own personal resources, capabilities, and core competencies when you analyze the
                        resources, capabilities, and core competencies of firms.

5.4 Resource-Based View and the VRIO Framework

By now, you know that strategy can be described as a firm's answer to three critical strategic questions that every organization needs
to answer:

 1. Where to play?
 2. How to win?
 3. Right to win?

Regarding the first two questions, "Where to play?" is addressed at the corporate level and "How to win?" is addressed at the strate-
gic business unit level. The third question, "Right to win?", is considered by the specific strategies that are embedded into business-
level strategies at the strategic business unit level, which include innovation strategy, sustainability and ethics strategy, technology
                                                                                                             5. ANALYZE THE INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT | 113

strategy, and multinational strategy. Corporate-level strategy, business-level strategy, and these embedded strategies are all dealt
with in detail in subsequent dedicated chapters. All three questions drive the firm's formulation of a roadmap and action plan
toward sustained superior performance.

Addressed at the strategic business unit level, how to win in a firm's chosen market is largely driven by the firm's ability to develop a
winning strategy around its resources, capabilities, and core competencies that are superior to those of its competitors and that will
create value for the firm's customers. Overall the "How to win?" question addresses the firm's search for a sustainable competitive
advantage.

Considering how a firm's resources, capabilities, and core competencies can be marshalled to create and sustain a competitive
advantage leads to a series of new questions that will help a company define how to win in its specific strategies that are embedded
into business-level strategies at the strategic business unit level.

1. Which of these resources, capabilities, and core competencies make a firm truly unique?
2. Where and how can a firm find its unique selling proposition (USP), which is the essence of what makes the firm's product or

    service better than its competitors?
3. What does the firm do both well and in a superior way?
4. What do the company's customers want?
5. What does the firm do better than its competitors?
6. What are the main sources and drivers for the firm's competitive differentiation?

A helpful framework to find answers to
these critical strategy questions is the VRIO
framework, which is based on the
resource-based view of a firm.

According to the resource-based view, a
firm can achieve a sustainable competitive
advantage if it possesses resources, capa-
bilities, and core competencies that are:

· Valuable
· Rare
· Hard to imitate (inimitable)
· Organized to capture value

A resource, capability, or core competency     Figure 5.5: The VRIO framework
that meets all four requirements can pro-
vide a sustainable competitive advantage
around which the firm should build its
strategy.

Analyze the Internal Environment of a Firm Using the VRIO Framework

The VRIO framework is a flowchart.

                                          Figure 5.6: VRIO framework flowchart
The first step in using the VRIO framework is to identify a firm's resources, capabilities, and core competencies and list these in the
lefthand column of the table, as shown in figure 5.5. Assess each resource, capability, and core competency to determine whether it
is valuable, rare, hard to imitate, and organized to capture value. Stop when you answer "no" to the resource, capability, or core com-
petency being valuable, rare, or costly to imitate. Do not continue along the flowchart once you have answered "no" for anything.
Use the VRIO decision tree to analyze resources, capabilities, and core competencies, not a firm's products, services, or the firm.
After learning what a VRIO analysis is and how to analyze the internal environment of a firm, the chapter walks you through an
example using a VRIO analysis.
          5. ANALYZE THE INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT | 115

Valuable

The first criterion in the VRIO framework is value. When you analyze a firm's internal environment using a VRIO framework, the
question to consider is whether a resource, capability, or core competency is valuable.

If a firm has no resources, capabilities, and core competencies that are valuable to the customer, the firm will fail. If customers do
not see value in what the company brings to the market, they will simply walk away from the company and give their business to
the organization's competitors that offer something that the customers value; in this case, the firm is at a competitive disadvantage.
The strategic conclusion is that, if a firm does not have valuable resources, capabilities, and core competencies, the company cannot
formulate differentiating strategies that are embedded into business-level strategies at the strategic business unit level, and there-
fore does not have a strategic right to win. The firm needs to internally develop or externally acquire resources, capabilities, and core
competencies that its customers value.

It is unlikely that you'll analyze a firm with no resources, capabilities, or core competencies, as it is impossible to survive in the mar-
ket if none of these elements are valuable. When you analyze a firm's internal environment using a VRIO framework, it is more likely
that you may find a particular resource, capability, or core competency that is not valuable. If you assess that a resource, capability,
or core competency is not valuable, then place a "no" in the flowchart under "Valuable" and stop. This places the company at a com-
petitive disadvantage.

When you assess the resource, capability, or core competency as valuable, then place a "yes" in the flowchart under "Valuable" and
move on to assess whether that resource, capability, or core competency is rare.

Rare

The second criterion in the VRIO framework is rarity. When you analyze a firm's internal environment using a VRIO framework, the
second question to consider is whether a resource, capability, or core competency is rare. You consider this question only for those
resources, capabilities, and core competencies that are valuable.

If a firm's competitors also command resources, capabilities, and core competencies that offer the same value for customers, the
firm does not offer anything unique and differentiating but only matches competitor offerings. This puts the firm at competitive
parity with its competitors. While this is surely a better strategic position than not offering any value at all, the company has fol-
lowed a "me too" strategy, and that is not enough to drive competitive differentiation. It is not recommended that a firm builds its
strategy around resources, capability, and core competencies that are valuable but not rare, as this only leads to competitive parity
in the market. The strategic conclusion is that a firm needs to develop or acquire resources, capabilities, and core competencies that
are unique in the market and that truly drive competitive differentiation that is perceivable by the firm's customers. If a firm has
no resources, capabilities, and core competencies that are rare, then the whole firm is at competitive parity. It is unlikely to survive
long.

When you analyze a firm's internal environment using a VRIO framework, it is more likely that you find some particular resources,
capabilities, and core competencies that are rare and some that are not. If you assess that one of these elements is valuable but not
rare, then place a "no" in the flowchart under "Rare" and stop. This resource, capability, or core competency places the company at a
competitive parity. When you assess the resource, capability, or core competency as rare, then place a "yes" in the flowchart under
"Rare" and move on to assess whether that resource, capability, or core competency is hard to imitate.
116 | 5. ANALYZE THE INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

Hard to Imitate (Inimitable)

The third criterion in the VRIO framework is being hard to imitate, or inimitable. When you analyze a firm's internal environment
using a VRIO framework, the third question to consider is whether a resource, capability, or core competency is hard to imitate. You
consider this question only for those resources, capabilities, and core competencies that are valuable and rare.

When a firm has resources, capabilities, and core competencies that are valued by the customer and rare, this is obviously much bet-
ter than the "me too" strategy mentioned earlier. The firm enjoys a temporary competitive advantage because it offers something
that its competitors do not currently offer. However, in a dynamic and highly competitive market environment, competitors con-
stantly monitor the success of the firm. Competitors do not want to lose market share, and if they have the opportunity to quickly
emulate and imitate the successful offering of the firm, they will do this to catch up and regain lost market share. This means the
company only enjoys a temporary competitive advantage as long as competitors have not yet imitated their successful approach.
As soon as competitors emulate, duplicate, and imitate their solutions, the firm will lose its competitive advantage. The strategic
conclusion is that a firm needs to command resources, capabilities, and core competencies that are rare, valuable, and hard to copy
by competitors.

If a firm has no resources, capabilities, and core competencies that are hard to imitate, it will remain competitive only until com-
petitors imitate these elements. When you analyze a firm's internal environment using a VRIO framework, it is more likely that you
may find particular elements that are not hard to imitate and some that are hard to imitate. If you assess that a resource, capabil-
ity, or core competency is not hard to imitate, then place a "no" in the flowchart under "Inimitable" and stop. Being hard to imitate
places the company at a temporary competitive advantage. When you assess the resource, capability, or core competency as hard to
imitate, then place a "yes" in the flowchart under "Hard to Imitate" and move on to assess whether that resource, capability, or core
competency is organized to capture value.

Organized to Capture Value

The fourth and final criterion in the VRIO framework concerns whether a firm is organized to capture value. You consider this ques-
tion only for those resources, capabilities, and core competencies that are valuable, rare, and hard to imitate. A resource, capability,
or core competency is organized to capture value when the firm has organizational systems, processes, and structures in place to
capitalize on the resource, capability, or core competency for a competitive advantage.

A firm that commands resources, capabilities, or core competencies that are valuable, rare, and hard to imitate is in a better strate-
gic position than those that do not have such characteristics. However, the presence of valuable, rare, and hard to imitate factors is
not enough for long-term success. Companies that have valuable, rare, and hard to imitate resources, capabilities, or core compe-
tencies have yet to fully realize their full competitive advantage. They have an unrealized competitive advantage.

The firm also needs to leverage those and translate them into specific activities and strategic action. It needs to organize its business
model in a way that enables the firm to translate the valuable, rare, and hard to imitate resources into a competitive advantage and
superior firm performance. The company does this by having organizational systems, processes, and structures in place to capital-
ize on the resource, capability, or core competency for a competitive advantage.

The strategic conclusion is that a firm needs to make good use of its valuable, rare, and hard to imitate resources, capabilities, or
core competencies. It takes leadership effort, strategic insight, and decisive managerial action to leverage the potential of winning
in the market into truly superior financial performance. Only when resources, capabilities, and core competencies meet all the VRIO
criteria does the firm have a sustainable competitive advantage to build a winning strategy.

Just as it is unlikely that a firm only no resources, capabilities, and core competencies that are valuable, it is also unlikely that one
hundred percent of a firm's characteristics meet all four criteria of valuable, rare, hard to imitate, and organized to capture value.
When you analyze a firm's internal environment using a VRIO framework, it is more likely that you may find a particular resource,
                                                                                                             5. ANALYZE THE INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT | 117

capability, or core competency that does not meet all four criteria and some that do. If you assess that a resource, capability, or
core competency is not organized to capture value, then place a "no" in the flowchart under "Organized to capture value" and stop.
This resource, capability, or core competency gives the company an unrealized competitive advantage. The firm has the potential to
move that resource, capability, or core competency into a sustainable competitive advantage if it can organize to capture the value
of that resource, capability, or core competency.

When you assess the resource, capability, or core competency to be organized to capture, then place a "yes" in the flowchart under
"Organized to capture value." This places the firm at a sustainable competitive advantage.

Using the VRIO framework helps companies to identify all of their resources, capabilities, and core competencies and the few truly
differentiating ones that are the source of sustainable competitive advantage. These few resources, capabilities, and core compe-
tencies form the basis of a winning strategy.

Figure 5.7: VRIO of your favorite restaurant

Imagine that your favorite restaurant has outdoor dining. You and everyone you know loves this. This is valuable. Now let's consider
if outdoor dining is rare. Because you attend university in a small university town in a favorable climate, outdoor dining is not rare.
Most restaurant in town offer outdoor dining. Therefore, the competitive implication for outdoor dining is that it affords the restau-
rant competitive parity with other restaurants in town. This is important information for the restaurant because they need to main-
tain outdoor dining to remain competitive in this town. Imagine the restaurant is faced with a decision to expand their indoor
seating at the expense of no longer offering outdoor dining. This is an unwise choice because that would put them at a competi-
tive disadvantage in relation to their competitors. Now imagine that your favorite restaurant is in a large city with weather seldom
favorable to outdoor dining. In that context, your assessment of outdoor dining would be different. When using a VRIO framework,
your analysis is always context specific.

Now let's say the restaurant has a secret sauce that has a bit of local notoriety. It is valuable and rare because no other local restau-
rant has a similar sauce, even though it is not hard to imitate. Do you like to try to make something at home that you have eaten
in a restaurant? If another local restaurant wanted to invest in replicating or even improving upon the secret sauce, they could. The
secret sauce is not inimitable, and the competitive implication is that the secret sauce is a temporary competitive advantage.
118 | 5. ANALYZE THE INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT
Imagine your favorite restaurant occasionally has fresh ocean seafood but not on a regular day of the week and without a consistent
selection. You and your friends love fresh ocean seafood and often go to your favorite restaurant hoping there will be a fresh ocean
seafood offering that day. Often you are disappointed. Your small university town is not near the ocean, and there are currently no
food services delivering fresh seafood to the area. Fresh ocean seafood is valuable, rare, and hard to imitate. However, the restaurant
has not organized to capture the full value of this resource because of the insufficient supply chain. This is an unrealized completive
advantage. Understanding this, your favorite restaurant decides to start internally sourcing fresh ocean seafood. They buy a refrig-
erated truck and employ someone to drive once a week to the ocean and bring back a reliable menu of fresh ocean seafood. Once
they have established the viability and profitability of this approach, the restaurant gradually adds more days. They have now orga-
nized to capture the full potential of this menu item and have the potential to change this unrealized competitive advantage to a
sustained competitive advantage.

Now let's say that your favorite restaurant has a strong local reputation. It is not only your and your friends' favorite restaurant but
also a favorite spot for most locals. This is valuable, rare, hard to imitate, and organized to capture value. The restaurant's strong
consistently positive local reputation is a sustained competitive advantage. The restaurant needs to continue to focus on and invest
in this to be sure it maintains this market position. Once reputation is tarnished, it is hard to recover it.

When you conduct a VRIO analysis, use the VRIO analysis instrument to structure your analysis, interpretation, and evaluation. The
goal is not to find an example of each of the possible competitive implications but to list the firm's resources, capabilities, and core
competencies and then evaluate them.

       Application

            · Conduct a VRIO analysis for your own resources, capabilities, and core competencies as a student. What is your USP? What
                makes you employable as an applicant for internships and positions after graduation?

            · Use your favorite professional sports team. Does your team have any resources, capabilities, and core competencies that
                would drive a right to win in its respective league?

            · Let's now apply the VRIO analysis to a company. Use the same example of one of your favorite companies that you used with
                the PESTEL, Porter's Five Forces, and strategic group mapping in the previous chapter. Now apply the VRIO framework to that
                company. Use the VRIO analysis instrument to structure your analysis, interpretation, and evaluation. What recommenda-
                tions would you make to the company based on your analysis?

     Key Takeaways

     According to the resource-based view (RBV), a firm can achieve a sustainable competitive advantage if it possesses resources, capabili-
     ties, and core competencies that are valuable, rare, hard to imitate (inimitable), and organized to capture value. A resource, capability,
     or core competency that meets all four requirements can provide a sustainable competitive advantage around which the firm should
     build its strategy. A VRIO analysis helps companies identify the few truly strategic and differentiating resources, capabilities, and core
     competencies that the firm can use to build its winning strategy. A winning strategy needs a convincing answer to the question of how a
     firm wants to win in its chosen markets. Doing the same as competitors is not good enough. Offering something that the customers do
     not truly value is not good enough. A firm must systematically analyze which resources, capabilities, and core competencies they have
                                                                                                             5. ANALYZE THE INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT | 119

     in place to win in the market, and they need to determine which of these elements must be further developed, honed, or added through
     internal development or external acquisition.

5.5 Isolating Mechanisms

The VRIO framework shows the importance of protecting a firm's competitive advantage. Building a firewall or a "moat" around the
firm's "castle" (its competitive advantage), moves the firm's strategic position from temporary or unrealized to sustainable compet-
itive advantage. Isolating mechanisms are important ways of sustaining a firm's competitive advantage and making it hard or, for a
certain time, even impossible or illegal for competitors to imitate the winning offerings of the firm.

Isolating Mechanisms and Their Significance in Business Strategy

The primary objective of a firm is to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage, where a unique resource, capability, or core com-
petency provides a lasting edge over competitors. The duration of this advantage varies by industry. In rapidly evolving sectors like
information technology or fast fashion, maintaining a competitive advantage for even a year can be considered successful. Con-
versely, in more stable industries, a sustainable competitive advantage may endure much longer. However, no firm can maintain
a competitive advantage indefinitely with its current resources, capabilities, and core competencies since competitors are always
striving to gain their own competitive advantage.
To prolong a competitive advantage, a firm must prevent competitors from replicating the resource, capability, or core competency
that provides this edge. To do this, a firm needs to utilize isolating mechanisms, which are crucial for firms to sustain competitive
advantage. Isolating mechanisms, also known as barriers to imitation, explain why firms can maintain a stable stream of economic
profits and why intra-industry differences persist over time. They protect individual firms from competition within a particular
strategic group or while the firms are uniquely positioned in the industry.
120 | 5. ANALYZE THE INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

Isolating mechanisms include intellectual property, social complexity, and path dependence, all of which reduce the likelihood of
imitation and help firms maintain their competitive advantage longer. Integrating purposeful decisions regarding isolation mecha-
nisms into the development of a firm's strategy ensures that key decisions concerning resource acquisition, development, and allo-
cation cannot be easily imitated, thereby prolonging and sustaining the firm's competitive advantage.

Intellectual Property

Intellectual property (IP) is one of the most important and impactful ways of creating isolating mechanisms. It refers to creations
of the mind, such as inventions, literary and artistic works, designs, symbols, names, and images used in commerce. It encompasses
the legal rights that individuals or organizations have over their intellectual creations, granting them control and protection from
unauthorized use by others. Intellectual property refers to the legal rights concerning intellectual activity in the industrial, scien-
tific, literary, and artistic fields. These rights allow creators or owners to benefit financially from their creations, providing a vital
incentive for innovation and creative output.

In the context of business strategy, IP plays a crucial role in building competitive advantage. By securing exclusive rights to new
technologies, designs, and creative works, companies can protect their market positions and prevent competitors from replicating
their products or services, making this advantageous resource, capability, or core competency hard to imitate. Protecting intellec-
tual property is especially important for companies whose business strategy includes a focus on differentiation, formulating and
implementing a strategy to distinguish itself in the market by responding to consumer preferences for luxury items. The company
competes primarily by offering products or services that are perceived as unique or superior by customers. Protecting intellectual
property also is important for companies where innovation plays an important role. These companies invest significant resources
into innovative products, services, and other solutions to drive competitive differentiation, and they obtain a significant return on
investment through their intellectual property rights.

There are four important types of intellectual property that firms use to sustain and protect competitive advantage: patents, trade-
marks, copyrights, and trade secrets.

Patents

A U.S. patent gives the inventor the right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, or selling an invention or importing
it into the U.S. (uspto.gov). A patent grants property rights by a sovereign authority to an inventor. In the U.S., the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office (USPTO) is this responsible authority and has issued more than ten million patents. U.S. patents are effective only
within the U.S. and its territories and possessions. They do not protect U.S. firms operating abroad. Globally operating U.S. firms
must research the intellectual property rights of other nations and apply for protection to their governing authorities.

The patent provides the inventor exclusive rights to the patented process, design, or invention for a designated period in exchange
for a comprehensive disclosure of the invention. Patents protect inventions from direct imitation for a limited period of time. Most
patents are valid for twenty years in the U.S. from the date the application was filed with the USPTO.

Patents can be further categorized into utility patents, design patents, and plant patents. Utility patents, or patents for invention,
issue legal protection to people who invent a new and useful process, an article of manufacture, a machine, or a composition of
matter. Utility patents are the most common type of patent, with more than 90 percent of patents issued by the U.S. government
belonging to this category. Design patents are patents issued for original, new, and ornamental designs for manufactured products.
Design patents protect the design or look of something. The invention to which the design belongs must be original. Plant patents
go to anyone who produces, discovers, and invents a new kind of plant capable of reproduction.

The number of patents successfully filed by a company is a good indicator of its innovation power. For example, German chemical
company BASF spent more than $2.3 billion on research and development and filed more than a thousand patents in 2023
(BASF.com).
                                                                                                             5. ANALYZE THE INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT | 121

In the pharmaceutical industry, IP is so important that the strength of a company's innovation pipeline drives the company eval-
uation. Intellectual property is a critical asset and strategic resource in business, company valuation, mergers, acquisitions, and
partnerships. Companies with strong IP portfolios are often valued higher because their intangible assets can generate sustained
revenue streams and superior financial performance. Effective management of IP, including obtaining, defending, and licensing
intellectual property rights, is essential for any knowledge-based business aiming to maintain long-term profitability and growth.

Examples of patents include Apple's iPhone, whose patent referred to it only as "electronic device." The patent for the signature
device of the twenty-first century tells you almost nothing about it. In its entirety, Apple's patent for the original iPhone, listed sim-
ply as an "electronic device," says only that it is an "ornamental design of an electronic device, as shown and described" (popularme-
chanic.com).

If we look way back, Thomas Edison is one of the most famous inventors in history, and his work still has a significant mark on the
world. The light bulb is one of the most famous inventions. He also worked with the phonograph, motion picture camera, and stor-
age battery. Thomas Edison was awarded 1,093 U.S. patents (2,332 if you include his foreign patents). Edison's record wasn't sur-
passed until 2003, 72 years after Edison's final patent application, by Shunpei Yamazaki who holds over 12,587 patents worldwide
as of 2024. Yamazaki is the president and founder of a research and development firm in Tokyo, Semiconductor Energy Laboratory
Co., Ltd. As of 2024, Samsung is the company that holds the most patents granted, with over 6,377 in the U.S. For decades, IBM has
been a leader in U.S. patents applications, filing over 10,000 U.S. patent applications.

Trademarks

Despite the lack of words, you immediately recognize the two trademarks
in figure 5.8. You also have various associations right away when you see
them. You may think of late-night food after a night out with friends and a
technology company that sells leading-edge gadgets that you want and
need. This example shows you the importance of trademarks as a way to
differentiate a firm from its competitors.

A trademark is a type of intellectual property consisting of a recognizable
sign, design, or expression that identifies a product or service from a par-
ticular source and distinguishes it from others. A trademark owner can be Figure 5.8: Easily recognizable trademarks
an individual, business organization, or any legal entity. Trademarks are
important because they help an organization stand out and build an identity in the marketplace. They are not only well known; they
also play a crucial role in brand identity and consumer recognition.

Copyright

Copyright is a type of intellectual property that grants the creator of an original work exclusive rights to its use and distribution for
a specified amount of time. This legal right allows the creator to control how the work is used, including reproduction, distribution,
adaptation, and public performance.

Below are some important examples of copyrights in the U.S.

  · Literary works like novels, poems, articles, and other written content
  · Musical works like compositions, including any accompanying lyrics
  · Dramatic works like plays and scripts
  · Pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works like paintings, drawings, sculptures, and photographs
  · Motion pictures like movies, TV shows, and videos
  · Sound recordings like music, spoken word, and other sounds
  · Architectural works like designs of buildings and structures
122 | 5. ANALYZE THE INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

These examples illustrate the broad scope of copyright protection, which is essential for safeguarding the rights of creators and pro-
moting creativity and innovation.

Trade Secrets

A trade secret is a type of intellectual property that consists of confidential business information which provides a company with
a competitive edge. This information can include formulas, practices, processes, designs, instruments, patterns, or compilations of
information that are not generally known or readily ascertainable by others. The owner of a trade secret must take reasonable mea-
sures to keep this information secret to maintain its economic value.

Below are some important examples of trade secrets in the U.S.

  · Coca-Cola's Recipe: The formula for Coca-Cola is one of the most famous trade secrets. It has been kept confidential since the
      drink was invented in 1863.

  · Google's Search Algorithm: Google's algorithm for ranking web pages is a closely guarded secret that gives the company a sig-
      nificant advantage in the search engine market.

  · KFC's Secret Blend of Herbs and Spices: The recipe for KFC's chicken, which includes a blend of eleven herbs and spices, is
      another well-known trade secret.

  · McDonald's Big Mac Special Sauce: The recipe for the special sauce used in McDonald's Big Mac is also a trade secret.

Trade secrets are crucial for businesses, as they protect valuable information that can give them a competitive advantage in the mar-
ket. By keeping this information confidential, companies can maintain their unique position and continue to innovate.

Social Complexity

Social complexity is another isolating mechanism. The web of relationships within a firm, as well as connections, relationships, and
partnerships of the organization with key external stakeholders like customers and suppliers, can be tough for competitors to repli-
cate. For instance, the vital relationships that firm members establish with strategic suppliers or the long-standing relationships of
the firm's account managers with procurement managers can create a unique condition that rivals cannot duplicate. Building trust,
mutual understanding, and alignment makes it easier to do business. This social capital serves as an enabler of productive relation-
ships that lowers transaction costs between the firm and other stakeholders. This social complexity acts as a barrier to imitation and
can extend a firm's competitive edge. Such complexity can arise from networks and partnerships both on an organizational level
and on the level of individual relationships between key members of the firm and its stakeholders.

Path Dependence

Path dependence is also an isolating mechanism. The journey a firm undertakes to achieve a competitive advantage can also act
as a barrier to imitation. Past decisions that have shaped a firm's current position can be challenging for other firms to replicate.
The accumulated learning and experience gained along this historical path are not easily duplicated. This concept, known as path
dependence, serves as an isolating mechanism, preventing competitors from attaining the same market position. For instance,
Warby Parker's early decision to build relationships with various suppliers and adopt a "buy one, give one" strategy, where a pair of
glasses is donated for every pair sold, created a loyal base of suppliers and customers in the online eyewear industry. Replicating
this strategy would likely be prohibitively expensive for competitors.

Key Takeaways

Isolating mechanisms are barriers to imitation that prevent competitors from replicating the resource, capability, or core competency
that provides a sustainable competitive advantage that is critical to a firm's strategy. They drive long-lasting competitive differentiation
that cannot be easily imitated or emulated by competitors. Isolating mechanisms include intellectual property (IP), social complexity,
and path dependence, all of which reduce the likelihood of imitation and help firms maintain their competitive advantage longer. Intel-
lectual property is a success-critical isolation mechanism to extend and protect the competitive advantage that a firm enjoys. Intellec-
tual property refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions, literary and artistic works, designs, symbols, names, and images used in
commerce. The targeted search and integration of IP strategies in support of the firm's chosen business model is an important element
of internal analysis and resource-based strategy development that builds strategy around the strategic resources, capabilities, and core
competencies of a firm that provide long-lasting and sustainable competitive differentiation. There are four important types of intellec-
tual property: patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets. A patent grants property rights by a sovereign authority to an inventor.
In the U.S., the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is this responsible authority. A trademark is a type of intellectual property con-
sisting of a recognizable sign, design, or expression that identifies a product or service from a particular source and distinguishes it from
others. Copyright is a type of intellectual property that grants the creator of an original work exclusive rights to its use and distribution
for a specified amount of time. A trade secret is a type of intellectual property that consists of confidential business information which
provides a company with a competitive edge. This information can include formulas, practices, processes, designs, instruments, patterns,
or compilations of information that are not generally known or readily ascertainable by others. Social complexity is another isolating
mechanism. The web of relationships within a firm, as well as connections, relationships, and partnerships of the organization with key
external stakeholders like customers and suppliers, can be tough for competitors to replicate. Path dependence is also an isolating mech-
anism, as the journey a firm undertakes to achieve a competitive advantage can also act as a barrier to imitation. Past decisions that have
shaped a firm's current position can be challenging for other firms to replicate. The accumulated learning and experience gained along
this historical path are not easily duplicated.

5.6 Analyze the Value Chain

A value chain represents the full life cycle of a product or service, usually in the form of a series of consecutive steps detailing the
creation of a finished product, from its initial design to its arrival at a customer's door. The chain identifies where value is added at
each step in the process. The term was introduced by Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter in his 1985 book Competitive
Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance. A value chain framework is a model that describes the series of activities a
business undertakes to create and deliver a product or service to a customer.

Value chain analysis (VCA) is another important tool of internal analysis. It provides a systematic overview of all major business
functions of the company. When you analyze the value chain, divide business functions into primary activities and support activi-
ties.

Primary activities include the business activities that are immediately necessary and basic for any business to operate. This includes
inbound logistics of raw materials being purchased and warehoused until they are used in the manufacturing process during busi-
ness operations. After producing their respective products, they are shipped to the customer using outbound logistics supported by
marketing and sales and by customer service as customer-facing key activities.

In contrast to primary activities, business support activities are not immediately customer-facing or related to the core business
operations. Support activities include the management of the company, financing, and legal activities as part of the firm's infra-
structure. Business support activities also involves human resource management, innovation management, and technology devel-
opment, which includes research and development. Finally, procurement is an important support activity.

All primary and support activities need to be well aligned for a company to be successful in the market and to generate positive
margins and profits.

Figure 5.9 depicts an overview of a company's primary and support activities.
                                                                                                             5. ANALYZE THE INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT | 125

Figure 5.9: Primary and support activities

There are three main steps to conducting a value chain analysis.
  · Identify primary and support activities that add value to the firm's final product or service.
  · Analyze all primary and support activities with the objective of reducing costs or increasing value through appropriate and
      strategy-supporting activities.
  · Recognize the most valuable activities. Today, competitive advantage is often derived from technological improvements or
      innovation.

A pragmatic approach for using value chain analysis for strategy formulation is "cost out, value in," which indicates a focus on bring-
ing costs down while building the value it delivers to customers. Executives use value chain analysis to implement best practices
throughout the firm, particularly for high value activities that drive strategic success and competitive differentiation. Products,
components, processes, and activities can be redesigned to facilitate speedier and more economical manufacturing or assembly.
High-cost activities can be reallocated and outsourced to external value chains to be performed more cheaply and efficiently by
vendors and contractors. Resources can also be reallocated to address activities tied to the most important purchase criteria for the
firm's customers. Finally, productivity-enhancing and cost saving technological improvements can be adopted in support of mar-
gins and productivity.
It is important and critical to identify firm-specific strengths and weaknesses through the process. Primary and support activities
that affirm key strengths need to be exploited and leveraged, enhancing their ability to effectively drive competitive differentiation
as a key element of strategy.
On the other hand, primary and support activities that have been identified as key weaknesses need to be addressed as well. Weak-
nesses that are success-critical and that impact competitive positioning and customer expectations need to be corrected by internal
development or the external acquisition of needed resources, capabilities, and core competencies. Weaknesses in business func-
126 | 5. ANALYZE THE INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT
tions that are not success-critical do not necessarily need to be addressed internally, as they possibly present an opportunity to out-
source the weak elements to third party suppliers that are better suited for them because they are specialized in those areas.
A good example of such an outsourcing process is that many companies outsource their payroll activities to a third-party supplier.
Unless you are a payroll services provider, payroll is neither a core competency of companies nor a factor that is important for win-
ning in the market. Hence, there are opportunities to save money by outsourcing non-key activities to third-party suppliers. This
process is covered by a long-standing strategic trend of companies focusing on their core competencies. Not every company can
be the best in performing all primary and support functions of the value chain. As a consequence, companies focus on the busi-
ness functions that are critical for winning in the market and that are mainly customer-facing, while outsourcing and reallocating
resources away from non-key activities in its value chain.
Use the value chain analysis instrument when you analyze a firm's value chain.

Analyzing a firm's internal environment using the VRIO analysis instrument and the value chain analysis instrument gives you
a full assessment of a firm's strengths and weaknesses. The value chain analysis reveals the ways a firm is organized to capture
value--one of the criteria in the VRIO analysis. Strengths that have been identified in the value chain analysis become possible can-
didates for a sustainable competitive advantage. The VRIO analysis answers whether strengths identified in the value chain analy-
sis meet all criteria to constitute a sustainable competitive advantage.

            · Conduct a value chain analysis for your favorite sports team. Which are the most important primary and support activities?
                Which ones are less important? Which activities, if any, would you outsource to a third party?
            · You probably have used the services of an airline and/or a car rental agency. What were your positive and negative experi-
                ences? How could a value chain analysis help to identify the strengths and weaknesses for these businesses?
            · Let's now apply the value chain analysis to a company. Use the same example of one of your favorite companies that you used
                above with the VRIO analysis.
                     Now apply the value chain framework to that company.

                Use the value chain analysis instrument to structure your analysis, interpretation, and evaluation. What recommen-
                   dations would you make to the company based on your analysis?

Key Takeaways

A value chain represents the full life cycle of a product or service, usually presented as a series of consecutive steps that go into the cre-
ation of a finished product, from its initial design to its arrival at a customer's door. The value chain analysis is another important tool
of internal analysis, providing a systematic overview of all major business functions of the company. When you analyze the value chain,
divide business functions into primary activities and support activities. The primary activities include the business activities that are
immediately necessary and basic for any business to operate. This includes inbound logistics of raw materials being purchased and ware-
housed until they are used in the manufacturing process during business operations. After producing their respective products, they are
shipped to the customer using outbound logistics supported by marketing and sales and by customer service as customer-facing key
activities. In contrast to primary activities, business support activities are not immediately customer-facing or related to the core busi-
ness operations. Support activities include the management of the company, financing, and legal activities, which all make up the firm's
infrastructure. It also includes human resource management, technology development, and innovation management. Finally, procure-
ment is an important support activity. The chain identifies where value is added at each step in the process.
A value chain analysis is a powerful tool to identify strengths and weaknesses in a firm's main business functions. It provides ideas to
push costs out of the business and drive more value creation by focusing on success-critical and strategically important business func-
tions while reallocating resources away from less important functions. This can drive the strategy away from trying to be "everything to
everyone" to instead focus on a few selected core competencies that the company performs really well; in turn, that will drive competitive
differentiation. Use the value chain analysis instrument when you analyze a firm's value chain.

5.7 Conclusion

Resources, capabilities, and core competencies are the backbone of strategy development in terms of how a firm can win in its cho-
sen markets. If these elements are unique, customer-perceivable, and relevant for customers' buying decisions, the company will
win. If a company has resources, capabilities, and core competencies that provide a sustainable competitive advantage, the com-
pany has a strategic right to win and should build its strategy around these few unique characteristics. The resource-based view and
the VRIO analysis help companies to identify these few success-critical and truly differentiating strategy drivers.

Isolating mechanisms are powerful elements of resources, capabilities, and core competencies that often meet all VRIO criteria.
Value chain analysis provides a systematic analysis of all primary and support business functions that help the company to identify
strengths that can be leveraged and weaknesses that need to be addressed in the development of a new strategy. A focus on core
competencies helps companies to position themselves for success with a guideline of "costs out, values in."

resource or capability is valuable, rare, and costly to imitate and the firm is organized to capture value, then it's sustained compet-
itive advantage. If the resource is not valuable, it's competitive advantage. if the resource is valuable but not rare, it's competitive
parity. If the resource is valuable and rare but not costly to imitate, it's temporary competitive advantage. If the resource is valuable,
rare, and costly to imitate but the firm is not organized to capture value, it's unrealized competitive advantage.

6.2 SWOT Framework

A SWOT framework is a tool used to categorize a firm's strengths, weak-
nesses, opportunities, and threats, typically portraying them in a grid with
four quadrants. Strengths and weaknesses are on the top of the grid, and
opportunities and threats are on the bottom of the grid.
In contexts other than the strategic management process, organizations use
a SWOT framework as a standalone tool.

                                                                                                    Figure 6.1: SWOT framework

       Application
            · Consider your search for a professional position after you graduate. Perhaps you already have plans.
                     Are you aiming to join a large company as a subject expert in accounting and information systems, business informa-
                        tion technology and cybersecurity, finance, insurance and business law, hospitality and tourism management, human

                        threats to your plans that you can plan around?
                     Place your strengths and weaknesses in the top of a SWOT tool and the external opportunities and threats you may
                        face in the bottom of a SWOT framework.

     Key Takeaways

     A SWOT framework is a tool used to categorize a firm's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. The framework is typically
     visualized as a grid, with strengths and weaknesses on the top of the grid and opportunities and threats are on the bottom of the grid.
                                                                             6. SYNTHESIZE ANALYSIS AND DETERMINE A FIRM'S STRATEGIC ISSUE | 135

6.3 How a SWOT Framework Is Used in Strategic Management

In strategic management, a SWOT framework is used to synthesize the analysis you have conducted so far. Synthesize means to
review, critically examine, and combine diverse elements into a coherent whole. Synthesis is combining different concepts to create
a new understanding, making a new whole from individual parts.
Think of a time when you wanted to make a large purchase. You gathered and analyzed a wide range of data, considered the rela-
tionships of that data, and decided what to buy based on your research. Perhaps you purchased a computer or another electronic
device for school. Did you investigate different brands? Did you consider the type of chip? How important was RAM to you? Perhaps
weight and size were important. What about price? You synthesized a lot of information to arrive at a decision based on your analy-
sis.
To conduct a SWOT in strategic management, you synthesize the analysis you have conducted so far about a firm's organizational
performance, external environment, and internal environment. This means to review, critically examine, and combine the diverse
elements of your previous analysis into a coherent concept.
When you synthesize the current analysis using a SWOT framework, this is referred to as a SWOT analysis. You are not returning to
the case to conduct additional analysis from the case when you use a SWOT framework.
In strategic management, a SWOT framework is never used as a standalone tool. It is used only after you have completed your analy-
sis of a company, when it is time to synthesize your analysis. In strategic management, once you have completed your SWOT analy-
sis, you use your completed SWOT analysis to determine the firm's strategic issue.

     Key Takeaways

     At this stage of strategic management, you analyze and synthesize the analysis you have conducted so far to complete the SWOT analysis.
     In strategic management, a SWOT framework is never used as a standalone tool, but as a way to determine the firm's strategic issue from
     the analysis so far.

6.4 Synthesize Analysis Using a SWOT Framework

To conduct a robust SWOT analysis, begin by assessing which elements of the analysis you have conducted so far represent
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. This gives you a draft of a SWOT analysis. The next step is to synthesize the infor-
mation in this draft. Once you confirm line of sight and congruence, you have a final SWOT analysis.

Determine Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats

The first step in conducting a SWOT analysis is to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in the elements you
have analyzed thus far in the process. Then you place your previously conducted analysis into the correct categories of a SWOT
analysis.
136 | 6. SYNTHESIZE ANALYSIS AND DETERMINE A FIRM'S STRATEGIC ISSUE
In strategic management, it is important to place the analysis that relates to the external environment of the firm in the bottom
half of the grid, as they are opportunities and threats. External analysis addresses those issues external to a company and outside a
firm's control--the opportunities and threats a company faces.
Then place the analysis you have conducted so far about the company's internal environment on the top of the SWOT framework
as strengths and weaknesses. This is because internal analysis addresses those issues internal to a company and within a firm's con-
trol. Issues within a company's control are the company's strengths and weaknesses.

                Figure 6.2: Synthesize analysis using a SWOT framework
Let's consider the analysis you have conducted so far. You do not place every aspect of your analysis into your SWOT analysis. Decide
which elements of your analysis impact the firm the most, are most relevant to the company, and are most important to the com-
pany. The evaluation step in the analysis you have conducted so far supports you in this assessment. Deciding which elements to
place in the SWOT framework requires critical thinking and judgment.

Organizational Performance

In Chapter 3, you learned how to analyze a firm's organizational environment. You used the organizational performance analysis
instrument to analyze a company's mission, purpose, vision, values, and goals. You analyzed a firm's financial position, its market
                                                                             6. SYNTHESIZE ANALYSIS AND DETERMINE A FIRM'S STRATEGIC ISSUE | 137

position, and other relevant quantitative measures. You also analyzed an organization's balanced scorecard. Your analysis of a firm's
organizational performance produces information that relates to both the extremal and internal environments of a firm.

Synthesis begins with the examination of your analysis of the firm's organizational performance, enabling you to decide which ele-
ments of your analysis relate to the company's external environment and which elements relate to the firm's internal environments.
For example, you may decide that your analysis of a firm's market position relates primarily to the external environment and your
analysis of the company's balanced scorecard may relate predominantly to the internal environment. This requires critical thinking
and judgment.

Next decide whether those elements of your organizational performance analysis that relate primarily to the external environment
represent opportunities or threats. Place those elements that you assess as opportunities in the opportunities box of your SWOT
analysis. Place those elements that you assess as threats in the threats box of your SWOT analysis.

Then decide whether those elements of your organizational performance analysis that relate primarily to the internal environment
represent strengths or weaknesses. Place those elements that you assess as strengths in the strengths box of your SWOT analysis.
Place those elements that you assess as weaknesses in the weaknesses box of your SWOT analysis.

Now that you have analyzed your analysis of the firm's organizational performance and placed this into the correct boxes of your
SWOT analysis, you are now ready to move on to analyzing your external analysis.

External Analysis

In Chapter 4, you learned how to analyze the external environment of a company. You used the PESTEL analysis instrument to ana-
lyze the general environment and the Porter's Five Forces analysis instrument to analyze the industry environment. You used the
strategic group mapping analysis instrument to analyze a firm's strategic group. The findings from your external analysis are placed
in the bottom half of the grid as opportunities and threats because external analysis addresses those issues outside a firm's control.

First decide whether the elements of your external analysis represent opportunities or threats. Place those elements from your
analysis of the external environment that you assess as opportunities in the opportunities box of your SWOT. Place those elements
from your analysis of the external environment that you assess as threats in the threats box of your SWOT.

Now that you have placed your analyses of the firm's organizational performance and external analysis into your SWOT, you are
now ready to move onto analyzing your internal analysis.

Internal Analysis

In Chapter 5, you learned how to analyze the internal environment of a company. You used the VRIO analysis instrument to analyze
a firm's resources, capabilities, and core competencies and the value chain analysis instrument to analyze a company's primary and
secondary activities. The findings from your internal analysis are placed in the top half of the grid as strengths and weaknesses
because internal analysis addresses those issues within a firm's control.

First decide whether the elements of your internal analysis represent strengths or weaknesses. Place those elements from your
internal analysis that you assess as strengths in the strengths box of your SWOT. Place those elements from your internal analysis
that you assess as weaknesses in the weaknesses box of your SWOT.

You have now analyzed the analysis you have conducted so far in the case analysis process, deciding which elements of your analysis
impact the firm the most, are most relevant to the company, and are most important to the company. After critical examination,
you placed those elements of your analysis that relate to the external environment on the bottom of your SWOT analysis as oppor-
tunities and threats and those aspects of your analysis that relate to the internal environment on the top of your SWOT analysis as
strengths and weaknesses. This step of conducting your SWOT analysis provides you with a draft SWOT analysis.
138 | 6. SYNTHESIZE ANALYSIS AND DETERMINE A FIRM'S STRATEGIC ISSUE

Synthesize SWOT Analysis

As you are learning, it is never sufficient in case analysis to simply place information into a framework. You must use critical thinking
and judgment to make decisions. The same is true for synthesizing your previous analysis using a SWOT analysis.
Now that you have completed a draft SWOT analysis, you synthesize the analysis you have placed in your draft.
To synthesize the analysis in your draft SWOT analysis, stand back and review the SWOT analysis. Think of it from a holistic perspec-
tive. Critically examine each element of your previous analysis that you have now placed into your draft SWOT analysis. Combine
elements of your draft that relate. Work with your draft SWOT analysis until you have a succinct and concise analysis that represents
all the essential elements of your draft SWOT analysis.

Confirm Line of Sight and Congruence

Once you have synthesized your analysis in the draft of your SWOT analysis, determine a clear line of sight and congruence between
the analysis from the strategic management frameworks and your SWOT analysis.
A few questions to consider include:

  · Is there a clear line of sight between the analysis from the strategic management frameworks and the SWOT analysis?
         Is there a clear logic behind how the analysis from the strategic management frameworks supports the SWOT analysis?
         Is there a clear logic behind what analysis from the strategic management frameworks is placed in which category of the
            SWOT analysis?

  · Is there congruence between the analysis from the strategic management frameworks and the SWOT analysis?
         Ensure that everything that is included in your SWOT analysis is included in an analysis instrument.
         Ensure that nothing is present in your SWOT analysis that is not included in an analysis instrument.

This gives you your final SWOT analysis.
This is step four in case analysis.

  Application
       · Let's apply the SWOT analysis to a company. Use the same example of one of your favorite companies that you used with the
          PESTEL, Porter's Five Forces, strategic group mapping, VRIO, and value chain analyses in the previous two chapters.
                Place your analysis from the external environment (PESTEL, Porter's Five Forces, strategic group mapping) on the bot-
                   tom of the SWOT grid as opportunities and threats.
                Place your analysis from the external environment (VRIO and value chain analysis) on the top of the SWOT grid as
                   strengths and weaknesses. This gives you your draft SWOT analysis.
                Synthesize the information in your SWOT analysis and confirm line of sight and congruence to determine your final
                   SWOT analysis.

Key Takeaways

To conduct a SWOT analysis, begin by accurately assessing which elements of the analysis you have conducted far represent strengths,
weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Place the analysis that relates to the external environment of the firm in the bottom half of the
grid as opportunities and threats because external analysis addresses those issues outside a firm's control. Place the analysis you have
conducted so far that relates to the internal environment of the company on the top of a SWOT framework as strengths and weaknesses
because internal analysis addresses those issues within a firm's control. This gives you a draft SWOT analysis. Then synthesize the analy-
sis in your draft. Confirm line of sight and congruence. Now you have a final SWOT analysis. It is only from a robust SWOT analysis that it
is possible to determine a firm's strategic issue.

6.5 Strategic Issue: What It Is and Why It Is Important

In addition to synthesizing organizational performance and external and internal analysis, executives and analysts use a SWOT
analysis to begin the process of identifying a firm's strategic issue. You also use a SWOT analysis to determine a firm's strategic issue
when conducting a case analysis. Before considering how a SWOT analysis is used to begin determining a firm's strategic issue, it is
first important to understand what a strategic issue is and why it is important.

Strategic Issue

We briefly introduced the concept of a strategic issue in the first chapter. We now cover its important role for any firm in greater
detail.

A firm's strategic issue is the most important, urgent, broad, and long-term matter that the company is facing. Strategic issues are
the result of multiple causes in multiples areas of a business and require significant organizational talent and resources to resolve.
Addressing a strategic issue moves a firm toward its mission, purpose, and vision and should therefore be congruent with its values.
A strategic issue focuses on the present and specific organizational context, and considers what is happening with this firm, at this
time, in this place, and under these circumstances.

Let's unpack this definition:

A firm's strategic issue is the most important, urgent, broad, and long-term matter that the company is facing.

The first thing to notice is that the definition refers to one strategic issue. We distinguish between major areas of strategic concern,
and a firm's strategic issue. Firms likely have more than one major area of strategic concern. Addressing multiple areas of strategic
concern in one strategic issue has the advantage of clearly determining the relationships between the major areas of strategic con-
cern. However, there is no one right answer to whether a company can have multiple strategic issues. It is more important to accu-
rately capture all that is going on strategically for a firm than it is to be concerned with whether the firm's strategic challenge is
expressed as one or multiple strategic issues. We find it easiest to learn one approach at a time. Therefore, we present multiple areas
of strategic concern written in one strategic issue.

A strategic issue is the most important concern that the company is facing. A strategic issue is not a trivial matter. It is very important
and must be addressed. A strategic issue also is urgent. If the strategic issue is not addressed, there are likely serious consequences
for the company. These could include loss of market share, loss of industry position, or even death. A strategic issue is broad. It cap-
tures the big picture of what the firm is facing. A strategic issue is long term. It is not something the company can deal with imme-
diately.
                                                                             6. SYNTHESIZE ANALYSIS AND DETERMINE A FIRM'S STRATEGIC ISSUE | 141

Strategic issues are the result of multiple causes in multiples areas of a business and require significant organizational talent and
resources to resolve.

Notice here that a strategic issue has multiple causes in multiples areas of a business. This means that strategic issues are complex,
with related and overlapping causes. Because of their complex nature, they have significant impact across multiple areas of a com-
pany. Their complexity also means that they are not easily or quickly resolved. They require both talent and resources to address,
and a company must be committed to solving them.

Addressing a strategic issue moves a firm toward its mission, purpose, and vision and should be congruent with its values.

Everything a firm does needs to be aligned to its mission, purpose, vision, and values.

A strategic issue focuses on the present and specific organizational context, addressing what is happening with this firm, at this time, in
this place, and under these circumstances.

There is no one right formula for the structure of a strategic issue. When learning to identify a strategic issue, one good way to write
a strategic issue is to begin with "How can [firm's name] ..."

When first learning what a strategic issue is, it is easy to write a strategic issue that is either too narrow or too broad. There are
several reasons why a strategic issue may be too narrow. Many business students concentrate on functional areas such as busi-
ness information technology, accounting, human resources, and entrepreneurship. This functional expertise is a strong asset when
beginning a business career, but it can also narrow focus and sometimes lead to strategic issues that are aligned with a particular
business function, such as marketing.

Another reason for identifying a strategic issue that is too narrow is the way that business education polishes skills in identifying
problems and then immediately identifying solutions. This is an important skill in business. However, in strategic management,
problems are identified through analyzing a company using strategic management tools. From those, a strategic issue is identified.
Then strategic alternatives offer solutions to the issue. The extra step of identifying a broad concern from the problem is not nec-
essarily unique to strategic management, but it may be a less-polished skill for many business students who have spent their busi-
ness educations honing their skills in immediately identifying solutions. In strategic management, you analyze a case to identify
the problem, then you determine a strategic issue before you move on to recommending solutions in the form of strategic alterna-
tives.

Strategic issues that are too narrow often contain an action. Actions and solutions are identified later in the process as strategic
alternatives.

When a strategic issue is too narrow and needs to be amended, a common response can be to then write a strategic issue that is too
broad. If a strategic issue applies to all companies, then it is too broad. For example, a strategic issue reading "How can [firm's name]
make a profit?" is too broad because that is relevant to all companies, not just the firm that is being analyzed.

If a strategic issue always applies to the company being analyzed, not just right now, then the strategic issue is too broad. For exam-
ple, if a technology company is being analyzed, then "How can [firm's name] remain an industry leader in technology?" is too broad
because this will always be relevant to the company being analyzed.

That is why a robust strategic issue must address what is happening with this firm, at this time, in this place, and under these cir-
cumstances, which can help focus a strategic issue that is too narrow or too broad. It focuses on the current context of the company
being analyzed.

Companies with strong strategic management talent, processes, resources, and strategic leaders are more likely to be able to con-
tinuously address strategy in a dynamic and ongoing way. This positions them to amend their strategy incrementally to remain
142 | 6. SYNTHESIZE ANALYSIS AND DETERMINE A FIRM'S STRATEGIC ISSUE
industry leaders. Failing to continue to invest in strategic management and leadership can lead to a company losing its position as
an industry leader. Even industry leaders face significant challenges from their external and internal environments.
More often, strategic issues arise from shifts in the general environment, the industry environment, and the competitive environ-
ment, from organizational crises, or from other circumstances that are either unforeseen or which the company is insufficiently pre-
pared to address. In these cases, failing to address a strategic issue quickly and thoroughly can lead to firm decline or even death.

6.6 Determine Major Areas of Strategic Concern

Now that it is clear what a strategic issue is and why it is important, it is possible to begin determining a firm's strategic issue. There
are multiple ways to do so, and as with the number of strategic issues or the wording of a strategic issue, there is no one right
approach. Regardless of the specific approach you use to determine a strategic issue, it is essential that you base your strategic issue
on your completed SWOT analysis. A strategic issue must reflect the analysis you have conducted so far of organizational perfor-
mance and the external and internal environments, which you have now synthesized in your SWOT analysis.
                                                                             6. SYNTHESIZE ANALYSIS AND DETERMINE A FIRM'S STRATEGIC ISSUE | 143
When learning to determine a strategic issue, it can be tempting to rush to define a strategic issue for a firm without using a struc-
tured approach. As you work with a case, you may begin to see areas a firm needs to address. Deciding a strategic issue without
basing it on robust analysis is not a reliable or sufficient method. Strategic issues must be grounded in the thorough and robust
analysis you have conducted so far using strategic management frameworks and your SWOT analysis.

Since students new to strategic management often benefit from having a specific process to follow to determine a strategic issue,
we now review one approach to determine a strategic issue. First determine themes in your SWOT analysis. Use these themes to
determine a firm's major areas of strategic concern. Then confirm line of sight and congruence between the themes in your SWOT
analysis and the major areas of strategic concern.

Determine Themes in Your SWOT Analysis

To determine a firm's major areas of strategic concern, first determine themes in your SWOT analysis. Critically think about each
strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat in your SWOT analysis, then identify which ones relate and how they relate.

A few questions to consider include:

Are there themes within the categories?

  · In the strengths?
  · In the weaknesses?
  · In the opportunities?
  · In the threats?

Are there themes between the categories?

  · Between any two, three, or four of the categories: strengths, weak-
      nesses, opportunities, threats?

Keep working with your SWOT analysis until all strengths, weaknesses, Figure 6.3: Determine themes in your SWOT analysis
opportunities, and threats are assigned to a theme.

Let's use an example to illustrate this process. Imagine that you have determined three themes in your SWOT analysis: competition,
innovation, and technology.

Determine Major Areas of Strategic Concern

Next determine major areas of strategic concern from the themes you have just identified in your SWOT analysis. Major areas of
strategic concern are the most urgent aspects of strategy that a firm needs to address immediately to ensure company success now
and in the future.

Ensure each major area of strategic concern is mutually exclusive from the others, making them each distinct.

The number of major areas of strategic concern is determined by the analysis of the company's current situation. Three is a good
guideline because most companies are facing at least three major areas of strategic concern, and three major areas of strategic con-
cern are likely the most a firm can effectively attend to at one time.
144 | 6. SYNTHESIZE ANALYSIS AND DETERMINE A FIRM'S STRATEGIC ISSUE

In our example, the three themes in your SWOT analy-
sis--competition, innovation, and technology--are the major
areas of strategic concern.

Finally, confirm the line of sight and congruence between the
themes in your SWOT analysis and the major areas of strategic
concern.

A few questions to consider include:

· Is there a clear line of sight between the SWOT themes

and the major areas of strategic concern?                 Figure 6.4: Major areas of strategic concern

 Is it clear how the SWOT themes support the major

areas of strategic concern?

· Is there congruence between the SWOT themes and the major areas of strategic concern?
      Ensure that everything that is included in your SWOT themes is included in the major areas of strategic concern.
      Ensure that nothing present in your SWOT themes is omitted in the major areas of strategic concern.

This is step six in case analysis.

6. Determine major areas of strategic concern.

   a. Identify the major areas of strategic concern from the SWOT analysis and any additional analysis of strategies.
   b. Ensure line of sight and congruence between the SWOT analysis and the major areas of strategic concern.

We move to step 6 of case analysis because step 5 is "as appropriate to the case, analyze strategies: corporate level, business level,
innovation, sustainability and ethics, technology, and multinational strategies." That step addresses information that may be con-
sidered when determining a strategic issue but is not central to learning how to determine a strategic issue, so it is omitted here.

Application

    · Consider your SWOT analysis that you completed above.

             Determine themes in your SWOT analysis.
             Determine three major areas of strategic concern from the themes in your SWOT analysis.
             Confirm the line of sight and congruence between the themes in your SWOT analysis and the major areas of strategic

                concern.
               6. SYNTHESIZE ANALYSIS AND DETERMINE A FIRM'S STRATEGIC ISSUE | 145

Key Takeaways

A strategic issue must reflect the analysis you have conducted so far of organizational performance and the external and internal envi-
ronments, which you have now synthesized in your SWOT analysis. To determine a strategic issue, determine themes in your SWOT
analysis, then identify major areas of strategic concern from the themes you identified in your SWOT analysis. Major areas of strategic
concern are significant strategic areas that a firm needs to address immediately to ensure company success now and in the future. Each
major area of strategic concern must be mutually exclusive. Aim for about three major areas of strategic concern. Lastly, confirm line of
sight and congruence between the themes in your SWOT analysis and the major areas of strategic concern.

6.7 Determine a Strategic Issue

Now that you have determined three major areas of strategic concern, it is possible to continue with the process of identifying a
firm's strategic issue. First, rank the major areas of strategic concern, placing them in descending order of importance to the firm.
Then identify the relationships between the major areas of strategic concern, and write phrases that capture these relationships.
Place the phrases between the major areas of strategic concern. This is your draft strategic issue.

           Figure 6.5: Identify a strategic issue

Confirm line of sight and congruence between the major areas of strategic concern and the draft of the strategic issue.

A few questions to consider include:

  · Is there a clear line of sight between the major areas of strategic concern and the draft strategic issue?
         Is there a clear logic between the major areas of strategic concern and the draft?

  · Is there congruence between the major areas of strategic concern and the draft strategic issue?
         Ensure that everything that is included in your major areas of strategic concern is included in the draft.
         Ensure that nothing present in your major areas of strategic concern is omitted in the draft strategic issue.
146 | 6. SYNTHESIZE ANALYSIS AND DETERMINE A FIRM'S STRATEGIC ISSUE
Review the draft of the strategic issue from a macro, big-picture orientation that considers the entire situation facing the firm. Stand
back and critically think about your draft strategic issue from a holistic perspective and finalize it based on your in-depth knowledge
of the case.
This is step seven in case analysis.

       7. Determine strategic issue.

           a. Determine the strategic issue from the major areas of strategic concern.
           b. Ensure line of sight and congruence between the major areas of strategic concern and the strategic issue.

In our example, you determined that competition, innovation, and technology are the major areas of strategic concern. Let's say you
rank these in order of importance to the case as follows: innovation, technology, and competition.
Now you determine the relationship between the major areas of concern: firm needs to innovate so that it can address technology
and deal with competition. This is your draft strategic issue.
Now stand back and critically think about your draft strategic issue from a holistic perspective and finalize it based on your in-depth
knowledge of the case. Your final strategic issue may be "How can [company] continue to innovate so that it can successfully capi-
talize on rapidly changing technology in an increasingly competitive market?" In choosing this focus, you have moved from a draft
strategic issue to a more refined and final strategic issue.
You arrived at this final strategic issue through your in-depth knowledge of the case. You know that the company is a leader in inno-
vation, so you frame innovation as something they are going to continue to do.
You also know that, although they are a leader in innovating to use existing and especially new technology, developing new tech-
nology is not aligned to their mission and vision. Therefore, you frame your final strategic issue as capitalizing on rapidly changing
technology. You know they want to use the latest technology but not develop it.
Finally, you know that, while their market position has been historically strong, they have had some very recent challenges to their
market position from some new companies in the market. You frame the final strategic issue as competing in an increasingly com-
petitive market.

                                should be congruent with its values. A strategic issue focuses on the present and specific organizational con-
                                text, addressing what is happening with this firm, at this time, in this place, and under these circumstances.

     Key Takeaways

     To identify a firm's strategic issue from the major areas of strategic concern, rank the major areas of strategic concern, placing them in
     descending order of importance to the firm. Identify the relationships between the major areas of strategic concern, and write phrases
     that capture these relationships, placing the phrases between the major areas of strategic concern. This arrangement is your draft strate-
     gic issue. Confirm line of sight and congruence between the major areas of strategic concern and the draft strategic issue. Review the
     draft from a macro orientation that considers the entire situation facing the firm. Critically think about your draft strategic issue from a
     holistic perspective, and finalize it based on your in-depth knowledge of the case.

6.8 Determine Strategic Alternatives

Once you have determined a strategic issue, the next step in case analysis is to identify strategic alternatives that address the issue.
A strategic alternative is an action that addresses and has the potential to resolve every aspect of a strategic issue.
All strategic alternatives resolve the same strategic issue, just in different ways. Strategic alternatives address root causes; they do
not address or mask symptoms. Strategic alternatives are forward-looking. They do not fix yesterday's problems. Strategic alterna-
tives are realistic in both practical and ethical senses. They are economically viable. It is important that strategic alternatives are well
developed and explained so they can be implemented by the firm.
Identify at least three strategic alternatives that address all areas in the strategic issue. Then confirm line of sight and congruence
between the strategic issue and the strategic alternatives.
A few questions to consider include:

  · Is there a clear line of sight between the strategic issue and the strategic alternatives?
         Is there a clear logic between the strategic issue and the strategic alternatives?

  · Is there congruence between the strategic issue and the strategic alternatives?
         Ensure that everything that is included in the strategic issue is addressed by each strategic alternative.
         Ensure that nothing present in the strategic issue is omitted by each strategic alternative.
148 | 6. SYNTHESIZE ANALYSIS AND DETERMINE A FIRM'S STRATEGIC ISSUE

Most often, complete and immediate resolution of the strategic issue may
not be realistic. Because strategic issues are complex and the result of mul-
tiple causes, strategic alternatives may begin by mitigating the circum-
stances causing the strategic issue or by aiming to improve the situation if a
full resolution is not immediately possible.

In our example, you determined the firm's strategic issue to be "How can
[company] continue to innovate so that it can successfully capitalize on
rapidly changing technology in an increasingly competitive market?" Next
determine three strategic alternatives that address the strategic issue. This
requires critical thinking and judgment and a thorough knowledge of the
case.

One strategic alternative may be "partner with [technology company]." From
your knowledge of the case, you know which company the firm is likely to
consider. You also know that the firm you are analyzing is not in direct com- Figure 6.6: Strategic alternatives
petition with the technology company, so a partnership may be a viable
option to explore. It could be mutually advantageous for both companies. Perhaps you also know that the firm engages in a variety
of cooperative relationships with other firms, so their culture would support such an alternative.

Another strategic alternative may be "invest heavily in talent acquisition and succession planning specifically aimed at innovation
leaders." You know from your knowledge of the case that the founders of the company remain their corporate leaders and are instru-
mental in setting the culture of innovation in the firm. However, while this hands-on approach was a key to their early success, the
firm's age and maturity and changing market conditions mean it is time to ensure the company's early success can continue into the
future.

A third strategic alternative may be "backwardly integrate into their value chain and acquire [technology company]." You know that
one of their current suppliers is a small technology company that may be inclined to consider this option. This would require the
firm to change their mission and vision to align with becoming a producer of the technology rather than just a consumer of it.

This is step eight in the case analysis process.

       8. Determine strategic alternatives.

           a. Determine the strategic issue from the major areas of strategic concern.
           b. Ensure line of sight and congruence between the major areas of strategic concern and the strategic issue.

       Application
            · Consider your strategic issue that you determined above.
                     Identify three strategic alternatives that address all areas in the strategic issue. Explain how each strategic alternative
                        addresses all areas in the strategic issue.
                     Confirm line of sight and congruence between the strategic issue and the strategic alternatives.

     Key Takeaways

     A strategic alternative is an action that addresses and has the potential to resolve every aspect of a strategic issue. All strategic alterna-
     tives resolve the same strategic issue, just in different ways. Strategic alternatives address root causes, are forward-looking, are realistic
     practically and ethically, are economically viable, and can be implemented by the firm. Aim for about three strategic alternatives.

6.9 Evaluate Strategic Alternatives

Once you have determined three strategic alternatives, you need to recommend one. If you are conducting an abbreviated case
analysis, you likely will not evaluate your three strategic alternatives.
If you evaluate the strategic alternatives, first identify the criteria you plan to use to evaluate the strategic alternatives. The criteria
may vary depending on the specifics of the company being analyzed and may include, but are not limited to, the degree to which
the strategic alternative resolves the strategic issue. Sometimes complete and immediate resolution of the strategic issue may not
be realistic.
Another criterion to consider when evaluating strategic alternatives is whether they are consistent with the firm's mission, purpose,
vision, and values. Consider whether the strategic alternatives are consistent with the external and internal environments of the
firm. Strategic alternatives should also be consistent with existing or needed firm resources, capabilities, and core competencies,
and they should create a competitive advantage for the firm. Another criterion to consider is whether the strategic alternatives add
value to the firm overall.
Whether strategic alternatives are financially realistic for the firm and how they impact a firm's profitability also are important.
Ask whether the strategic alternatives are realistic given the economic resources of the firm, as recommending a strategic alterna-
tive that a firm cannot fund is not helpful. Consider whether the strategic alternatives enable the firm to earn a profit by asking if
they add value and increase price or if they add value without increasing costs. In addition, you must consider whether the strategic
alternatives improve profitability.
Use the table below to evaluate the strategic alternatives against the criteria you choose. Delete criteria that you do not use, and
add criterion that you use that do not appear in the table. Include a robust description of whether and in what ways each strategic
alternative meets each criterion.

Figure 6.7: Evaluate strategic alternatives

The last task for the strategic alternatives is to explain how each alternative meets the evaluation criteria. Give a full and clear expla-
nation.

This is step nine in the case analysis process.

9. Evaluate strategic alternatives.

   a. Determine criteria to evaluate the strategic alternatives.
   b. Use criteria to evaluate the strategic alternatives.
   c. Clearly indicate how the strategic alternatives meet the evaluation criteria.

Application

    · Consider your strategic alternatives that you determined above.
             Use figure 6.7 to identify criteria to evaluate the strategic alternatives.
             Explain how each strategic alternative meets the evaluation criteria.

Key Takeaways

Once you have determined three strategic alternatives, you need to recommend one, which is achieved by evaluating the alternatives
(unless you are conducting an abbreviated case analysis). If you evaluate the strategic alternatives, identify the criteria you plan to use to
evaluate them. The criteria may vary depending on the specifics of the company being analyzed. Use the criteria to evaluate each alter-
native, explaining how each strategic alternative meets the evaluation criteria.

6.10 Recommend a Strategic Alternative

Once you have determined three strategic alternatives, you now recommend one. If you conduct an abbreviated case analysis, you
may not have used criteria to evaluate your strategic alternatives. In this case, use critical thinking to recommend the best strategic
alternative. You may still explain why you chose the strategic alternative that you did. If you use criteria to evaluate your strategic
alternatives, explain how the strategic alternative you recommend best meets the criteria used.

This is step ten in the case analysis process.

10. Recommend strategic alternative.
   a. Recommend one strategic alternative using the evaluation criteria.

  Application
       · Consider how each strategic alternative meets the evaluation criteria you used above.
       · Recommend a strategic alternative that best meets the criteria you use.
       · Explain how the strategic alternative you recommend best meets the criteria you use.

Key Takeaways

Once you have determined three strategic alternatives, you now recommend one either using critical thinking or criteria you identify.

6.11 Design an Implementation Plan

Now that you have recommended one strategic alternative, you may design an implementation plan to execute the recommended
strategic alternative. As with the criteria to evaluate the strategic alternatives, implementation plans may vary depending on the
specifics of the company being analyzed.

Implementation plans may include assumptions regarding implementation of the strategic alternative, such as changes in
demand, price, and costs that factor in competitor reactions, customers' willingness to pay a higher price, and realistic cost projec-
tions.

Implementation plans outline an implementation timeline that may include stages of the implementation plan, duration of each
stage of the implementation plan, activities in each implementation stage, duration of activities in each implementation stage, and
who is responsible for each activity.

New resources required will likely be addressed by an implementation plan. These include financial resources, such as available
cash, stocks, and loans. The human resources of time and talent are also important. Other resources to consider are whether the
firm has sufficient facilities and appropriate technology.

When designing an implementation plan, it is helpful to consider whether new or revised value chain activities are needed. Like-
wise, ask if new resources, capabilities, or core competencies are required. Consider whether changes are needed in organization
structure or firm infrastructure, such as new positions and restructuring. Changes in organizational systems, such as incentive pro-
grams that will support the success of changes, may be helpful.

Use the table below to design the implementation plan against the criteria you choose. Delete criteria that you do not use, and add
criteria that you use that do not appear in the table. Place a robust description of whether and in what ways the strategic alternative
you recommend to be implemented meets each criterion.

This is step eleven in the case analysis process.

     strategic alternative. As with the criteria to evaluate the strategic alternatives, implementation plans may vary depending on the specifics
     of the company being analyzed.

6.12 Confirm Line of Sight and Congruence across the Entire Case Analysis

Line of sight and congruence are important throughout the case analysis process. Up to now, you have considered line of sight and
congruence within a strategic management tool, among strategic management frameworks, and between steps in the case analy-
sis process. It is now time to assess line of sight and congruence across the entire case analysis. Review the entire strategic analysis,
ensure there is direct and clear logic connecting all elements in the strategic analysis, and confirm there is a one-to-one relationship
between two or more things.
This is step twelve in the case analysis process.
154 | 6. SYNTHESIZE ANALYSIS AND DETERMINE A FIRM'S STRATEGIC ISSUE

       12. Confirm line of sight and congruence across the entire case analysis.

       Application
            · Review the entire strategic analysis you have conducted on one of your favorite companies.
            · Confirm there is line of sight and congruence across your entire analysis.

     Key Takeaways

     As a final check, assess line of sight and congruence across the entire case analysis.

6.13 Write and/or Present the Case Analysis

Now that you have conducted a case analysis, you will likely write it as an assignment and/or present it. A case analysis is not a data
dump of every point of information produced. It is a presentation of a coherent and logical narrative.
This is step thirteen in the case analysis process.

       13. Write and/or present case analysis.

       Application
            · Review the entire strategic analysis you have conducted on one of your favorite companies.
            · Determine a coherent and logical narrative to present your analysis.
            · Discuss how you can avoid your case analysis being a data dump of every point of information you produced.

Key Takeaways

When you have completed your analysis, write it as an assignment and/or present it.

6.14 Conclusion

In strategic management, a SWOT framework is used to synthesize the analysis you have conducted so far. When you synthesize
the analysis using a SWOT framework, this is referred to as a SWOT analysis. In strategic management, a SWOT framework is never
used as a standalone tool. It is used only after you have completed your analysis of a company to synthesize that analysis. In strate-
gic management, once you have completed your SWOT analysis, you use your completed SWOT analysis to determine the firm's
strategic issue.

A firm's strategic issue is the most important, broad, long-term, and urgent matter that the company is facing. Strategic issues are
the result of multiple causes in multiples areas of a business. They require significant organizational talent and resources to resolve.
Addressing a strategic issue moves a firm toward its mission and vision while supporting its values. A strategic issue addresses what
is happening with this firm, at this time, in this place, and under these circumstances. It is focused on the present and specific con-
text.

To determine a strategic issue, determine themes in your SWOT analysis, determine major areas of strategic concern, write a draft
strategic issue, and finalize it based on your knowledge of the case. Determine strategic alternatives, which are actions that address
and have the potential to resolve every aspect of a strategic issue. Evaluate and recommend a strategic alternative, develop an
implementation plan to implement your recommended strategic alternative, and present your case analysis.

     Demonstrate Your Knowledge, Skills, and Competence

Use these questions to test your knowledge of the chapter:

   1. Describe a SWOT framework and how it is utilized in strategic management. Explain why you place your external analysis on the
        bottom of the grid and your internal analysis on the top of the grid. Discuss why a SWOT analysis is never used as a standalone
        tool in strategic management.

   2. Unpack the definition of a strategic issue to be sure you understand all its critical elements.
   3. Describe how you determine the major areas of strategic concern for a firm.
   4. Describe how to use major areas of strategic concern to identify a company's strategic issue.
   5. Describe the criteria you may use to evaluate a firm's strategic alternatives and how you would use these to recommend a strate-

        gic alternative.
   6. Describe the criteria you may use to design an implementation plan.
   7. Describe what confirming line of sight and congruence across the entire case analysis involves and why this is essential to a

        robust case analysis.
156 | 6. SYNTHESIZE ANALYSIS AND DETERMINE A FIRM'S STRATEGIC ISSUE

     By answering these questions, you have demonstrated your thorough knowledge of how to synthesize your analysis and determine a
     firm's strategic issue. This is essential to robust case analysis. Well done!

7.1 Introduction

You have now completed your strategic analysis. You analyzed a company's overall organizational performance and its external and
internal environments. You synthesized the analysis using a SWOT analysis and determined the firm's strategic issue and strategic
alternatives.
This chapter focuses on how firms use strategic analysis to formulate strategy. You learn strategy formulation beginning at the
broadest level of a firm--the corporate level. Then in the next chapter, you learn about business-level strategy, which is the strategy
all firms formulate at the strategic business unit level. In Part V, you learn about four strategies that are embedded in business-
level strategy: innovation strategy, sustainability and ethics strategy, technology strategy, and multinational strategy.
Firms use strategic analysis to formulate strategy. When you conduct a case analysis, you analyze the strategies companies have for-
mulated for their effectiveness and congruence with the firm's mission, purpose, vision, and values as well as their other strategies.
In this chapter, you learn about corporate-level strategy, synergy, and the role synergy plays in corporate-level strategy. Next you
learn how diversification, including related and unrelated diversification, is used by firm executives to address corporate-level strat-
egy. Then you learn how company leaders use vertical integration, including forward vertical integration and backward vertical
integration, to address a firm's corporate-level strategy. You also learn how geographical scope is used to address a company's cor-
160 | 7. FORMULATE CORPORATE-LEVEL STRATEGY
porate-level strategy. Additionally, you learn about portfolio planning and the BCG matrix, a model for assessing a firm's portfolio.
Finally, you learn how corporate-level strategy is relevant to new business graduates.

7.2 Corporate-Level Strategy

Let's begin by explaining corporate-level strategy.

Where Are We Going?

Recall that there are three stages to the strategic management process--strategic analysis, strategy formulation, and strategy
implementation--and each stage aligns with a foundational question of strategic management. You have now completed your
strategic analysis, which addresses the question "Where are we?" Strategy formulation begins to answer "Where are we going?"
Lastly, strategy implementation addresses "How are we going to get there?" Corporate-level strategy is the first strategy you learn,
and like all strategy formulation, it addresses the question of where a firm is going.

C-Suite and Board of Directors

There are three levels of strategy in an organization: corporate-level, business-level, and functional-level. Strategy is formulated at
all three levels. Corporate-level strategy is the broadest level of strategy. The corporate level of a company consists of the C-suite,
and if the company is large enough, it includes the board of directors.

Figure 7.1: Three levels of strategy
                                                                                                           7. FORMULATE CORPORATE-LEVEL STRATEGY | 161

Strategy can be described as a firm's answer to three critical strategic questions that every organization needs to answer. "Where
to play?" is answered at the corporate level with corporate-level strategy. "How to win?" is addressed in strategic business units by
business-level strategy, and the third question, "Have we earned a right to win?", is addressed by strategies that are embedded in
business-level strategy, such as innovation strategy, sustainability and ethics strategy, technology strategy, and multinational strat-
egy.

Where to Play?

"Where to play?" investigates where the firm is going to compete, considering which industries, markets, market segments, busi-
nesses, and regions in which the firm wants to operate (or play). This is largely determined by the firm's assessment of the attractive-
ness and profit potential of alternative markets, market segments, and businesses and the synergies between them. The answers
to the question of where to play also provide important solutions to issues related to the allocation of limited company resources
to different businesses. In this sense, it is also important for every organization to decide where not to play. Overall, "where to play"
strategy can be described as the firm's search for markets and market segments that are attractive today and in the future.

Therefore, formulating corporate-level strategy focuses on where a firm is going--its direction for the future. Corporate-level strat-
egy is the broadest level of strategy and is the responsibility of senior executives and the board of directors. Corporate-level strategy
further answers the question where a company is going to "play": where it is going to compete.

Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous (VUCA) Environment

When executives analyze their organizational environments, they consider factors that relate to both the external environment and
the internal environment of the firm. The external analysis focuses on an outside-in perspective of the firm. The internal analysis
focuses on an inside-out perspective of the firm. You analyze companies through these same lenses when you conduct a case analy-
sis.

When strategic management leaders and managers formulate strategy, they focus on an outside-in perspective. All successful
strategies are driven by outside-in perspectives, including corporate-level and business-level strategy as well as the strategies
embedded in business-level strategies, such as innovation, sustainability and ethics, technology, and multinational strategies.

This means that companies need to carefully monitor their external environment, analyzing trends and developing strategies that
are forward-looking. Firms must navigate an external environment that is volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA),
where change and disruption have become the new normal.

Volatility refers to rapid and unpredictable changes in the environment and can include many things, such as sudden shifts in con-
sumer demand, disruptive technology like the rise of AI, and fluctuating stock prices. Uncertainty means lack of clear information
and predictability and may include things such as the effects of climate change and unanticipated competitor moves like the launch
of a new product or service. Complexity occurs when there are many interrelated factors and one area changes, causing long-rang-
ing ripple effects; this makes it challenging to fully understand and manage the possible ramifications of proposed actions. The
global supply chain responding to tariffs is an excellent example of complexity. Finally, ambiguity means there are multiple cor-
rect answers with various tradeoffs, making decision-making a challenge; it can also mean there are multiple interpretations to the
same situation, making finding a correct answer challenging. Companies that conduct business globally face significant ambiguity,
including customer reactions to foreign products and the impact of foreign regulations.

A VUCA environment is characterized by all these factors intertwined, further complicating strategic analysis, strategy formulation,
and strategy implementation. As you know, strategic management is a structured process to analyze, evaluate, and interpret infor-
mation to support evidenced-based decisions. The data-driven decisions of strategic management all occur in a VUCA environment.
162 | 7. FORMULATE CORPORATE-LEVEL STRATEGY

Synergy

Corporate-level strategy seeks ways to generate synergy. Synergy means that the whole is greater or better than the sum of its parts.
In business, synergy occurs when two or more strategic business units or businesses perform more effectively together than they
do independently. To review, a strategic business unit is a fully functional unit of a business that has its own vision and direction and
may be part of a larger organizational unit like a division. It may be based on markets served, products offered, or regions served.
Smaller firms may have only one strategic business unit, and large corporations may have multiple. Firms gain synergy in various
ways, such as by sharing administrative overhead expenses like accounting, human resources, and sales and marketing when two
business units are combined. This is an opportunity to capture operational efficiency.

Focus

Corporate-level strategy is a companywide strategy that focuses on creating and maintaining a firm's competitive advantage by cre-
ating synergy within and between multiple industries, markets, market segments, and businesses, across multiple industry value
chain(s), and in different geographical locations. The industry value chain concept is reviewed in section 7.4.
Therefore, corporate-level strategy focuses on these questions:

 1. In what industries, markets, market segments, and businesses should a firm operate? This is a question of diversification.
 2. In what stage of the industry value chain(s) should the company participate? This is a question of vertical integration.
 3. Where should the organization compete geographically? This is a question of geographical scope.

       Application
            · Firms operate in a VUCA environment, and so do individuals.
                     Think about your job search.
                     Identify and discuss how you will face a volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous environment when you try to
                        secure a position after graduation.

     Key Takeaways

     Like all strategy formulation, corporate-level strategy addresses the broad question of where a firm is going. Corporate-level strategy is
     the broadest level of strategy and is the responsibility of senior executives and the board of directors. Corporate-level strategy further
     answers the question where a company is going to compete. Corporate-level strategy is a companywide strategy that focuses on creating
     and maintaining a firm's competitive advantage by creating synergy within and between multiple industries, markets, market segments,
     and businesses, across multiple industry value chain(s), and in different geographical locations. Diversification refers to the question of
     what industries, markets, market segments, and businesses firms should operate in. Vertical integration considers the stage of the indus-
     try value chain(s) at which the company should participate. Geographical scope refers to the question of where an organization should
     compete in the world.

7.3 Diversification

In what industries, markets, market segments, and businesses a firm should operate is a question of diversification.
Let's first clarify the distinction between differentiation and diversification.

Differentiation

Differentiation is how a company makes its products distinct from its competitors. Apple makes a Mac distinct from a PC and an
iPhone different from a Galaxy phone.

Diversification

Diversification refers to how a company simultaneously deals
with different products and services in different industries,
markets, market segments, and businesses. After the firm
decides which industries, markets, market segments, and busi-
nesses it wants to operate in, it then decides which products
and services it is going to offer.

For example, Apple's range of products--desktop computers,
laptops, iPhones, iPads, and watches--represent product
diversification. Another example of product diversification is
L'Oréal. L'Oréal initially focused on hair products and diversi-
fied its product lines to include skincare and cosmetics.

It is diversification, not differentiation, that is the focus of cor-  Figure 7.2: L'Oréal
porate-level strategy. There is a strong business case for diver-
sification. Diversification helps with the firm's risk
management because the firm doesn't "put all of its eggs in one
164 | 7. FORMULATE CORPORATE-LEVEL STRATEGY

basket." Through diversification, a company spreads its risk by participating in different industries, markets, market segments, and
businesses. Beyond risk management, diversification allows the firm to leverage its resources, capabilities, and core competencies
into different industries, which drives growth for the firm.

There are multiple types of diversification to consider. You will likely consider diversification from multiple points of view through-
out your business education. As it relates to corporate-level strategy, we focus on two types of diversification: related diversification
and unrelated diversification. One important subcategory is geographic diversification. In corporate-level strategy, geographical
diversification is covered in questions of geographical scope.

To understand related and unrelated diversification, it is helpful to understand single business firms and dominant business firms
first.

Single Business Firm

A single business firm is a firm that derives 95 percent or more of its revenues from one business.

Dominant Business Firm

A dominant business firm derives between 70 percent and 95 percent of its revenues from one business.

Related Diversification

Related diversification refers to expanding into new and similar markets, market segments, and businesses in a new industry that
has similarities to a firm's current industry or industries. In contrast to a single business firm or a dominant business firm, a com-
pany that engages in a related diversification strategy receives less than 70 percent of its revenues from a single business and the
remaining revenue from a business or businesses that are related to the primary business. Related diversifiIt also encourages and
supports synergies.

For example, Unilever was originally a soap manufacturer but engaged in related diversification by expanding its product line to
include personal care such as skincare like Vaseline lotion and Axe deodorant.

Unrelated Diversification

Unrelated diversification refers to expanding into new markets,
market segments, and businesses in a new industry that has little
or no similarities to a firm's current industry or industries. In con-
trast to a single business firm or a dominant business firm, a com-
pany that engages in an unrelated diversification strategy
receives less than 70 percent of its revenues from a single busi-
ness and the remaining revenue from a business or businesses
that are unrelated to the primary business. Unrelated diversifica-
tion has positive impacts on the firm's risk management because
it expands into new markets, market segments, and businesses.
On the other hand, this approach does not involve synergies, one
of the main drivers of corporate strategy.

For example, Unilever also engaged in unrelated diversification         Figure 7.3: Magnum ice cream bar
by expanding into food products such as Hellmann's mayonnaise
and Magnum ice cream.

Amazon started as an online bookstore before expanding into different sectors, such as streaming services (Prime Video) and gro-
cery stores (Whole Foods). Google initially started as a search engine and then diversified its services to include Google Drive, where
users can store files, photos, and more. Additionally, Google expanded into advertising with Google Ads. Sony initially focused on
electronics but has expanded its products line to movies and music production.

In contrast to single and dominant business firms, firms that
engages in both related and unrelated diversification strategy
receives less than 70 percent of their revenues from a single
business. Both related and unrelated diversification require
significant resources to execute. Related diversification is con-
sidered less risky and often produces greater profit potential.
This is because the company already has expertise with the
industry that it can apply to the new products and services.
However, there are times when expanding into a new industry
taps into significant profits.

Diversification and Financial Performance

When considering whether to enter new businesses in new            Figure 7.4: Google
industries, consider how attractive the new industry is. New
business in new industries must have strong profit potential to
make the risk worth taking.

In choosing between related or unrelated diversification, it is useful to analyze the external environment of the firm. As you learned
in Chapter 4, a PESTEL analysis gives an analysis of the general environment and a Porter's Five Forces analysis provides an analysis
of the industry environment. You also analyzed strategic groups as a way of analyzing the competitive environment. Together, these
analyses support an evidenced-based decision about related or unrelated diversification.

Is unrelated diversification better or worse than related diversification? While this needs to be answered on a company-specific
basis, there is a sweet spot between both forms of diversification that leads to the highest financial performance.

The graph in figure 7.5 suggests that there is an optimal degree
of diversification, and in most cases, related diversification is
associated with the strongest firm performance. High and low
levels of diversification are generally associated with lower
overall performance, while moderate levels of diversification
are associated with higher firm performance. This implies that
companies that focus on a single business, as well as compa-
nies that pursue unrelated diversification, often fail to achieve
additional value creation. Firms that compete in single mar-
kets could potentially benefit from economies of scope by
leveraging their core competencies into adjacent markets.

Ways Firms Diversify

Now that we have reviewed related and unrelated diversifica- Figure 7.5: Diversification and financial performance
tion and the impact of diversification on financial perfor-
mance, let's consider ways to diversify. To explore ways that firms choose to diversify, we introduce a make-contract-create-acquire
continuum, illustrated in figure 7.6.
166 | 7. FORMULATE CORPORATE-LEVEL STRATEGY

Figure 7.6: How to diversify

Companies may diversify by using internal development to make their own products or to design new services. They also may enter
into contracts with other companies to achieve diversification. This includes nonequity and equity alliances. Firms can diversify by
creating a new company through a joint venture. Finally, companies may acquire additional companies as a means of diversifica-
tion through mergers and acquisitions.

Make: Internal Development

When considering different ways to diversify, organizations
may use internal development to make their own new prod-
ucts or design new services by leveraging their existing
resources and expertise.

Apple is an example of a company that often uses internal
development to diversify its products and services.

Companies can also develop and launch whole new business
lines through internal development. For example, Microsoft
expanded from mostly software development to offering full
tech solutions by diversifying its offerings through internal
development, producing products like Microsoft Teams for col-
laboration and Azure for cloud services.

Contract: Strategic Alliances

Strategic alliances are mutually beneficial contractual relationships between two organizations, allowing them to work together
on specific goals while maintaining their independence. Strategic alliances are an example of horizontal integration. Nonequity
and equity strategic alliances are both means of diversification.

Equity Strategic Alliance

An equity strategic alliance is created when one company contracts with another company to purchase a certain equity percentage
of the other company.

                                                                                For example, in 2010, Panasonic invested $30 million in the
                                                                                automaker Tesla by purchasing shares of Tesla common stock
                                                                                in a private placement, which is a sale of stock to preselected
                                                                                investors rather than on a public exchange. The purpose of this
                                                                                equity strategic alliance was to build a stronger relationship
                                                                                between Panasonic and Tesla. Panasonic was able to expand its
                                                                                footprint in the electric vehicle market. Tesla was able to
                                                                                improve its battery packs and reduce its costs through Pana-
                                                                                sonic's market position as one of the world's leading battery
                                                                                cell manufacturers. The relationship between the two compa-
                                                                                nies continues to this day.

                                                                                with the first production lithium-ion cells manufactured at

Nonequity Strategic Alliance

Nonequity strategic alliances are created when two or more
companies enter a contractual relationship to pool their
resources and capabilities together. These alliances allow com-
panies to expand their networks and improve their services
without requiring equity stakes from other organizations.

Turkish Airlines, for example, has established a number of non-
equity strategic alliances with other carriers, including Air
Canada, United Airlines, and Lufthansa. Through these non-
equity strategic alliances, Turkish Airlines is able to keep its
independence while expanding the range of routes it offers
and enhancing passenger connection.

Create: Joint Ventures

                                                                                   Figure 7.10: Turkish Airlines
In addition to embracing internal development and strategic
alliances, two organizations also may diversify by creating an entirely new company. An example of this is a joint venture.
168 | 7. FORMULATE CORPORATE-LEVEL STRATEGY

Joint ventures are established when two companies establish a new shared entity. For example, when two parent companies, Com-
pany A and Company B, create a child company, Company C, this is a joint venture. Each partner is invested in the new venture and
shares joint responsibility for the new entity's success. Joint ventures are another example of diversification through horizontal inte-
gration.

In 2007, Hulu was initially established as a joint venture between NBCUniversal, the Walt Disney Company, Providence Equity, and
21st Century Fox. These companies came together to create Hulu, a streaming platform that provides TV shows, movies, and origi-
nal content.

When both Company A and Company B own 50 percent of the child company, this is a 50-50 joint venture.

For example, in 2012, Microsoft and General Electric Healthcare signed an agreement to create Caradigm, a new company. Microsoft
and General Electric Healthcare each owned 50 percent. The purpose of this joint venture was to develop and market an open
healthcare intelligence platform through the creation of Caradigm. Microsoft had the technical capability, and General Electric
Healthcare had the expertise with healthcare. This is an example of a 50-50 joint venture.

Subsequently, in 2016, General Electric Healthcare bought out Microsoft's share in the company, and in 2018, General Electric
Healthcare sold Caradigm to Inspirata. This illustrates how joint ventures may serve a current corporate strategy until the company
must respond to a dynamic market and choose to engage in other forms of diversification and divestment.

If Company A owns 70 percent and Company B owns 30 percent, the joint venture is a majority-owned joint venture.

For example, until recently, China required all manufacturing operations to be at least 50 percent Chinese owned. In 2003, BMW
and Chinese automobile manufacturer Brilliance Auto Group entered a 50-50 joint venture to produce and sell BMW vehicles in
China. When Chinese regulations changed, the relationship between BMW and Brilliance Auto Group changed. In 2022, the two
firms entered into a majority-owned joint venture, with BMW owning 75 percent of the joint venture. This is another example of
how relationships between firms change. A PESTEL analysis is a good strategic management framework to assess changing govern-
mental regulations in the general (macro) environment.

Acquire: Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A)

Finally, firms may acquire another company as a method of diversifying.
Mergers and acquisitions are means of acquiring another company. Both
are examples of horizontal integration.

A merger occurs when two companies of similar size voluntarily join forces
and create a new, singular business.

For example, in 1999, Exxon and Mobil merged to create ExxonMobil, the
largest publicly traded oil company in the world. Both companies were
about the same size and decided to join together voluntarily. By merging,
they combined their expertise, resources, and market power. This helped
them become more efficient and competitive in the global oil and gas
industry. The merger allowed ExxonMobil to grow stronger and lead the
market in exploration, refining, and energy production.

Acquisitions occur when one company buys another company, absorbing         Figure 7.11: Marriott
the purchased company into the buyer. Acquisitions are more common
than mergers.
                                                                                                           7. FORMULATE CORPORATE-LEVEL STRATEGY | 169
For example, in 2016, Marriott bought Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, making them part of the Marriott International
company and creating the world's largest hotel chain.

Figure 7.12: Marriott hotels
In 2017, Amazon bought Whole Foods Market. In 2023, Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard, a video game holding company. A
holding company's primary business is holding a controlling interest in the securities of other companies.
We consider joint ventures, strategic alliances, and mergers and acquisitions again in Chapter 9 when we focus on innovation, as
these are mechanisms that allow firms to innovate through cooperation.

Reducing and Reversing Diversification

Continuously assessing and managing diversification includes evaluating a firm's current offering of products and services and
assessing the potential value of changing the firm's current offerings by expanding into additional products and services. A firm
also may consider reducing or divesting the offerings of its current product and service lines.

Retrenchment

Business borrowed the term retrenchment from warfare. In the wars of the early twentieth century, battles were fought using trench
warfare. When an attacking army reached a trench, the defending army fell back to the next trench. This was called retrenchment,
which allowed the retreating army to refortify its position. The partial retreat was an effort to remain in the battle with the goal of
winning the battle.
In business, retrenchment is a reduction in size and product offerings to continue to make profits. It is also referred to as downsizing
or rightsizing, which often requires laying off employees.
170 | 7. FORMULATE CORPORATE-LEVEL STRATEGY

Divestment

When reducing a company's size and offerings is insufficient to address the company's strategic goals, then divestment may be an
option. Selling an unprofitable business or product line can be a way of reversing diversification. Companies may divest complete
product lines and businesses. They may also sell part of a company. Selling part of a company, such as a division of strategic business
unit, is known as a spinoff.

     Key Takeaways

     Differentiation is how a company makes its products distinct from its competitors. Diversification refers to how a company simultane-
     ously deals with different products and services in different industries, markets, market segments, and businesses. A single business firm
     is a firm that derives 95 percent or more of its revenues from one business. A dominant business firm derives between 70 percent and
     95 percent of its revenues from one business. Related diversification is expanding into new and similar markets, market segments, and
     businesses in a new industry that has similarities to a firm's current industry or industries. A company that engages in a related diver-
     sification strategy receives less than 70 percent of its revenues from a single business and the remaining revenue from business related
     to the primary business. Unrelated diversification is expanding into new markets, market segments, and businesses in a new industry
     that has little or no similarities to a firm's current industry or industries. A company that engages in an unrelated diversification strategy
     receives less than 70 percent of its revenues from a single business and the remaining revenue from business unrelated to the primary
     business. There is an optimal degree of diversification, and in most cases, related diversification is associated with the strongest firm per-
     formance. Companies may diversify by using internal development to make their own products or design new services. They also may
     enter into contracts with other companies to achieve diversification through nonequity and equity alliances. Firms can diversify by creat-
     ing a new company through a joint venture. Finally, companies may acquire additional companies as a means of diversification through
     mergers and acquisitions. Sometimes companies need to reduce their diversification through retrenchment, which is reverse diversifica-
     tion through divestment or spinoffs.

7.4 Vertical Integration

As you recall, corporate-level strategy is a companywide strategy that focuses on creating and maintaining a firm's competitive
advantage by creating synergy within and between multiple industries, markets, market segments, and businesses, across multiple
industry value chain(s), and in different geographical locations.

To consider at what stage of the industry value chain(s) a company should participate requires an understanding of industry value
chains and how analyzing them relates to corporate strategy.

A supply chain and an industry value chain are related ideas.

Supply Chain

A supply chain includes the steps of product production from multiple entities, from raw materials to the final delivered product.
Using jewelry production as an example, valuable metals such as gold, silver, and platinum are extracted from mines. Mining com-
panies ship these to suppliers, who shape the raw materials. Then, manufacturing companies design the products in workshops,
where they also do quality control. After this process, the produced jewelry is distributed to retailers, who market and sell them to
customers and offer customer support and service.
172 | 7. FORMULATE CORPORATE-LEVEL STRATEGY

Industry Value Chain

An industry value chain considers the ways a firm adds value to each step (or "node") in the production process.

Analyze an Industry Value Chain

Chapter 4, "Analyzing the Internal Environment," considered several strategic management
frameworks, including the VRIO and value chain analyses. A company value chain analysis exam-
ines internal company practices and their optimization relative to creating value for customers
and a sustainable competitive advantage for the firm. An industry value chain analysis differs in
that it emphasizes value creation as it examines the production stages, from raw material pro-
curement to the delivery of the final product.

An industry value chain analysis examines each node of a product's value chain to analyze value
creation at each. Among other things, these nodes include sourcing of raw materials, costs asso-
ciated with production and distribution, and characteristics that drive customers' willingness to
pay for the product. Aspects of each node have the ability to impact total costs and expected mar-
gins of the final delivered product. An industry value chain analysis is used to identify opportuni-
ties for increased profit through, for example, more effective cost control pricing, product
positioning, and product distribution strategies.

Imagine an industry value chain for the production of gourmet cakes. In figure 7.13, the value
chain includes the following nodes: wheat farmer, wheat processing plant, dairy farmer, dairy
processing plant, baking facility, distribution, and bistro. To analyze the value chain, analyze each
level or node for the value added to the overall process of producing gourmet cakes. This includes
an analysis of the profit margin of each step in the process.

The stage of the industry value chain(s) at which the company should participate is a question of
business integration--more specifically, vertical integration.

Business Integration

Business integration is the process of combining different components of a business into a uni-
fied and cohesive operation. There is horizontal and vertical integration.

Horizontal Integration

Horizontal integration is business expansion that focuses on relationships with another com-

pany in the same business line.                                                                  Figure 7.13: Industry value chain for
Continuing with our example of a value chain for producing gourmet cakes, let's now consider     the production of gourmet cakes

horizontal integration. An example of horizontal integration would be a wheat processing plant merging with or acquiring another

wheat processing plant. If a wheat processing plant significantly expands its capacity so that it takes up more market share, this

internal development can also be a form of horizontal integration. If a distributor merged with another distributor or a bistro

acquired another bistro, these would also be examples of horizontal integration.

                                 Figure 7.14: Horizontal integration

Vertical Integration

Vertical integration is a business expansion strategy where a company takes control over one or more stages in the production or
distribution of its products.
Continuing with our example of a value chain for producing gourmet cakes, an example of vertical integration would be any busi-
ness along the vertical dimension of the value chain deciding to diversify into another business along the vertical dimension of the
value chain such as a dairy processing plant diversifying by opening a baking facility.

Backward Vertical Integration

Backward vertical integration occurs when a firm moves backward along the indus-
try value chain and enters a supplier's business. For example, Volkswagen purchased
turbine manufacturing facilities to guarantee consistent supply of parts for its power
generation equipment.

In our example of a value chain for producing gourmet cakes, a dairy processing plant
purchasing a dairy farm is an example of backward vertical integration. If the bistro
decided to change its business model from purchasing gourmet cakes to making
them in-house, that also would be an example of backward vertical integration. This
would be a significant change for the bistro. The bistro would need the physical space
and equipment to make cakes, it would need to hire talented patisserie chefs, and it
would need to establish relationships with suppliers to ensure they had reliable sup-
plies to make the cakes.

These decisions are supported by an industry chain analysis. In Chapter 4, you
learned that one of the four elements of a Porter's Five Forces analysis is the bargain-
ing power of suppliers. Analyzing the bargaining power of suppliers is also important
when considering backward vertical integration. Using multiple strategic analysis
tools informs an evidenced-based decision whether to choose a backward vertical
integration approach.

                                                                                          Figure 7.16: Backward vertical integration
176 | 7. FORMULATE CORPORATE-LEVEL STRATEGY

Forward Vertical Integration

When a company moves further forward down the industry value chain and enters a
buyer's business, that is forward vertical integration. When a microbrewery purchases a
pub, that is an example of forward vertical integration. Amazon's acquisition of Whole
Foods is another example.

In our example of a value chain for producing gourmet cakes, the baking facility deciding
to distribute the cakes would be example of forward vertical integration. Many companies
outsource business activities that do not contribute to their core competencies, hiring
organizations that specialize in goods delivery, such as Fedex. Amazon is an example of a
company that brought delivery back in-house. This is a good strategic choice for Amazon
due to the importance of delivery and the percentage of its online shopping business that
relies on delivery. Companies that require special delivery conditions for their products,
which may be fragile or heat sensitive, sometimes provide their own deliveries. Paxton &
Whitfield, a London cheesemonger, provides its own overnight deliveries in recyclable ice
packs. In our example, an industry value chain analysis may convince the baking facility
that it is worth the investment to deliver its own cakes.

In Chapter 4, you learned that another of the four elements of a Porter's Five Forces analy-
sis is the bargaining power of buyers. Analyzing this power is important when considering
forward vertical integration. Using multiple strategic analysis tools informs an evidenced-
based decision whether to choose a forward vertical integration approach.

Vertical integration, both backward and forward, occurs when a company controls differ-
ent stages along the industry value chain. When considering a company's position in the
industry value chain(s), a firm evaluates its current position and assesses the potential
value of expanding through backward and forward vertical integration. The firm also
evaluates the benefits of contracting its presence in the chain(s) and changing its portfo-
lio either incrementally or radically with a combination of retaining, expanding, and
reducing positions in the industry value chain(s).

Conducting an industry value chain analysis allows corporate executives to make evi-          Figure 7.17: Forward vertical integration
denced-based decisions about which stage of the industry value chain the firm should
occupy. Combining a value chain analysis and a Porter's Five Forces analysis gives a strong
evidence base to decide how to manage a firm's position along its value chain(s).

Key Takeaways

Vertical integration is a business expansion strategy where a company takes control over one or more stages in the production or dis-
tribution of its products. Backward vertical integration occurs when a firm moves backward along the industry value chain and enters
a supplier's business. When a company moves further forward along the industry value chain and enters a buyer's business, that is for-
ward vertical integration. Vertical integration, both backward and forward, occurs when a company controls different stages along the
industry value chain. An industry value chain considers the ways a firm adds value to each step in the production process. Conducting
an industry value chain analysis allows corporate executives to make evidenced-based decisions about which stage of the industry value
chain the firm should occupy. Combining an industry value chain analysis with a Porter's Five Forces analysis is a robust approach to for-
mulating strategy.

7.5 Geographical Scope

So far, we have discussed corporate-level strategy based on synergy and the industry value chain. There is a third factor to consider.
Where the organization should compete geographically is a question of geographical scope-- where geographically firms provide
their products and services.

Companies evaluate the potential benefits of offering their products and services in local, regional, national, and multinational
markets. Formulating multinational strategy is considered in detail in Chapter 12.

Companies evaluate geographical markets for their current line of products or for new lines of products. When considering where
the firm will provide its products and services, it evaluates its current geographical markets and assesses the potential value of
expanding into new geographical markets; it also evaluates the value of changing its portfolio either incrementally or radically with
a combination of retaining, expanding, and reducing their offering geographically.

The question of where to provide products and services is important for brick-and-mortar businesses. It is equally essential for com-
panies that offer either all or a portion of their products and services online. For example, when a company expands its market
through online sales, it must address many new issues, such as transportation for delivering its products. U.S.-based companies that
expand into a wider local market within a state may encounter different local laws and regulations, such as differences in taxation.
Expanding into new U.S. states requires knowledge of both federal and state laws, such as those that govern labor practices. Inter-
national expansion considers a wide range of factors and is the topic of Chapter 12.

     Key Takeaways

     Geographical scope refers to where geographically firms compete, providing their products and services. Companies evaluate the poten-
     tial benefits of offering their products and services in local, regional, national, and international markets. Sometimes a company needs
     to alter its businesses and product lines either incrementally or radically while retaining its current offering, expanding through diversi-
     fication, and reducing or divesting the products and services it offers. This is a process of portfolio planning, which we will consider next.

7.6 Portfolio Planning

A firm's business portfolio consists of all the products and services it sells, all the business it is in, and all the market segments, mar-
kets, and industries in which it participates.
An essential part of continuously assessing and managing corporate-level strategy includes portfolio planning. Portfolio planning
addresses how a firm should manage its portfolio of businesses, like strategic business units or divisions, to achieve synergy and
create value. It also addresses how the parent company adds value to its business divisions and strategic business units.
There are many models to describe business portfolios. The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) matrix is a framework that supports
portfolio planning.

The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Matrix

The BCG matrix is designed to help companies decide how to prioritize their different businesses. A company with multiple strate-
gic business units needs to make important decisions as to which strategic business units are the most attractive, which will receive
more resources than other strategic business units, which will receive new investments, and which are not attractive enough any-
more and need to be divested.
These questions touch on the topic of corporate portfolio management. Ideally, a corporation wants to operate successful busi-
nesses in attractive markets. Following this logic, the BCG matrix uses the market growth rate as an indicator of how attractive the
strategic business unit's market is. The relative market share is used as an indicator of how well the business or strategic business
units are doing in the specific market. A high relative market share means that the business is doing well compared to its competi-
tors. Ideally, a corporation wants a relatively high market share in attractive markets, as measured by market growth rates.
                                                                   7. FORMULATE CORPORATE-LEVEL STRATEGY | 179

The BCG matrix maps a firm's businesses along two dimen-
sions. The first is relative market share, and the second is mar-
ket growth rate. This produces four quadrants, each with its
own symbol: dog, cash cow, question mark, and star. To use the
BCG matrix, first plot a firm's business units or product lines
along these two dimensions, and then decide whether it is best
to liquidate them, reinvest their profits into other product
lines, or significantly invest in them.

Dogs

The Boston Consulting Group uses the term pet for the quad-
rant most commonly referred to as dogs (bcg.com). For fans of
dogs or any pet, either name is unfortunate, as dogs in the BGC
matrix are those businesses or product lines that have a low rel-
ative market share and a low market growth rate. Dogs are
strong candidates for liquidation, divestment, or repositioning
in the portfolio.

Cash Cows                                                          Figure 7.18: The BCG matrix

Cash cows have a high relative market share and a low market
growth rate. Cash cows are best "milked" for cash to reinvest. These businesses or product lines have poor performance potential.
Therefore, profits from cash cows are best diverted to business and product lines with more profit potential.

Question Marks

Question marks have a low relative market share and a high market growth rate. Executives decide whether to invest in them or
divest them, depending on their potential profit.

Stars

Stars have a high relative market share and a high market growth rate. Because of their high profit potential, companies should sig-
nificantly invest in stars.

Limitations to the BCG Matrix

Like many portfolio planning tools, the BCG matrix has limitations. The positioning and attractiveness of different strategic busi-
ness units is influenced by many complex factors, but relative market share and market growth rate oversimplifies this. The BCG is
best used as a broad first indication of the positioning and attractiveness of different strategic business units. Once a BCG matrix
has been applied to a firm's businesses, it is important to then consider other relevant factors that influence the positioning and
attractiveness of different strategic business units before a decision is made to divest, reinvest profits, or invest in the product line.

     Key Takeaways

     A firm's business portfolio consists of all the products and services it sells, and all the business it is in, all the market segments, markets,
     and industries in which it participates. The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) matrix is a framework that supports portfolio planning by

     have a low relative market share and a high market growth rate. Executives decide whether to invest in them or divest them, depending
     on their potential profit. Stars have a high relative market share and a high market growth rate. Because of their high profit potential,
     companies should significantly invest in stars. Like most tools, the BGC has limitations, such as oversimplifying portfolio planning.

7.7 Analyze Corporate-Level Strategy

Corporate executives and boards of directors focus on formulating corporate-level strategies. When you conduct a case analysis, you
analyze a firm's corporate-level strategy. This is step six in the case analysis process.

       6. As appropriate to the case, analyze strategies: Corporate-level, business-level, innovation, sustainability and ethics, technol­
       ogy, and multinational strategies.

           a. Use strategic management analytical frameworks to analyze, interpret, and evaluate strategies.
           b. Ensure line of sight and congruence within analysis of each strategy.

7.8 Why Corporate-Level Strategy Is Important to Business Graduates

Because corporate-level strategy operates at the highest level of a firm, it may appear distant or irrelevant to the work of recent
business graduates. However, that is not the case. For business graduates starting as business support unit managers in support
business units of large companies, such as marketing managers, corporate-level strategy has a direct influence on the implementa-
tion of functional-level strategy, which is a key responsibility for functional managers. In formulating corporate-level strategies, cor-
porate executives and divisional or strategic business unit managers may solicit data analysis from functional business managers,
such as managers of business information technology, accounting, and human resource management.

As a companywide strategy that focuses on creating and maintaining a firm's competitive advantage by creating synergy within and
between multiple industries, markets, market segments, and businesses, across multiple industry value chain(s), and in different
geographical locations, corporate-level strategy must reflect current, accurate, and relevant data analysis that only business sup-
port unit managers have direct access to. Therefore recent graduates are an essential part of ensuring a firm's successful corporate-
level strategy.

Business graduates joining smaller companies will spend more time working closely with executives responsible for corporate-level
strategy from the start. Business graduates that enter either internal or external consulting roles require a high level of competence
with corporate-level strategy to communicate to corporate executives how their consulting projects fit into the overall corporate-
level strategy of the firm. For business graduates who already are or will become entrepreneurs, fluency with corporate-level strat-
egy is essential to establishing and growing a successful firm.

7.9 Conclusion

Formulating a firm's corporate-level strategy focuses on finding a direction for the firm's future. Corporate-level strategy is the
broadest level of strategy and is the responsibility of senior executives and the board of directors, who must answer the question of
where the firm is going to compete. Corporate-level strategy is a companywide strategy that focuses on creating and maintaining
a firm's competitive advantage by creating synergy within and between multiple industries, markets, market segments, and busi-
nesses, across multiple industry value chain(s), and in different geographical locations. In what industries, markets, market seg-
ments, and businesses a firm should operate is a question of diversification. At what stage of the industry value chain(s) the
company should participate is a question of vertical integration. Where the organization should compete geographically is a ques-
tion of geographical scope. The BCG matrix is one framework that addresses portfolio planning.

8.1 Introduction

In the previous chapter, you learned about the broadest level of strategy, corporate-level strategy. In this chapter, we begin to narrow
the focus with business-level strategy.
After an introduction to business-level strategy, you learn the two dimensions along which strategic business unit managers for-
mulate business-level strategy. The first addresses a firm's strategic market position, which includes cost leadership and differen-
tiation approaches. The second addresses a firm's strategic market size, which can concentrate on a narrow, niche market segment
(focused approach) or a wider market (broad approach). These two dimensions produce six business-level strategies: focused cost
leadership, broad cost leadership, focused differentiation, broad differentiation, and two hybrid strategies known as best cost and
blue ocean. Then you learn the risks of a firm not clearly formulating a business-level strategy and getting stuck in the middle. Next
you learn how to analyze a firm's business-level strategy. Finally, you consider why business-level strategy is important to business
graduates.

8.2 Business-Level Strategy

Let's begin by considering what business-level strategy is.

Where are we going?

You now understand that there are three stages to the strategic management process: strategic analysis ("Where are we?"), strategy
formulation ("Where are we going?"), and strategy implementation ("How do we get there?"). Like all strategy formulation, busi-
ness-level strategy addresses the question of where a firm is going.

While corporate-level strategy is the broadest level of strategy and is formulated at the corporate level of a company, business-level
strategy is the strategy of a strategic business unit.
A strategic business unit is a fully functional unit of a business that has its own vision and direction and may be part of a larger
organizational unit like a division. It may be based on markets served, products offered, or regions served.
Each strategic business unit has its own vision and direction it pursues through one business-level strategy. Smaller firms that have
only one strategic business unit have only one business-level strategy. In large companies with more than one strategic business
unit, different strategic business units may have different business-level strategies. Therefore, large corporations that have more
than one strategic business unit potentially have multiple business-level strategies. Let's revisit our diagram that depicts the three
levels of strategy to now consider how business-level strategy fits into the larger picture of strategy in an organization.

  Figure 8.1: Three levels of strategy
             8. FORMULATE BUSINESS-LEVEL STRATEGY | 187

How to win?

How a firm wins in its chosen markets is largely driven by the firm's ability to develop a winning strategy around its resources, capa-
bilities, and core competencies that are superior to those of its competitors and that will create value for the firm's customers. Over-
all, the "How to win?" question addresses the firm's search for a sustainable competitive advantage.

Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous Environment

As you now know, when executives analyze their organizational environments, they consider factors that relate to both the external
environment and the internal environment of the firm. The external analysis of the general, industry, and competitive environ-
ments focuses on an outside-in perspective of the firm. The internal analysis of a firm's resources, capabilities, core competencies,
and value chain focuses on an inside-out perspective of the firm. When you conduct a case analysis, you analyze companies through
these same lenses.

When strategic management leaders and managers formulate strategy, they focus on an outside-in perspective. All successful
strategies are driven by outside-in perspectives. Chapter 7 discussed how this is true for corporate-level strategy. An outside-in per-
spective is equally important to business-level strategy and the strategies embedded into business-level strategies.

Strategic leaders and managers carefully monitor the external environment of their companies, analyze trends, and develop strate-
gies that are forward-looking. Regardless of the level of strategy being formulated, firms must navigate an external environment
that is volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA), where change and disruption are the new normal.

Focus

Both corporate-level strategy and business-level strategy focus on the markets and market segments in which a firm competes. Cor-
porate-level strategy is broader in focus, aimed at creating synergy across businesses and industries.

Business-level strategy is narrower in focus. Business-level strategy is the strategy of a strategic business unit. A business-level strat-
egy is a general way of positioning a company within an industry for gaining a competitive advantage by defining how a firm com-
petes head-to-head against similar products and services in its market and market segments. In contrast, corporate-level strategy
considers what industries and markets a firm should operate in and how to create synergy between them. Both focus on markets
and market segments, but the focus is different. It is important the business-level strategy is congruent with and supports corpo-
rate-level strategy.

Determining a firm's business-level strategy involves making decisions about how to best serve specific groups of customers,
address their unique needs, and provide solutions that stand out from competitors. At its core, business-level strategy is about iden-
tifying who the firm will serve, what needs it will meet, and how it will go about satisfying those needs in a way that delivers value.

Who Are Our Customers?

The first step in crafting a business-level strategy is understanding who the company is trying to serve. Every organization must
carefully define its target market and market segments. For smaller companies, this might involve focusing on a single customer
group, while larger organizations may develop different strategies for each of its markets and market segments. Understanding the
customers being served is critical, as it guides the firm in tailoring its offerings and competitive approach to meet specific needs.
188 | 8. FORMULATE BUSINESS-LEVEL STRATEGY

What Customer Needs Do We Meet?

Next, a business-level strategy must address what customer needs will be met. This step involves identifying the core problems or
desires of the company's target market and market segments. Successful firms invest heavily in understanding these needs, often
through market research, customer feedback, and competitive analysis. Whether customers are looking for affordability, innova-
tion, reliability, or premium quality, the firm must clearly identify what drives purchasing decisions. The ability to accurately define
and prioritize customer needs is essential to developing a strategy that resonates with the target market.

How Do We Satisfy Customer Needs?

Finally, the business must decide how it will satisfy its customers' needs and desires. This involves choosing the methods the firm
will use to deploy its strategic resources, capabilities, and core competencies to deliver value to customers. The choice of how needs
will be satisfied is closely tied to the firm's internal resources, capabilities, and core competencies. From a thorough knowledge of
its customers, firms develop business-level strategies.

Business-level strategy leads to decisions about how to deploy a firm's resources, capabilities, and core competencies to best serve
specific groups of customers, address their unique needs, and provide solutions that stand out from competitors. It is essential the
firm keeps customers as a primary focus in deciding business-level strategies. Aligning a firm's resources, capabilities, and core com-
petencies to business-level strategies includes decisions about product design, marketing, pricing, distribution, and customer ser-
vice. An organization must define and continuously improve its business-level strategy because they are not necessarily static. They
can change, especially in response to VUCA environments.

Strategic leaders and managers choose from a limited number of business-level strategies that are available to all companies.
Despite companies choosing from a common pool of business-level strategies, all strategy should be specific and differentiating,
and companies must implement them in ways that reflect their specific company conditions.

As you learn in Part V, there are strategies that are embedded into business-level strategies. We cover four of them in the book: inno-
vation strategy, sustainability and ethics strategy, technology strategy, and multinational strategy. Therefore, the overall strategies
that are formulated and implemented at the strategic business unit level are a combination of a company's chosen business-level
strategy and the ways in which it embeds a combination of other strategies (such as innovation strategy, sustainability and ethics
strategy, technology strategy, and multinational strategy) into their business-level strategy. This nuanced combination of strategies
gives a company a distinctive competitive edge.

Next, we consider a business-level strategy framework.

Key Takeaways

Just as strategy formulation asks the question "Where are we going?", business-level strategy asks the question "How to win?" and func-
tions at the strategic business unit level. Determining a firm's business-level strategy involves making decisions about how to best serve
specific groups of customers, address their unique needs, and provide solutions that stand out from competitors. Business-level strat-
egy focuses on how to compete within an organization's chosen market and market segments to create and sustain competitive advan-
tage. Business-level strategy addresses a firm's strategic market position, cost leadership and differentiation, and its strategic market
size, focused or broad.

8.3 Business-Level Strategy Framework

Firms formulate business-level strategies by making critical decisions on two fundamental dimensions. The first of these decisions
is defining the firm's strategic market position. The second decision that firms make concerns the company's strategic market size.
Both dimensions require a thorough understanding of the firm's customers, and both dimensions address which customers are
being targeted.

These decisions combine to create business-level strategies and are represented in the business strategy framework as depicted in
figure 8.2. The text that follows walks you through the business-level strategy framework.

Next we consider a firm's strategic market position, which involves cost leadership and differentiation. Then we turn our attention
to a company's strategic market size, which concerns whether it competes in a broad market or a focused market segment.

     Key Takeaways

     Firms formulate business-level strategies by defining the firm's strategic market position and strategic market size.

8.4 Strategic Market Position: Cost Leadership and Differentiation

The first critical strategic decision in defining the firm's business-level strategy is deciding its strategic market position. The strategic
market position addresses how the firm distinguishes itself in its chosen market and market segments, either through addressing
consumer preferences for low-cost alternatives or by addressing consumer preferences for luxury items. Strategic market position
is sometimes referred to as the source of competitive advantage or as just strategic position.

Cost Leadership

When a firm distinguishes itself in the market by responding to consumer preferences for low-cost alternatives, the company com-
petes primarily by being the lowest-cost producer or provider in its chosen market. The goal is to offer products or services that are
of an equal or similar value to competitors' products or services at a lower price than them. This is called a cost leadership approach,
and it appeals to cost-conscious customers.
A cost leadership strategic market position involves a firm striving to become the lowest-cost producer or provider in its chosen mar-
ket or market segment while still offering products or services that meet customer expectations. Successful cost leadership lever-
ages operational efficiencies, scale, and cost control measures to reduce production and distribution costs.
                                                                                                              8. FORMULATE BUSINESS-LEVEL STRATEGY | 191

Companies achieve cost leadership through a combination of strategic initiatives focused on reducing costs across various areas of
their operations. One common approach is leveraging economies of scale to achieve efficiency, where firms produce in large quan-
tities to lower the average cost per unit. Economies of scale are created when the costs of offering goods and services decrease as a
firm sells more items. This occurs because expenses are distributed across a greater number of items.

Automation, outsourcing, and streamlined processes also play crucial roles in keeping production costs low. Firms often simplify
product offerings, standardize processes, and minimize waste to reduce overhead. Moreover, firms pursuing cost leadership often
invest heavily in supply chain optimization, negotiating better terms with suppliers and seeking out more affordable raw materials.
This relentless focus on cost-cutting allows companies to maintain their profit margins while offering lower prices to customers,
creating a competitive advantage.

Firms that pursue cost leadership focus on achieving operational efficiency, leveraging economies of scale, and controlling over-
head costs. This strategy is particularly effective in industries where price is the primary driver of customer decisions, such as retail,
transportation, or basic consumer goods. Cost leaders streamline their supply chains and keep operating costs low to offer lower
prices than competitors.

Large companies often choose to pursue a cost leadership strategic market position, and they keep their prices down by demanding
price concessions from suppliers. The firm then passes some of these savings on to customers in the form of reduced prices in its
stores. Typically, firms following a cost leadership approach spend little on advertising, market research, or research and develop-
ment.

The key to this strategic market position is maintaining profitability through low costs while offering value that resonates with
price-sensitive customers. However, it is important for firms to avoid compromising on quality to a degree that alienates their cus-
tomer base. The challenge is striking a balance between being cost-competitive and delivering acceptable value.

A cost leadership approach works well when price competition among rival sellers is vigorous, identical products are available from
many sellers, there are few ways to differentiate industry products, most buyers use the product in the same way, and buyers incur
low costs in switching among sellers. The primary driver of a cost leadership approach is cost, which is most influenced by the cost
of input factors and economies of scale.

For example, Walmart strategically positions itself in the market by using a cost leadership strategic market position. It has mas-
tered this position by streamlining its supply chains and keeping operating costs low to offer lower prices than competitors. The key
to success in cost leadership is maintaining cost advantages without sacrificing quality, which can erode the firm's competitive posi-
tion if not carefully managed.

Advantages

Cost leadership offers several advantages for companies that can successfully implement it. One of the most significant benefits is
that it allows firms to maintain a competitive position by offering lower prices than competitors, which can attract a larger share
of price-sensitive customers. By being the lowest-cost producer, a firm can set its prices below industry averages, making it difficult
for rivals to compete without sacrificing profitability. Additionally, cost leadership can provide companies with a buffer during eco-
nomic downturns or periods of weak demand. When consumers are more cautious with their spending, companies with lower costs
can continue to thrive by offering affordable alternatives, which can allow them to maintain their sales volume even when higher-
priced competitors suffer. The emphasis on efficiency also makes firms well positioned to withstand price competition from rivals.

Another advantage is the potential for greater profitability through economies of scale and operational efficiency. Firms that
achieve cost leadership often benefit from producing goods or services at high volumes, which spreads fixed costs over a larger
number of units, reducing the per-unit cost. This can lead to higher margins, even when selling at lower prices. Furthermore, cost
leaders are often more resistant to price wars in which competitors continually lower prices in pursuit of market share; they can
resist because they have the financial flexibility to absorb lower margins without significantly harming their bottom line. This abil-
192 | 8. FORMULATE BUSINESS-LEVEL STRATEGY

ity to maintain profitability while keeping prices low enables cost leaders to undercut competitors in highly competitive markets.
High profits are possible if a cost leader has a high market share.

Disadvantages

Cost leadership also has several disadvantages that firms must be aware of. One major risk is the potential for lower perceived value
by customers. If a firm focuses solely on reducing costs, it may neglect product quality, innovation, or customer service, leading cus-
tomers to perceive the product as inferior. In industries where customers value features, brand loyalty, or innovation, cost leadership
can backfire if the firm sacrifices these elements in pursuit of cost reduction. Additionally, firms pursuing cost leadership are highly
vulnerable to changes in the cost structure, such as rising raw material prices, labor costs, or supply chain disruptions, especially in
a VUCA environment. If a firm's cost advantage erodes due to external factors, it may struggle to compete, particularly if it cannot
quickly adjust its prices or improve efficiency.

Another disadvantage of cost leadership is that it can lead to complacency and a lack of differentiation. Firms focused on cutting
costs may not invest enough in research and development, marketing, or customer experience, which can prevent them from adapt-
ing to changing market conditions. Competitors might develop innovations or create brand loyalty that cost leaders cannot match.
In such cases, cost leadership may become unsustainable if competitors can offer superior products at a similar price point. Addi-
tionally, cost leadership is often imitable, meaning competitors can adopt similar cost-cutting measures, eroding the initial firm's
advantage.

Another disadvantage includes customer perceptions of quality. Just offering cheaper products is not sufficient to succeed at a cost
leadership strategy. If customers perceive the quality of the product as no longer of the same or similar value, they are likely to take
their business to a competitor. Sacrificing quality to a level that cost-conscious customers no longer perceive as acceptable can erode
the firm's competitive position if not carefully managed.

Another disadvantage for cost leaders is reliance on large sales volumes. When sales decline, so do profits because the profit margin
is low. Cost leaders often offset this risk by selling recession-proof products like groceries, healthcare, and other essentials. Firms
that follow a cost leadership strategy are slow to respond to market changes because low investment in research and development
can lead to a sluggishness to detect market changes, which can be a disadvantage. Large volumes of sales are required for cost lead-
ers because profit margins are slim. Lastly, the need to keep expenses low might lead cost leaders to be slow in detecting key envi-
ronmental trends.

Differentiation

When a firm distinguishes itself in the market by responding to consumer preferences for luxury items, the company competes pri-
marily by offering products or services that are perceived as unique or superior by customers. This is referred to as a differentiation
approach.

Firms that choose a differentiation approach offer products or services that have unique features or attributes. They aim to create
higher value than competitors' products or services. They invest heavily in advertising in general and brand building in particular.

Firms that choose a differentiation approach add value to the products and services they offer. They are responsive to customer
preferences, and this can increase costs. The invest in research and development and innovation. Their customers are willing to pay
a premium for products and services because of distinct product features, customer service, and the perception that the product is
superior to those offered by competitors. The primary driver of the differentiation approach is value, and this is most influenced by
product features, customer service, and perception of quality.
                                                                                                             8. FORMULATE BUSINESS-LEVEL STRATEGY | 193

A differentiation approach involves offering products or services that are perceived as unique or superior by customers, allowing
firms to stand out in the marketplace. Companies pursuing this approach focus on developing features, quality, brand identity, or
customer experiences that go beyond what competitors offer. By doing so, they hope to attract customers who are willing to pay a
premium for these distinctive qualities. This approach is particularly effective in industries where customers value innovation, qual-
ity, customization, or specialized expertise over just price.

Instead of competing on price, the objective is to create a product or service that customers are willing to pay a premium for because
it meets needs in ways that rivals cannot easily replicate. Companies that follow a differentiation approach often offer cutting-edge
technology, superior design, and a strong brand identity. Differentiation can be achieved through various means, including innova-
tion, superior customer service, or the creation of a prestigious brand image. However, this strategic market position often requires
significant investment in research and development, marketing, and customer engagement.

A differentiation approach works well when firms differentiate their products and services in ways that are difficult for rivals to
duplicate or imitate, such as through company reputation, long-standing relationships with buyers, and a unique product or service
image. Differentiating along these dimensions creates substantial switching costs that lock in buyers. Patent-protected product
innovation and relationship-based customer service can also be success factors for a company following a differentiation strategy.
Differentiation also works well when there are many ways that differentiation can have value to buyers and there is rapid change in
the product's technology and features.

For example, Apple exemplifies the differentiation approach to strategic market position by offering cutting-edge technology, supe-
rior design, and a strong brand identity.

Advantages

Differentiation offers significant advantages to firms that can successfully execute it. One of the primary benefits is the ability to
command premium prices for products or services, as customers are often willing to pay more for offerings they perceive as unique
or superior. This premium pricing not only boosts profit margins but also allows companies to reinvest in continuous innovation,
marketing, and customer service. For example, Tesla has been able to charge significantly higher prices than traditional automakers
due to the perceived value of its cutting-edge technology, superior design, and sustainable approach to transportation.

Another advantage of differentiation is the potential for strong brand loyalty. When customers feel that a company offers some-
thing truly distinctive, whether it's exceptional quality, innovative features, or a unique experience, they are more likely to remain
loyal to the brand. This loyalty can reduce price sensitivity, making customers less likely to switch to a competitor, even if that com-
petitor offers a lower price. For example, buyer loyalty is extremely common for smartphone users.

Disadvantages

A differentiation approach also comes with its challenges. One of the most significant disadvantages is the higher cost structure
associated with maintaining differentiation. Companies must invest heavily in research and development, marketing, and cus-
tomer service to ensure that their products or services remain distinct and relevant in the marketplace. This constant need for inno-
vation can strain resources, especially if competitors begin to catch up or replicate similar features.

Another disadvantage is the risk of imitation by competitors. In highly competitive markets, rivals may quickly copy the features or
innovations that originally differentiated the product. As competitors adopt similar technology, designs, or service enhancements,
the perceived uniqueness of the original product may diminish over time. This can erode the firm's competitive advantage, forcing
it to lower prices or further invest in differentiation to maintain its market position.

Another disadvantage is that customers' own perception of quality is a crucial element in them continuing to buy luxury items. If a
company following a differentiation approach offers discounts that are too deep, this can have negative ramifications on customers'
perception of the quality of its offerings.

     Key Takeaways

     The first critical strategic decision when deciding a firm's business-level strategy is to define the firm's strategic market position. When a
     firm distinguishes itself in the market by responding to consumer preferences for low-cost alternatives, the company competes primarily
     by being the lowest-cost producer or provider in its chosen market. The goal is to offer products or services that are of an equal or sim-
     ilar value to competitors' products or service at a price lower than competitors. This is called a cost leadership approach, and it appeals
     to cost-conscious customers. While cost leadership provides a competitive edge, it can lead to diminished product quality or innovation,
     resulting in lower perceived value by customers if the focus on cost-cutting becomes too extreme. The cost leadership strategic market
     position is highly sensitive to external cost changes, such as rising raw material prices or supply chain disruptions, and such a firm is often
     susceptible to imitation by competitors, which can erode the firm's competitive advantage. Firms pursuing this strategic market position
     must carefully balance cost reduction with maintaining enough value in their offerings to satisfy customers. Companies that can navi-
     gate these challenges effectively can enjoy sustained profitability, but those that rely too heavily on cost cutting without innovation or
     differentiation may find themselves outpaced by more adaptable competitors.

investment and exposes the firm to competitive threats. Companies that follow a differentiation approach benefit from strong customer
relationships and pricing power but must also navigate the high costs of maintaining their unique offerings and the risk of competitors
imitating their innovations. Differentiation is a dynamic strategic market position that requires constant innovation, deep market under-
standing, and a sustained commitment to providing superior value to customers. While it can lead to long-term success, firms must
continuously evolve to protect their differentiated position in the market. Differentiation allows firms to charge higher prices by offer-
ing unique products or services that customers perceive as superior, fostering strong brand loyalty and reducing price sensitivity. Dif-
ferentiation requires significant investment in research and development, marketing, and customer service to maintain the perceived
uniqueness of the offering, which can strain profitability over time. Competitors can erode a firm's competitive advantage by imitating
the features or innovations that initially set the differentiated product apart, forcing the firm to continuously innovate to stay ahead.

8.5 Strategic Market Size: Broad and Focused

The second critical decision that firms make when deciding their business-level strategy concerns the company's strategic market
size. Like the firm's strategic market position, a company's strategic market size is also a decision based on the firm's customers. The
strategic market size defines whether the firm will target a broad market, serving many customer segments, or a narrow market,
focusing on a specific niche market segment.

If the approach is broad, the target market is broad, meaning most people within that industry buy the product or service. If the
approach is focused, the target market is narrow, and the product or service is not meant for most people in the industry. Some-
times strategic market size is referred to as scope of operations or competitive scope.

Broad

A broad approach to strategic market size targets large markets, typically encompassing a wide range of customer groups. These
strategies aim to appeal to as many customers as possible by offering products or services designed to meet diverse customer needs
and preferences. By leveraging economies of scale and broad market reach, firms employing this approach seek to dominate their
industry and build a strong competitive position. Broad approaches are often associated with significant operational scale, exten-
sive distribution networks, and the ability to serve a diverse customer base efficiently. The goal of a broad strategic market size is to
achieve widespread market penetration and long-term sustainability by serving the needs of a diverse customer base.

For example, Walmart targets in a broad strategic market. Its products appeal to a large and diverse customer base.

Advantages

One advantage of a broad strategic market size is the ability to achieve economies of scale. By serving a large customer base, firms
can lower their per-unit costs through higher production volumes, enabling them to price competitively.

Another advantage of a broad approach is the potential for extensive market coverage and revenue generation. By targeting large,
diverse markets, firms can access multiple customer groups, maximizing their sales potential.

A third advantage is that broad approaches also help firms build brand recognition and customer loyalty. A well-recognized brand
that appeals to a wide audience can establish connections with customers and help to secure a firm's competitive position.

Additionally, firms that adopt a broad strategic market size benefit from reduced dependency on any single customer groups. This
diversification allows them to be more resilient to changes in consumer preferences or economic conditions.

Finally, broad approaches enable firms to create or maintain entry barriers for competitors. Extensive market coverage, brand
equity, and economies of scale make it challenging for new entrants to compete effectively, reinforcing the firm's market domi-
nance.

Disadvantages

One major disadvantage of a broad strategic market size is the complexity of managing operations. Serving a large and diverse mar-
ket requires extensive resources, including multiple product lines, varied distribution channels, and significant administrative over-
sight. This operational complexity can result in inefficiencies and higher costs.

Another disadvantage is the risk of diluted focus. Broad approaches often require firms to cater to the general needs of many cus-
tomer groups, which may prevent them from meeting the specific needs of individual groups. This lack of specialization can leave
the firm vulnerable to competitors employing focused approaches that target niche market segments more effectively.
                                                                                                             8. FORMULATE BUSINESS-LEVEL STRATEGY | 197

Staying competitive across a wide market often requires substantial resources, which can strain profitability. In industries with
intense competition, this challenge is even more pronounced.

Expanding a brand to appeal to a broad audience can also dilute its identity. When a firm attempts to serve too many customer
groups, it risks alienating its core audience. For example, luxury brands that adopt a broad approach may lose their exclusive appeal,
reducing their differentiation from competitors.

Finally, firms pursuing a broad strategic market size face intense competition from other large players targeting the same markets.
This competition can lead to price wars, reduced profit margins, and challenges in sustaining a competitive advantage. A broad
approach to strategic market size requires continuous effort to remain relevant and efficient in highly contested markets.

Focused

A focused approach to strategic market size targets specific niche markets segments. Focused strategic market segments allow
firms to understand and cater to the specific needs of a niche market segment, fostering customer loyalty by offering tailored prod-
ucts or services that meet the unique demands of their target market segment. By concentrating on a narrow market segment, firms
that follow a focused approach can reduce direct competition, but the small size of the niche market segment limits long-term
growth opportunities and may constrain economies of scale. Focused strategic market segments are highly vulnerable to changes in
customer preferences and can be threatened by larger competitors entering the niche market segment, leveraging their resources
and scales to replicate or surpass the focused firm's offerings. Focused approaches allow firms to serve niche market segments with
precision and build customer loyalty, but they also come with risks, such as limited market size, vulnerability to market shifts, and
the threat of competition from larger rivals. Firms pursuing focused strategic market segment must stay vigilant in maintaining
their unique value proposition while being prepared to adapt to changes in their niche market segment.

For example, Apple follows a focused approach to strategic market size. They serve a market segment that is interested in high qual-
ity products with the latest technology.

Advantages

One of the primary advantages of a focused approach is that they allow firms to deeply understand and cater to the specific needs of
a niche market segment. By concentrating on a well-defined customer segment, companies can offer tailored products or services
that align closely with the preferences, behaviors, and demands of their target market segment. This precision leads to stronger
customer loyalty, as the specialized nature of the offering makes it difficult for competitors to meet the same level of personaliza-
tion or relevance.

Another advantage of focused strategies is the reduced competition within the niche market segment. Firms employing a focused
strategy can carve out a space in underserved or overlooked areas of the market, reducing direct rivalry. By serving specific groups
more effectively than larger, more generalist competitors, these firms can establish strong market positions without having to con-
stantly fend off well-resourced competitors.

Additionally, focused approaches enable firms to maximize resource efficiency by concentrating on a single market segment. Com-
panies can align their operations, marketing, and product development efforts specifically with the needs of their niche market seg-
ment, reducing waste and avoiding the complexity of serving a broad, diverse market.

Companies adopting a focused approach often build significant expertise in their products and services to attract customers to their
specialty stores, such as camping shops that offer customers expert advice in maximizing their limited vacation times.

Disadvantages

Focused approaches come with several disadvantages. One major risk is the limited market size. By concentrating on a narrow,
niche market segment, firms may struggle to achieve the economies of scale available to competitors with broader market reach.
The small size of the target market segment means that growth opportunities are often constrained, limiting the potential for long-
term scalability. Demand for specialized goods and services is limited, making each sale critical. For instance, a company that suc-
ceeds in a very specific market segment, such as high-end luxury goods, may find it difficult to expand beyond that market segment
without losing its specialized appeal.
Another disadvantage is the vulnerability to changes in the niche market. If customer preferences shift or technological advance-
ments alter the landscape, companies employing focused approaches may find it difficult to adapt without fundamentally chang-
ing their business models. When a firm's competitive advantage is built on serving a very specific group, any changes in customer
demand can significantly impact the firm's success.
Finally, focused approaches are vulnerable to competitors who decide to enter the niche market. Larger firms with more resources
might recognize the profitability of the niche market segment and begin targeting it with similar offerings.

Key Takeaways

The second critical decision that firms make when defining their business-level strategy concerns the company's strategic market size.
Like the decision about the firm's strategic market position, this decision is also based on the firm's customers. The strategic market size
defines whether the firm will target a broad market segment or a focused market segment. If the approach is broad, the strategic market
is broad and serves many customer groups, and most customers in an industry buy the product or service. If the approach is focused, the
strategic target market is narrow, a niche market segment, and the product or service is not meant for most people in the industry.

Targeting a broad strategic market size enables firms to achieve economies of scale, expand market reach, and build strong brand
recognition. A broad approach also brings challenges like operational complexity, diluted focus, and intense competition. Firms pursu-
ing a broad approach must balance efficiency and innovation to serve diverse customer needs while maintaining competitiveness in a
large and often contested market.

Focused approaches to strategic market size allow a firm to deeply understand and cater to the specific needs of a niche market segment,
fostering strong customer loyalty by offering tailored products or services that meet the unique demands of the target market segment.
By concentrating on a narrow market segment, firms that follow a focused approach can reduce direct competition, but the small size of
the market segment limits long-term growth opportunities and may constrain economies of scale. Focused approaches are highly vul-
nerable to changes in customer preferences and can be threatened by larger competitors entering the niche market segment, leveraging
their resources and scale to replicate or surpass the focused firm's offerings. Focused approaches allow firms to serve niche market seg-
ments with precision and build strong customer loyalty, but they also come with risks, such as limited market size, vulnerability to mar-
ket shifts, and the threat of competition from larger rivals. Firms pursuing focused approaches must stay vigilant in maintaining their
unique value proposition while being prepared to adapt to changes in their niche market segment.

8.6 Six Business-Level Strategies

So far you have learned that business-level strategy involves two critical decisions. The first addresses a firm's strategic market posi-
tion and considers whether the firm follows a cost leadership or a differentiation approach. The second addresses a firm's strategic
market size and addresses whether a company concentrates on a broad market segment called a broad approach or a narrow mar-
ket segment called a focused approach.
Now let's consider how these two dimensions dynamically interact to suggest six business-level strategies: broad cost leadership,
focused cost leadership, broad differentiation, focused differentiation, best-cost strategy, and blue ocean strategy. Each offers dis-
tinct paths to achieving competitive advantage.
200 | 8. FORMULATE BUSINESS-LEVEL STRATEGY

     Key Takeaways

     Strategic market position and strategic market size dynamically interact to suggest six business-level strategies: broad cost leadership,
     focused cost leadership, broad differentiation, focused differentiation, and two hybrid strategies known as best-cost strategy and blue
     ocean strategy.

8.7 Broad Cost Leadership

A broad cost leadership strategy is a business-level strategy that combines a broad strategic market size and a cost leadership
strategic market position. The firm distinguishes itself in the market by responding to consumer preferences for low-cost alterna-
tives and competes primarily by being the lowest-cost producer in its industry. This is the cost leadership element of the company's
business-level strategy. The company is also targeting a broad market, meaning most people within that industry buy the product
or service.

Firms that pursue a broad cost leadership business-level strategy focus on achieving operational efficiency, leveraging economies
of scale, and controlling overhead costs. This strategy is particularly effective in industries where price is the primary driver of cus-
tomer decisions, such as retail, transportation, or basic consumer goods.

Walmart is an excellent example of a company following a broad cost leadership strategy by streamlining their supply chains and
keeping operating costs low to offer lower prices than competitors. Walmart uses its massive supplier network and distribution
capabilities to offer low prices to a broad market, securing its leadership in cost-effective retail. Walmart focuses on selling products
of an equal or similar quality than its competitors at a lower cost, and most people in the market shop at Walmart. If a customer
is purchasing a consumable product like tissue and decides to purchase a name brand product, then it is likely that Walmart has
the economies of scale to sell those name brand consumables at a lower cost than most of its competitors. However, if a consumer
decides to buy a store brand product, the consumer may consider Walmart's products to be of a lesser quality though still just good
enough to purchase. In this case, although the store brand consumable product may not be of an equal or similar quality than
its competitors, consumers prioritize cost savings over quality. Walmart's range of products allows it to be an attractive option for
many price-sensitive customers.

McDonald's is another example of a company that follows a broad cost leadership strategy. McDonald's
uses a standardized menu in many countries and negotiates bulk purchasing agreements, allowing the
company to keep costs low while maintaining consistent quality across its global locations. This
approach enables McDonald's to offer affordable meals that appeal to a broad customer base, making
it a leader in the fast-food industry.

Spotify's free version operates on an ad-supported model that attracts a broad audience with no
upfront cost. However, this low-cost strategy depends on having a large user base to generate sufficient
ad revenue. Therefore, this Spotify service follows a broad cost leadership business-level strategy. Spo-
tify's dependency on maintaining high volumes creates financial pressure and limits flexibility, as Spo-
tify must continuously cater to and retain a vast user base to sustain profitability on its free tier.

                                                                                                                                       Figure 8.3: McDonald's
Hulu's low-cost, ad-supported model also follows a broad cost leadership business-level strategy. The
ad-supported model allows it to offer affordable streaming options, but it has also restricted its ability to evolve with customer
demands by failing to add premium features to their service, such as offline downloads. The broad cost leadership business-level
                                                                                                             8. FORMULATE BUSINESS-LEVEL STRATEGY | 201

strategy allows them to meet one market and limits their ability to respond to new customer preferences, which in turn affects their
competitiveness in the overall marketplace.

Procter & Gamble follows a broad cost leadership business-level strategy by offering a range of affordable household products. This
ensures steady revenue streams even as market demands fluctuate.

Company Example

            customers by providing them with low-cost menu options, offering value-focused meals to attract budget-oriented customers.
            This strategy has helped McDonald's remain the largest fast-food chain in the world with over forty thousand restaurants in over
            one hundred countries.

Dunkin'     Although it's known for doughnuts, Dunkin' Donuts generates more revenue from selling cheap coffee.

            people looking their best, while keeping money in their pockets, since 1975."

Little      Little Debbie snack cakes originated in the early 1930s, when O.D. McKee sold treats for just five cents each. Though prices have
Debbie      risen since then, Little Debbie cakes remain much cheaper than similar products sold by their competitors, Entenmann's and
            Tastykake.

Planet      The commercial gym Planet Fitness has become a rapidly growing business thanks to its affordable membership model,
Fitness     appealing to a broad customer base and securing a strong market share in the gym industry.

Netflix     Netflix, with its budget-friendly streaming service, offers a basic plan that can withstand price wars, as higher-priced
            competitors often avoid direct competition with more efficient, lower-cost options.

Papa        Papa Murphy's focuses its affordable "take-and-bake" pizzas on budget-conscious families. Because the pizzas are baked at
Murphy's    home, the company can accept food stamps, enabling Papa Murphy's to serve customers who might not typically purchase
            restaurant-quality pizza.

Costco      Costco provides its members with bulk buying options, with a focus on low-price, high-volume products. By selling huge
            amounts and requiring a membership fee, Costco can reduce per-unit costs, appealing to customers who are willing to buy in
            bulk to save money.

8.8 Focused Cost Leadership

Firms that pursue a focused cost leadership strategy target a narrow market segment that prefers low-cost products. The firm dis-
tinguishes itself in the market by responding to consumer preferences for low-cost alternatives and competes primarily by being
the lowest-cost producer in its industry, appealing to cost-conscious customers. This is the cost leadership element of the company's
business-level strategy. The company is also following a focused strategy, which means the company is concentrating on a target
market segment that is a narrow, niche market and that the product or service is not meant for most people in the industry. The
firm's strategic market position is cost leadership, and its strategic market size is focused. Focused cost leadership involves offering
products or services at the lowest price within a defined market segment, catering to a particular group of cost-conscious customers.
                                                                                                             8. FORMULATE BUSINESS-LEVEL STRATEGY | 203

Focused cost leadership strategy involves a company targeting a specific niche market segment while maintaining a low-cost struc-
ture to serve that market. The focus is not on competing broadly across all market segments but on tailoring products or services
to meet the specific needs of a defined group of customers. Companies that pursue this strategy aim to be the lowest-cost provider
in their niche, offering affordable solutions without the broad operational scope required by larger competitors. By zeroing in on
a smaller market segment, firms can better align their resources, capabilities, and core competencies to maximize efficiency and
minimize costs while addressing the unique needs of their customers.

Dollar General, for instance, employs a focused cost leadership strategy by targeting rural and small-town customers with low-cost,
basic goods. Dollar General's business model is built around keeping operational costs low, including a focus on smaller store foot-
prints and private-label goods, which helps reduce purchasing and distribution costs. By focusing on price-sensitive customers in
underserved areas, Dollar General effectively captures a niche market segment that is less competitive than the broader retail mar-
ket dominated by companies like Walmart. Its ability to offer affordable goods in convenient, smaller locations makes it attractive
to customers who prioritize convenience and low prices. Dollar General has been able to thrive in rural, lower-income areas where
larger retailers like Walmart have less presence, leveraging its focused cost leadership approach to dominate that market segment.

Another example of a company that follows a focused cost leadership strategy is Ryanair, which has become a dominant player in
the European budget airline industry by targeting budget-conscious travelers. Unlike full-service airlines, Ryanair offers extremely
low base fares by stripping away all nonessential services and charging extra for things like luggage, seat selection, and food. This
no-frills approach is designed specifically for customers who prioritize price over comfort. Ryanair's focused cost leadership strategy
includes using secondary airports and maintaining a standardized fleet, both of which contribute to keeping costs down. By cater-
ing to a niche market segment of cost-sensitive travelers willing to sacrifice convenience and amenities for lower fares, Ryanair has
successfully built a strong presence in the highly competitive airline industry.

The success of focused cost leadership hinges on the company's ability to tightly manage costs while meeting the essential needs
of its target market segment. Firms often achieve this by offering fewer product variations, reducing complexity in their supply
chains, and simplifying operational processes. For example, Dollar General minimizes store sizes and product variety to keep over-
head costs low, passing those savings on to customers through lower prices. Similarly, Ryanair's use of secondary airports not only
reduces airport fees but also allows for faster turnaround times, enabling more flights per day. In both cases, the companies have
honed in on a specific customer market segment that values affordability above all else, tailoring their business models to meet
those expectations.

This strategy is particularly effective when there is a segment of the market that is underserved by broader competitors. In the case
of Dollar General, major retailers often overlook smaller, rural markets, allowing the company to step in and dominate those areas
with its focused, low-cost approach. Similarly, Ryanair has found a niche in the European market where cost-conscious travelers
are looking for the cheapest possible airfare, even if it means sacrificing comfort. By understanding and capitalizing on the specific
needs of its niche market, the company has created a strong competitive position within its industry while maintaining low opera-
tional costs.

Another example of focused cost leadership is Xiaomi, the Chinese electronics and smartphone company. Xiaomi has grown rapidly
by implementing a focused cost leadership strategy in the highly competitive smartphone industry. Unlike major players like Apple
or Samsung, Xiaomi minimizes costs by selling its devices primarily through e-commerce, cutting out intermediaries, and main-
taining extremely low profit margins on hardware. In addition, the company generates revenue through software, apps, and inter-
net services, allowing it to offer high-quality smartphones at significantly lower prices than its competitors. Xiaomi's ability to
deliver affordable yet innovative devices has enabled it to rapidly expand its market share, particularly in developing markets, by
appealing to price-sensitive consumers without sacrificing product quality. Less-expensive smartphones from companies such as
budget-friendly brands like Xiaomi and Realme can offer smartphones with the same competitive features as flagship models from
Apple and Samsung, such as high-refresh-rate screens, decent cameras, and a solid performance for everyday tasks at a fraction of
the price. These alternatives attract price-sensitive buyers who want a good smartphone without paying premium prices. Imitation
204 | 8. FORMULATE BUSINESS-LEVEL STRATEGY

devices and lookalike smartphones closely resemble popular flagship models and are often sold by street vendors and online mar-
ketplaces. This can result in budget-conscious buyers straying away from the original brand, diluting their exclusivity.

Aldi, the German-based grocery retailer, is another example of a company that follows a focused cost leadership strategy. Aldi has
made a significant impact in various global markets, including the United States. Aldi's success is rooted in its rigorous cost-cut-
ting measures. The company reduces operational expenses by offering a limited selection of private-label products. Requiring cus-
tomers to bring their own shopping bags and deposit coins to use shopping carts is standard procedure in global markets, such as
the United Kingdom. They are less common in the United States. These efficiency-driven and sustainability-focused practices allow
Aldi to keep prices significantly lower than traditional grocery chains while maintaining quality standards that appeal to budget-
conscious shoppers. By focusing on operational simplicity and scale, Aldi has effectively maintained a competitive position in the
crowded grocery market.

Aldi offers their customers the essential groceries but at a much lower price by reducing their operational costs such as limiting product choices, limiting their staff and creating simple store layouts. This allows Aldi's to target cost-conscious consumers who prioritize

             savings over premiums brands.

8.9 Broad Differentiation

Firms that pursue a broad differentiation strategy target a broad market and customers who want a quality product. A firm dis-
tinguishes itself in the market by responding to consumer preferences, typically for luxury items. A company using such a strategy
competes primarily by offering products or services that are perceived as unique or superior by customers. This is the differentiation
element of the business-level strategy. If the company is also following a broad strategy, this means it is concentrating on a target
market that is broad, meaning most people within that industry buy the product or service. The firm's strategic market position is
differentiation, and its strategic market size is broad.

An example of a firm that follows a broad differentiation strategy is Marriott International, which differentiates itself through a
wide range of premium accommodations and customer service, catering to both business and leisure travelers worldwide.

One significant advantage of broad differentiation strategies is the ability to attract a large customer base while maintaining higher
profit margins. Customers are often willing to pay premium prices for products or services that they perceive as superior, allowing
firms to sustain profitability despite higher production or marketing costs. Additionally, strong brand recognition and customer
loyalty fostered by differentiation can provide long-term competitive advantages, reducing vulnerability to price-based competi-
206 | 8. FORMULATE BUSINESS-LEVEL STRATEGY

tion. For example, BMW is able to command higher prices for its vehicles from a large worldwide consumer base that appreciates
the admiration tied to the brand.

Broad differentiation also enables firms to adapt to diverse customer preferences. By offering products or services that appeal to a
wide audience but maintain unique attributes, companies can meet the varied demands of their customer base, driving growth and
market share. For instance, Toyota's Lexus brand targets luxury car buyers globally with a blend of premium quality, technology, and
reliability.

Although broad differentiation can be beneficial, these strategies are accompanied with challenges as well. One major disadvan-
tage is the significant cost of maintaining differentiation while serving a large, diverse market. High investments in research, devel-
opment, branding, and marketing are often required to sustain a unique position, which can strain a firm's resources.

Firms pursuing broad differentiation are also vulnerable to imitation. Competitors with lower costs may attempt to replicate unique
features or quality, eroding the firm's competitive advantage. For example, luxury fashion brands like Gucci often face competition
from lower-cost brands or counterfeit producers that mimic their designs and style. These imitators can attract price-sensitive cus-
tomers, potentially diluting the exclusivity and perceived value of the high-end brand.

Company Example

Nordstrom Nordstrom, as well as other department stores, like Macy's, builds a broad differentiation strategy around offering designer merchandise and providing exceptional service to a broad market.

        Nike builds its broad differentiation strategy around its athletic products, including exclusive footwear, apparel, and sports

Nike    equipment, using its strong household reputation, athletic endorsements, and continuous innovations to consistently appeal to

        audiences worldwide.

Ralph   Top-tier designer apparel line Ralph Lauren employs a broad differentiation strategy, offering exclusive items to a broad market.
Lauren

FedEx   FedEx's former slogan, "When it absolutely, positively has to be there overnight," highlights the commitment to very speedy
        delivery that differentiates them from competitors such as UPS and the U.S. Postal Service.

Airbnb  Airbnb's strategy is to differentiate themselves by providing unique and diverse lodging experiences internationally, from
        treehouses to farmhouses, setting them apart from traditional hotel chains. Airbnb's brand focuses on local experiences and
        owner personalization, which appeals to guests who are looking for something different from the typical hotel.

Key Takeaways

A broad differentiation strategy is a business-level strategy that combines a broad strategic market size and a differentiation approach.
This strategy is effective when most consumers within the market buy the product or service and those customers want a quality product.
Broad differentiation combines the advantages of offering unique, high-quality products or services with the ability to appeal to a large,
diverse customer base. This business-level strategy allows firms to command high prices and build brand loyalty, making it a powerful
approach in competitive markets. However, broad differentiation requires significant investments in innovation, marketing, and oper-
ational efficiency to maintain a distinctive position while serving a wide audience. Companies must carefully balance broad market
appeal with their unique value proposition to avoid diluting the brand or losing focus. The success of broad differentiation lies in contin-
ually delivering value that resonates across multiple customer segments while protecting the brand from imitation and maintaining its
competitive edge.

8.10 Focused Differentiation

A firm that pursues a focused differentiation strategy targets a narrow, niche market segment and offers quality products. The
firm distinguishes itself in the market by responding to consumer preferences for luxury items, offering products or services that
are perceived as unique or superior by customers. The company concentrates on a niche target market, and the product or service
is not meant for most people in the industry. The firm's strategic market position is differentiation, and its strategic market size is
208 | 8. FORMULATE BUSINESS-LEVEL STRATEGY

focused. Focused differentiation involves offering unique, differentiated products or services tailored to the specific needs of a niche
market segment, allowing the firm to charge premium prices.

The focused differentiation strategy involves a firm targeting a specific niche market and offering products or services that are
highly differentiated and tailored to meet the unique needs of that market segment. Focused differentiation concentrates on a
particular consumer group with specific preferences or demands. The essence of this strategy is to provide something unique and
valuable for which customers in the market will pay a premium. By doing so, firms can build strong customer loyalty and insulate
themselves from price-based competition, as customers are drawn to the specialized nature of the product or service rather than
any factor relating to price.

One of the primary characteristics of focused differentiation strategies is the ability to offer a product or service that is difficult for
competitors to replicate. Companies that pursue this approach spend significant time and resources studying the needs, desires,
and pain points of their target customers. By honing in on these unique characteristics, the firm can craft a highly specialized offer-
ing that resonates with the segment. For example, Ferrari focuses exclusively on high-performance luxury cars for affluent cus-
tomers who value exclusivity, design, and engineering excellence. The company's focused differentiation strategy allows it to cater
specifically to a small but wealthy market that is less sensitive to price and more concerned with brand prestige and performance.

The success of the focused differentiation strategy often hinges on brand loyalty and customer retention. Because the firm's product
or service is so tailored to the specific needs of its niche market segment, customers develop strong brand loyalty and are less likely
to switch to competitors. The emotional connection and perceived value of the specialized offering create a barrier to entry for
other firms. This allows companies to build long-term relationships with their customers, fostering repeat business and reducing
the threat of price competition. By continually innovating and maintaining a close connection with their market segment, focused
differentiators can sustain a competitive advantage in the long run. Many individuals stay loyal to Apple due to their seamless con-
nectivity across devices like the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and MacBook. The integration of services, such as iCloud and AirDrop,
incentivizes customers to stay with Apple in order for their devices to stay connected. Apple's focus on the creative professional mar-
ket segment has allowed it to cultivate a highly loyal customer base willing to pay a premium for the brand's high-performance
products.

However, the narrow strategic market size of focused differentiation means that firms must remain vigilant in staying aligned with
the evolving needs of their quality-conscious customers. Changes in customer preferences or shifts in the market can quickly erode
the competitive advantage if the firm fails to adapt. Additionally, the company's growth potential may be more limited compared
to firms pursuing broader strategies because the company targets a smaller market segment. Nevertheless, for firms that can effec-
tively cater to a specialized group and offer something truly unique, focused differentiation provides an opportunity to build a
strong, loyal customer base and command premium prices, establishing a distinct market position.

One of the most prominent examples of a focused differentiation strategy is Tesla, which has redefined the automotive industry
by offering electric vehicles (EVs) that combine luxury, sustainability, and advanced technology. Tesla's vehicles stand out for their
long-range electric powertrains, high performance, and innovative software features, including autonomous driving capabilities.
Beyond the product itself, Tesla has differentiated its brand by providing over-the-air software updates that continually enhance the
functionality and performance of its cars, allowing customers to experience new features long after their initial purchases. Tesla's
commitment to innovation, sustainable transportation, and cutting-edge design has created a loyal customer base that is willing
to pay a premium for these exclusive benefits. This has positioned Tesla as a leader not only in the EV market but also in the broader
technology and luxury spaces. By differentiating itself through innovation and performance, Tesla maintains a loyal customer base
that values its products beyond just their functional capabilities.

While Tesla has enjoyed a significant lead in electric vehicle technology, other automakers are rapidly developing their own EV
models, forcing Tesla to continuously innovate to maintain its competitive edge. This ongoing investment can put pressure on prof-
itability, particularly if the firm is unable to justify premium pricing indefinitely. While Tesla's initial differentiation was its pioneer-
ing electric vehicle technology, other automakers like Ford and Volkswagen have introduced their own electric models, with some
offering similar features at more competitive prices. The more these rivals imitate Tesla's differentiation points, the more difficult
                                                                                                             8. FORMULATE BUSINESS-LEVEL STRATEGY | 209

it becomes for Tesla to maintain its premium positioning without introducing new innovations. This ongoing investment can put
pressure on profitability, particularly if the firm is unable to justify premium pricing indefinitely.

A different but equally strong example of focused differentiation can be found in Palantir, a data analytics company that has set
itself apart by offering highly specialized and customizable software solutions for governments and large enterprises. Palantir's dif-
ferentiation lies in its ability to provide powerful, mission-critical tools that help organizations make sense of massive amounts of
data for intelligence, defense, and commercial applications. Palantir's platforms, such as Gotham and Foundry, are renowned for
their ability to integrate and analyze vast datasets, offering insights that drive key decision-making processes. What differentiates
Palantir from other software companies is its deep collaboration with clients. Its software is not a one-size-fits-all solution but is
tailored to the specific needs of each client, whether it be national security, public health, or financial services. This level of cus-
tomization, combined with Palantir's expertise in handling highly sensitive data, has made it indispensable to clients that require
precision, security, and flexibility, allowing the company to charge premium prices for its services and building long-term relation-
ships with its clients. Because Palantir tailors its software to meet the exact needs of its clients, the switching costs for customers are
high, and they are less likely to move to another provider, even if a cheaper option becomes available.

Both Tesla and Palantir demonstrate the power of focused differentiation to establish a strong market presence. Tesla's focus on
innovative, luxury electric vehicles and Palantir's ability to provide customized, high-stakes data solutions have allowed both com-
panies to build loyal customer bases and command premium pricing. By offering unique value propositions that competitors find
difficult to replicate, these firms have carved out durable competitive advantages in their respective industries. Differentiation,
when executed effectively, enables companies like Tesla and Palantir to transcend traditional price competition and build deeper
connections with their customers based on the specialized benefits they offer.

                                                       Patagonia is another company that uses a focused differentiation busi-
                                                       ness-level strategy. Patagonia is known for giving their consumers high-
                                                       quality, durable outdoor clothing and for having a commitment to
                                                       environmental activism through various environmental programs. This
                                                       company targets eco-conscious adventurers that are willing to pay extra
                                                       for sustainable products from a company that cares about the planet.

                                                       Success in focused differentiation comes from knowing the customer
                                                       segment deeply and offering a product that is tailored specifically to their
                                                       needs and preferences.

Figure 8.7: Patagonia                                  Oatly, a Swedish food com-

                                                       based milk made from oats.

They differentiate themselves within the milk industry by promoting their strong envi-

ronmental responsibility and sustainability as well as by using a marketing approach

focused on humor to appeal to eco-conscious consumers and vegans by highlighting

the benefits of oat milk over traditional dairy milk.

A focused differentiation strategy works well in industries where customer prefer-      Figure 8.8: Oatly
ences are highly diverse and specialized products can command higher prices. Compa-
nies pursuing focused differentiation may target high-end customers, specific
geographic regions, or niche needs within a broader market. Ferrari, for example,
focuses on a luxury, high-performance car market, providing exclusive, differentiated
vehicles to a narrow audience of high-end consumers. Success in focused differentia-
tion comes from knowing the customer segment deeply and offering a product that is
tailored specifically to their needs and preferences.

8.11 Best-Cost Strategy

There are two business-level strategies that rely on combining a cost leadership approach and a differentiation approach. The first
is a best-cost strategy, a hybrid approach that combines elements of both cost leadership and differentiation in an existing market
or market segment.

A best-cost strategy allows firms to offer products or services with superior features at lower prices than competitors. This strategy
seeks to deliver more value to customers by providing high quality while keeping costs lower than rivals who offer similar levels of
quality.

By offering both superior quality and competitive pricing, firms employing this strategy can attract both price-conscious consumers
and those who are willing to pay a bit more for added value. This dual appeal allows companies to capture market share from both
low-cost competitors and premium brands.
212 | 8. FORMULATE BUSINESS-LEVEL STRATEGY

To successfully implement a best-cost strategy, companies must tightly control costs while continuing to invest in features or attrib-
utes that enhance the perceived value of their offerings. This requires efficient operations, strong supply chain management, and
a focus on innovation. Firms need to leverage technology, economies of scale, and operational efficiency to keep production costs
down, allowing them to offer competitive pricing without sacrificing quality.

Strategic Market Position: A Continuum

For firms that implement broad cost leadership, focused cost leadership, broad differentiation, or focused differentiation business-
level strategy, an assumption is that the two dimensions that underpin these strategies consist of two primary and opposing
choices. As you recall, a firm defining its strategic market position either follows a cost leadership strategy and appeals to cost-
conscious customers or it follows a differentiation strategy and appeals consumer preferences for luxury items. When defining a
company's strategic market size, a firm either follows a focused approach, targeting a narrow, niche market segment or a broad
approach, targeting a broad market.

A best-cost strategy primarily focuses on this first dimension, strategic market position. A best-cost strategy is based on the starting
premise that the choice of strategic market position is a continuum of choices, with pure cost leadership at one end and pure differ-
entiation at the other. There are many points along the strategic market position continuum that represent varying degrees of cost
leadership and differentiation.

In practice, firms that follow a best-cost strategy aim to balance offering some degree of luxury with offering as low a cost as possi-
ble. Firms compete, at least indirectly, with both cost leadership and differentiation rivals. They often aim to acquire market share
from rivals using both cost leadership and differentiation strategies.

Although best-cost strategy primarily addresses strategic market position, all firms using this strategy must also choose their
strategic market size. A best-cost strategy is based on the assumption that the choice of a strategic market size is also a continuum
of choices, with a pure focused approach at one end and a pure broad approach at the other. There are many points along the con-
tinuum that represent varying degrees of targeting a narrow niche market segment through a focused approach and targeting a
broad market through a broad approach.

For example, IKEA uses a best-cost strategy by offering stylish, well-designed furniture at affordable prices. While customers could
find cheaper options at discount furniture stores or more luxurious items at high-end retailers, IKEA's combination of modern
design and reasonable pricing allows it to appeal to both markets, giving customers the perception of high value.

Toyota uses a best-cost strategy with its Lexus brand, offering luxury features at lower prices than traditional luxury automakers like
Mercedes-Benz or BMW. Toyota achieves this balance by leveraging its efficient manufacturing processes and economies of scale,
keeping costs low while maintaining high quality in its Lexus line. Lexus appeals to customers who may not be able to afford more
luxury vehicles or who choose not to spend their money on more expensive automobiles from a value perspective but who still want
a little luxury at a reasonable price.

Another example of a company that follows a best-cost strategy in the fast-fashion industry is Zara. Zara has successfully employed
a best-cost strategy by offering trendy, stylish clothing at relatively affordable prices. Zara's ability to quickly produce fashion-for-
ward designs while maintaining competitive pricing gives it an edge over both lower-cost fast-fashion competitors and more expen-
sive designer brands.

Advantages

A best-cost strategy can achieve a strong competitive advantage. The ability to offer customers more value for their money--high-
quality products at reasonable prices--creates a compelling proposition in many markets. Companies that master this strategy can
                                                                                                             8. FORMULATE BUSINESS-LEVEL STRATEGY | 213

build a loyal customer base and protect themselves from competitive pressures by offering a unique blend of cost efficiency and
quality. The best-cost strategy allows firms to occupy a middle ground between cost leadership and differentiation, giving them
flexibility and broad appeal.

Disadvantages

The best-cost strategy can be challenging to execute because it requires excellence in both cost management and differentiation,
which are different strategies with different trade-offs. Firms must be able to provide features or qualities that customers value
while maintaining low-cost structures. Balancing the cost driver of cost leadership and the value driver of differentiation is difficult
in practice.

This best-cost strategy works well in a market where customers want both a little luxury and affordability, but it might not be as
effective in markets or market segments where customers prioritize either luxury or the lowest possible price. The strategy works
best in markets where customers want products that offer enhanced features but are not willing to pay premium prices, combin-
ing differentiation and affordability. The goal of the best-cost strategy is to strike a balance, offering customers more value for their
money without sacrificing profitability.

Company Example

Southwest   Southwest Airlines offers low-cost flights to a limited number of vacation destinations, a strategy resembling a cost leadership
Airlines    strategy. Additionally, Southwest provides exceptional customer service and offers a distinctive flying experience by focusing on
            creating fun. Southwest Airlines successfully employs the hybrid best-cost strategy.

Target      Target offers extremely competitive prices, but the firm also differentiates itself from other discount retailers by carrying
            products from trendy designers such as Michael Graves, Isaac Mizrahi, Fiorucci, and Universal Thread.

Chipotle    Chipotle Mexican Grill offers a limited menu of low-cost Mexican fare. However, the menu is customizable and uses organic
            ingredients. Chipotle successfully employs the hybrid best-cost strategy.

            IKEA uses a best-cost strategy by offering stylish, well-designed furniture at affordable prices. While customers could find

IKEA        cheaper options at discount furniture stores or more luxurious items at high-end retailers, IKEA's combination of modern design

            and reasonable pricing allows it to appeal to both markets, giving customers the perception of high value.

HelloFresh  HelloFresh, a meal kit delivery service, offers cheap healthy meal plans compared to dining out, while using fresh ingredients and
            simple recipes. Their direct-to-consumer approach allows their busy consumers to enjoy high-quality meals at home for a much
            lower cost than ordering takeout or eating out. Hello Fresh successfully uses the hybrid best-cost strategy.

Toyota      Toyota has used a best-cost strategy with its Lexus brand, offering luxury features at lower prices than traditional luxury
            automakers like Mercedes-Benz or BMW.

            Zara has successfully employed a best-cost strategy by offering trendy, stylish clothing at relatively affordable prices. Zara's ability

Zara        to quickly produce fashion-forward designs while maintaining competitive pricing gives it an edge over both lower-cost

            fast-fashion competitors and more expensive designer brands.

Figure 8.10: Best-cost strategy examples

One way to be successful by using a best-cost strategy is by reducing overhead costs while providing innovative quality products.
Entrepreneurial enterprises may have an advantage when it comes to balancing reducing overhead and providing creative products
and may find a best-cost strategy appealing.

Entrepreneurs in the food industry are an excellent example of this strategy, as seen in figure 8.11.

Toast   sourdough. The Toast Truck, a food truck based out of Detroit, can keep their costs low by using their mobile format, allowing
Truck   customers to enjoy artisanal flavors without the overhead cost of running a full restaurant.

Crave   Crave Crepes uses a crepe cart to keeps things simple, selling crepes with great toppings such as Nutella and strawberries or ham
Crepes  with Swiss cheese, which are all under $5. Their cart setup allows for Crave Crepes to keep overhead low while also still being able to
        deliver fresh and made-to-order crepes.

Bento   Bento Heaven in Miami specializes in Japanese-style bento boxes that are all under $8 and packed with options like teriyaki
Heaven  chicken, tofu katsu, and vegetable tempura. By focusing on small and well-curated meals, they can provide variety and affordability
        to their customers, allowing them to become a go-to spot for many.

Key Takeaways

The best-cost strategy allows firms to offer high-quality, differentiated products at competitive prices, appealing to both price-conscious
consumers and those seeking superior features, which creates a strong value proposition in diverse markets. Successfully executing a
best-cost strategy requires tight cost control combined with continuous investment in innovation and quality, as firms must balance cost
efficiency with delivering differentiated value to avoid being outcompeted by both low-cost and premium brands. Firms must carefully
manage their cost structures while continuing to innovate and invest in the features that set them apart. When executed well, the best-
cost strategy can give companies an edge over both low-cost and premium competitors, appealing to customers looking for value with-
out compromise. However, firms must navigate the challenges of maintaining both cost and quality to avoid falling into the trap of being
outperformed on both fronts.

8.12 Blue Ocean Strategy

Some firms find it difficult to strictly adhere to either a cost leadership or differentiation strategy, as market conditions often require
a blend of cost control and differentiation. Firms that choose a best-cost strategy combine cost leadership and differentiation in
existing markets. Other companies are bold, creating a completely new market using a blue ocean strategy, which is also a combi-
nation of cost leadership and differentiation but with the distinction of market creation.

Blue ocean strategy is a relatively new strategic approach which has resonated both in the academic community and the corporate
world. The core goals of the blue ocean strategy are to create uncontested market space and ideally make competition irrelevant.
By doing so, blue ocean strategy breaks the paradigm that business is a zero-sum game in which a company can only increase its
business at the expense of its competitors.

In contrast to blue ocean strategy, red ocean leads to competing on the same attributes with the same or similar products and ser-
vices as the organization's competitors; in this situation, market share gains can only be achieved at the expense of competitors.
When all industry players compete in this red ocean, they face intense competition with limited differentiation, using price as one
of the means to gain market share. This approach will eventually lead to lower industry profit, a limited industry attractiveness, and
eventually a deterioration of profitability for all players in the red ocean.

Business professors Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne identified the blue ocean strategy. This new paradigm strategically positions
a business for success and is characterized by the following elements.

  · Creating uncontested markets instead of competing in an existing market space
  · Making the competition irrelevant instead of beating them
  · Creating new demand instead of capturing more of the existing demand
  · Creating value innovation that disproves the value/cost trade-off

Value innovation as one of the core principles of blue ocean strategy, which defies the notion that a business can only select either a
differentiation or cost leadership strategy. The blue ocean strategy simultaneously pursues both through the concept of value inno-
vation. Successfully combining differentiation and cost leadership activities through value innovation allows a business to conquer
untapped market space, create additional demand, and pursue opportunities for highly profitable growth.

An example of a company that followed a blue ocean strategy to great success is Marvel. Marvel was founded in 1939 as a comic book
company, and its customers were children. In the 1960s, Marvel followed a blue ocean strategy by seeking new customers, college
students, with superheroes that were humans first and superheroes second, like the Hulk. In the 1980s, Marvel returned to a red
ocean strategy by repeating the same strategy with little innovation. Customers were alienated, and the company went bankrupt.
In 1999, Peter Cuneo was appointed CEO, and he is credited with taking Marvel from bankruptcy to its purchase by Disney to being
valued at over four billion dollars in a decade. In achieving this, Marvel also transformed movie production. Marvel is an excellent
example of a blue ocean strategy because it not only opened a new field, it reconstructed the field to open a blue ocean. Marvel was
able to create unprecedented value at a low cost, using both differentiation and cost leadership to create a new a market.

There are many advantages to following a blue ocean strategy, such as brand identity and customer loyalty. However, a firm cannot
remain in the same blue ocean indefinitely because competitors quickly enter the blue ocean, turning it red. It takes continuous
innovation to lead an industry in a blue ocean. As you can see from the case of Marvel, a company can create multiple blue ocean
strategies.

While this sounds surely very compelling and like a "no-brainer" for every business leader and strategy expert, the decisive question
is where and how an organization can find these "magic" blue oceans. The answer to this success-critical question is the thorough
use of value curves.
              8. FORMULATE BUSINESS-LEVEL STRATEGY | 217

Value Curves

The value curve is a different concept from the value chain analysis. The value curve is a two-dimensional graph that shows the prin-
cipal buying factors on the X-axis and the service level on the Y-axis.

The X-axis depicts the competing factors that are the main factors that a customer considers in a buying decision in the specific
industry. Typical principal buying factors are price, innovation, reliability, customer service, supply security, global availability, and
sustainability of the offered product and service, among others. These principal buying factors are specific to the industry in which
the business operates.

The Y-axis depicts the service level offered per principal buying factor, ranked from low to high (for example, on a scale from 0 - 5 or
0 - 10).

Using this concept, the organization creates two different value curves. The industry as-is curve depicts the current profile of offer-
ings. Additionally, the company depicts its current value curve for its business.

                          Figure 8.13: Value curve

Lastly, the organization identifies a blue ocean market space by purposefully and intentionally diverting from the as-is industry
value curve. The logic of this move is that the organization deliberately does not want to offer the same level of the same principal
buying factors, which would lead to the classic red ocean play. Based on the as-is industry curve and the current value curve of the
organization, a blue ocean can be identified by raising the service level of certain principal buying factors, reducing the service level,
eliminating certain product and service elements, and creating new product and service factors.
218 | 8. FORMULATE BUSINESS-LEVEL STRATEGY

               Figure 8.14: Creating a blue ocean value curve
Through this process, the organization purposefully creates a new value curve that deviates from the as-is industry curve. This blue
ocean move means that the business is not operating anymore in the same market space, as it has created a differentiated offering
that ideally creates a new blue ocean space.
The organization that uses this approach lowers its costs by eliminating or
reducing factors that the industry takes for granted and that are the indus-
try's current standard. At the same time, the business also increases per-
ceived consumer benefits by raising and creating factors well above the
industry's standard or by offering completely new factors that the industry
has never offered. This simultaneous reduction of costs and creation of
new benefits supports the value innovation at the core of blue ocean strat-
egy as a combination of differentiation and cost leadership strategies.
Value innovation places equal emphasis on value and innovation. As such,
it is a new way of thinking about and executing strategy that results in the
creation of a blue ocean. The creation of blue oceans allows driving costs
down while simultaneously driving value up for buyers.
The graph in figure 8.16 shows a blue ocean value curve that purposefully
deviates from the industry curve.

                                                                                                  Figure 8.15: Value innovation as the result of lowering costs while

Key Takeaways

The blue ocean strategy can be a very powerful strategic approach to drive competitive differentiation and carve out a niche of unique-
ness in otherwise crowded and competitive markets. The key to a successful blue ocean strategy is a very profound and in-depth market
understanding of what customers truly value and want to pay for and what competitors are currently offering. Value curves for the indus-
try and for the organization using blue ocean strategy are the basis for identifying uncontested market space. Many leading companies
involve key customers in designing differentiating value curves by checking which principal buying factors really matter to them and
which buying factors they are truly willing to pay for. Using this customer input and the in-depth market understanding, companies
220 | 8. FORMULATE BUSINESS-LEVEL STRATEGY

     design new blue ocean value curves using the concept of value innovation by lowering and eliminating specific factors (cost leadership
     element) and by raising or adding new factors (differentiating element). The new blue ocean value curve is then implemented in the new
     strategy and the new differentiating business model.

8.13 Stuck in the Middle

Companies that attempt to combine cost leadership and differentiation strategies and fail to balance the tensions inherent in cost
leadership and differentiation may end up being stuck in the middle, unable to compete on price with low-cost leaders or on qual-
ity with premium brands. This is a risk for companies following a best-cost strategy, which focuses on existing markets or market
segments. It is also a risk for firms that are attempting to create entirely new markets by following a blue ocean strategy.
For instance, if a firm attempts to cut costs too aggressively, it may erode the value of its differentiated features, causing customers
to perceive the product as inferior. Conversely, if the firm invests too heavily in enhancing product features without controlling costs,
it may not be able to offer competitive pricing, limiting its appeal to price-sensitive consumers.
                                                                                                             8. FORMULATE BUSINESS-LEVEL STRATEGY | 221

When firms are stuck in the middle, they are left without a clear competitive advantage. These firms cannot compete on price with
low-cost leaders, nor can they offer unique enough products or services to justify premium pricing.

A recent example of a company caught in this strategic dilemma is Fisker Automotive, an electric vehicle manufacturer. Fisker
attempted to position itself as both a luxury electric vehicle producer, competing with Tesla, and as an affordable option for environ-
mentally conscious consumers. However, the company failed to differentiate itself with unique technology or a distinct brand iden-
tity. At the same time, it was unable to achieve the cost efficiencies required to compete with lower-priced electric vehicle options
offered by larger manufacturers. This misalignment left Fisker without a strong customer base, and the company filed for bank-
ruptcy in 2024 after struggling to find a buyer or secure additional funding to continue operations.

Another company that recently became stuck in the middle is Bed Bath & Beyond, which filed for bankruptcy in 2023. Bed Bath &
Beyond was once a dominant player in the home goods market, but over time, the company failed to clearly define its competitive
strategy. It was unable to effectively compete with low-cost giants like Walmart and Amazon, who offered similar products at lower
prices. At the same time, the company did not differentiate itself enough in terms of customer experience, product offerings, or con-
venience to maintain its status as a go-to destination for home goods. As online retailers gained market share with more efficient
operations and aggressive pricing, Bed Bath & Beyond found itself squeezed between cost leaders and brands that are more innov-
ative or customer-centric, ultimately leading to its collapse.

Being stuck in the middle poses significant risks for companies. Without a clear value proposition, these firms face increasing pres-
sure from all sides. Competitors with well-defined cost leadership or differentiation strategies will be better positioned to attract
customers, leaving middle-ground companies vulnerable to shrinking margins, declining sales, and loss of relevance in the mar-
ket. Both Fisker and Bed Bath & Beyond serve as recent examples of how lacking strategic focus can lead to financial instability and
eventually bankruptcy.

Company Example

Arby's      Arby's signature roast beef sandwiches are neither more affordable than other fast-food options nor are they exceptional in
            flavor. Arby's has failed to implement either a cost leadership or a differentiation strategy.

Under       Under Armour has been in a tough situation. Positioned between budget-friendly athletic wear brands like Adidas and
Armour      premium brands like Nike, it struggles to clearly define its market segment. It lacks the aspirational and product quality image
            of its premium competitors and the affordability of its value brand competitors, which has led to consistent slow growth and
            missed revenue targets. Under Armour has failed to implement either a cost leadership or a differentiation strategy.

GameStop    Video game retailer GameStop has consistently struggled to stay relevant in the age of digital downloads and competition from
            online platforms like Amazon and Steam. Unable to compete on price or deliver a unique customer experience, GameStop has
            faced many store closures and huge revenue declines.

IHOP        The International House of Pancakes, aka IHOP, is known for its breakfast, but it is stuck in between fast-casual spots like
            Denny's and Waffle House and premium trendy brunch locales that offer more modern and social-media-friendly experiences.
            IHOP's inability to become an affordable breakfast option with quick service or to provide their customers with aesthetically
            pleasing dishes for social media has led to many store closures.

Fisker      Fisker attempted to position itself as both a luxury electric vehicle producer, competing with Tesla, and as an affordable option
Automotive  for environmentally conscious consumers. However, the company failed to differentiate itself with unique technology or a
            distinct brand identity. At the same time, it was unable to achieve the cost efficiencies required to compete with lower-priced
            electric vehicle options offered by larger manufacturers.

Bed Bath &  Bed Bath & Beyond failed to clearly define its competitive strategy. It was unable to effectively compete with low-cost giants like
Beyond      Walmart and Amazon, who offer similar products at lower prices. At the same time, the company did not differentiate itself
            enough in terms of customer experience, product offerings, or convenience to maintain its status as a go-to destination for
            home goods.

     and relevance, often leading to financial instability, as seen in recent bankruptcies like Fisker and Bed Bath & Beyond.

8.14 Limitations of Business-Level Strategies

While broad cost leadership, focused cost leadership, broad differentiation, and focused differentiation provide useful frameworks
for understanding competitive positioning, they have several limitations. One of the key challenges is that these strategies can be
overly simplistic and may not fully capture the complexity of real-world competition. Competitors can easily imitate cost or differ-
entiation advantages, eroding a firm's edge.
The existence of hybrid strategies like best-cost strategy can lead to some firms trying to do too much, getting stuck in the middle of
the industry. Additionally, shifting customer preferences, technological advancements, and the fast-paced nature of industries can
make these static strategies less effective over time, requiring firms to constantly adapt their approach to remain competitive.

     Key Takeaways

     The business-level strategies can be overly simplistic and may not fully capture the complexity of real-world competition.

8.15 Analyze Business-Level Strategy

Strategic business unit managers focus on formulating business-level strategies. When you conduct a case analysis, you analyze a
firm's business-level strategy. This is step six in the case analysis process.

6. As appropriate to the case, analyze strategies: Corporate-level, business-level, innovation, sustainability and ethics, technol­
ogy, and multinational strategies.

   a. Use strategic management analytical frameworks to analyze, interpret, and evaluate strategies.
   b. Ensure line of sight and congruence within analysis of each strategy.

8.16 Why Business-Level Strategy Is Important to Business Graduates

Just like corporate-level strategy, business-level strategy has a direct influence on the implementation of functional-level strategy.
Business graduates that start as business support unit managers will support business units of large companies, such as business
information technology managers. They may be asked to support divisional or strategic business unit managers by providing data
analysis from functional business managers, such as managers of marketing, accounting, and human resource management are
ideally placed to assist with. As divisional mangers choose between broad cost leadership, broad differentiation, focused cost lead-
ership, focused differentiation, and best cost strategies, the access that business support unit managers have to key data and their
skills with robust data analysis is essential support for divisional leaders. Even in those more rare instances of a firm that follows a
blue ocean strategy, timely data analysis is vital to a successful outcome.

Those of you joining smaller companies will immediately spend more time working closely with divisional or strategic business unit
managers responsible for business-level strategy. Business graduates that enter either internal or external consulting roles require
a high level of competence with business-level strategy to communicate to divisional or strategic business unit managers how their
consulting projects fit into the business-level strategy of the firm. Some of you already are or will become entrepreneurs, and flu-
ency with business-level strategy is essential to establishing and growing a successful firm. It is essential to know how your com-
pany competes within its chosen market and market segments.

8.17 Conclusion

Business-level strategies are essential for firms to create and sustain competitive advantage in their respective markets. Companies
must clearly define how they will compete to serve their target customers effectively. Each strategy has its benefits and challenges,
requiring careful alignment of resources, capabilities, and core competencies. Firms that fail to commit to a clear strategy risk
224 | 8. FORMULATE BUSINESS-LEVEL STRATEGY

becoming stuck in the middle, where they lose out to both low-cost leaders and differentiated competitors. To thrive, companies
must remain adaptable, continuously refining their strategies to meet evolving market conditions and customer needs. Firms can
pursue one of six business-level strategies: broad cost leadership, focused cost leadership, broad differentiation, focused differenti-
ation, best-cost strategy, or blue ocean strategy. Each offer a distinct path to achieving competitive advantage.

     Demonstrate Your Knowledge, Skills, and Competence

9.1 Introduction

In this chapter, you first learn what innovation strategy is. Next you learn about entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and its role in inno-
vation. This term is applied to both entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship, as well as to individuals. EO accounts for innovative-
ness, proactiveness, and risk-taking. This chapter also discusses why innovation is important and the four major types of innovation.
These differ along two dimensions. The first considers whether the company is innovating by creating a new market or addressing
an opportunity in an existing market. The second dimension of innovation considers whether the innovation uses a new technology
or takes advantage of existing technology. Incremental innovation involves entering an existing market with existing technology;
disruptive innovation enters an existing market with new technology; architectural innovation enters a new market with existing
technology; and radical innovation enters a new market with new technology. After considering the four types of innovation, you
learn that first movers are those firms that enter a market first and fast followers enter the market after first movers pave the way.
Then you learn how the four types of innovation and first movers and fast followers apply to a product's life cycle (introduction,
growth, maturity, and decline).

As this chapter continues, you learn the five stages of a company's product adoption cycle or an industry's technological advance-
ment. These five stages are innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards. You learn the importance of cross-
ing the chasm as a means of sustaining a product's growth in the market. You revisit internal development, strategic alliances, joint
ventures, and mergers and acquisitions as means of cooperating with other firms. Next you learn ways of responding to innovation
230 | 9. FORMULATE INNOVATION STRATEGY
in the market, including multipoint competition, responding to disruptive innovations, fighting brands, co-location, and co-opeti-
tion. Then you learn how to measure a firm's performance through the lens of innovation. Finally, you learn how to analyze innova-
tion strategy.

9.2 Innovation Strategy

Like all strategy formulation, innovation strategy formulation answers the question "Where are we going?" Innovation strategy
addresses where a firm is going as it relates specifically to innovation. All firms need to address innovation and innovation strategy.

Innovation strategy is the first strategy you learn that is embedded in business-level strategy at the strategic business unit level
of a firm. Strategies that are embedded in business-level strategies address the "Right to win?" question. All companies have the
ambition to win in their chosen markets. They want to gain market share, increase revenue and profit, and enter new markets and
regions, among other barometers of success. However, strategy is more than a wish list of what a company would ideally want to do
and achieve. Strategy is a company-specific roadmap for navigating in its industry, directing how a firm moves from its current state
toward the firm's vision.

Like all strategy, innovation strategy focuses on an outside-in perspective. Companies need to carefully monitor their external envi-
ronments. They need to analyze trends and formulate strategies that are forward-looking. Robust innovation strategy takes into
account the volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) nature of the firm's external environment, where change and dis-
ruption have become the new normal.

A firm's approach to innovation plays a crucial role in shaping its competitive advantage. A strong commitment to innovation, often
reflected in a firm's entrepreneurial mindset, drives the development of new products and services while refining existing offerings.
This process of continuous improvement not only enhances the company's market position but also expands its reach into new,
often untapped, markets.

     Key Takeaways

     Like all strategy formulation, innovation strategy formulation answers the question of where a firm is going. Innovation strategy
     addresses where a firm is going as it relates specifically to innovation. All firms need to address innovation and innovation strategy. Inno-
     vation strategy is embedded in business-level strategy at the strategic business unit level of a firm. Strategies that are embedded in busi-
     ness-level strategies address the "Right to win?" question. A firm's approach to innovation plays a crucial role in shaping its competitive
     advantage.

9.3 Entrepreneurial Orientation

An essential part of innovation, entrepreneurial orientation (EO) is a fundamental concept in strategic management and entre-
preneurship, capturing the essence of how firms innovate, take risks, and proactively engage with the market to seize new oppor-
tunities. At its core, EO reflects a firm's willingness to embrace change, challenge the status quo, and explore uncharted territories,
which can drive growth and competitive advantage. By embodying a mindset that prioritizes bold strategic moves, agility, and a
forward-looking perspective, companies with strong EO are better positioned to navigate uncertainty, respond to shifting market
                                                                                                                 9. FORMULATE INNOVATION STRATEGY | 231

dynamics, and sustain long-term success. Understanding EO offers valuable insights into how firms can cultivate a culture of entre-
preneurship to thrive in today's dynamic business environment.

Entrepreneurial orientation is characterized by three core traits: innovativeness, proactiveness, and risk-taking. Innovativeness rep-
resents a company's willingness to experiment with new ideas, products, or processes. Proactiveness refers to a firm's ability to
anticipate and act on future opportunities rather than simply reacting to external changes. Risk-taking involves the willingness
to invest in uncertain ventures and explore new territories, even when the outcomes are unknown. Although EO has traditionally
focused on these three characteristics, two additional traits, competitive aggressiveness and autonomy, have been proposed as part
of EO. However, these have sparked debate in academic circles and are excluded from this discussion so that we may focus on the
core dimensions of EO that are universally recognized.

Innovativeness

Innovativeness refers to the drive to embrace creativity and experimentation. Some innovations are incremental, building on exist-
ing skills to make small improvements, while others are more radical, demanding new skills and potentially rendering old ones
obsolete. The goal of innovativeness is to develop new products, services, or processes. Companies that excel in innovation typically
outperform those that fail to prioritize it, gaining a competitive edge and enhancing overall performance.

Renowned for its commitment to efficiency, UPS introduced its
ORION system, an innovative technology that optimizes deliv-
ery routes in real time, saving fuel and reducing delivery times.
This type of advancement is particularly valuable for busi-
nesses handling time-sensitive goods, such as pharmaceuti-
cals or fresh produce. But how do companies come up with
such innovations that address their customers' specific and
complex needs?

Companies like Apple and Atlassian offer some insights. Apple
frequently sends its design teams into consumer environments
to better understand user pain points and needs, resulting in
products that anticipate market demand. Atlassian, known for
its project management tools, allows employees to dedicate a Figure 9.1: UPS
portion of their work hours to passion projects, leading to the
creation of new features like Jira's customizable workflows. These examples highlight how encouraging employee autonomy can
fuel innovation, demonstrating how multiple dimensions of entrepreneurial orientation, such as autonomy and innovativeness,
can work together to drive breakthrough ideas.

Proactiveness

Proactiveness refers to the ability to anticipate and act on future needs rather than merely responding to events as they unfold.
Proactive organizations are opportunity-driven, identifying and capitalizing on emerging trends before competitors.

Take, for example, Tesla's early investment in electric vehicles. Long before the market for EVs was fully established, Tesla antici-
pated a shift toward sustainable transportation and positioned itself as a leader in the industry.

Similarly, Shopify, recognizing the growing trend of e-commerce, rapidly adapted to the needs of small businesses by offering easy-
to-use, scalable solutions before many other platforms could catch up. These companies embody proactiveness by actively seeking
232 | 9. FORMULATE INNOVATION STRATEGY

out opportunities in changing technological, environmental, and market conditions, allowing them to stay ahead of the curve and
build strong competitive advantages.

Risk-Taking

Risk-taking involves pursuing bold actions rather than opting for conservative or cautious strategies.

A strong example of this can be seen in Netflix's decision to
transition from DVD rentals to streaming services, a move that
required significant investment and foresight at a time when
streaming technology was still in its infancy. This bold shift not
only redefined how people consume media but also estab-
lished Netflix as a global entertainment powerhouse, none of
which would be possible if Netflix had not taken the risk of
changing its entire business model.

While entrepreneurs and companies are often portrayed as
habitual risk-takers, research shows that many do not perceive
their actions as inherently risky. Instead, they employ careful
planning and forecasting to mitigate uncertainty.

                                                                                   Figure 9.2: Netflix
For instance, when Tesla decided to build its Gigafactory, the
company faced massive financial and logistical challenges.
However, detailed planning and strategic partnerships helped reduce the uncertainty, enabling Tesla to scale up production and
dominate the electric vehicle market. Yet, as with any venture, uncertainty can never be entirely eliminated.

When BP decided to expand its oil exploration operations in the Gulf of Mexico, the company exemplified risk-taking by investing
heavily in a venture fraught with political, environmental, and technical challenges. Despite the potential for high returns from
gaining access to vast oil reserves, the move exposed BP to unpredictable risks, which ultimately materialized during the Deepwater
Horizon disaster, which caused the largest marine oil spill in history. This incident highlighted the inherent dangers of risk-taking,
as the pursuit of strategic opportunities can lead to substantial gains but also significant losses.

These examples show that, while risk-taking is essential for growth, successful entrepreneurs and firms should balance bold action
with strategic foresight to increase the likelihood of long-term success.

Intrapreneurship

Entrepreneurship is often synonymous with trailblazers who build empires from scratch--figures like Whitney Wolfe Herd, who
revolutionized online dating with Bumble, or Melanie Perkins, who simplified graphic design with Canva. But the spirit of entrepre-
neurship is not confined to startups or garage-born businesses. In fact, some of the most impactful innovations come from individ-
uals working within large organizations who challenge the status quo, pushing for the development of groundbreaking products
or services. These employees may not be founders, but they act with the same determination and creativity to bring their ideas to
fruition, often reshaping the company's future in the process.

This form of entrepreneurship within an organization is known as intrapreneurship. Unlike traditional entrepreneurship, intrapre-
neurs innovate from within, navigating the complexities of large organizational structures to drive change.

For instance, 3M's famous invention of Post-it notes didn't come from external R&D but from an
employee experimenting with new uses for a weak adhesive. Similarly, Netflix's shift from DVD
rentals to streaming content came from internal visionaries who saw the potential long before
streaming was a mainstream concept.

Companies that foster intrapreneurship often gain a competitive advantage by leveraging their exist-  Figure 9.4: Google Maps
ing resources, capabilities, and core competencies to develop new products and services without
needing to acquire or merge with external firms. Rather than solely seeking growth through acquisi-
tions, firms like Apple and Google have created cultures that encourage employees to think and act
entrepreneurially, resulting in innovations like the iPhone and Google Maps, both developed inter-
nally.

Moreover, thinking entrepreneurially isn't just beneficial for organizations; it's a powerful tool for personal career growth. Employ-
ees who adopt an entrepreneurial mindset often excel in navigating corporate landscapes, identifying opportunities others over-
look, and positioning themselves as valuable innovators within their firms. Those who think outside the box and take initiative
often find that they can climb the corporate ladder faster, all while making meaningful contributions to the company's success.

Intrapreneurs, much like their entrepreneurial counterparts, blend creativity with strategic risk-taking, showing that entrepreneur-
ship isn't confined to new ventures but is also thriving within the walls of some of the world's largest corporations.

EO Applied to Individuals

Entrepreneurial orientation applies not only to organizations but also to individuals. Traits such as risk-taking, innovation, and com-
petitiveness, key characteristics of entrepreneurial companies, are equally important for individuals. Those who embrace creativ-
ity, are comfortable with uncertainty, and thrive in competitive environments tend to score higher in EO, which often translates to
greater success when starting a business. While EO is frequently associated with high-tech startups, it is equally valuable for more
traditional ventures like lawn care services or hair salons. For anyone interested, online tools are available to assess EO and better
understand entrepreneurial potential.

Building an Entrepreneurial Orientation

Executives can take deliberate steps to cultivate stronger entrepreneurial orientation across their organizations, just as individuals
can develop more entrepreneurial mindsets in their own roles. For executives, it's critical to align organizational systems and poli-
cies with the key dimensions of EO. For example, compensation structures should be designed to encourage entrepreneurial behav-
ior. Are employees rewarded for taking calculated risks, even if those risks don't always pay off ? Or does the system discourage
risk-taking by penalizing failures? Corporate debt levels also play a role in shaping EO, as high levels of debt might stifle innovation
234 | 9. FORMULATE INNOVATION STRATEGY
by making the organization more risk averse. Thoughtfully structured debt, however, can provide the financial flexibility needed to
support innovation and risk-taking.
Executives can assess their organizations' EOs by examining various performance measures that reflect key dimensions of entrepre-
neurial behavior. For example, to gauge autonomy, they might track employee satisfaction and turnover rates, as organizations that
encourage autonomy often see higher satisfaction and lower turnover. Innovativeness can be evaluated by measuring the number
of new products or services introduced as well as the patents secured in a given year, offering tangible evidence of how effectively
the company promotes creativity and experimentation.
For individuals, developing a stronger entrepreneurial orientation requires reflecting on personal attitudes and behaviors. Are you
taking proactive steps rather than reacting to competitors? Are you offering fresh ideas for products or processes that could drive
value for the company?
An individual employee can play a key role in enhancing EO by consistently thinking ahead, proposing new ideas, and making deci-
sions that align with the company's strategic goals. By doing so, they not only support the organization's entrepreneurial culture but
also position themselves as valuable contributors to its growth and success.

     Key Takeaways

     Entrepreneurial orientation, an essential part of innovation, is characterized by three core traits: innovativeness, proactiveness, and risk-
     taking. Innovativeness refers to the drive to embrace creativity and experimentation. Proactiveness refers to the ability to anticipate and
     act on future needs rather than merely responding to events as they unfold. Risk-taking involves pursuing bold actions rather than opt-

     neurial orientation applies not only to organizations but also to individuals. Executives can take deliberate steps to cultivate a stronger
     entrepreneurial orientation across their organizations, just as individuals can develop more entrepreneurial mindsets in their own roles.
     Innovation is essential for firms to maintain a competitive edge. Companies that continuously innovate are better positioned to capture
     new markets, improve products, and outpace competitors, while firms that remain stagnant risk losing customers and market share. A
     strong EO helps firms continuously seek out new opportunities and innovate, which is crucial for staying competitive in dynamic mar-
     kets.

9.4 Why Innovate?

Innovation is a critical strategy for maintaining a competitive edge in rapidly evolving industries. Companies that become compla-
cent risk losing market share to more agile competitors who are constantly pushing boundaries. An innovation-driven approach,
paired with a strong entrepreneurial orientation, helps companies keep customers engaged and returning for the latest products
or services.

Consider the tech industry, where companies like Apple and Samsung consistently release new versions of their smartphones with
enhanced features like more powerful processors, better camera quality, or advanced software capabilities. This approach drives
consumer demand, encouraging people to upgrade regularly to the latest model. In a similar fashion, streaming platforms like Net-
flix continuously innovate by adding interactive content and personalized recommendations, keeping users engaged and attract-
ing new subscribers.

The automotive industry also relies heavily on innovation to stay
relevant. Each year, manufacturers introduce updated models with
improved designs, advanced safety features, and cutting-edge tech-
nology like electric powertrains or autonomous driving capabilities.
Tesla, for example, has revolutionized the car market with its elec-
tric vehicles and over-the-air software updates, making continuous
innovation a cornerstone of its success.

Even in fields like pharmaceuticals, innovation is essential. Compa-  Figure 9.5: Tesla
nies invest heavily in research to develop new treatments for
chronic diseases, such as cancer or Alzheimer's, ensuring they
remain at the forefront of life-saving medical advancements. With-
out continuous innovation, companies risk falling behind and los-
ing their competitive positions, regardless of the industry.
236 | 9. FORMULATE INNOVATION STRATEGY

Innovation is often the backbone of strategy for new startups across various industries, particularly in tech and consumer services.
For instance, companies in renewable energy or electric mobility may develop groundbreaking battery technologies or new charg-
ing infrastructures that solve consumer needs and disrupt existing markets. These innovations are the engines that propel compa-
nies forward, allowing them to carve out new spaces in competitive markets.

While innovation is critical, it doesn't negate the need for a clear business-level strategy, whether that takes the form of focused cost
leadership, broad cost leadership, focused differentiation, broad differentiation, best cost, or blue ocean. A firm must still define its
competitive approach to ensure the success of its innovative offerings. There is a success-critical role for innovation in all business-
level strategy.

Startups introducing unique, high-demand products or services often employ a differentiation strategy, setting premium prices due
to limited competition. For instance, Tender Food, founded in 2020, specializes in plant-based meat alternatives that closely mimic
the taste and texture of traditional meats. By utilizing innovative fiber-spinning technology, Tender Food creates a unique and
healthier plant-based meat, such as beef short ribs and chicken breasts, appealing to consumers seeking sustainable and health-
conscious options. This distinct technology allows Tender Food to position itself as a leader in the plant-based food industry, justi-
fying premium pricing for its products.

The famous saying "He who hesitates is lost," credited to the eighteenth-century writer Joseph Addison, holds significant truth
in today's fast-moving business landscape. Executives often face overwhelming choices, but hesitation can be costly, especially in
environments where rapid decision-making is crucial. Many industries now operate in conditions of hyper-competition, where the
speed of competitive moves and countermoves makes it difficult to sustain a lasting competitive advantage. Under these circum-
stances, it is better to make a timely, reasonable decision than to wait for the perfect one, which might never materialize.

In addition, the value of continuous learning emphasizes the
importance of a "take action" mindset. Business success often
depends not on executing flawless moves but on learning from
a series of strategic decisions and adjusting along the way.
Sometimes decisive action can yield advantages, even when
the decisions are made with incomplete information. Startups Figure 9.6: Zoom
like Zoom capitalized on this during the pandemic by quickly
scaling their services, seizing the opportunity before competitors had fully adapted to the surge in demand. These companies
exemplify how timely decisions, combined with innovation, can lead to significant market gains in fast-paced industries.

     Key Takeaways

     Innovation is a critical strategy for maintaining a competitive edge in rapidly evolving industries. Companies that become complacent
     risk losing market share to more agile competitors who are constantly pushing boundaries. An innovation-driven approach, paired with
     a strong entrepreneurial orientation, helps companies keep customers engaged and returning for the latest products or services. Many
     industries now operate in conditions of hyper-competition, where the speed of competitive moves makes it difficult to sustain a lasting
     advantage. Under these circumstances, it is better to make a timely, reasonable decision than to wait for the perfect one, which might
     never materialize. The value of continuous learning emphasizes the importance of a "take action" mindset.

9.5 First Movers and Fast Followers

In the competitive landscape, companies must decide how best to approach new market opportunities. Two common strategies
are being a first mover or a fast follower. A first mover is a company that enters a new market or launches a new product before
any competitors, aiming to establish an early advantage. A fast follower is a firm that enters the market immediately after the first
mover.

First movers are the pioneers who introduce new products or services to the market, aiming to capture customer attention and
establish strong market position before competitors emerge. This approach requires significant investment and a willingness to
face uncertainty, as these firms must educate the market as to what they are offering and navigate uncharted territory. In contrast,
fast followers enter the market after the first movers have paved the way, learning from their experiences and improving upon the
original offering. Each strategy comes with its own set of advantages and challenges, and the choice between them depends on a
firm's resources, capabilities, core competencies, and risk tolerance.

The concept of first-mover advantage draws parallels from military strategy, where the objective is to strike first and gain a dom-
inant position before competitors can respond. In business, this means entering a new market or launching a new product before
others, capturing customer attention and shaping market expectations. However, the decision to be a first mover also carries risks,
as early entrants must face skepticism or challenges that later entrants can avoid.

The well-known saying "the early bird gets the worm" suggests
that acting early can offer distinct advantages. In business, being
the first mover into a market can help a company gain a competi-
tive edge that may be difficult for later entrants to overcome.
First-mover advantage occurs when a firm's initial move allows it
to dominate the market by establishing strong brand recognition,
customer loyalty, or technological leadership.

For example, Apple's early introduction of the user-friendly per-    Figure 9.7: KFC
sonal computer in the 1980s built a reputation for creativity and
innovation that continues to this day. Kentucky Fried Chicken
(KFC) was the first Western fast-food chain to enter China, build-
ing strong relationships with local officials, which allowed it to
become the top fast-food chain in that market. Genentech, a
biotechnology company focused on using DNA to produce medi-
cine, played a pioneering role in biotechnology, which helped it
238 | 9. FORMULATE INNOVATION STRATEGY

overcome traditional barriers to entry in the pharmaceutical industry and become highly profitable. In each of these cases, being
the first mover gave these firms a distinct advantage that contributed to their long-term success.

Being a first mover is inherently risky, and companies cannot be certain consumers will embrace their offerings. Being first to the
market can still yield valuable organizational learning and competitive insights, even if the product itself fails. For instance, Apple's
Newton, an early attempt to enter the personal digital assistant market, ultimately failed financially, as did Google's initial foray
into digital glasses. However, Apple and other first movers gained crucial knowledge about market demands, technological hurdles,
and consumer behavior, which they could leverage in future innovations. Apple, for example, applied insights from the Newton to
later products, eventually leading to the groundbreaking success of the iPhone and iPad. By learning from earlier missteps, first
movers can refine their approaches, potentially leading to new and successful entries as first movers in other markets. Meanwhile,
later entrants benefit from observing both the failures and successes of first movers, enabling them to refine or replicate these inno-
vations more affordably. For example, companies like Sony and Samsung quickly followed Apple's AirPods with their own wireless
earbuds, building on Apple's initial market insights and successes to create competing products.

First movers must also commit sufficient resources to following through on their initial advantage. For example, RCA and Westing-
house were early leaders in LCD display technology, but they failed to invest in the development and commercialization of their
innovations. Today, they are not significant players in the flat-screen market, which supplies displays for everything from laptops to
medical devices. Instead, companies such as Samsung, LG Display, and BOE Technology have emerged as top leaders in LCD display
technology, dominating the market with their advanced research, production capabilities, and global distribution networks.

Research offers mixed conclusions about the benefits of being a first mover. Some studies suggest that a first mover typically enjoys
an advantage for about a decade, while others argue that the advantages are minimal or short-lived. The key for executives is to
assess whether a first move will create a sustainable competitive advantage. First moves that leverage strategic resources, such as
patented technologies, are harder for competitors to replicate and thus are more likely to succeed. For example, Pfizer's patent on
Viagra gave it a monopoly in the erectile dysfunction market for five years, and even after rivals entered the market, Viagra remains
a significant revenue generator for the company, earning about $1.9 billion annually.

Conversely, first movers that do not rely on strategic resources are more easily imitated. E-Trade Group's introduction of the portable
mortgage, which allowed customers to transfer a mortgage when buying a new home, lacked protection from imitation by larger
banks. As a result, even if the idea had gained traction, it could have easily been replicated, limiting E-Trade's ability to profit from
being the first mover.

Key Takeaways

A first mover is a company that enters a new market or launches a new product before any competitors, aiming to establish an early
advantage. A fast follower is a firm that enters the market immediately after the first mover. There are benefits and risks to both
approaches. The decision to be a first mover should be carefully evaluated based on whether the move offers the potential for a lasting
competitive advantage. Without the right resources and strategic planning, first-mover status may offer only a temporary edge.

Being the first to enter a market can offer significant benefits, such as brand dominance and customer loyalty. However, it also comes
with risks, including the costs of educating the market and the uncertainty of whether the product will be widely accepted. Later entrants
can learn from a first mover's mistakes and refine their own offerings.

9.6 Innovation Framework: Four Types of Innovation

In this section, you learn an innovation framework that considers four types of innovation that firms can leverage to drive growth
and competitive advantage: incremental, disruptive, architectural, and radical innovation. Each type varies based on two key fac-
tors: whether it addresses an existing market or creates a new one and whether it utilizes existing technology or introduces new
technology. Understanding these distinctions helps companies strategize how to innovate effectively, depending on their goals and
market conditions.

Incremental Innovation

Incremental innovation involves enhancing an existing prod-
uct or service by making improvements based on current tech-
nology and targeting the existing market. In the automotive
industry, for example, incremental innovations take the form
of yearly updates to car models, such as improved fuel effi-
ciency, updated safety features, or minor design tweaks. These
changes don't create new markets but instead refine the prod-
uct using established technologies to offer a better version to
existing customers.

                                              Figure 9.9: Types of innovation

Company Example

Toyota  Toyota continuously updates its vehicles, such as by adding advanced driver-assistance systems or improving hybrid engine
        performance.

Samsung Samsung's Galaxy smartphones are incrementally improved with better screen technology, faster processors, and enhanced camera capabilities.

Coca-Cola Coca-Cola introduces new variations of its drinks, such as Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and smaller, more convenient packaging sizes.

Figure 9.10: Incremental innovation examples

Disruptive Innovation

According to a 2015 article by Christensen, Raynor, and McDonald, disruptive innovation occurs when a product or service initially
enters a market by catering to an often underserved segment, often offering a simpler, more affordable solution than existing
options. Over time, this innovation improves, eventually displacing established competitors. The key aspect of Christensen's defini-
tion is that disruptive innovations begin by targeting overlooked or low-end consumers before challenging mainstream markets.
                                                                                                                 9. FORMULATE INNOVATION STRATEGY | 241

However, the term disruptive innovation has often been misunderstood or misapplied. Many products labeled as disruptive are not.
According to Christensen, true disruptive innovations initially underperform in comparison to established products but appeal to
customers who value new dimensions, such as simplicity or lower cost.

A classic example is Netflix. When it first launched, Netflix's
mail-order DVD rental service catered to a niche of customers
who valued convenience over visiting brick-and-mortar video
rental stores like Blockbuster. Over time, as internet speeds
improved and streaming technology developed, Netflix moved
upmarket, disrupting the entire entertainment industry and
leading to the downfall of video rental stores.

In contrast, products like Apple's iPad, often cited as disruptive,
don't fully align with Christensen's definition. The iPad was a
high-end, well-performing product at launch. While it Figure 9.11: Blockbuster
impacted the laptop market, it didn't follow the typical path of
targeting low-end or overlooked consumers before dominating the mainstream.

Christensen's perspective emphasizes that disruptive innovations don't succeed by merely being better than existing products; they
succeed by reshaping the competitive landscape, starting in less-demanding markets and moving upward. For example, digital
cameras began with lower-quality images and slower performance compared to traditional film, appealing mainly to niche market
segments. As the technology advanced, they improved in quality and convenience, ultimately surpassing film cameras and trans-
forming the photography industry. This shift led to the decline of film giants like Kodak, who struggled to adapt. True disruptive
innovations can challenge and replace incumbents by fundamentally altering how businesses and customers operate within the
industry.

Below are several examples of disruptive innovation.

  · The rise of tablet computers has affected laptop sales due to their greater portability and multifunctionality. While reading
      books on traditional computers can be uncomfortable, devices like the iPad, Nook, and Kindle offer a more convenient experi-
      ence and have become favored by textbook publishers.

  · Numerous stores that depended on compact disc (CD) sales closed when downloadable digital media revolutionized the
      music industry. Prior to this, CDs had replaced vinyl records and cassette tapes because of their better durability and sound
      quality. Now, music subscription services like Spotify and Apple Music are taking the place of digital downloads. What emerg-
      ing technology might eventually replace these subscription models?

  · Digital cameras transformed the photography industry by providing immediate results and removing the need for film devel-
      opment. More recently, high-quality cameras on smartphones have disrupted the digital camera market.

  · The rise of personal computers challenged the supremacy of mainframes, allowing individuals to own computers in their
      homes.

  · LED lights, a more recent technology, are gradually replacing incandescent bulbs by capturing the existing market.

Typically, disruptive innovations start with a small, niche audience of early adopters and gradually gain traction as the product
improves. For example, digital cameras were initially slow and produced lower-quality images compared to traditional film, lim-
iting their appeal. However, as the technology advanced, digital cameras gradually won over even the most loyal film users. The
iPad serves as another example, but with a different trajectory. Unlike most disruptive innovations, the iPad was an immediate suc-
cess, quickly gaining widespread popularity across various demographics. Its intuitive design, portability, and versatile functional-
ity allowed it to create a new category of devices (tablets), appealing to consumers, professionals, and educational institutions from
the outset.
242 | 9. FORMULATE INNOVATION STRATEGY

For companies considering disruptive innovation, patience and resilience are key. Growth may be slow at first, but the ability to nav-
igate the initial period of low adoption is crucial to long-term success. Firms need to ensure they have the resources, capabilities,
and core competencies to weather this slow build while improvements are made and a broader customer base develops.

Architectural Innovation

Architectural innovation is about transforming familiar technologies into new formats, often unlocking markets that didn't pre-
viously exist. By reimagining the structure or configuration of a product or service, companies can create offerings that appeal to
entirely new audiences. A notable example is the smartwatch, which repurposed existing smartphone technology into a wearable
device, creating a new consumer category. By integrating product capabilities like fitness tracking, notifications, and health moni-
toring into a compact, wrist-worn format, companies like Apple and Samsung redefined the potential of wearable tech and broad-
ened the appeal of digital connectivity.

This form of innovation thrives on reshaping existing technologies in creative ways. Companies don't need to invent something
entirely new; they just need to rethink how their current technologies can be used in different contexts. By doing so, firms can tap
into new markets and meet the needs of consumers who may have been uninterested in the original product. Architectural innova-
tion allows businesses to expand without reinventing the wheel--simply by giving old technologies a fresh, compelling new form.

Below are examples of effective architectural innovation.

  · Peloton combines existing technologies such as bicycles, the internet, and communication tools to attract new customers who
      might not have purchased an exercise bike otherwise.

  · Some companies have utilized solar cell technology to create small sources of rechargeable outdoor lighting, attracting a new
      group of consumers who use these eco-friendly lights to decorate their yards.

  · Copiers were once large, costly machines designed for use in large offices. Canon and other companies redesigned these
      machines to be compact and desktop-friendly, opening up a new market for personal copier/printers.

Radical Innovation

Radical innovation occurs when entirely new technologies are used to create products or services that open up new markets. A
prime example is the invention of the airplane, which revolutionized transportation by making long-distance travel feasible in ways
that were previously unimaginable. Before air travel, a trip from New York to San Francisco could take weeks by car or train, but the
airplane dramatically shortened this time, transforming the way people and goods moved across the world.

Radical innovation isn't just about introducing something new; it's about reshaping the landscape of what's possible. By utilizing
groundbreaking technologies, companies can reach new consumers and create markets that didn't previously exist.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a defining innovation of the current business landscape. Companies that respond effectively to disrup-
tive, new, and emerging technologies, such as AI, are engaging in radical innovation. NVIDIA's CUDA platform opened up the par-
allel processing power of GPUs to general-purpose computing, enabling GPUs to complete complex AI and deep learning tasks. In
healthcare, AI models analyze data to identify early signs of diseases before symptoms appear. AI in finance is used in algorithmic
trading to analyze market data, predict market movements, and execute trades at optimal times.

Once a firm successfully launches a radically innovative product or service, they often shift to a strategy of incremental innovation,
making continuous improvements to enhance performance and attract even more customers. For example, after the initial devel-
opment of smartphones, which is an example of radical innovation, companies like Apple and Samsung used incremental innova-
tion to add features like better cameras and faster processors, keeping consumers engaged and boosting sales. Radical innovations
create the foundation, but it's the steady stream of enhancements that ensures long-term success.
                                                                   9. FORMULATE INNOVATION STRATEGY | 243

Below are examples of radical innovation in different industries.

· Pharmaceutical researchers frequently develop groundbreaking products through innovative combinations of chemicals
   designed to treat medical conditions, which in turn draw new customers. For example, Aricept, a medication co-marketed by
   Eisai and Pfizer for managing Alzheimer's symptoms, has expanded market opportunities.

· Apple's AirPods represent a radical innovation, as the company created a wireless earpiece capable of receiving Bluetooth sig-
   nals. Today, it's common to see people wearing AirPods, a shift from the past when wired earphones were more commonly
   used.

· The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine utilizes electromagnetic forces, rather than X-rays, to capture internal
   images of the body. This innovation created an entirely new market, with hospitals investing in these machines to expand their
   diagnostic abilities.

9.7 Footholds

Just as rock climbers rely on footholds for stability and progress when ascending steep cliffs, firms use footholds to secure positions
in markets where they are not yet established. In business, a foothold refers to a small but strategic entry point that a company
deliberately creates in an unfamiliar market. This initial presence allows the firm to gather market insights, test the waters, and pre-
pare for potential expansion. Footholds are factors in architectural and radical innovations, as they are the two types of innovation
that involve entering new markets.
For instance, a company may acquire small local firms or open a limited number of stores in a new region as a way of gaining a
foothold. This approach allows the company to understand local consumer behavior and competition without committing to large-
scale operations right away. Once a foothold is secure, the firm can build from this position, gradually scaling up its presence and
influence in the new market.
Below are examples that illustrate the use of footholds.

  · When IKEA enters a new country, like Japan, it typically opens only one store initially. This first location serves as a showcase to
      build the brand's presence, and additional stores are opened once the brand has gained recognition (Hambrick & Fredrickson,
      2005).

  · Pharmaceutical leader Merck gained a strong position by acquiring SmartCells Inc., a company working on a potential new
      treatment for diabetes.

  · The concept of a foothold is also relevant in warfare, where armies establish new positions in previously unoccupied territories.
      During World War II, the Allied Forces used Normandy, France, as a strategic base to launch their advance against German
      forces.
                                                                                                                 9. FORMULATE INNOVATION STRATEGY | 245
Many companies strategically use footholds to gain small but intentional presences in new markets before making larger commit-
ments. A foothold provides a low-risk way to explore market dynamics and refine offerings without fully diving in (Upson et al.,
2012).
Tech companies also use footholds to explore emerging markets. Microsoft often enters new industries by acquiring smaller star-
tups, as it did with its purchase of Mojang, the developer of the popular game Minecraft. This foothold allowed Microsoft to enter
the gaming space more robustly, later expanding its Xbox offerings and gaming services. Similarly, Amazon initially secured a
foothold in the grocery market by acquiring Whole Foods. This strategic entry allowed Amazon to explore the grocery industry with
an established brand while integrating its own e-commerce and logistics expertise. By using these smaller, calculated steps, com-
panies like Microsoft and Amazon can test the waters in new markets before fully scaling their operations.

       Application
            · Think about your own personal experience in school. When have you made a small but strategic entry point in an unfamiliar
                area?
            · Describe a time when you have gained a foothold. Perhaps it was with a new social group of friends. Maybe you made it hap-
                pen by playing club sports. Have you gotten a foothold in a new subject, such as strategic management?
                     Discuss the advantages the foothold gave you.

     Key Takeaways

     A foothold refers to a small but strategic entry point that a company deliberately creates in an unfamiliar market. This initial presence
     allows the firm to gather market insights, test the waters, and prepare for potential expansion. This applies to architectural and radical
     innovations, as they are the two types of innovation that involve entering new markets. Radical and disruptive innovations have the
     potential to completely change industries by introducing new technologies that redefine markets. However, these innovations are typi-
     cally followed by incremental improvements, which help sustain the product's market relevance and profitability over time. Establishing
     footholds allows companies to gain small but strategic presences in new markets, minimizing risk while gathering insights before com-
     mitting to full-scale operations. This approach helps firms test their products or services and adapt before expanding.

9.8 Innovation and Business-Level Strategy

We often think of innovation as applying to the products that high-tech companies produce, with innovation being a central focus
for these companies. High tech companies typically follow a differentiation strategic market position and either a focused or broad
strategic market size, choosing a broad differentiation business-level strategy or a focused differentiation strategy. However, those
firms are not the only firms that focus on innovation. In fact, all companies need an innovation strategy. Innovation strategy is cen-
tral to organizations that follow any type of business-level strategy.

Differentiation

For firms that follow a broad or focused differentiation strategy, innovation is typically more focused on product and service inno-
vations. Innovation drives differentiation more externally through customers.

A part of the innovation strategy for firms that follow these strategies is high investments in R&D to fuel continuous product
and service innovation. This is a clear choice, as they are operating in a business environment where customers want continuous
upgrades to their products and services.

In high-tech industries, customers want new features and new product innovations. In the high-end fashion market segment for
example, consumers want the latest fashion innovations. They also expect exceptional service and individualized attention.

Companies following focused or broad differentiation business-level strategies are able to demand higher prices for the latest prod-
ucts and services. They use the higher profit margins on their products and services to ensure a return on their R&D investments.
Because of this, they can create new products and continuously introduce new or improved services to sustain their competitive
advantage.

These firms focus on being the first to market with a new product or service. Firms that follow a differentiation strategy often aim
to be first movers.

While all firms may use different types of innovation at different times, companies that approach strategic market position by tar-
geting differentiation and cost leadership use the four types of innovation differently. Companies following a focused or broad dif-
ferentiation business-level strategy use each type of innovation--incremental, disruptive, architectural, and radical--to innovate
in customer-facing product and service innovation.

Cost Leadership

For firms that follow a cost leadership business-level strategy, either broad or focused, innovation is typically more internally
focused on process optimization in support of lean operations that reduce costs.

Firms that follow a broad or focused cost leadership strategy focus on reducing costs in their firm value chains. To optimize oper-
ational efficiency and reduce costs, they focus on process innovation in their primary activities, such as in their inbound and
outbound logistics and standardizing operations. They may also focus on doing the same in manufacturing, warehousing, and dis-
tribution. Because they have smaller profit margins, these companies must focus on enhancing operational excellence.

Firms that follow broad or focused cost leadership business-level strategies often aim to be fast followers. Their low investments in
R&D do not generally support a first-mover approach. Industry leading cost leadership companies capitalize on innovations that
other first movers have made by being fast followers.

All firms may use different types of innovation at different times. Companies that follow broad or focused cost leadership strategy
use incremental, disruptive, architectural, and radical innovation to innovate internally, focusing on process innovation, operational
efficiency, and cost reduction.

Application

        most potential for process optimization in support of lean operations that reduce costs. Illustrate your answer with an exam-

     Key Takeaways

     For firms that follow either a focused or broad differentiation strategy, innovation is typically more focused on product and service
     innovations. Innovation drives differentiation more externally through customers. These firms focus on being the first to market with
     a new product or service. Firms that follow a differentiation strategy often aim to be first movers. For firms that follow cost leadership
     approaches, either broad or focused, innovation is typically more internally focused on process optimization in support of lean opera-
     tions that reduce costs. Industry-leading cost leadership companies capitalize on innovations that other first movers have made by being
     fast followers.

9.9 Product Life Cycle

When a new product is introduced to the market, it typically follows a progression through four distinct stages that represent the
product life cycle. These stages are the same for all types of products, from high-tech gadgets like virtual reality headsets to every-
248 | 9. FORMULATE INNOVATION STRATEGY

day items like cleaning solutions. Product life cycle stages apply primarily to architectural innovation (a product in a new market
that uses an existing technology), radical innovation (a product in a new market that introduces new technology), and disruptive
innovation (a product introduced in a new market that uses new technology). The four product life cycle stages are introduction,
growth, maturity, and decline.

Introduction

In stage one, the product is launched with hopes of gaining traction in the market. Sales are usually slow at this stage as customer
awareness for the product builds.

When the product is new to consumers, companies follow a first mover's approach, observing the first to introduce a product. Stage
one of the product life cycle applies primarily to those types of innovation that introduce a product into a new market and/or uses
new technology. This includes three types of innovation: architectural innovation, disruptive innovation, and radical innovation.

For example, the sustainable brand Patagonia, known for its eco-friendly outdoor clothing, introduced a line of clothing made from
recycled materials, representing architectural innovation. The company entered a market of environmentally-conscious consumers
by using existing materials but offering an innovative product that focused on sustainability. This approach helped Patagonia stand
out as a leader in the sustainable fashion industry.

Growth

Then in stage two, as the product begins to gain popularity, sales begin to steadily increase. Competitors, including many fast
followers, enter the market, though competition remains manageable, allowing room for growth. For both the original product
designer and imitators, conducting a Porter's Five Forces analysis at this stage is valuable to assess the threat of new entrants. This
analysis helps the original designer understand how to maintain their competitive edge, while imitators can identify opportunities
to differentiate or compete on cost. By understanding the dynamics of competition, barriers to entry, and the potential power of
suppliers and buyers, both groups can strategically position themselves for sustained success in the growing market.

Maturity

Once a product market has grown rapidly and sales have increased in the growth stage, the product reaches maturity in the market.
The early maturity stage is characterized by continued growth and sales. Then market saturation is reached, and sales reach their
peak in the later phase of the maturity stage. By the end of the maturity stage, market growth slows as the market becomes sat-
urated. Competition intensifies, and a shakeout occurs, where some competitors exit or merge with others. Conducting a Porter's
Five Forces analysis to analyze the threat of substitute products is also valuable at this stage.

Decline

Finally, the product life cycle ends in a stage of decline. Sales start to drop as the product loses relevance or market demand
decreases. Fewer competitors remain, and firms begin looking for exit strategies or ways to consolidate. During the decline stage,
the product's placement on the Boston Consulting Group matrix can give executives initial information about whether to divest the
product line from their portfolio.
                                                                                          9. FORMULATE INNOVATION STRATEGY | 249

Figure 9.12: Product life cycle

This life cycle can be visualized as a bell curve, with sales starting low during the introduction stage, rising during the growth stage,
peaking during the maturity stage, and eventually falling during the decline stage. Notice the bell curve is not symmetrical, as the
product life cycle curve for stage one, product introduction, rises much more slowly than stage two, the growth stage. First movers
who introduce a new product must be prepared to weather stage one and continue to invest in the product and its production as
well as marketing so that they reach stage two, growth, when the life cycle curve is much steeper. During stage one, companies must
create capacity in all areas of both the firm and industry value chains to be ready to adequately deal with the growth stage of the
product.

Product Life Cycle Extension

To avoid or delay the decline stage of a       Figure 9.13: Product life cycle extension
product's life cycle, companies often
relaunch their products by introducing
updated or improved versions. This is an
example of incremental innovation (intro-
ducing products in existing markets using
existing technology), and it helps revitalize
interest and effectively restarts the product
life cycle. For example, Apple frequently
updates its iPhone with new features to
maintain consumer demand, and car man-
ufacturers like Ford and Toyota regularly
release improved models to keep their
products competitive. This cycle of innova-
tion helps extend the product's lifespan in
the market.

Profits During the Product Life Cycle

                  Figure 9.14: Profits during the product life cycle
Profits throughout a product's life cycle typically follow a predictable trajectory. In the early research and development (R&D)
phase, a company invests heavily in developing the product, resulting in negative profits as costs outweigh revenue. This trend con-
tinues into the introduction stage, where sales are still low and significant marketing expenses are required to build awareness, fur-
ther delaying profitability.
The turning point occurs in the growth stage, where increasing sales allow the firm to start recouping its initial investment in R&D
and marketing. Profits usually peak at the beginning of the maturity stage as sales reach their highest levels. However, as compe-
tition intensifies during this stage, companies are often forced to lower prices, which erodes profit margins. By the time the prod-
uct enters the decline stage, profits shrink significantly, and firms may begin looking for ways to exit or consolidate. This pattern
highlights the importance of planning throughout the product life cycle to maximize profitability, especially during the growth and
early maturity phases when the potential for returns is highest.

       Application
            · Think about a product you like and use frequently.
                     Describe the product's life cycle.

                     At what stage did you purchase the product?
                                                                                                               9. FORMULATE INNOVATION STRATEGY | 251

Key Takeaways

When a new product is introduced to the market, it typically follows a progression through four distinct stages that represent the product
life cycle. These stages are the same for all types of products, from high-tech gadgets like virtual reality headsets to everyday items like
cleaning solutions. Product life cycle stages apply primarily to architectural innovation, radical innovation, and disruptive innovation.
The four product life cycle stages are introduction, growth, maturity, and decline. To avoid or delay the decline stage of a product's life

tion, and it helps revitalize interest and effectively restarts the product life cycle. Profits throughout a product's life cycle typically follow
a predictable trajectory.

9.10 Crossing the Chasm

Now that you have learned about the four stages of a product's life cycle, how that life cycle can be extended, and profits during
a product's life cycle, you can now learn a closely related idea--crossing the chasm. Crossing the chasm is a concept related to the
stages of consumer adoption of a company's new product or service. It can also apply to industrywide innovations, which are usually
technology advancements, such as AI and media streaming services.

The point when a firm's new product or an industry's technological advancement crosses the chasm is the point when the success of
a new product is more certain. To illustrate this, we review the five stages of a product's or technology's adoption life cycle and the
related concept of crossing the chasm.

The five stages of a product's, service's, or technology's adoption life cycle include innovators, early adopters, early majority, late
majority, and laggards. As you can see, the stages of the adoption life cycle correspond to consumer characteristics. These consumer
characteristics influence many business aspects of the new product or technology, such as the firm's marketing approach. Crossing
the chasm happens between the early adopters and early majority stages.

Figure 9.15: The adoption cycle of a company's product or service, or an industry's technological advancement
252 | 9. FORMULATE INNOVATION STRATEGY

Innovators

When a new product, service, or technology is introduced, it is typically adopted first by innovators--people eager to experiment
with cutting-edge advancements. These are consumers enthusiastic about the new product, service, or technology. They are typi-
cally tuned into the product's market and may even be eagerly awaiting the next advancement. They may be motivated by the need
or want for the new product addresses by the desire to be one of the first to use the new product, or both. Innovators make up about
2.5 percent of the market potential of a product.

Early Adopters

Early adopters are a slightly larger group and follow closely behind innovators. Early adopters show early interest in trying out the
product, service, or technology. Early adopters share some characteristics with innovators. These are consumers that are also enthu-
siastic about the new product or service. Early adopters make up about 13.5 percent of the market potential of a new technology.

Once innovators and early adopters are onboard with a new product or service, about 16 percent of the product's potential market
share is using the new product. This is still a small percentage of the potential for the new product.

Crossing the Chasm

The real challenge for many companies and industries lies in moving beyond these innovators and early adopters and gaining trac-
tion with the broader, more mainstream consumer group. This leap to the mainstream is what's referred to as crossing the chasm,
and it often requires a different business and marketing approach to succeed. Innovators and early adopters represent about 16 per-
cent of the overall market.

Early Majority

For the product, service, or technology to become a success, companies must strategize on how to reach the early majority, those
customers who represent a larger majority of the market potential for the product. These customers are both enthusiastic about the
new product and cautious enough to wait to be sure it is likely to catch on before buying it. They may respond to assurances the new
technology is here to stay and is worth their investment. The early majority comprises about 34 percent of the potential market.

Failure to convince the early majority to adopt the product typically leads to the product's demise. An example of a product that
failed to cross the chasm is Google Glass. While it was highly innovative, offering internet-connected eyeglasses that could display
information and take photos, its practical value was unclear. Despite generating interest among early adopters, the product did not
resonate with the broader market, leading to its failure.

Electric vehicles represent a current example of an industry wide technology in the process of crossing the chasm to mainstream
adoption. In recent years, EV adoption has accelerated significantly, with global EV sales accounting for 14 percent of all new car
sales in 2023. However, despite this growth, there are still challenges preventing EVs from fully reaching the early majority. Key fac-
tors include concerns about charging infrastructure, range anxiety, and the higher upfront costs compared to traditional gas-pow-
ered cars. While automakers like Tesla, Ford, and Rivian have made significant strides in addressing these concerns by expanding
charging networks and improving battery efficiency, many consumers remain cautious. For EVs to fully cross the chasm into main-
stream adoption, these concerns must be further alleviated through more widespread infrastructure, lower costs, and greater edu-
cation on the long-term benefits of electric vehicles.
                                                                                                                 9. FORMULATE INNOVATION STRATEGY | 253
As you can see, once early adopters embrace a product, service, or technology, the adoption life cycle peaks at the top of the bell
curve. This now represents 50 percent of the potential market. Half the market remains to be attracted to a firm's product. This is
useful information for companies to plan for the next phase in the product life cycle, the late majority.

Late Majority

Consumers in the late majority stage of the adoption cycle of a product, service, or technology are more cautious than early majority
adopters. There are many reasons consumers wait to adopt a product, and it is important for a firm to understand their consumer
base so that they can tailor their marketing and other business approaches accordingly. The late majority represents 34 percent of
the potential market. Once the late majority has joined other consumers in owning the product, the product is used by 84 percent
of the potential market.

Laggards

Laggards represent the last group of consumers to come onboard with a new product, service, or technological advancement. Lag-
gards represent the remaining 16 percent of the potential market.
Consumers in all stages of the adoption cycle may belong to their respective groups for multiple reasons ranging from values to
affordability. Understanding the specific product adoption cycle of a firm's products or services or of an industry's technological
advancement is essential to developing approaches that resonate with each group and ensure full market saturation.

       Application
            · Think about a company with a line of products, such as Apple or Amazon.
                     Describe products that have crossed the chasm and ones that did not. Explain your rationale.

     Key Takeaways

     Crossing the chasm is a concept related to the stages of consumers' adoption of new products or services. It can also apply to industrywide
     innovations. The point when a new product crosses the chasm is the point when its success is more certain. The five stages of a product's
     adoption life cycle include innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards. The challenge for many companies and
     industries lies in moving beyond the innovators and early adopters and gaining traction with the broader, more mainstream consumer
     groups. This leap to the mainstream is what's referred to as crossing the chasm.

9.11 Cooperative Moves

Bill Gates once noted, "Our success has really been based on partnerships from the very beginning." In today's business environ-
ment, cooperation between firms is often just as critical as competition. While competition drives innovation and improvement,
collaboration allows companies to tackle larger challenges, access new markets, and leverage each other's strengths. Below, we
explore four common cooperative strategies that firms use to enhance their market positions and achieve shared success. Beyond
competing head-to-head, businesses can unlock significant advantages by working together.
In Chapter 7, we introduced a make-contract-create-acquire continuum to show the ways a firm can diversify. This same framework
can be used to cooperate with other firms.

Figure 9.16: Make-contract-create-acquire continuum

Internal Development

Internal development occurs when firms can choose to build new capabilities and core competencies in-house. This strategy is
more competitive than cooperative, as it relies on a firm's own resources, capabilities, core competencies, entrepreneurial orienta-
tion (EO), and innovative culture to drive growth. As previously noted, Apple is an excellent example of a company that relies heavily
on internal development.
Internal development taps into intrapreneurship, where employees within the organization use their entrepreneurial skills to cre-
ate new products or services. Although internal development can take longer and require significant investment, it allows a com-
pany to retain full control over its innovations and processes.

Strategic Alliances

Strategic alliances occur when firms partner through an agreement to work together on a specific goal while maintaining their
independence.
For example, Starbucks and Spotify formed a strategic alliance to blend coffee culture with music streaming. Through their part-
nership, Starbucks employees and customers gained access to exclusive playlists on Spotify, and Spotify gained increased visibility
through Starbucks' vast network of stores. Both companies maintained their separate operations, but their collaboration enhanced
customer experiences and created mutual benefits.
Another example is the partnership between Nike and Apple, which led to the development of the Nike+iPod activity tracker. This
strategic alliance blended Nike's athletic expertise with Apple's tech innovation, allowing users to track their workouts using iPods
integrated with Nike shoes. It was a win-win for both brands. Nike became more tech-forward, and Apple strengthened its presence
in the fitness world without the need for either company to merge or create a new business entity.
                                                                                                                 9. FORMULATE INNOVATION STRATEGY | 255

The pharmaceutical industry often relies on strategic alliances to drive innovation and growth. For example, Merck and PAREXEL
International Corporation formed a strategic alliance to collaborate on biotechnology, specifically focusing on developing biosimi-
lars--pharmaceutical drugs that have properties of other, pre-existing drugs. This alliance is crucial for Merck, as the global biosim-
ilars market is expected to experience substantial growth in the coming years (PRWeb, 2011). Through partnerships like this,
pharmaceutical companies can pool resources and expertise, accelerating advancements in medical technologies.

Joint Ventures

A joint venture is when two or more companies combine to create a separate, shared entity. Each partner has a stake in the new
venture, involved in everything from decision-making to profits, creating a collaborative relationship with joint responsibility.

Take the collaboration between Google and Fiat Chrysler as an example. The two companies formed a joint venture to develop self-
driving cars. Google brought its advanced technology in autonomous driving, while Fiat Chrysler contributed its expertise in vehicle
manufacturing. Together, they created a new frontier in the automotive industry that neither could have tackled alone as effec-
tively. By sharing their strengths, both companies could accelerate innovation in the race for autonomous vehicles.

In another scenario, Sony and Ericsson teamed up to form Sony Ericsson, a joint venture aimed at combining Sony's expertise in con-
sumer electronics with Ericsson's strong background in telecommunications. The goal was to create cutting-edge mobile phones,
which was a market both companies wanted to dominate. Although the joint venture eventually dissolved, during its time, it
allowed both companies to compete more effectively against major players in the mobile phone industry.

Collaboration through joint ventures or strategic alliances can open doors to opportunities that might be out of reach if a company
tried to go it alone. By pooling resources, knowledge, and expertise, firms can move more quickly and efficiently. However, coopera-
tion isn't without risks. Companies may face loss of control, potential leaks of confidential information, or even exploitation by their
partners (Ketchen et al., 2004).

In both joint ventures and strategic alliances, businesses find creative ways to collaborate, capitalizing on each other's strengths to
achieve more than they could on their own. However, these partnerships require trust, clear goals, and a careful balancing of inter-
ests to succeed.

Mergers and Acquisitions

Another common way companies collaborate for mutual benefit is through mergers and acquisitions (M&A). In a merger, two com-
panies of roughly equal size combine to form a new, stronger entity. A high-profile example is the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint,
which transformed the two smaller wireless providers into a more formidable competitor against industry giants like AT&T and
Verizon. Sometimes, the merged companies retain elements of both names, such as the case with Exxon and Mobil merging to form
ExxonMobil, while other times, a new name or one firm's name is used moving forward.

Acquisitions, on the other hand, usually involve a larger company purchasing a smaller one. For example, Google acquired FitBit.
Although the end result is similar to a merger, acquisitions often result in the larger firm absorbing the smaller one, though in some
cases the acquired firm maintains its separate identity. Mergers and acquisitions can combine complementary strengths, eliminate
competitors, and enhance market share.

However, M&A activities come with significant risks. According to a Harvard Business Review study, between 70 percent and 90 per-
cent of mergers and acquisitions fail (Lakelet Capital, 2019). This failure rate is often attributed to challenges like integrating dif-
ferent corporate cultures, underestimating the total costs of the deal, and technical or operational mismatches between the two
companies. In addition, acquisitions are sometimes driven by CEOs eager to boost short-term revenues without fully considering
the long-term implications, a situation referred to as an agency problem, which will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 10.

     Key Takeaways

     In today's business environment, cooperation between firms is often just as critical as competition. While competition drives innovation
     and improvement, collaboration allows companies to tackle larger challenges, access new markets, and leverage each other's strengths.
     Internal development occurs when firms can choose to build new capabilities and core competencies in-house. This strategy is more
     competitive than cooperative, as it relies on a firm's own resources, capabilities, core competencies, entrepreneurial orientation, and
     innovative culture to drive growth. Strategic alliances occur when firms partner through an agreement to work together on a specific
     goal while maintaining their independence. A joint venture is when two or more companies combine to create a separate, shared entity.
     Each partner has a stake in the new venture in all aspects from decision-making to profits, creating a collaborative relationship with joint
     responsibility. In a merger, two companies of roughly equal size combine to form a new, stronger entity. Acquisitions, on the other hand,
     usually involve a larger company purchasing a smaller one. While cooperation through alliances, joint ventures, and mergers can pro-
     vide firms with significant strategic advantages, they also come with risks such as loss of control, cultural clashes, and agency problems.
     Companies must carefully weigh these risks against potential benefits to succeed in today's competitive landscape. Cooperation between
     firms through internal development, strategic alliances, or joint ventures allows companies to pool resources and expertise to achieve
     common goals.
     Instead of acquiring external expertise, firms can develop new capabilities in-house. Internal development fosters innovation within the
     organization and encourages intrapreneurship, allowing the firm to retain control over new products and services while leveraging its
     entrepreneurial orientation.

9.12 Responding to Innovation in the Market

In fast-paced industries, executives often contend with constant competitive pressures, such as aggressive marketing, price cuts,
and attempts to poach key customers. Quick responses are vital, as delays can give competitors a significant edge. For example,
when Samsung launched its Galaxy Fold, Apple took time before introducing a competing foldable phone, allowing Samsung
to gain an early foothold in the foldable phone market. Conversely, when Apple introduced the Apple Watch, Samsung swiftly
responded with the Galaxy Watch, preventing Apple from monopolizing the emerging wearable tech space. As former General Elec-
tric CEO Jack Welch famously noted, success in competition relies less on perfect predictions and more on the ability to react swiftly
to evolving market conditions.

Multipoint Competition

When companies compete against the same rival across multiple markets and market segments, this is known as multipoint com­
petition (or multimarket competition), which makes decisions about responses more complex. Take the rivalry between cigarette
manufacturers R.J. Reynolds (RJR) and Philip Morris, which compete in both U.S. and international markets. When RJR lowered
prices in the U.S. to gain customers, Philip Morris responded by cutting prices in the U.S. and ramping up its presence in Eastern
Europe, forcing RJR to defend itself on two fronts.

In some cases, rivals recognize that aggressive moves could lead to costly retaliation, resulting in mutual forbearance. For example,
Southwest Airlines and United Airlines once found themselves poised to compete more aggressively, but when Southwest's CEO
publicly threatened retaliation, United backed off. Both firms benefited from avoiding direct conflict, preserving profits that would
have been eroded by unnecessary competition.

Responding to Disruptive Innovations

When a disruptive innovation challenges an industry's established norms, companies have three main ways to respond. First, exec-
utives might choose to stick with traditional business models, hoping the disruption doesn't fully displace their offerings. This was
the case with Barnes & Noble, which initially underestimated the threat of Amazon's online bookstore. Second, firms can counter-
attack by innovating along different dimensions, as Apple did when it responded to low-cost competitors like Dell by adding more
features and power to its products. The third option is to match the competitor's move, as Merrill Lynch did when it launched its
own online trading platform, recognizing that ignoring the disruption could cost them future customers.

Fighting Brands

When a competitor undercuts a firm by offering lower-priced goods or services of comparable quality, one response is to create a
fighting brand. A fighting brand is a lower-end product introduced specifically to protect the firm's market share without devaluing
its primary brand. In the late 1980s, General Motors (GM) responded to the growing popularity of affordable Japanese cars by creat-
ing the Geo brand. GM didn't want to hurt its established brands like Chevrolet and Cadillac, so it sold low-cost cars under the Geo
name instead. Interestingly, some Geo models were produced in joint ventures with the same Japanese companies against which
GM was trying to compete. By the late 1990s, however, the market shifted toward higher-quality vehicles, and Geo was discontin-
ued.

Some fighting brands are short-lived and fail to achieve their
desired objectives. Take the case of GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK)
attempt to protect its market share in Europe. When the patent
for its popular asthma drug, Seretide, was about to expire, GSK
launched Seretide Eco, a lower-cost version aimed at prevent-
ing customers from switching to generic alternatives. However,
once generics hit the market, Seretide Eco wasn't priced com-
petitively enough, and customers quickly migrated to cheaper
options. GSK soon discontinued the brand, marking the effort
as a misstep in the fight against generics.

The airline industry offers similar cautionary tales. In response
to the growing success of budget carriers like Ryanair and Easy-
Jet, British Airways launched Go in the late 1990s as a low-cost Figure 9.17: The Geo brand was recognized for its affordability and fuel
alternative. Despite initial interest, Go struggled to compete efficiency rather than its design
with established budget airlines and was sold off in 2002. Sim-
ilarly, Scandinavian Airlines introduced Snowflake in 2003 to rival low-cost carriers, but the brand was discontinued two years later
due to poor performance. These examples highlight the challenges legacy carriers face when trying to succeed in the discount mar-
ket, where competing on cost often conflicts with their existing differentiation strategies based around, for example, reputation or
luxury. As seen here, shifting from a differentiation to a cost leadership strategy, or vice versa, can be especially difficult for estab-
lished companies, whose resources, capabilities, core competencies, and brand identities are deeply tied to their original market
positioning.

However, not all fighting brands face the same fate. Some have proven to be enduring successes. A notable example is Toyota's cre-
ation of Scion in the early 2000s. Designed to appeal to younger, budget-conscious consumers without diluting Toyota's premium
image, Scion successfully built a niche market segment in the compact car market for over a decade before being discontinued
in 2016 when market conditions shifted. Another success story comes from Unilever, which launched Axe as a lower-priced men's
grooming product in response to competition from smaller, upstart brands. Axe not only reclaimed market share but also grew into
a globally recognized brand in its own right.

These successful examples illustrate how fighting brands, when well-conceived and properly positioned, can effectively protect a
company's market share without undercutting its premium offerings. However, as the failures demonstrate, launching a fighting
brand requires careful strategy and a deep understanding of market dynamics.
             9. FORMULATE INNOVATION STRATEGY | 259

Co-Location

Co-location refers to the strategy of situating different businesses near one another, creating a collective hub that draws more cus-
tomers than each would individually. A prime example can be seen in bustling tech hubs like Austin, Texas, where startups and tech
giants like Dell, IBM, and Oracle are clustered. The proximity of these firms fosters an ecosystem that attracts talent, investors, and
business opportunities, all while benefiting the companies involved.

Similarly, retail outlets like outdoor gear shops, bike stores, and coffee shops tend to pop up near hiking trails or in adventure sports
districts, appealing to specific clientele. These clusters thrive because customers appreciate the convenience of having multiple
options in one location.

Some companies also leverage co-location by positioning their own brands close together. For example, Hilton might strategically
place a Hampton Inn next to a higher-end Hilton Garden Inn, allowing them to capture both budget and premium travelers without
losing customers to competitors.

In the fast-casual dining space, Dunkin' often co-locates with Baskin-
Robbins in shared storefronts, giving customers the option of coffee or
ice cream under one roof. Similarly, Coca-Cola places multiple differ-
ent vending machines in the same locations, offering soda, juice, and
water so that every consumer's thirst is quenched. Co-location doesn't
just provide customers with choice; it also helps businesses maximize
foot traffic and diversify their offerings within the same space.

Co-Opetition

Although competition and cooperation are usually viewed as oppos-
ing forces, the concept of co-opetition reveals a more intricate Figure 9.18: Co-located brands
dynamic in which firms can simultaneously collaborate and compete.
Ray Noorda, founder of Novell, coined the term to describe a blend of rivalry and partnership. For example, tech giants Microsoft
and Samsung compete directly in the electronics market, but they have also partnered to integrate Microsoft's software into Sam-
sung devices. This allows both companies to benefit from each other's strengths while still maintaining competition in other areas.
Similarly, Google and Apple are competitors in the smartphone market, but they collaborate through partnerships in mapping and
app development, working together on projects while competing for consumer attention.

A notable example of co-opetition is the partnership between Ford and Volkswagen. While the two automakers fiercely compete
in the global car market, they have joined forces in the development of electric vehicles and autonomous driving technologies. The
collaboration allows both companies to reduce research and development costs while pooling their expertise in these cutting-edge
fields. At the same time, they continue to compete for market share, with each striving to outsell the other in regions around the
world.

In their book Co-opetition, Adam Brandenburger and Barry Nalebuff argue that firms often collaborate to "create the pie" and then
compete to "divide it up." In other words, companies typically cooperate in areas removed from direct customer interaction, such as
research and development, but become rivals when it comes to sales, marketing, and distribution.

For instance, in the Scandinavian telecom industry, firms have been known to collaborate on infrastructure development but
fiercely compete in consumer products and services. Similarly, in the food and beverage industry, companies might work together
on sustainability initiatives like waste management or packaging innovation, while competing aggressively in branding and retail
strategies.

       Application
            · Think of companies you have studied in your business education.
                     Describe examples of a multipoint competition, fighting brand, co-location, and co-opetition as a means of respond-
                        ing to innovation in the market. Explain your rationale.

     Key Takeaways

     In fast-paced industries, executives often contend with constant competitive pressures, such as aggressive marketing, price cuts, and
     attempts to poach key customers. Quick responses are vital because delays can give competitors a significant edge. When companies
     compete against the same rival across multiple markets and market segments, known as multipoint competition (or multimarket com-
     petition), decisions about responses become more complex. When a disruptive innovation challenges an industry's established norms,
     companies have three main ways to respond: stick with traditional business models, counterattack by innovating along different dimen-
     sions, or match the competitor's move. When a competitor undercuts a firm by offering lower-priced goods or services of comparable
     quality, one response is to create a fighting brand. Co-location refers to the strategy of situating different businesses near one another,
     creating a collective hub that draws more customers than each would individually. Co-opetition is a blend of rivalry and partnership.
     By partnering on specific initiatives, companies can pool resources and expertise, reducing the costs of innovation. This approach helps
     firms accelerate innovation while remaining competitive in other market segments.

9.13 Measuring Innovation Performance

Measuring the performance of innovations involves assessing both the success of new initiatives and their impact on overall busi-
ness outcomes. Various metrics can be employed to capture the effectiveness of innovation strategies and investments.
One common approach is to evaluate the percentage of sales generated from products or services launched within a specific time
frame. This metric indicates the contribution of recent innovations to the company's overall revenue. Another useful measure is the
                                                                                                                 9. FORMULATE INNOVATION STRATEGY | 261

success ratio, which compares the number of successful innovations to the total number of initiatives undertaken. This helps assess
the efficiency and effectiveness of the innovation process. Innovation output is sometimes measured as the percentage of product
sales which were new to market (Laursen & Salter, 2006).

Revenue growth attributed to new products and services can highlight how much innovation is driving top-line growth. Companies
can also track the return on invested capital from innovation-related projects, providing insight into the profitability of innovation
efforts relative to the resources invested.

In addition, companies often calculate the net present values of their innovation portfolios. This metric estimates the long-term
financial return from innovation projects, helping organizations prioritize and manage their innovation investments for future
growth.

These metrics, when combined, offer a comprehensive view of how well innovation efforts are contributing to both short-term per-
formance and long-term strategic objectives.

9.14 Analyze Innovation Strategy

When you conduct a case analysis, you analyze a firm's innovation strategy. This is step six in the case analysis process.

       6. As appropriate to the case, analyze strategies: Corporate-level, business-level, innovation, sustainability and ethics, technol­
       ogy, and multinational strategies

            · Use strategic management analytical frameworks to analyze, interpret, and evaluate strategies.
            · Ensure line of sight and congruence within analysis of each strategy.

9.15 Why Innovation Strategy Is Important to Business Graduates

Because innovation strategy is formulated at the strategic business unit of a firm and embedded into a company's business-level
strategy, graduates starting as business support unit managers in support business units in large companies, such as marketing
managers, will see that innovation has a direct influence on the implementation of key functional-level strategy. For example,
whether a firm chooses a first mover or fast follower approach directly influences the day-to-day work of business support unit
managers. Whether a firm follows an incremental, disruptive, architectural or radical innovation strategy, business executives and
divisional or strategic business unit managers may solicit data analysis from functional business managers of business information
technology, accounting, and marketing.
Business graduates joining smaller companies will spend even more time working closely with executives responsible for innova-
tion strategy from the start. Business graduates that serve in internal or external consulting roles require a high level of competence
with innovation strategy to communicate with business executives how their consulting projects fit into the overall innovation
strategy of the firm. For business graduates who already are or will become entrepreneurs, fluency with innovation strategy is
essential to establishing and growing a successful firm.

9.16 Conclusion

This chapter delves into the critical role of innovation in shaping a company's strategy and the various ways firms can navigate com-
petitive pressures. By fostering an entrepreneurial mindset, companies can drive innovation, though being a first mover comes with
both advantages and risks, as competitors may learn quickly and overtake the pioneer. Alternatively, firms may take a more mea-
sured approach, establishing footholds in niche market segments or using a blue ocean strategy to avoid direct competition alto-
gether.

Innovation manifests in four key types: incremental, disruptive, architectural, and radical. Most new products follow a familiar life
cycle of introduction, growth, maturity, and decline. However, incremental improvements often allow firms to reintroduce prod-
ucts, renewing their relevance. To achieve mainstream success, companies must help new products "cross the chasm" into wider
acceptance. Collaboration also plays a key role, with firms forming joint ventures and strategic alliances or even engaging in co-ope-
tition, where they cooperate and compete simultaneously. In some cases, companies may launch fighting brands to protect market
share from low-cost competitors. All of these tactics are part of a broader strategic management process that allows firms to adapt
and thrive in dynamic markets.

     When you finish Chapter 10, you will be equipped to analyze sustainability and ethics strategy.

10.1 Introduction

This chapter covers sustainability and ethics strategy. This entails you learning about megatrends, including climate change, that
drive sustainability and ethics strategy. Then you learn about sustainability strategy in more detail, including its history and evolu-
tion. You learn about the continuing impact of the triple bottom line approach. The chapter covers two crucial sustainability strate-
gies: corporate social responsibility (CSR) and today's most current framing of sustainability strategy, the environmental, social, and
governance (ESG) approach. Next you learn about ethics strategy and contemporary questions of corporate ethics. Then you learn
how to analyze sustainability and ethics strategy. Finally, the chapter concludes with a discussion of why sustainability and ethics
strategy is important to business graduates.

10.2 Sustainability and Ethics Strategy

Like all strategy formulation, formulating sustainability and ethics strategy answers the question "Where are we going?" This form
of strategy addresses how a firm can use sustainability and business ethics to establish a competitive advantage over its competitors
by better meeting evolving customer demands and the expectations of important business stakeholders. All firms need to address
sustainability and ethics.
268 | 10. FORMULATE SUSTAINABILITY AND ETHICS STRATEGY
Like innovation, sustainability and ethics is another strategy focus that is formulated at the strategic business unit level of a com-
pany and embedded in business level-strategy, answering the strategic question of how specifically a firm is going to win or com-
pete in its chosen markets and market segments.
Like all strategy, sustainability and ethics strategy focuses on an outside-in perspective. Companies need to carefully monitor their
external environments. They need to analyze trends and formulate strategies that are forward-looking. Robust sustainability and
ethics strategy takes into account the volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous nature of the firm's external environment, where
change and disruption have become the new normal.
This chapter analyzes how changes in the external environment of the firm drive strategic responses with companies embracing
their corporate social responsibility, developing environmental, social, and governance strategies and treating corporate business
ethics as a possible source of winning in the market versus just a legalistic approach to stay compliant.

     Key Takeaways

     Like all strategy formulation, formulating sustainability and ethics strategy answers the question "Where are we going?" and addresses
     how a firm can use sustainability and business ethics to establish a competitive advantage. All firms need to address sustainability and
     ethics strategy. Like innovation, sustainability and ethics is another strategy focus that is formulated at the strategic business unit level
     of a company and embedded in business-level strategy, answering the strategic question "Right to win?"

10.3 Megatrends and Climate Change

Positioning a business strategically for success requires a thorough analysis of disruptive megatrends, which are deep and profound
trends that are global in scope and long term in effect. These must be considered for strategy formulation. Important disruptive
megatrends relevant for business rest in technological transformation (for example, AI, cloud and quantum computing, big data,
and automation) as well as shifts in economic power to emerging countries, rapid urbanization, global population growth, supply
chain disruptions in an increasingly globalized business environment, aging Western populations, young populations in emerging
countries, geopolitical tensions, social change, climate change, and resource scarcity.

Climate Change

Addressing climate change is the defining challenge of our time and is one megatrend that threatens to disrupt modern society. Cli­
mate change is a significant variation of average weather conditions (warmer, wetter, or drier) over several decades. When the earth
absorbs the sun's energy, or when atmospheric gases prevent heat released by the earth from radiating into space (the greenhouse
effect), the planet warms. Global warming refers to the increase in the planet's overall average temperature in recent decades.
Global warming is part of climate change and is driven by greenhouse gases (GHGs), with carbon dioxide (CO2) being the main dri-
ver of global warming. The burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas for electricity, heat, and transportation is the main root cause
of the huge increase of CO2 emissions. CO2 concentration is now at its highest level in 800,000 years, leading to a rapidly increasing
global temperature which is causing draughts, rising sea levels, extreme weather events, food shortages, the reduction of biodiver-
sity, lack of fresh water and climate refugees, among other issues. In his opening remarks to COP27 on November 7, 2022, United
270 | 10. FORMULATE SUSTAINABILITY AND ETHICS STRATEGY
Nations (UN) Secretary Antonio Guterres had some very clear, powerful, and concerning messages to the world regarding climate
change:

      "We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot still on the accelerator."
      "We are in the fight of our lives, and we are losing."
      "Greenhouse gas emissions keep growing, global temperatures keep rising, and our planet is fast approaching tipping points that will
      make climate chaos irreversible."
To limit the negative effects of climate change, almost all countries in the world committed to a reduction of CO2 emissions in the
Paris Agreement in 2015. The target of the Paris Agreement is limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial
level. To achieve this, countries committed to a net-zero CO2 target by 2050.
These commitments have implications for all businesses around the world, leading to strategic questions like:

  · What does my industry and market look like in a net-zero world?
  · How do I transform and decarbonize my business model?
  · How do I identify, mitigate, and address climate risk in my operations?
  · How do I climate-proof my operations?
  · How do I manage my global supply chain, and how do I cooperate with suppliers around the world who contribute to my firm's

      greenhouse gas footprint?
  · How do I stay legally compliant with current and emerging climate regulations and laws?
  · How do I report on the environmental (and social) performance of my firm?

     Key Takeaways

     Megatrends are deep and profound trends that are global in scope and long term in effect. Important disruptive megatrends relevant
     for business involve technological transformation, shifting economic power to emerging countries, rapid urbanization, global popula-
     tion growth, supply chain disruptions, aging Western populations, young populations in emerging countries, geopolitical tensions, social
     change, climate change, and resource scarcity. Positioning a business strategically for success requires a thorough analysis and integra-
     tion of disruptive megatrends.

10.4 Sustainability Strategy

Addressing the issues of climate change, resource scarcity, biodiversity, human rights, social issues, and social justice are covered
by the term sustainability. Sustainability is defined by the UN Commission for Sustainable Development (Brundtland Commission)
as meeting the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
Sustainability strategy is a company's strategy to reduce adverse environmental and social impacts resulting from business oper-
ations while still pursuing profitable growth. Strategies that fall under this umbrella include corporate social responsibility (CSR)
strategies and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) strategies. Sustainability is a business imperative and should be at the
core of every business's strategy and operations.

Figure 10.2 shows a few examples of firms' sustainability statements.

Company Sustainability statement

Ford Vision For The Future: We aim to reach carbon neutrality no later than 2050. This encompasses our entire impact on the planet - from the emissions from our vehicles to the power in our factories, to our suppliers.

McDonald's Our Planet: We're helping to drive climate action, protecting natural resources, reducing waste, and transitioning to more sustainable packaging and toys.

Oatly  So, you may be wondering why a company needs a to-do list or how long a company's to-do list might be. Hopefully, this
       explains it or leaves you with your own questions. Anyway, it's our to-do list to take important steps toward our vision for a food
       system that is better for people and the planet. But it's not just a to-do list! It's our sustainability plan outlining the actions we
       will take to meet our sustainability ambitions.

Do Companies Have a Social Responsibility beyond Profit?

There is a decades-long controversy over whether business should (or even must)
support environmental and social issues or whether they should just focus on gen-
erating profits. The strongest supporter of the profit focus is American economist
and Nobel Prize Winner in Economic Sciences, Milton Friedman. He stated that
"the business of business is doing business." He believed that there is one and only
one social responsibility of business: "To use its resources and engage in activities
designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game,
which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud"
(Forder, 2019).

On the other hand, Theodore Levitt, American economist and professor at the Har-
vard Business School stated, "Although profits are required for business just like
eating is required for living, profit is not the purpose of business any more than
eating is the purpose of life" (Levitt, 1983).

There is a strong argument to be made that companies do have an ethical and            Figure 10.3: Milton Friedman
moral obligation to give back to society and support environmental and social
issues. With great power, there comes great responsibility. Companies have the
resources available to make a positive difference, and it seems to be the right and
ethical thing to do.

Business Case for Sustainability Strategy

As you have just seen, there are different perspectives on whether the purpose of business includes a social responsibility beyond
just making profits. We now want to go beyond an ethical assessment toward a clear financial business case in favor of sustainable
business management. This business case is driven by the expectations of business' main stakeholders: customers, employees,
investors, and regulators.

Customers

  · Eighty percent of consumers are more likely to buy from a company that stands up for environmental issues (PWC, 2023).
  · Ninety percent of Gen-Zs believe companies should act on social issues, and 90 percent of millennials in the U.S. would switch

      brands to those championing a cause (BCG, 2021).
  · Eighty-seven percent of Americans will purchase a product because a company advocated for an issue they care about,

      whereas 76 percent will refuse to purchase a company's product from a company supporting issues contrary to their beliefs
      (Cone Communications CSR Study, 2017).
                                                                                             10. FORMULATE SUSTAINABILITY AND ETHICS STRATEGY | 273

While customers have always supported sustainability to a high degree, the current game changer is the customers' willingness to
pay more for sustainable products and solutions, basically voting with their wallets in support of sustainability. Offering sustain-
able solutions helps companies to win with their customers and in their chosen markets and market segments.

Employees

· Forty percent of millennials state that sustainability was a consideration in their job choice (BCG).
· Over 40 percent of Gen-Zs and millennials would switch jobs over climate concerns (Segal, 2024).
· Eighty-three percent of employees are more likely to work for a company that addresses environmental and social issues in

   their business (PWC, 2021).
· Eighty-six percent of employees prefer to support or work for companies that care about the same issues they do (PWC, 2021).

Talent attraction, talent retention, and managing an engaged and committed workforce depends on the strength of companies'
sustainability strategies.

Investors

· Eighty-eight percent of investors believe companies that prioritize sustain-
   ability initiatives represent better opportunities for long-term returns than
   companies that do not (PWC, 2022).

· Beyond strong financial performance, institutional investors demand a
   strong environmental and social performance from the companies in
   which they invest. They see a lack of social commitment and a business
   model that doesn't transform the company's business toward sustainabil-
   ity as signs of a financial investment risk.

· In the words of Larry Fink, Chairman and CEO of the world's largest asset
   management firm, BlackRock: "To prosper over time, every company must
   not only deliver financial performance but also show how it makes a posi-
   tive contribution to society. Companies must benefit all of their stakehold-
   ers."

Access to capital and capital costs depends on a robust sustainability strategy    Figure 10.4: Larry Fink
that convinces private and institutional investors that the company is well posi-
tioned with a clear purpose and a meaningful management of climate risk in
their business model.

Government and Regulators

· Governments and regulators have set the bold ambition for countries to become carbon-neutral by 2050. This is the direct con-
   sequence of countries committing to the Paris Agreement. Regulatory approaches to achieve this include regulation on the
   industry sector level designed to limit and continuously reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the implementation of a carbon tax
   to make the use of fossil energy more expensive, and tax breaks and financial subsidiaries in support of a business transforma-
   tion toward a low-carbon business model.

· Regulators introduce carbon pricing and regulations on a sector level to reduce CO2 emissions. For example, California out-
   lawed the sale of new fossil fuel cars as of 2035.

· There is significant pressure on businesses to comply with quickly evolving new environmental regulation and laws and a clear
   mandate to decarbonize companies' business models.
274 | 10. FORMULATE SUSTAINABILITY AND ETHICS STRATEGY
A proactive approach to sustainability helps companies to stay compliant and ahead of the curve in terms of legislation and regula-
tion. Instead of just passively reacting to new legislation and regulation, companies can proactively factor new laws and regulations
into their business models, excel in reporting and disclosure, and transform their business models ahead of the competition.
Sustainability strategies drive positive performance by saving on costs through lower energy and water consumption, waste reduc-
tion, pollution control, improved employee recruitment, retention, and work productivity, improved corporate reputation and
brand recognition, and the creation of new revenue-generating opportunities through innovation, new products, and new markets.
Sustainability also supports cost savings through risk management in global supply chains, tax credits and subsidies, legal and reg-
ulatory compliance, positive community relations, and better access to capital.
Figure 10.5 summarizes the business case for sustainability strategies.

                          Figure 10.5: The business case for sustainability
This positive financial business case of sustainable business models has also been supported by a large-scale meta-study of the New
York University Center for Sustainable Business. The Center examined the relationship between ESG and financial performance in
245 research studies between 2015 and 2020. The results of this study showed that a majority of studies (58 percent) indicated a pos-
itive impact of ESG and business sustainability on financial performance, whereas only 8 percent show a negative impact (Whelan,
Atz, Van Holt, & Clark, 2021).

       Application
            · Research the sustainability statements for three companies you admire. Discuss whether each company is following its sus-
                tainability commitments and how this impacts profits.

Key Takeaways

Sustainability is defined by the UN Commission for Sustainable Development (Brundtland Commission) as meeting the needs of the
present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainability strategy is a com-
pany's strategy to reduce adverse environmental and social impacts resulting from business operations while still pursuing profitable
growth. Strategies that fall under the umbrella of sustainable strategies include corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategies and envi-
ronmental, social, and governance (ESG) strategies. Businesses need to balance economic, social, environmental, and legal and regula-
tory obligations in order to satisfy stakeholder desires and therefore must assume broad responsibilities that include complying with
social norms and expectations. There is a clear financial business case in support of sustainability strategy driven by customers, employ-
ees, investors, and regulatory agencies.

10.5 Triple Bottom Line

Closely related to the positive financial business case of sustainable business is the
triple bottom line concept. Business leader Sir Richard Branson once said, "Doing
good is good for business." This reflects a growing mindset in modern companies
where social and environmental responsibility go hand in hand with profitability.
This is often reflected in a firm's purpose and values. It is also a focus of corporate
social responsibility and environmental, social, and governance strategy.

Instead of asserting that doing positive things for the environment and society
comes at the expense of profit, the triple bottom line states that a good environmen-
tal and social performance will support the financial performance of companies.
There is no tradeoff between profit and people and the environment; in fact, there is
a positive correlation. Companies use sustainability strategies to enhance financial
performance, and sustainability becomes a driver of competitive differentiation.

The triple bottom line framework emphasizes a broader view that focuses on the            Figure 10.6: Richard Branson
three Ps: people, planet, and profits. These may also be referred to as social/societal,
environmental, economic/financial. The triple bottom line ensures that organiza-
tions consider not only financial success but also their impact on society (people)
and the environment (planet). Although the concept originated in the 1980s, it
gained significant traction in the late 1990s as businesses began recognizing that
sustainable and ethical practices lead to long-term success. Almost all companies
have embraced this approach, prioritizing environmental sustainability and social
responsibility alongside their financial goals.
                                                                                             10. FORMULATE SUSTAINABILITY AND ETHICS STRATEGY | 277
The logic in support of the business case for sustainable business management and the triple bottom line approach can be summa-
rized by the following statements:

  · Doing well by doing good
  · Making "doing the right thing" profitable
  · Creating a better world through better business

                                       Figure 10.7: The triple bottom line emphasizes the three Ps: people (social concerns),
                                       planet (environmental concerns), and profits (economic concerns)

Deloitte demonstrates its commitment to the planet and people through an integrated
approach to sustainability and social impact. The company's environmental pledge,
embedded in its strategy, includes ambitious goals to achieve net-zero emissions by
2030 and drive climate-positive initiatives across industries. Deloitte doesn't stop at
environmental leadership; it also prioritizes the people aspect of the triple bottom line Figure 10.8: Deloitte
by focusing on creating equitable opportunities within the communities it serves.
Through programs like its WorldClass initiative, Deloitte aims to empower 100 million individuals worldwide by 2030 through edu-
cation and skills development, especially in underserved populations. Balancing these commitments with strong financial perfor-
mance, Deloitte demonstrates how large organizations can be profitable while remaining socially responsible and environmentally
conscious. Deloitte encourages its employees to learn skills that benefit both the firm and individuals through its Graduate School
Assistance Program. The program helps to send high-performing consultants to top graduate schools. In doing so, Deloitte hopes
to encourage top talent to choose employment with the firm. The program provides a reward for the high-achieving employees
who it wishes to retain. This is evidence of Deloitte's commitment to the people pillar of the triple bottom line.

10.6 Corporate Social Responsibility: A Sustainability Strategy

Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is the idea that a business has a responsibility to the society in which it operates. CSR is an
approach where a company operates in ways that enhance society and the environment while pursuing its profit goal. CSR can pro-
mote a positive reputation with stakeholders and a positive brand image for the company. With the parallel pursuit of environmen-
tal, social, and economic objectives, CSR shows many parallels with the triple bottom line approach (profit, people, planet). One of
the main drivers and advantages of CSR is that it acknowledges and embraces the fact that business operates in a multi-stakeholder
context.
                                                                                            10. FORMULATE SUSTAINABILITY AND ETHICS STRATEGY | 279

Corporate social responsibility strategy is a sustainability strategy that focuses on the tenants of the CSR approach. Assuming cor-
porate responsibility not only for a company's financial results but also considering various stakeholders and their environmental
and social interests strengthens a business's social license to operate. It enhances relationships and drives support of various pri-
mary and secondary stakeholders whose support a company needs to stay successful in the long term.

Beyond allowing a company to thrive in a multi-stakeholder society, CSR encourages long-term thinking, drives innovation and
cost savings, enhances brand differentiation, and furthers customer and employee engagement. Beyond customers and employees,
investors and governmental regulators are additional important stakeholders. CSR improves business reputation and standing,
provides access to investment and funding opportunities, and generates positive publicity and support by the general public and
media, also known as the "court of public opinion."

Let's take Levi Strauss & Co. as an example of what companies do in support of their CSR strategies. Levi's explains how it supports
society and the environment through these specific activities:

   ginia in 1960.

· We championed corporate integrity through trans-
   parency: Our Terms of Engagement were instituted
   worldwide in 1991, ensuring worker protection at every
   point of the supply chain.

· We encouraged empathy in the face of fear: Our leaders
   and employees came together in 1982 to educate the pub-
   lic on issues facing the LGBTQ+ community.

· We're making things better & thinking sustainability first.
· We're collaborating with suppliers on programs that

   improve the lives of apparel workers.
· We're committed to saving arts education (Levi's, n.d.).

You can easily see how Levi's targets various stakeholders, how it wants to improve social matters (improving the lives of apparel
workers) and environmental matters (prioritizing sustainability). You can also easily see how consumers may identify with these
activities and reward Levi's with their business, which would then drive Levi's financial performance as a result of brand loyalty and
higher willingness to pay by consumers.

Other typical activities of a socially responsible company include making products that are safe, obeying laws and regulations in all
aspects of business, promoting honest and ethical employee behavior, committing to a safe workplace for all employees, avoiding
misleading or deceptive advertising and marketing practices, giving money to charitable causes, responding quickly to customer
problems, and avoiding polluting the environment, among many other methods.

Specific company examples of robust CSR activities include:

· LEGO's pledge to reduce its carbon impact: LEGO is the first and only toy company to be named a World Wildlife Fund Climate
   Savers Partner (lego.com).

· Salesforce's 1-1-1 philanthropic model: Beyond being a leader in the technology space, cloud-based software giant Salesforce
   is a trailblazer in corporate philanthropy. Since its outset, the company has championed its 1-1-1 philanthropic model, which
   involves giving one percent of product, one percent of equity, and one percent of employees' time to communities and the non-
   profit sector (salesforce.com).

· Ben & Jerry's social mission: At Ben & Jerry's, positively impacting society is just as important as producing premium ice cream.
   As part of its overarching commitment to leading with progressive values, the ice cream maker established the Ben & Jerry's
280 | 10. FORMULATE SUSTAINABILITY AND ETHICS STRATEGY

      Foundation in 1985, an organization dedicated to supporting grassroots movements that drive social change (benjerry.com).
  · Starbucks's commitment to ethical sourcing: Starbucks launched its first corporate social responsibility report in 2002 with

      the goal of becoming as well known for its CSR initiatives as for its products. One of the ways the brand has fulfilled this goal is
      through ethical sourcing. In 2015, Starbucks verified that 99 percent of its coffee supply chain is ethically sourced, and it seeks
      to boost that figure to 100 percent through continued efforts and partnerships with local coffee farmers and organizations
      (starbucks.com).

The different corporate responsibilities that business has are illustrated in the CSR pyramid in figure 10.10.

If you were to visualize CSR strategy as a hierarchy of dif-
ferent social responsibilities, the foundation would be
composed of legal and regulatory compliance. All com-
panies need to obey laws and regulations as the mini-
mum social responsibility. While this sounds banal and
obvious, the copious amount of ethics scandals shows
that this is not always the case. Some companies may be
able to disobey laws and regulations, pay a fine, and go
on to recover their market share. On the other hand, law-
suits can bankrupt a business. Either way, customers
want to do business with companies that obey all applic-
able laws and regulations.

The second level in the hierarchy of social responsibility    Figure 10.10: Different corporate responsibilities
of corporations is an economic and financial responsibil-
ity to the firm's owners, shareholders, and other stake-
holders. Without being financially healthy and without
continuously generating profits, a company is not viable,
disappearing from the market. A company cannot create
social good without being profitable.

The third level of social responsibility is being ethical. This goes beyond legal and regulatory compliance and is driven by robust vol-
untary corporate ethics programs, ethical culture, ethical leadership, and robust corporate governance.

The fourth level of the CSR pyramid is the social responsibility of being a good corporate citizen. This encompasses the firm's social
responsibility to give back to society through strategic philanthropy and to give back to the local and global communities with
which the firm interacts. This level balances the firm's financial performance with its environmental and social impact in the frame-
work of a holistic approach to business that considers the needs of all stakeholders, not just shareholders.

CSR evolved over time and is now characterized by an integrated and transforming approach to CSR strategy. The strategic intent
of CSR is value creation and social change rather than just legal and regulatory compliance. CSR is not just outsourced to a team or
specialists in the organization; CSR is owned and driven by strategic leaders and managers with the support of business unit man-
agers. It embraces a multi-stakeholder approach with partnership alliances, and it provides a high level of transparency through a
full disclosure of CSR performance in specific CSR reports that the organization publishes on a regular basis. CSR went from some-
thing extra or even a greenwashing endeavor to a fully integrated strategy that is part of an organization's culture, policies, opera-
tions, and strategy.

Key Takeaways

Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is the idea that a business has a responsibility to the society in which it operates. CSR is an approach
where a company operates in ways that enhance society and the environment while pursuing its profit goal. CSR strategy as a hierarchy
of different social responsibilities, including legal and regulatory responsibility, economic and financial responsibility, ethical responsi-
bility, and corporate responsibility.
The social contract between society and business has changed. Companies are expected to assume much broader responsibilities in sup-
port of positive societal and environmental outcomes than ever before. As a result, companies are repositioning their business purposes
in support of making a positive difference in the world instead of being motivated by profit alone. Stakeholders support companies that
assume broader social responsibilities, which drives the positive correlation between doing something good for the planet and for peo-
ple while increasing profits at the same time. Corporate social responsibility starts with the foundation of companies being compliant
with all applicable laws and regulations while also acting economically and financially responsible to the firm's owners, shareholders,
and other stakeholders. Beyond that, companies are expected to be ethical, give back to society, and be good corporate citizens. Subse-
quently, strategic management is unsuccessful if it is performed in an ethical vacuum. An authentic and genuine commitment to CSR is
rewarded by stakeholders and makes CSR a driver of value creation in the form of competitive differentiation that is business driven and
stakeholder supported.

10.7 Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG): A Sustainability Strategy

An organization's sustainability practices are typically analyzed against environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics. Sus-
tainability has environmental, social, and economic perspectives. In addressing sustainability challenges, almost all companies
develop environmental, social, and governance strategy.
Although CSR strategy still holds relevance and importance, ESG has emerged as the leading concept for achieving or maintaining
a sustainable and ethical organization. ESG has become a success-critical strategy element. ESG focuses on a company's environ-
mental performance, its support of social topics, such as social justice and human rights, and its corporate governance. Sometimes
ESG is called "CSR with teeth" because ESG is more heavily regulated than CSR. There are far-reaching ESG disclosure and reporting
requirements for companies that are not found under the CSR model. In the European Union, the Corporate Sustainability Report-
ing Directive (CSRD) requires around 50,000 companies to report and disclose their environmental, social, and governance per-
formances through audit-grade reporting. There is also a high level of transparency with ESG reports, and ESG ratings must meet
formal transparency standards.
Stakeholders such as institutional investors place high importance on a company's ESG performance. According to a PWC study:

  · Eighty-three percent of consumers think companies should be actively shaping ESG best practices.
  · Ninety-one percent of business leaders believe their company has a responsibility to act on ESG issues.
  · Eighty-six percent of employees prefer to work for a company that cares about the same issues they do.
  · More than 50 percent of all investments will be ESG-driven in the near future.
The large majority of investors believe that strong ESG practices can lead to better long-term returns (Deloitte Survey, 2023; Morgan
Stanley Survey, 2024). Achievement of sustainability goals was the most cited business priority, identified by 75 percent of organi-
zations as one of their five most important initiatives, well ahead of second-place digital transformation Initiatives at 56 percent
(Honeywell study, 2023).

           Figure 10.11: ESG
284 | 10. FORMULATE SUSTAINABILITY AND ETHICS STRATEGY
ESG strategy is a driver for value creation. The ESG-driven sustainable business transformation is collaborative, with various stake-
holders like suppliers included along the value chain. A company defines its ESG strategy in support of its mission, purpose, vision,
and values.
ESG is embedded in business-level strategy and contains the following strategic pillars.

  · Environmental pillar: Addresses resource, land, and water use. Promotes a reduction of carbon emissions, pollution, and
      waste, the decarbonization of a firm's business model, and biodiversity. Is aligned with the circular economy.

  · Social pillar: Addresses labor management. Promotes the health and safety of employees, human capital development and
      talent management, supply chain labor standards for workers in the global value chain, social justice, consumer rights, prod-
      uct safety, privacy and data security, and the rights of communities affected by the business.

  · Governance pillar: Promotes corporate business ethics, codes of conduct, advisory board oversight, tax transparency, anti-cor-
      ruption and anti-bribery policies, and executive pay.

Environmental Pillar

The decarbonization of a company's business model is the most critical element in fighting climate change and often the main ele-
ment of the ESG environmental pillar. Companies need to define their journeys to become carbon-neutral by 2050 at the latest. As
a consequence, companies are currently transparently assessing and measuring their emissions as the baseline for defining spe-
cific programs to reduce carbon emissions along their complete value chains. This is covered under corporate decarbonization strat-
egy, which is a part of an overall sustainability strategy and includes measures like energy efficiency projects, the use of renewable
energy, electrification, the use of life cycle assessments (LCA) to reduce the environmental impact of products, and partnerships
with suppliers.
Another important and strategy-changing environmental element of ESG is the transformation to a circular economy. This con-
trasts with the current linear economy and linear business model, which follow a take-make-waste approach where resources are
used to make products that are being consumed and then wasted.

Figure 10.12: Linear economy
                                                                                            10. FORMULATE SUSTAINABILITY AND ETHICS STRATEGY | 285

                                     Figure 10.13: Circular economy

Other important elements of the environmental pillar are the reduction of pollution and waste, responsible management of water,
support of biodiversity, reduction of land use, opportunities in green building, renewable energy, and investment in green technol-
ogy.

Social Pillar

The next pillar of ESG is the social pillar, which is related to the company's impact on social issues and human rights. The social pillar
focuses on the firm's positive impact on different stakeholders.
The first stakeholder group is the firm's own employees. The firm should create safe working conditions, provide appropriate com-
pensation and development opportunities, support the continuous upskilling of its workforce, allow unionization, and have robust
anti-discrimination and equal opportunity policies in place.
One success-critical element of the social pillar is the continued talent development of the firm's workforce in the era of AI. AI,
automation, and robotics are changing the way we live and the way we work. There are estimates that forecast that up to 40 percent
of current jobs will disappear by 2030. Many employees will also work in jobs and positions in the future that don't even exist today.
Job families will rise and decline in the context of the transformation of industries and business models. This often requires funda-
mentally different and new skill sets for employees and new ways to organize work. Hence, the continued upskilling and reskilling
of a company's workforce is one of the success-critical elements of the social pillar.
Another important topic for a firm's own workforce is the topic of "new work." This concept encompasses all changes to work design
initiated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Employees worked from home, and many continue to expect some kind of balance between
in-office work and working from home. At the same time, many companies have requested employees to return full time to their
offices. New hybrid work models are important challenges and critical success factors regarding a firm's own workforce under the
social pillar of ESG. Figure 10.14 shows some of the topics that are currently discussed with a high priority.
286 | 10. FORMULATE SUSTAINABILITY AND ETHICS STRATEGY

Figure 10.14: Organizations reimagining "new work" in a hybrid work model

The second stakeholder group in the social pillar is workers in the firm's global value chain. This element of ESG drives a significant
paradigm change in business. The social responsibility of companies does not end at their factory gates or at borders. Firms are
responsible for labor standards of workers in their global value chains. This means that companies assume responsibility for the
working conditions, safety standards, work hours, and payment of workers who work for their suppliers abroad. This is a significant
paradigm change that is accompanied by management and reporting challenges. Supply chain standards in global value chains
need to be managed thoroughly, and companies must manage responsible sourcing practices with all of their suppliers, including
auditing the human rights of their suppliers' workers.

The third stakeholder group are communities affected by the firm's business operations. The firm needs to respect the rights of local
communities affected by the company's operations and must provide remedies for any adverse impact of their operations.

The last stakeholder group are the firm's consumers and end users who have the right to safe products, the absence of misleading
marketing information, and especially important in the era of big data, privacy rights (for example, data protection and cybersecu-
rity).

Patagonia, Inc., is an American retailer of outdoor recreation     Figure 10.15: The Patagonia story: making business sustainability the strategic
clothing, equipment, and food. It was founded by Yvon              right to win and the main source of competitive differentiation
Chouinard in 1973 and is based in Ventura, California. Patago-
nia's revenue is estimated at $1.5 billion, and the company has
shown strong growth and robust success over time. However,
the driver of this success is not just its high-quality products.
The main differentiator and the source of Patagonia's competi-
tive advantage is its sustainable business model and its focus
on its environmental, social, and governance performance,
which is the core of ESG and CSR strategy. This is rewarded by
key stakeholders like customers, who respond with brand loy-
alty and a higher willingness to pay for Patagonia's sustainable
products.

The company has three pillars--environmental programs, social programs, and business conduct--that follow the ESG structure.
Patagonia explicitly addresses climate change in declaring "The climate crisis is our business." Patagonia is radically reducing its car-
bon emissions and is transforming how they make products, using materials that cause less harm to the environment. Patagonia's
commitment goes beyond its own company and includes a goal to make a positive impact along the full global value chain, from
suppliers to customers, which is one of the best practices for a robust ESG strategy.

Since 1985, Patagonia has pledged 1 percent of sales to the preservation and restoration of the natural environment. The firm
awarded over $140 million in cash and in-kind donations to domestic and international grassroots environmental groups making a
difference in their local communities. This is an example of strategic philanthropy, which is part of the CSR pyramid and part of the
social ESG pillar.

                                                                         Patagonia is a certified B Corp. Becoming a B Corp is another trend

                                                                         Lastly, Patagonia is committed to the reuse and recycling of its prod-

                                                                         Patagonia ran an iconic marketing campaign in the form of a full-

                                                                         jacket's weight. This included thirty-six gallons of water, which is

                                                                         plea: "Don't buy what you don't need." This is an excellent example
                                                                         of Patagonia, like many other firms, moving from a linear to a circu-

omy with elements of reusing materials, repairing products, prolonging the product life cycle, refurbishing and remanufacturing,
and recycling.

Governance Pillar

Corporate governance is the system of rules, practices, and processes by which a company is directed, managed, and controlled.
The system guides a company's relationships with its shareholders and stakeholders. Establishing and implementing these rules
and practices involves balancing the interests of a company's many stakeholders. Creating and implementing transparent rules and
controls can guide leadership in aligning the interests of shareholders, directors, management, community members, and employ-
ees. Good corporate governance can benefit various stakeholders as well as the operations and reputation of a company. Bad cor-
porate governance can destroy a company's operations and ultimate profitability.
288 | 10. FORMULATE SUSTAINABILITY AND ETHICS STRATEGY

In large companies, a company's board of directors is responsible for the direction and execution of the company's corporate gover-
nance. The company's shareholders appoint the directors to make sure that the organization has an appropriate governance struc-
ture in place.

An effective board plays a key role in various areas that are critical to an organization. Here are some of their roles:

  · Appointment of corporate officers, including the CEO
  · Executive compensation
  · Setting company goals and approval of financial objectives

      opportunities, as board members are often senior executives in other companies

One of the most important roles and responsibilities of the board of directors is the representation of shareholder interest in the
company. Corporate governance addresses the separation of ownership and control. Shareholders are the owners of the company,
but it is not possible for individual shareholders who lack a large percentage of overall shares to have meaningful and reasonable
oversight of how the company is managed by the CEO and other company officers. Hence, dispersed shareholders need a voice to
speak for them and their interest--the board of directors.

A specific issue that requires robust corporate governance is conflict of interest. A company employee could possibly choose per-
sonal gain over duties to shareholders and could possibly abuse the position in the company for personal gain. This can happen
when a person could receive personal benefit from decisions being made by a company employee in their official capacity. For
example, a procurement manager has been tasked with identifying the best supplier to provide maintenance services for the com-
pany's car fleet. One of the possible suppliers is owned by his brother-in-law, who would be happy to gain this significant business.
However, the company operated by him does not provide the best offer in terms of quality and price for the organization that buys
the maintenance services. The company's procurement manager may have two conflicting interests. In his capacity as a professional
procurement manager, he needs and wants to give the business to the most suitable supplier, which is not his brother-in-law's
business. On the other hand, he would love to help his brother-in-law, his sister, and their family to do well and gain the business.
Obviously, the decision to give the business to the procurement manager's brother-in-law is not in the interest of shareholders. Cor-
porate governance needs to address conflict of interest issue and provide some clear policies and guidance.

Another example is a CEO who pursues the acquisition of a competitor and who is willing to spend too much money on the acquisi-
tion. The reasons for the CEO's willingness to overpay for the acquisition may be personal interest in gaining power and reputation,
leading a larger company, and possibly receiving higher compensation for leading the larger company. This would be a conflict of
interest in regards to what is best for shareholders compared to the CEO's own personal ambitions.

The disconnect between the interests of the employees, manager, and CEO in the above examples and the interests of the owners
(the shareholders), are described as the principal-agent problem or agency problem. The principal-agent problem is a conflict in
priorities between a principal, here the shareholders, and the agent authorized to act on their behalf, company employees and
especially leadership. An agent may act in a way that is contrary to the best interests of the principal.

The role of corporate governance is to identify and address possible conflicts of interest and possible principal-agent problems. This
could be achieved by providing clear guidance on how possible conflicts of interest need to be handled in the company's code of
conduct.

Generally, the basic principles of good corporate governance are as follows.

  · Accountability: The board must explain the purpose of a company's activities and the results of its conduct. Both board and
      company leadership are accountable for the assessment of a company's capacity, potential, and performance. It must commu-
      nicate issues of importance to shareholders.

  · Transparency: The board should provide timely, accurate, and clear information to all stakeholders.
  · Fairness: The board of directors must treat shareholders, employees, vendors, and communities fairly and with equal consid-

      eration.
  · Responsibility: The board is responsible for the oversight of corporate matters and management activities. It must be aware of

      and support the successful ongoing performance of the company. Part of its responsibility is to recruit and hire a CEO. It must
      act in the best interests of a company and its investors.
  · Risk management: The board and management must determine risks of all kinds to shareholders and other stakeholders. It
      must provide guidance on how best to control and mitigate risks. It must act on those recommendations to manage risks and
      inform all relevant parties about the existence and status of risks.

The benefits of good corporate governance include building trust with investors, the community, and public officials. Good corpo-
rate governance helps an organization to operate more efficiently, and it promotes the long-term financial viability of the organi-
zation. It helps organizations to respond to stakeholder concerns swiftly and effectively. It improves access to capital, improves a
company's reputation and reduces the risk of business ethics violations. Finally, good corporate governance safeguards against mis-
management and the potential for financial loss.

Bad corporate governance can have the opposite effect, eroding relationships and trust with both internal and external stakehold-
ers. This can damage a company's reputation, create legal, regulatory, or ethical scandals, reduce both employee and customer
retention, cause stock prices to fall, and ultimately eat away at a company's profitability.

Corporate governance, particularly the role of boards of directors, has long been critiqued for its relative ineffectiveness in safe-
guarding ethical business conduct and ensuring long-term value creation. Boards are meant to provide oversight, ensure account-
ability, and represent shareholders' interests, yet several inherent weaknesses often limit their effectiveness.

One primary critique is the problem of insufficient independence between board and firm. Many boards are composed of directors
with close personal or professional ties to the CEO or other executives, leading to conflicts of interest and a lack of genuine oversight.
This dynamic can result in management decisions being "rubber-stamped" rather than challenged, especially on ethical or contro-
versial issues. Another criticism is the lack of broad perspective in expertise, perspective, and background among board members,
which can narrow the scope of strategic discussions and blind boards to emerging risks, particularly around social, environmental,
and ethical concerns.

Additionally, the infrequency of meetings and the often-superficial nature of board deliberations can prevent directors from fully
understanding complex business operations and risks.

Ethical failures often stem from boards prioritizing short-term financial performance over long-term sustainability and ethical con-
siderations, pressured by shareholder expectations or executive incentives tied to stock performance. This can lead to a focus on
profit at the expense of social responsibility, environmental stewardship, or sound governance, undermining the board's fiduciary
duty to broader stakeholder groups.

Some of the most recent trends and hot topics in corporate governance are:

  · Board composition with a broad background
  · Executive compensation
  · Making ESG an imperative
  · Dealing with more conscientious consumers, with millennials and Gen-Z leading the change
290 | 10. FORMULATE SUSTAINABILITY AND ETHICS STRATEGY
  · Ensuring boards are a strategic asset
  · A focus on future-proofing companies in the face of disruptive change
  · Companies implementing new technologies like AI in a responsible way using robust and meaningful data governance poli-
      cies

CEO compensation and excessive retirement packages and severance agreements are issues in corporate America, where they are
sometimes called "golden handshakes." CEO-to-worker compensation has reached a multiple of around 350 in the U.S., a huge
increase from a ratio of around forty until the 1980s and much higher than ratios in other countries and regions of the world. Obvi-
ously, it is not possible to determine a perfect ratio and the appropriate compensation for senior executives, which is a very com-
plex, multifactor decision. The notion of self-serving executives is a criticism raised by stakeholders in the U.S. CEO compensation
is the result of supply and demand, and executive leaders bring unique competencies and experience into the equation. However,
excessive ratios have seen a lot of scrutiny in the governance pillar for assessing a company's ESG performance.

                     How does the company report on its ESG activities and ESG performance?

     Key Takeaways

     An organization's sustainability practices are typically analyzed against environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics. Sustain-
     ability has an environmental, social, and economic scope. In response to addressing sustainability challenges, almost all companies
     develop ESG strategy.
     A company must embed sustainability into the fabric of its business, corporate culture, and corporate strategy. A robust ESG strategy
     is the core of a company's sustainability strategy, which enables new business models to support sustainability goals, increases oper-
     ational efficiencies, complies with regulatory requirements, exposes innovation opportunities, and improves the customer experience
                                                                                             10. FORMULATE SUSTAINABILITY AND ETHICS STRATEGY | 291

     while creating competitive advantage. Success-critical areas of ESG include the design of transparent and resilient global supply chains
     that embed ethical and sustainable practices and that support a circular supply chain. Firms must embark on transparent and high-qual-
     ity legal and regulatory reporting that meets the demands of regulators and investors for financial-grade disclosure of ESG metrics. Firms
     engage with various stakeholders in the context of inclusive stakeholder management. Lastly and maybe most importantly, firms decar-
     bonize their production and operations to manage the transition to clean energy and to map out a clearly defined path to net-zero busi-
     ness operations.

10.8 Ethics Strategy

One positive outcome of corporate scandals has been an increased focus on business ethics by firms. Business ethics covers the
moral principles, policies, and values that govern the way companies and individuals engage in business activity. It is a form of
applied professional ethics that examines ethical principles and problems that can arise in a business environment. Business ethics
applies to all aspects of business conduct and is relevant to the conduct of individuals and entire organizations. At the minimum,
companies need to stay compliant with all applicable laws and regulations to avoid lawsuits and fines, and they must also avoid
violating regulation that will limit the business's freedom to act. Strategy development should always occur through acceptable
practices in the industry and in light of the firm's own code of ethics and compliance.

Corporate scandals:

  · Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme: Madoff was a former chairman of the NASDAQ stock exchange and ran an investment firm that
      promised consistently high returns. Instead of using real investment profits, he paid earlier investors with money from newer
      investors, which created the illusion of success. His scheme lasted from the '90s until its collapse in 2008, when the financial
      market downturn led to many clients withdrawing their money, exposing his fraud. Madoff's scheme is considered the largest
292 | 10. FORMULATE SUSTAINABILITY AND ETHICS STRATEGY

      financial fraud in history.
  · Volkswagen's Dieselgate: In 2015, Volkswagen was caught in a scandal for installing illegal software and defeat devices in mil-

      lions of diesel cars worldwide to cheat on their emissions tests. The software allowed the cars to pass emissions tests by tem-
      porarily lowering nitrogen oxide emissions to comply with regulations during testing. However, during regular driving, the
      cars emitted pollutants forty times greater than allowed, far exceeding legal limits. As a result, Volkswagen faced massive
      amounts of recalls, numerous legal actions, and fines, costing the company billions of dollars as well as severely damaging its
      reputation.
  · Purdue Pharma and the U.S. opioid crisis: A pharmaceutical company founded in 1892 played a significant role in the U.S. opi-
      oid crisis by aggressively marketing OxyContin as a safe painkiller with a low addiction risk, despite a lack of evidence. Purdue's
      misleading claims resulted in widespread overprescription, which led to many patients becoming dependent on the drug. As
      these addiction rates skyrocketed, OxyContin became extensively misused, meaning that Purdue Pharma played a huge role
      in the catastrophic opioid epidemic. The company then had to face numerous lawsuits, having to settle for over 4.5 billion dol-
      lars in 2021 and eventually filing for bankruptcy. The opioid crisis led to the overdose death of hundreds of thousands of vic-
      tims.
  · Boeing 737 Super Max airliner with two crashes: The Boeing 737 MAX was involved in two fatal crashes that resulted in 346 peo-
      ple losing their lives. These unfortunate crashes resulted from the malfunction in their Maneuvering Characteristics Augmen-
      tation System, which caused the planes' noses to be tilted down due to faulty sensor data. Investigations into the two flights
      exposed Boeing's design flaws and its lack of pilot training and regulatory management by the Federal Aviation Administra-
      tion. The 737 MAX fleet had to be grounded, and Boeing was met with countless lawsuits and reputational damage. The Boe-
      ing 737 MAX was able to be redeployed after software fixes and regulatory changes.
  · Two million fake Wells Fargo accounts: This scandal was centered on Wells Fargo employees developing over two million
      unauthorized bank and credit card accounts without consent from customers, driven by extreme sales pressure to meet unre-
      alistic quotas set by Wells Fargo Management. Customers were billed fees for these accounts, negatively affecting their credit
      scores and their wallets. Wells Fargo was ordered to pay $185 million and was subject to abundant lawsuits and investigations.
      Several Wells Fargo executives resigned, and the company was required to reform its unethical sales practices and corporate
      culture.
  · Theranos case: Elizabeth Holmes founded Theranos in 2003, claiming its technology could change blood testing forever by
      only requiring a couple drops of blood. The company raised over $700 million, reaching a $9 billion valuation. However, in
      2015, investigations showed that Theranos's device, Edison, was unreliable and that the company was really using commercial
      machines for their tests. This led to lawsuits, federal charges, and the downfall of Theranos. In 2022, Holmes was convicted of
      defrauding investors.

As firms move from "doing right" to "doing good" and endorse ESG and CSR strategies, then employees, managers, customers, and
other stakeholders take pride and satisfaction in the impact their company has on improving society. Further, as contemporary soci-
etal expectations have shifted toward companies embracing a responsibility beyond the profit motive, firms have witnessed new
opportunities to turn corporate values and ethical decision-making into a competitive advantage within their marketplace.

Today, corporate business ethics goes beyond compliance and is not solely a reactive approach. Business ethics is part of an orga-
nization's core values and corporate culture. Ethics is part of an organization's foundation, incorporated into the organization's
business-level strategy and embedded in its daily decision-making. Failure to balance stakeholder interests can result in failure to
maximize shareholders' wealth. A robust corporate ethics strategy becomes a source of competitive differentiation and a source of
sustainable competitive advantage.

10.9 Contemporary Questions of Corporate Ethics

Businesses need to embrace a robust system of data governance to manage data responsibly.

For new technologies, there is clearly a regulation lag. Regulators and lawmakers struggle to grasp the ethical implications of new
technologies, leading to a lack of regulation in this time of accelerating technology penetration.

At the same time, there is also an ethical lag that occurs when the speed of technological change far exceeds that of ethical devel-
opment.

Consequently, ethical technological leadership is critical for businesses, which includes an appropriate level of self-regulation. The
current business ethics "hot topic" is making responsible and ethical decisions as to what ethical principles will be programmed into
AI and applied to machine learning. While there is no perfect solution, companies need to develop robust technology strategies and
data governance strategies embedded in their ethics and CSR/ESG strategies.

Business Ethics in a Multi-Stakeholder Society and Shareholder Activism

Companies operate in an era of hyper-transparency and intensifying political and social disruptions. There are growing expecta-
tions from various stakeholders to support a more inclusive economy and sustainable environment. The U.S. has clearly moved
away from a business social contract where the shareholder is the most important stakeholder and guiding star for business. We
have moved away from a shareholder economy to an inclusive stakeholder economy. As a result, companies are reevaluating their
purpose in society. Business assumes broader responsibilities in relation to society and serves a wider range of human values than
ever before. Engagement with multiple stakeholders and the strategic management of public issues becomes critical not only for
financial success but often for the survival of companies.
                                                                                            10. FORMULATE SUSTAINABILITY AND ETHICS STRATEGY | 295

Another contemporary issue is the emergence and evolution of shareholder activism. Now, even smaller shareholders use their
rights to position topics on the agendas of CEOs and boards of directors that go beyond financial topics. Social and environmental
issues are aggressively pursued, and companies need appropriate strategies to interact with activist shareholders.

One example of shareholder activism illustrates the power that even smaller shareholders hold. Rio Tinto is world's second largest
metals and mining corporation. In May 2020, Rio Tinto detonated explosives at Juukan Gorge in Western Australia to expand an
iron ore mine. The destruction included two significant Aboriginal rock shelters that contained evidence of human occupation for
forty-six thousand years. As a result of opposition from activist shareholders, Rio Tinto's Chief Executive, Jean-Sébastien Jacques,
had to quit his position over this destruction of a sacred aboriginal site in Western Australia despite the fact that the destruction
was done with ministerial consent under Western Australia's cultural heritage protection laws.

Business Ethics in a Globalized World

Most U.S. multinational corporations operate in one of two ways internationally: sourcing from suppliers abroad or selling products
and services abroad. Being a global player adds several additional business ethics topics to the ethics agendas of companies. The
fundamental question for global players is which ethical norms should guide their business ethics policies when they are operating
in two (or more) different countries with different laws, different values, and different cultural norms.

In support of a global business ethics strategy, there is a clear global code of conduct in which companies must find an appropriate
middle ground between home and host country stakeholder expectations. For example, local laws set the minimum standard, such
as ensuring that a living wage is paid to employees abroad and that the working conditions are conducive to the work being done.
As stated in the ESG strategy, it is consensus now and the expectation of many stakeholders that U.S. companies have a responsi-
bility to monitor and maintain the working conditions in the factories of their suppliers abroad. The rights of workers in the global
value chain are a strong focus. These rights are related to issues of slave-free labor, appropriate and safe working conditions, equal
opportunities, nondiscrimination, a living wage, and other work-related rights.

Beyond employees in the value chain, companies also need to manage their impact on affected communities and the impact of
business operations on local economies. They must protect social and cultural rights and the civil and political rights of local popu-
lations, especially as they relate to the impact on indigenous people.

Finally, the rights of consumers and end users need to be protected regarding information, personal safety, social inclusion, and the
protection of personal data.

     Key Takeaways

     With emerging technologies like AI, big data, and automation, business ethics is rapidly changing. Companies need an active approach
     and need to assume ethical responsibility for the use of new technologies, with a focus on good data governance and transparency. Busi-
     nesses need a robust system of data governance to manage data responsibly. Operating in a globalized business world, human rights
     issues and social issues need to be addressed beyond the borders of the U.S. and the factory gates of U.S. companies. Contributing to
     fighting climate change becomes an opportunity in support of stakeholder loyalty and competitive differentiation but also an ethical
     obligation. Companies have the resources, the know-how, and the power to make a positive difference. With great power comes great
     responsibility.

10.10 Analyze Sustainability and Ethics Strategy

When you conduct a case analysis, you analyze a firm's sustainability and ethics strategy. This is step six in the case analysis process.

       6. As appropriate to the case, analyze strategies: Corporate-level, business-level, innovation, sustainability and ethics, technol­
       ogy, and multinational strategies.

           a. Use strategic management analytical frameworks to analyze, interpret, and evaluate strategies.
           b. Ensure line of sight and congruence within analysis of each strategy.

10.11 Why Sustainability and Ethics Strategy Is Important to Business
Graduates

Sustainability and ethics is a rather new area that is already a competency highly valued by employers. The majority of CEOs address
risks and opportunities of climate change in their business models. As a consequence, two-thirds of CEOs are looking to upskill or
reskill their workforce in the topic of sustainability, according to a 2023 global PwC survey of 4,700 CEOs. Sustainability does not
only impact the scope of skills expected in successful managers in all business and functional areas of a firm, it also has become a
hiring criterion. Seventy-one percent of business leaders intend to implement sustainability experience as a hiring criterion, accord-
ing to a 2023 IBM survey of more than three thousand business leaders. Having a sound understanding of business sustainability
gives you a head start in the application process and the corporate world, where sustainability expertise is becoming the backdrop
for managers in all areas of business. Lastly, sensitizing you to the importance of business ethics keeps you out of trouble and helps
you to embrace a moral compass aligned with business ethics to drive sustainable success in your career.

10.12 Conclusion

Businesses are operating in an increasingly volatile, global, and multi-stakeholder environment that is driven by continuous change
and disruption. To strategically position the business for success, organizations account for disruptive megatrends related to cli-
mate change, social justice, and technology that drive the strategic agendas of organizations.

Every organization's strategic canvas must include consideration of sustainability (and its resulting CSR and ESG strategies) as well
as business ethics strategy. Codes of conduct and various other business ethics practices improve companies' accountability to the
communities and society they serve. Globally, business activities have lowered poverty rates, but ethical issues remain. Balanc-
ing competing interests on many issues (such as offshoring, pollution, sustainability, and economic inequality) are a high priority.
Responsible AI and data governance strategies provide guidelines for how companies act ethically in the era of accelerating tech-
nology advancement.

The role of boards of directors in the corporate governance of organizations has become more important than ever, especially in
large publicly traded corporations. Wise boards work to manage the agency problem that creates a conflict of interest between top
managers, such as the CEO, and other groups with stakes in the firm.

11.1 Introduction

This chapter examines technology strategy. In the discussion, you learn what navigating technological disruption entails, including
the role of digital transformation and its impact as a megatrend on business and strategy as well as the role of Industry 4.0, the
Fourth Industrial Revolution. Next you learn the importance of new and emerging technologies and their strategic implications.
This includes big data and data analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning, cloud computing, Internet of Things,
blockchain technology, and quantum computing. Then you learn a framework that considers technology as a strategy or an enabler
of strategy. You learn that there are a few relevant intersections of technology and strategy, where technology can create value and
drive competitive differentiation. These areas of value and differentiation include data governance and the responsible use of AI,
implementation of Industry 4.0, technology-enabled new business models and enhanced customer experiences, technology as a
strategic resource, digital transformation, architecture, and the creation of an agile organization. Finally, you learn how to analyze
technology strategy.

11.2 Technology Strategy

Like all strategy formulation, formulating technology strategy answers the question "Where are we going?" All firms need to
address the role of technology and technology strategy.
Like innovation and sustainability and ethics, technology is another strategic focus that is formulated at the strategic business unit
level of a company and embedded in business-level strategy. As such, technology strategy also answers the "right to win" question
of how specifically a firm is going to win or compete in its chosen markets and market segments.
302 | 11. FORMULATE TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY
Like all strategy, technology strategy focuses on an outside-in perspective. Companies carefully monitor their external environ-
ments and analyze trends and formulate strategies that are forward-looking. Robust technology strategy considers the volatile,
uncertain, complex, and ambiguous nature of the firm's external environment.
This chapter analyzes how changes in the external environments of firms drive strategic responses and how companies formulate
technology strategy to create and sustain a competitive advantage.
Technology strategy uses digital technology to improve an organization's processes, operations, products, and services. Technology
strategy frames the "rewiring" of an organization, with the goal of creating value by continuously deploying technology at scale.

11.3 Navigate Technological Disruption

The previous chapter focused on sustainability and ethics strategy, providing a framework for how disruptive megatrends impact
strategy (in the form of new ESG strategy, for example).
This chapter introduces a second disruptive megatrend with significant impact on strategy, digital transformation, which involves
new and emerging technologies that impact both strategy formulation and strategy implementation. Digital transformation is the
process of using existing or new digital technologies to address evolving market conditions and customer expectations.
                                                                                                               11. FORMULATE TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY | 303
We are living in the era of technological disruption, and we are in the middle of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This rapidly evolv-
ing landscape of technology changes the way we work and the way we live. It also has significant implications on businesses, their
strategic positioning, and their ways of looking for technology-driven and technology-enabled opportunities of competitive differ-
entiation. Digital transformation changes how companies make strategic decisions and how companies operate and deliver value.
Digital transformation also drives strategic shifts that every firm needs to embed in its business-level strategy. Hence, developing
strategy in the age of technology requires a deep understanding of technological trends and their strategic impacts in a technology-
driven environment.
Figure 11.1 shows disruptive technologies.

                      Figure 11.1: Disruptive technologies
According to Boston Consulting Group's Transformation Benchmarking Survey, digitization and digital transformation are the main
drivers of companies evolving to survive the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This transformation needs to be driven by strategic con-
siderations and must be a part of the technology strategy embedded into the business-level strategy of a firm.
Some data points and examples that illustrate the acceleration of technology development:

  · In terms of new technologies, it took the telephone fifty years to reach fifty million users, the ATM eighteen years, the cell
      phone twelve years, and the internet seven years. It took Pokemon Go just nineteen days to reach fifty million users.

  · During the First Industrial Revolution, it took four hundred years for human knowledge to double. IBM states that we are cur-
      rently seeing a doubling of knowledge every twelve hours. We are living in the information age, and new technologies like
      the Internet of Things drive the trend of rapidly increasing knowledge, but they're also becoming obsolete quicker than ever
      before.

  · You all use AI every day, driverless cars are already operating on U.S. streets, and technology companies are powering the econ-
304 | 11. FORMULATE TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY
      omy, creating more than 50 percent of total market value growth across all sectors since 2015 (Bain & Company).

  · Ninety percent of the world's data has been created in the last two years. In 2022, more than one trillion objects were con-
      nected, and more than 90 percent of stock trading is now done by algorithms.

  · In a PwC study of 4,700 CEOs, 56 percent stated that technological change is the main factor that drives change in the way their
      companies create, deliver, and capture value.

  · When you apply for the job you will have after graduating from university, it will most likely be AI, not a personal recruitment
      specialist, that decides whether your application advances beyond the screening round in the application process.

These examples show that technology is a true game changer and that companies need to factor in a robust and holistic technology
strategy. Disruptive innovation is much more common than ever before.
Another concept that emphasizes the strategic implications of technological disruption is the fact that we are living in the era of the
Fourth Industrial Revolution. The First Industrial Revolution happened in the eighteenth century with the development of mechan-
ical production equipment that replaced human labor, leading to enormous increases in productivity. This was followed by the
Second Industrial Revolution with mass production and then the third, driven by the internet. The Fourth Industrial Revolution
does not replace the "hand" (manual labor) with machines as the first did, but it replaces the "head" with smart machines, which
is truly revolutionary and disruptive. The impact of this Fourth Industrial Revolution goes beyond economic impacts like produc-
tivity increases and mass production, also showing a significant social impact. Business is now embracing the concept of Industry
4.0, leveraging the rapid technological advancement that blurs the separation between the physical, digital, and biological worlds.
Industry 4.0 drives fundamental shifts in the global production and supply chain networks using smart technologies, automation,
robotics, AI, machine learning, and embedded connectivity.
Figure 11.2 shows the evolution from Industry 1.0 (or the First Industrial Revolution) to Industry 4.0 (the Fourth Industrial Revolu-
tion).

                  Figure 11.2: Evolution from Industry 1.0 to Industry 4.0

A practical example of a company navigating Industry 4.0 is BASF, the world's largest chemical company. While the chemical indus-
try is an old and traditional industry, BASF uses Industry 4.0 concepts to change the way that the company operates. BASF imple-
mented what it calls "smart manufacturing," stating, "We are increasing the effectiveness of our plants and the efficiency of our
                                                                                                               11. FORMULATE TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY | 305
production processes through the use of digital technologies and data. With mobile devices, we have access to relevant informa-
tion for our daily work. The tight integration of production and business processes allows us to make better and fast decisions"
(basf.com). BASF uses augmented reality and the Internet of Things (discussed in detail in section 11.4) to make the maintenance
and repair of their physical assets quicker and more productive.
The BASF example illustrates that new and emerging technologies are the game changer in Industry 4.0, showing significant
impact on strategy development and strategy implementation.
Figure 11.3 provides an overview of disruptive Industry 4.0 technologies that drive the digital transformation and that need to be
factored into the strategy process.

            Figure 11.3: Disruptive Industry 4.0 technologies
The remainder of this chapter explores the critical intersection of technology and strategic management, examining how emerging
technologies reshape business landscapes, competitive dynamics, and organizational capabilities.

       Application
            · Discuss three of the disruptive Industry 4.0 technologies in detail.
                     Describe your personal experience with these disruptive technologies.

     Key Takeaways

     A disruptive megatrend with significant impact on strategy is digital transformation, which involves new and emerging technologies
     that impact both strategy formulation and strategy implementation. We are living in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The First
     Industrial Revolution happened in the eighteenth century with the development of mechanical production equipment that replaced
     human labor and that led to enormous increases in productivity. This was followed by the Second Industrial Revolution with mass pro-

11.4 New and Emerging Technologies and Their Strategic Implications

New and emerging technologies are shaping strategy. The following technologies are game changers in the ongoing digital trans-
formation, and they have a significant impact on strategy. Their impact on business and the strategy process needs to be under-
stood, and the insight and opportunities made possible by technology need to be integrated and leveraged into a firm's technology
strategy, which is embedded in its business-level strategy.

Big Data and Data Analytics

Business has an abundance of data available that can be used and leveraged for strategic decision-making, including critical strate-
gic topics like market analysis, customer insights, and competitive intelligence. In the current digital age of data-driven decision-
making, the data has a high strategic importance. Data is a strategic asset that provides insights into customer preferences, market
trends, and operational efficiency. By collecting and analyzing vast amounts of data, companies can make informed, evidence-
based strategic decisions, optimize their processes, personalize customer experiences, and forecast future trends, thus shaping
their competitive advantage.

For example, many companies use data from rewards apps to analyze their customer preferences to tailor their promotions and rec-
ommendations to their individual users. In return, the apps offer value to customers, such as the convenience of quick and remote
ordering. Data analytics allows these firms to gain a better understanding of customer behavior and preferences. A few examples
of this include Starbucks, Waffle House, Taco Bell, and Kroger.

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

While AI is not necessarily a new technology (computational linguistics started in the 1950s), its full game-changing impact on busi-
ness has fully developed in recent years. AI, including generative AI, is used to automate processes, enhance decision-making, and
provide predictive insights into the strategy process. It is used and leveraged throughout the entire strategy process. These uses
include identifying complex market patterns and trends, strategically understanding past performance, forecasting future out-
comes, using scenario planning for strategy formulation and implementation, and formulating and evaluating strategic alterna-
tives. Advanced algorithms enhance strategic scenario analysis and optimize resource allocation. For example, Shell uses scenario
planning to prepare for various future energy landscapes, ensuring that its business model provides adaptable strategic responses
to a rapidly evolving external business environment.

Amazon uses artificial intelligence in its strategic management process to maintain its posi-  Figure 11.4: Amazon
tion as a leader in e-commerce and logistics. The company uses AI-driven algorithms to ana-
lyze vast amounts of customer behavior data, identifying complex market patterns and
trends, such as changes in purchasing habits during economic shifts. Predictive analytics
help Amazon forecast future demand for products in order to ensure inventory optimization
and resource allocation.

Together with AI, vastly large data sets, known as big data, can be used strategically to scan the external environment, identify
emerging technology, create a technology roadmap, and detect weak signals. It can be used to anticipate demand patterns and
consumer behavior, provide recommendations for optimal strategic decision-making, and support strategic planning in a dynamic
VUCA environment.

Kroger has been exploring ways in which AI can be used to
improve customer experience. In a Forbes interview, Kroger
Chief Data & Technology Officer Todd James explains, "We are
using AI-enabled dynamic batching to reduce Pickup lead time
while enhancing the store associate experience. Through the
power of machine learning and AI, we are developing new ways
to elevate the Pickup experience for customers."

Cloud Computing

Cloud computing enables on-demand access to computing              Figure 11.5: Kroger is an example of a company using AI to improve customer
resources, reduced infrastructure costs, and the flexible scaling  experience
of cloud solutions. This supports strategy by enabling faster
responses to customer needs, collaboration and knowledge
sharing, enhanced innovation, and faster execution of strategic
initiatives.

For example, Netflix uses cloud computing in order to flexibly scale its streaming services. When a new season of a very popular
show is released, the platform scales up its server capacity to handle increased viewer traffic in real time, ensuring uninterrupted
service.

Internet of Things (IoT)

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical objects that can connect and share data with other devices and systems over
the internet. IoT devices are also known as smart objects and can include common household items like fixtures and kitchen appli-
ances. According to Statista, the number of Internet of Things devices worldwide is forecasted to almost double from 15.9 billion in
2023 to more than 32.1 billion IoT devices in 2030. The Internet of Things is one of the drivers for the abundance of data that busi-
nesses can use in their strategy formulation. In strategy, the Internet of Things is used to improve operations, enhance the customer
experience, and improve service offerings. IoT-enabled businesses can use real-time data to make informed decisions, respond to
market shifts, and anticipate challenges.

For example, Siemens uses the Internet of Things in its factories to improve productivity and operational efficiency. John Deere uses
the Internet of Things to integrate their sensors on their agricultural equipment, allowing farmers to collect and analyze real-time
data on soil moisture, weather, and crop health. This data allows farmers to make data-driven decisions improving their yields and
overall operational efficiency.

Blockchain Technology

The blockchain offers a decentralized and secure way to record transactions. Its implications for strategy include enhanced trans-
parency, reduced fraud, and the possibility of new business models.

IBM uses blockchain in supply chain management to create secure transaction mechanisms and to improve transparency and trace-
ability. Another example is international shipping and logistics giant, Maersk. Maersk uses blockchain in global shipping to create
an end-to-end transparent supply chain tracking system with higher levels of visibility, a reduced administrative overhead, and an
enhanced compliance tracking across complex global logistics networks.
                                                                                                               11. FORMULATE TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY | 309
Blockchain technology also allows for supply chain transparency. IBM uses blockchain to enable their supply chain partners to share
trusted data through permissioned blockchain solutions. This approach provides end-to-end visibility that allows businesses and
consumers to verify product authenticity and responsible sourcing, in return gaining trust from customers across the supply chain.

Quantum Computing

Quantum computing promises unprecedented computational power. The applications for quantum computing are primarily cen-
tered around speed. Quantum computing allows for the processing of vast amounts of datasets and complex calculations at
extremely high speeds that are unattainable by normal computers. While this is not yet a market-ready technology, businesses
need to monitor its development closely and possibly use first-mover advantages in this area as a possible source of a sustainable
competitive advantage.
Quantum computing also allows for advantages in securing sensitive government communications and protecting financial trans-
actions and personal data.

11.5 Framework: Technology as a Strategy or an Enabler of Strategy

Technology can be either a strategy or an enabler of strategy.

Technology strategies co-evolve along with the emergence of new technology systems. New technology systems such as printed
electronics and fiber optics, are rapidly emerging at the interfaces of unrelated technology areas. Therefore, new technology sys-
tems, result from the convergence of these distinct yet now intersecting technology systems. When formulating a robust and value-
adding technology strategy, firms need to integrate new and existing technologies into a coherent strategy. Firms are dealing with
unrelated knowledge rooted in different technologies and must decide how systemic (complete technology system) or focused (sin-
gle component of the technology system) their engagement in technology development in the converging technology system is
going to be. Companies also must decide strategically the extent to which to develop specialized or design knowledge. From a sys-
tems perspective, technology strategy can be considered from the perspective of the scope (focused vs. systemic engagement with
the technology system) and type of technological knowledge (specialized or design knowledge) (Wambsganss, et al., 2023).

A firm's technology strategy must directly support and enable the firm's broader strategic objectives. Technology needs to create
value and drive competitive differentiation, and technology strategy needs to address this. Technological investments in a firm's
resources, capabilities, and core competencies need to align with the firm's mission, purpose, vision, and values, and the invest-
ments must directly enhance the firm's technology strategy. In this sense, technology strategy is a success-critical strategy.

As an enabler of strategy, the more extensive the adoption of new digital technology, the larger the change in strategy (Van Zee-
broeck, Kretschmer, & Bughin, 2023).

When firms approach technology as an enabler of strategy, technology is not the primary focus of strategy. In this case, technology
is neither the starting point nor the solution for a firm's strategy. Taking the approach of technology as an enabler of other strate-
                                                                                                                11. FORMULATE TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY | 311

gies, a firm first must define strategic opportunities and threats that arise from its external environment; then it defines the strate-
gic strengths and weaknesses that result from internal resources, capabilities, and competencies. Then the firm needs to analyze
how new and emerging technologies can position the company to take advantage of its opportunities and mitigate its threats by
enhancing its strengths and bolstering its weaknesses.

As an enabler of strategy, technology needs to be closely aligned with strategy, and the firm's approach to technology must be
derived from the firm's other strategies and embedded in them, directly supporting the firm's broader strategic objectives. Tech-
nology needs to create value and drive competitive differentiation while aligning with the firm's mission and other strategies. Here,
technology is a success-critical strategy enabler but not the starting point of strategy.

While there is no "one size fits all" approach to integrating technology into a firm's other strategies, the following are a few relevant
intersections where technology and strategy interface and where technology can create value and drive competitive differentiation.

Data Governance and Responsible Use of AI

While the use of technology provides unprecedented business opportunities, every company also must address the risks and
threats that accompany the use of new technologies. The abundance of available data about customers can cause issues related to
privacy rights. Data breaches in an increasingly digital world pose a significant risk both to customers and the firm. Cybersecurity is
not just a technical concern but a strategic business concern because of the threats to brand reputation and financial stability when
data is breached. A robust cybersecurity strategy helps organizations build trust with customers and other stakeholders, protect
critical assets, and ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

It is also important that companies establish robust data governance strategies and policies. Transparent AI development and use
are critical. As AI becomes more advanced and integrated into various business processes, it raises ethical concerns around fairness,
accountability, transparency, and privacy. Responsible AI development and deployment should prioritize the principles of fairness
(avoiding bias), accountability (ensuring explainability), and privacy (protecting user data). Companies must implement ethical
technology governance and comprehensive data governance with compliance mechanisms that consider the social implications
of technological implementation in business. It is also important that companies implement risk management strategies for tech-
nologies that they use.

Boston Consulting Group identifies the following responsible AI principles that companies need to embrace and cover in their AI
and technology strategy:

  · Accountability
  · Fairness and equity
  · Data and privacy governance
  · Social and environmental impact
  · Safety, security, and robustness
  · Transparency and explainability

Implementation of Industry 4.0

The implementation of Industry 4.0 principles presents tremendous strategic opportunities for companies. Using Industry 4.0 tech-
nologies can drive operational efficiency and increase productivity. Embedding sophisticated sensors in machinery to monitor the
health of production assets enables preventive maintenance and significantly reduces operational downtime (predictive mainte-
nance). Automation and robotics reduce labor costs and increase productivity. For firms, it is critical to understand the implications
of automation and robotics. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics and consulting firm McKinsey, up to 40 percent of cur-
rent jobs will disappear by 2030. Companies need to understand the transformation of industries and business models, declining
312 | 11. FORMULATE TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY

and growing job families, and the new skill sets and new ways to organize work that are necessary. Against common belief, automa-
tion and robotics are not issues that only affect unskilled work. There are well-qualified job categories that are impacted by the
potential to automate work.

Technology-Enabled New Business Models and Enhanced Customer Experience

Technologies enable disruptive and enhanced business models. For example, technology is at the core of how Uber disrupted
the taxi market and how Airbnb disrupted the hotel market. E-commerce and platform-based business solutions provide new
approaches to meeting and exceeding customer needs. Microsoft's shift to cloud computing with Azure has transformed its busi-
ness model and revenue streams significantly. The same is true for Amazon Web Services (AWS), which currently generate more net
profit than the traditional Amazon e-commerce business.

Amazon also uses AI to enhance its recommendation algorithms, improving customer satisfaction and increasing sales. Hence,
there are a variety of opportunities for using technology like AI to enhance customer experience and customer engagement in sup-
port of gaining a sustainable competitive advantage.

Another example of using new technologies to enhance customer experience is Netflix's use of data analytics to monitor viewer
preferences and optimize content production. In the finance industry, Goldman Sachs uses sophisticated algorithmic AI approaches
and machine learning for their risk assessment, automated trading strategies, and personalized investment recommendations.

Technology as a Strategic Resource

As you now know, strategy is the quest to create a sustainable competitive advantage. Any firm that can use technology as a means
of competitive differentiation has a strategic resource that they may capitalize upon to build strategic capabilities and turn them
into core competencies that meet all criteria of a VRIO analysis (valuable, rare, inimitable, and organized to capture value). Firms
that use technology to gain technological differentiation, technology-enabled innovation, and product development are especially
well positioned for success.

Digital Transformation Framework and Architecture

As you now know, it is critical that a firm has resources, capabilities, and core competencies that can provide a sustainable com-
petitive advantage. The technologies reviewed here are potential candidates for these strategic resources. Every company needs to
invest in digital transformation to enable the use of technology as a competitive advantage. This digital transformation investment
includes talent and capability development with the upskilling and reskilling of employees, treating knowledge workers as a strate-
gic resource, and investing in the technological infrastructure. Creating AI and technology literacy throughout the whole organiza-
tion through workforce development becomes a strategic differentiator, making human resources a critical factor. The firm needs
to develop a comprehensive roadmap for digital capabilities and create a flexible corporate infrastructure that supports rapid tech-
nological adaptation and the ability to design and scale technology in support of profitable growth.

Creating an Agile Organization

In times of continuous technological disruptions, traditional organizational structures with hierarchical levels and functional and
organizational silos are no longer appropriate. Companies must design organizational structures and key processes in support of
technological and strategic business agility. This allows organizations to respond swiftly to a quickly evolving and changing envi-
ronment that is characterized by disruptive and continuous change. Companies need to build agile paradigms into their strategies
and organizational capabilities. This includes the ability to continuously adapt strategy. The former approach of developing strat-
                                                                                                                11. FORMULATE TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY | 313
egy and then just focusing on implementation for the next five to ten years is no longer a successful approach to strategy. It is a
strategic imperative for successful organizations to employ continuous strategy adoption mechanisms backed up by real-time per-
formance management.

       Application
            · Research a company that focuses on technology.
                     Describe the company's technology strategy.
            · Research a company that uses technology to accomplish its mission.
                     Describe how the company uses technology as an enabler of other strategy.
            · Discuss the differences between technology as a strategy and as an enabler of strategy.

     Key Takeaways

     Technology can be either a strategy or an enabler of strategy. As a strategy, one focus is on how technology strategies co-evolve along
     with the emergence of new technology systems. As an enabler of strategy, the more extensive the adoption of new digital technology,
     the larger the change in strategy. A few relevant intersections where technology and strategy interface and where technology can create
     value and drive competitive differentiation include data governance and the responsible use of AI, implementation of Industry 4.0, tech-
     nology-enabled new business models and enhanced customer experience, technology as a strategic resource, digital transformation
     framework and architecture, and the creation of an agile organization.

11.6 Analyze Technology Strategy

When you conduct a case analysis, you analyze a firm's technology strategy. This is step six in the case analysis process.

       6. As appropriate to the case, analyze strategies: Corporate-level, business-level, innovation, sustainability and ethics, technol­
       ogy, and multinational strategies.

           a. Use strategic management analytical frameworks to analyze, interpret, and evaluate strategies.
           b. Ensure line of sight and congruence within analysis of each strategy.

11.7 Why Technology Strategy Is Important to Business Graduates

As you now see, technology strategy may be both a strategy and an enabler of strategy. As a recent business graduate starting as
a business support unit manager in support business units in a large company (such as an accounting manager), you are directly
impacted by all uses of technology. You may also be asked to support strategic business managers in formulating technology strat-
egy (such as data governance, the responsible use of AI, or how to use Industry 4.0 technologies to drive operational efficiency and
increase productivity).
Business graduates that enter either internal or external consulting roles require a high level of competence with technology strat-
egy to communicate with business executives how their consulting projects fit into the overall technology strategy of the firm. For
example, you may be asked to consult on how to create an more agile organizational culture to capitalize quickly on new and emerg-
ing technologies. For business graduates who are or will become entrepreneurs, fluency with technology strategy is essential to
establishing and growing a successful firm. How will you invest in digital transformation to enable the use of technology as a com-
petitive advantage?

11.8 Conclusion

In the current era of technological disruption and digital transformation, technology and strategy are closely linked and intercon-
nected. Technology is crucial in building competitive, agile, and resilient organizations. It is integral to strategic success by allowing
companies to leverage data analytics and compete more effectively. Technology is shaping business strategy by driving competitive
differentiation, enabling innovative and disruptive business models, opening new markets, improving efficiency and productivity,
and fundamentally changing the way businesses operate. It is important to align technology with core business objectives, focus-
ing on customer needs, fostering innovation, and ensuring security. With the strategic opportunities that new technologies present,
companies also need to address possible risks through robust data governance, cybersecurity strategies, and policies regarding the
responsible use of AI. Emerging technologies such as quantum computing will continue to shape strategy. Companies must con-
tinuously balance and evaluate opportunities and risks, making it essential for companies to stay vigilant, adaptable, and forward-
looking in their strategic approach to technology as a driver of long-term success.

12.1 Introduction

You have learned about the innovation, sustainability and ethics, and technology strategies embedded in business-level strategy at
the strategic business unit level of a firm. Successful companies address each of these areas.
In this chapter, you learn about the next embedded strategy: multinational strategy. This involves a review of the history of global
commerce. You learn the motivations and risks associated with choosing a multinational strategy. Next you learn key theories of
multinational business. Then you learn a framework for analyzing the attractiveness of foreign markets, the CAGE distance frame-
work, which assesses foreign markets along four dimensions: cultural, administrative, geographical, and economic. The chapter
explains how to use the CAGE distance framework analysis instrument to analyze the attractiveness of proposed foreign markets.
Next you learn a framework for types of multinational strategy, the integration-responsiveness framework. This framework ana-
lyzes multinational strategy along two dimensions, whether the strategy is responsive to global integration pressures and whether
the strategy is responsive to local pressures. An international strategy combines a low responsiveness to global integration pres-
sures with a low responsiveness to local preferences. A multidomestic strategy combines a low responsiveness to global integration
pressures with a high responsiveness to local preferences. A global strategy combines a high responsiveness to global integration
pressures with a low responsiveness to local preferences. A transnational strategy combines a high responsiveness to global inte-

Then you learn about a firm's choices when entering foreign markets, as well as issues and strategies related to exporting, licensing
and franchising, joint ventures, strategic alliances, wholly owned subsidiaries, and foreign direct investment. Finally, you learn how
to analyze multinational strategy when you conduct a case analysis.

12.2 Multinational Strategy

Like all strategy formulation, multinational strategy answers the question "Where are we going?" Multinational strategy addresses
where a firm is going as it relates specifically to its commerce in foreign markets.

Like innovation, sustainability and ethics, and technology strategy, multinational strategy is formulated at the strategic business
unit level of a company and embedded in business-level strategy. It addresses how a firm is going to win or compete in its chosen
markets and market segments.

A multinational corporation (MNC) is a firm that has operations in more than one country. Not all companies compete internation-
ally. Multinational corporations formulate multinational strategy. Mutinational strategy focuses on the ways multinational corpo-
rations compete in global markets.

Like all strategy, multinational strategy focuses on an outside-in perspective. Companies carefully monitor their external environ-
ments, analyze trends, and formulate strategies that are forward-looking. Robust multinational strategy considers the volatile,
uncertain, complex, and ambiguous nature of the firm's external environment.

Multinational strategy is a critical component of a company's strategy. Multinational strategy focuses on expanding operations
beyond domestic markets to drive profitable growth and manage risks effectively. This approach involves strategic decision-making
about how best to enter and compete in foreign markets, whether and to what degree to adapt products or services to local con-
sumer preferences and cost pressures, and how to manage multinational risks and secure competitive advantage on a global scale.
By pursuing multinational strategy, companies can tap into larger consumer bases; distribute risk across diverse industries, mar-
kets, market segments, and businesses; enhance operational efficiencies; and leverage global resources, capabilities, and core com-
petencies. As part of a broader business-level strategy, multinational expansion enables firms to achieve scale, optimize resource
allocation, and capitalize on new growth opportunities, all while bolstering their resilience in an increasingly interconnected mar-
ketplace.

12.3 The History of Global Commerce

The evolution of multinational strategy has followed significant historical events that shaped global commerce. The Silk Road facil-
itated early trade between Asia and Europe. Prior to European contact, many indigenous nations, such as First Nations in the Amer-
icas, had elaborate federations and complex trade agreements (Blackhawk, 2023). Colonialization has rightly come under serious
critical scrutiny for its impacts on indigenous populations. European colonial expansions of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
laid the groundwork for modern multinational trade. In the twentieth century, multilateral institutions like the World Trade Orga-
nization (WTO) and economic blocs such as the European Union played pivotal roles in reducing trade barriers and promoting cross-
border trade. Trade agreements, such as the North America Trade Agreement, support trade between countries, while trade tariffs,
such as those between the U.S. and China, can discourage or limit commerce across borders.

Today, technological advancements, improved communication, and the rise of free trade agreements have created a more inter-
connected global economy, offering companies diverse opportunities for strategic multinational expansion and the ability for some
companies to be "born global" at their founding. Globalization provides companies with unprecedented strategic opportunities,
including access to new industries, markets, market segments, and businesses. Multinational firms gain economies of scale and the
advantage of being able to source talent globally.

However, globalization also poses challenges that require careful planning. Multinational businesses must manage cultural differ-
ences, mitigate political risks, and handle the complexities of global supply chains. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the vulnera-
bilities of international supply chains, but it also underscored the importance of agility and innovation in multinational strategy,
which must be able to adapt quickly to changing circumstances.

One example of successful international strategy is the German mobility startup Tier Mobility. Originally focused on micromobility
solutions in its home market, Tier expanded its operations across Europe, capitalizing on the increasing demand for sustainable
urban transport solutions. By 2023, Tier had expanded into new cities such as Oslo and Rome, offering electric scooters and bicycles.
Tier's multinational strategy involved building strong relationships with local municipalities and tailoring its offerings to fit specific
urban needs, including adapting to different regulatory environments. This tailored approach helped Tier successfully navigate the
complexities of international expansion, grow its brand, and enhance city partnerships for sustainable transportation solutions.

Another recent example is the case of Swedish oat milk producer Oatly. Oatly strategically expanded from Europe into North Amer-
ica, recognizing a shift in consumer preferences toward plant-based dairy alternatives. The company's multinational strategy is
built on its ability to convey a clear message about sustainability, climate change, and healthy lifestyle choices. By focusing on these
attributes and partnering with notable coffee chains such as Starbucks, Oatly expanded its market presence in the United States
and Canada. By 2023, Oatly had not only increased its market share but had also successfully navigated distribution challenges by
320 | 12. FORMULATE MULTINATIONAL STRATEGY
setting up local manufacturing facilities and minimizing the logistical issues and tariffs that often arise with international ship-
ments.
These examples illustrate the importance of understanding local market dynamics, aligning products with consumer trends, and
forming strategic partnerships as part of an effective multinational strategy. Success lies in being agile and building robust relation-
ships, which are key factors for any company aiming to thrive on the international stage.

     Key Takeaways

     The evolution of multinational strategy has followed significant historical events that shaped global commerce, beginning with the Silk
     Road that facilitated early trade between Asia and Europe and the elaborate federations and complex trade agreements of many indige-
     nous nations prior to European contact. Today's trade agreements support trade between countries, and trade tariffs can discourage or
     limit commerce across borders.

12.4 Motivations and Risks when Choosing a Multinational Strategy

Companies that choose a multinational strategy share common motivations and also share similar risks.

Motivations for Choosing a Multinational Strategy

Companies pursuing international expansion are often driven by multiple motivations, each tied to enhancing competitiveness,
increasing profitability, and positioning themselves strategically within the global market. However, going global comes with its
share of complexities and challenges. This section delves into both the motivations behind international expansion and the draw-
backs companies face when they decide to operate globally.

Market Seeking

One of the foremost motivations for international expansion is market seeking. Companies often look to expand into new geo-
graphic areas to find additional customers, especially when their domestic market is either saturated or shows limited growth
potential. By tapping into larger or faster-growing international markets, businesses can significantly increase their revenue
streams. For instance, French electric vehicle manufacturer Hopium expanded into the North American market in 2023 to capture
the growing demand for electric vehicles in the United States, spurred by favorable government policies and shifting consumer
preferences toward green technologies. By gaining a foothold in a lucrative and evolving market, companies like Hopium aim to
build stronger brands and secure their shares of new revenue opportunities.

An important driver of finding more robust growth opportunities abroad is the emergence of middle classes in developing coun-
tries. Strong population growth in developing countries and emerging middle classes provide untapped growth opportunities that
haven't been present in the past, when only a small percentage of the population had enough buying power to purchase consumer
products from U.S. global players. For example, in the past, the majority of Indian consumers used bar soap to wash their hair and
laundry. Now, hundreds of millions of consumers in India's emerging middle class have the buying power to buy hair shampoo and
laundry detergent, which represents huge market opportunities for companies like the U.S. consumer giant Procter & Gamble or
Dutch/British consumer giant Unilever. Emerging countries like China, Brazil, India, and Russia have now become growth engines
for U.S. companies, and the former BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) have now become BRIC+ with the addition of coun-
tries like Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates.

Resource Seeking

Another major driver for international expansion is resource seeking, which involves accessing cheaper or higher-quality inputs for
production. Businesses, particularly those in manufacturing or industries dependent on natural resources, expand internationally
to secure better access to raw materials or labor. Finnish renewable energy company Neste, for example, moved into the Asia-Pacific
region in 2022 to secure sustainable feedstocks for renewable diesel production. By situating closer to essential resource bases,
Neste aimed to reduce logistical costs and ensure a consistent supply, providing a competitive edge in the renewable energy mar-
ket.

Efficiency Seeking

Efficiency seeking is also a core motivation for internationalization, where companies expand to improve their operational effi-
ciency and profitability. This typically involves leveraging economies of scale or shifting certain operations to regions where costs
are lower.
322 | 12. FORMULATE MULTINATIONAL STRATEGY

Asset Seeking

Strategic asset seeking is another important motivator, driving companies to pursue international expansion to acquire knowledge,
technology, or unique resources, capabilities, and core competencies that are critical for growth. This often involves forming part-
nerships or acquiring firms with advanced technological assets or market expertise. South Korean conglomerate SK Group, for
example, expanded into the U.S. market by acquiring stakes in American battery technology firms, positioning itself favorably
within the growing electric vehicle industry. By accessing cutting-edge battery technology through strategic partnerships, SK Group
aimed to secure its place at the forefront of a rapidly changing market.

While international expansion offers opportunities for market growth, access to resources, operational efficiencies, and strategic
assets, it also involves significant risks that require careful planning and strategic management to avoid and mitigate.

Risks of Choosing a Multinational Strategy

Companies must weigh the potential benefits of choosing a multinational strategy against the potential challenges, such as com-
plex regulations, economic instability, supply chain vulnerabilities, cultural differences, and the need for brand consistency. A
successful multinational strategy involves not only leveraging the motivations that drive expansion but also anticipating the chal-
lenges that come with entering diverse global markets.

Expanding internationally brings a variety of risks that companies must understand and mitigate to ensure success. While inter-
national markets offer opportunities for growth, cost savings, and strategic positioning, they also expose businesses to diverse and
often unpredictable risks. Some of the risks that accompany international business operations include political risk, economic risk,
operational risk, cultural risk, legal and regulatory risk, competitive risk, financial risk, and reputational risks.

Political Risk

One of the most prominent international risks is political risk, which arises from the uncertainty of government actions in foreign
countries. Political risk can include sudden changes in government policies, the nationalization of industries, civil unrest, or unex-
pected changes in trade regulations. These factors can significantly affect a company's ability to operate effectively. For instance,
in 2022, dozens of Western companies faced difficulties in Russia due to increased government scrutiny and economic sanctions,
leading some to halt operations or exit the market entirely. Such political dynamics can disrupt operations and create unexpected
costs, making it critical for companies to assess the political climate before investing heavily in a foreign market.

Economic Risk

Economic risk is another significant consideration for companies operating internationally. Exchange rate fluctuations can have a
major impact on profitability, especially when earnings from foreign operations need to be repatriated. Sudden currency devalua-
tions can erode profit margins, while currency appreciation in a company's home country can make its exports less competitive. The
recent volatility in the Turkish lira, for instance, has had a profound impact on foreign businesses operating in Türkiye, leading to
increased costs and challenges in managing price stability. Additionally, inflation rates, interest rates, and overall economic stabil-
ity in the target market can affect consumer purchasing power and the overall business environment.

Operational Risk

Operational risk also plays a significant role in international expansion. These risks include logistical challenges, supply chain vul-
nerabilities, and difficulties in maintaining consistent quality standards across borders. Global supply chains are vulnerable to vari-
ous disruptions, such as natural disasters, strikes, or changes in trade agreements. The COVID-19 pandemic exemplified the impact
of such disruptions, with companies experiencing significant delays and increased costs as global supply chains were interrupted.
                                                                                                            12. FORMULATE MULTINATIONAL STRATEGY | 323

Companies need to build resilient supply chains by diversifying suppliers and creating contingency plans to mitigate these opera-
tional risks. Firms must also acknowledge that managing and coordinating international businesses in various countries increases
costs and the complexity of a business.

Cultural Risk

Cultural risk is another aspect that can directly affect the success of an international strategy. Differences in consumer behavior, lan-
guage, business practices, and societal values require careful consideration. Failure to understand these cultural dynamics can lead
to marketing blunders, poor customer engagement, or even reputational damage. For instance, some fast-food companies have
faced backlash in certain regions when their advertising or product offerings did not align with local cultural norms and expecta-
tions, such as promoting beef products in predominantly vegetarian countries or using advertising themes that conflict with local
values. Another example is Walmart's failed market entry into the German retail market. Walmart almost lost a billion dollars as
a result of not fully understanding very different German consumer shopping habits. These missteps highlight the importance of
tailoring products and messaging to resonate with diverse cultural contexts, ensuring a more successful international strategy. Suc-
cessfully mitigating cultural risks requires in-depth market research, cultural sensitivity training, and often local talent who can
provide valuable insights into consumer preferences and behaviors.

Legal and Regulatory Risk

Legal and regulatory risk also poses a challenge when operating in multiple jurisdictions. Each country has its own set of laws and
regulations related to labor, environmental standards, taxation, and data privacy, which can be complex and costly to navigate.
Companies need to comply with these laws and regulations to avoid fines, legal disputes, and reputational harm. For instance, the
European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has strict requirements regarding the collection, use, and storage of
consumer data, impacting how companies do business in Europe. Legal compliance is a matter of not only adhering to laws but also
ensuring that operations align with evolving regulatory landscapes across different markets. Another risk is the difficulty of pro-
tecting intellectual property in some countries, especially when the company enters a partnership, like a joint venture, with local
partners. Lastly, tariffs and other trade barriers may change, leading to a loss of profit and market access.

Competitive Risk

Competitive risk arises from the uncertainty of entering new markets where existing players may have a substantial advantage.
Local competitors often have a deeper understanding of the market, established customer relationships, and more agile responses
to changes in the local environment. This can create challenges for new entrants who are still learning to navigate the complexities
of a foreign market. For instance, many Western e-commerce companies have struggled to compete in China, where local giants
like Alibaba and JD.com dominate the market through their local brand image, extensive logistics networks, and consumer loyalty
programs.

Financial Risk

Financial risk is another crucial factor to consider, especially when dealing with markets that have limited access to financing or
higher capital costs. Businesses may face challenges in accessing affordable funding to support their international operations, or
they may encounter higher interest rates, making investments more costly. Moreover, inconsistent cash flows due to delayed pay-
ments from international customers can pose liquidity challenges. Companies expanding into emerging markets must particularly
assess the financial stability of the market and the availability of credit to ensure they can effectively fund their operations.
324 | 12. FORMULATE MULTINATIONAL STRATEGY

Reputational Risk

Lastly, reputational risk can arise from operating in multiple regions, where different standards and expectations may lead to per-
ceptions of unfair practices. International businesses are increasingly scrutinized for their impact on the environment, working con-
ditions, and the ethics of their business practices. A misstep in any of these areas can lead to significant backlash and harm to a
company's global reputation. For example, clothing brands have faced criticism for poor working conditions in overseas factories,
leading to protests, boycotts, and long-term damage to their brand images. As a response to this risk, many companies implement
robust environmental, social, and governance strategies that are covered in greater detail in section 10.7.
The risks of operating internationally are interrelated. For example, Nestle has faced economic, cultural, and reputational risks
from claims of selling substandard products in low-income countries like India due to rising costs in their supply chain. Nestle has
also been slow to respond to consumer preferences for more sustainable packaging. They are now addressing their packaging and
receiving a positive consumer response.

     Seeking new markets, resources, efficiencies, and assets are among the motivations for companies to pursue multinational expansion.
     All are aimed at enhancing competitiveness, increasing profitability, and positioning the firm strategically within the global market.
     However, going global comes with its share of complexities and challenges. Some of the risks that accompany international business
     operations include political risks, economic risks, operational risks, cultural risks, legal and regulatory risks, competitive risks, financial
     risks, and reputational risks. Successful international expansion involves not just seizing opportunities but also anticipating and address-
     ing the potential risks that come with operating in diverse and dynamic environments.

12.5 Theories of Multinational Business

Theories exploring multinational business provide essential insights into why companies expand across borders, how they select
foreign markets, and the strategies they employ for success. These theories help shape the decisions that businesses make as they
navigate the complexities of international markets.

Comparative Advantage Theory

Comparative advantage theory (Ricardo, 2004a; Ricardo, 2004b) is one of the oldest and most fundamental theories that explains
international trade and business. The theory posits that countries should specialize in the production of goods where they have a
lower opportunity cost relative to other nations. This specialization allows countries to benefit from trade by producing what they
326 | 12. FORMULATE MULTINATIONAL STRATEGY

make most efficiently and trading for what they are less efficient at making. This theory has formed the basis of modern trade poli-
cies, explaining why nations and businesses trade in goods and services that maximize their efficiency and productivity. For compa-
nies, understanding comparative advantage is crucial when deciding which products or services to produce domestically and which
to outsource or import, thereby allowing them to optimize costs and competitiveness. For example, Brazil specializes in coffee due
to its climate and the U.S. in machinery due to its advanced technologies. By trading, both benefit in terms of efficiency and cost
savings.

OLI Paradigm

The OLI paradigm, also known as the eclectic paradigm (Dunning, 1977), is a comprehensive framework that explains why firms
choose to engage in foreign direct investment (FDI) rather than licensing or exporting. OLI stands for ownership, location, and inter-
nalization. Ownership advantages refer to unique resources, capabilities, and core competencies that a company possesses, such
as technology, brand reputation, or proprietary knowledge, which give it a competitive edge in foreign markets. A firm's resources,
capabilities, and core competencies are analyzed using a VRIO framework, a tool that helps evaluate the "ownership" element of the
OLI paradigm. Location advantages pertain to the attractiveness of a foreign market, which may include lower labor costs, favorable
regulations, or access to natural resources. Internalization advantages focus on the benefits of maintaining control over operations
rather than licensing out technology or the brand. The OLI paradigm thus offers a holistic perspective on why firms decide to estab-
lish a physical presence in foreign markets, helping guide decisions on selecting the most appropriate multinational strategy.

Uppsala Model

The Uppsala model of internationalization (Johanson & Vahlne, 2017) provides a gradual, staged approach to multinational expan-
sion. Developed by Swedish researchers, this model suggests that companies begin by entering markets that are culturally and geo-
graphically close to their home countries, thereby reducing the uncertainties and risks associated with foreign markets. As firms
gain experience and learn from their initial ventures, they expand into markets that are more distant and dissimilar. The Uppsala
model emphasizes learning and experiential knowledge, suggesting that firms develop their multinational strategy incrementally,
based on the level of knowledge they accumulate over time. It explains the cautious approach often seen in international business,
where companies prefer to move step-by-step, increasing their market commitment progressively as they become more confident
in their understanding of foreign environments. The CAGE framework discussed in section 12.6 is a useful tool that assesses the cul-
tural (C) and geographical (G) distance between the home country and target foreign markets; it also assesses the administrative
(A) and the economic (E) distance.

Porter's Diamond Model of National Competitive Advantage

Porter's Diamond Model of National Competitive Advantage (O'Connell, Clancy, & van Egeraat, 1999; Porter, 1991; van den Bosch,
van Prooijen, & Porter, 1992) provides an explanation for why certain industries within specific countries are more internationally
competitive than others. Michael Porter identified four key factors that provide a competitive advantage for one national economy
or business over another. These factors interact to create favorable environments that support the development of competitive
industries in international markets. These same factors also influence whether a firm chooses a cost leadership or differentiation
business-level strategy. This demonstrates the interconnectedness of business-level strategies and the strategies embedded into
them.

The focus of Porter's Diamond Model is on the industry. The ability of the firms in an industry to be successful in global business is
shaped by four factors: (1) factors of production, (2) consumer demand, (3) strategy, structure, and rivalry, and (4) related and sup-
porting industries.
                       12. FORMULATE MULTINATIONAL STRATEGY | 327

Factors of Production

Factors of production refers to the nature of the resources that firms need to create goods and services in an industry in their home
country. Examples include labor, capital markets, and land. Businesses with good access to factors of production are more likely to
be successful, and they face challenges when they lack this access. Understanding the factors of production an industry needs and
has access to in the home country allows a company to assess the factors of production in foreign markets and make strategic deci-
sions about potential global markets to consider for expansion. For example, India has a large, educated workforce with a high level
of English proficiency. When a company understands that the industry needs a workforce like that in India, expanding into India
may be a smart option.

Factors of production, such as labor, land, capital, and infrastructure, play a critical role in shaping a company's multinational strat-
egy. The availability and quality of these resources in a target country also influences whether a company pursues a cost leader-
ship or differentiation strategy, which is part of its business-level strategy. Determining a firm's strategic market position is based
on the characteristics of the target market and market segments. For example, if a country offers low-cost labor, a multinational
strategy that focuses on cost leadership strategy may align with target markets or market segments seeking affordability, as com-
panies may be able to remain profitable while paying locally competitive wages. Conversely, if a country has a highly skilled work-
force and advanced infrastructure, companies may choose a multinational strategy that focuses on differentiation strategy to create
unique products or services that appeal to consumers willing to pay a premium for innovation and quality. Additionally, access to
natural resources, supportive governmental laws, regulations and policies, or efficient logistics networks can influence how compa-
nies position themselves to meet specific market demands, shaping their competitive approach in each international setting.

Consumer Demand

Consumer demand refers to the nature of domestic customers. Industries in home countries that have demanding consumers pro-
duce higher-quality products domestically and are better positioned to compete internationally. For example, Japanese customers
demand high-quality, aesthetically pleasing, and reliable vehicles. Japanese automakers produce automobiles in Japan that meet
these high customer demands, and this increases their success in foreign markets. Unlike Japanese customers, French customers of
automobiles have low demands, and as a result, the reputation of French automobiles is low, and they do not sell well in foreign
markets.

Consumer demand is another critical aspect in determining multinational strategy. Companies must understand the nature of con-
sumer demand in each international market to tailor their offerings effectively. For example, emerging markets with large popula-
tions and growing middle-class populations often present opportunities for a multinational strategy that includes a cost leadership
strategy focused on affordability. On the other hand, sophisticated and demanding consumers can drive companies to innovate and
develop high-quality products, pushing them toward a differentiation strategy. Understanding local demand conditions is essential
for companies to align their products and services with consumer expectations and gain competitive edge in international markets.

Strategy, Structure, and Rivalry

Together, strategy, structure, and rivalry refer to how challenging it is to survive domestic competition. When an industry in a home
country has intense rivalry, competition drives quality up and creates a domestic industry of competing high-quality products. Pro-
ducing high-quality products domestically increases the likelihood the industry will be successful in international markets.

Strategy, structure, and rivalry also play a crucial role in determining how businesses compete internationally. In highly competitive
markets, companies need to develop distinctive strategic approaches to succeed. When entering markets with intense local compe-
tition, companies may have to adopt innovative practices or find unique ways to differentiate themselves to appeal to consumers.
Conversely, in markets with limited local rivalry, firms might find opportunities to achieve cost leadership more easily due to
328 | 12. FORMULATE MULTINATIONAL STRATEGY

reduced pressure on price competition. The strategic decisions that firms make regarding market positioning, investments, and
value propositions are often influenced by the competitive dynamics of each international market.

Related and Supporting Industries

It is common for an industry to rely on related and supporting industries to make products and services for use in its own business.
For example, Italians are known for high quality leather goods. Access to an extensive and high-quality leather production industry
is essential to the high-end leather goods industry. Being reliant on an industry with few or low-quality products puts an industry
at risk. An extensive supporting industry gives an industry more choices when events influence the supporting industry, and it
increases competition within the supporting industry to ensure high-quality goods.

The presence of related and supporting industries also influences a company's business-level strategy in international contexts.
When a country has strong supporting industries, such as suppliers, distributors, or specialized service providers, companies can
leverage these relationships to enhance efficiency or product quality. This interconnectedness often results in more innovation and
efficiency, providing companies with competitive advantages. For example, the automotive industry in Germany benefits signifi-
cantly from a strong network of supporting industries, including engineering firms, component manufacturers, and R&D institu-
tions. Companies that expand into such environments can use the advanced capabilities of these related industries to support their
differentiation strategies by offering superior products or processes. In contrast, when related industries are underdeveloped, com-
panies may opt for a simpler cost leadership strategy due to limited support for advanced innovation or premium offerings.

To be successful at the business level, companies expanding internationally must consider how these factors of production;
demand conditions; firm strategy, structure, and rivalry; and related and supporting industries shape the opportunities and con-
straints of each market. By aligning their business-level strategy with these foundational elements, companies can better position
themselves to meet local market needs, capitalize on competitive advantages, and achieve sustainable success in international
operations.

Porter's Diamond Model helps explain why some nations have clusters of highly competitive industries, such as Germany's auto-
motive sector or Silicon Valley's tech industry in the United States, providing insights into the strategic advantages companies may
gain from operating within these clusters. These elements directly influence how companies craft and implement their strategies
to achieve competitive advantage in foreign markets.

Together, these theories (among many others) offer a framework for understanding the motivations behind international business
and provide a roadmap for companies seeking to expand across borders. By understanding and applying these theories, companies
can make informed decisions about market selection, entry strategies, and how to compete effectively in the global landscape.
Each theory offers a unique perspective that helps businesses navigate the opportunities and challenges of operating internation-
ally, whether through focusing on efficiency, leveraging unique capabilities, learning through gradual expansion, or capitalizing on
national competitive advantages.

     Key Takeaways

     Theories of international business offer essential insights into why companies expand globally, how they select markets, and which
     strategies they adopt. Key frameworks include comparative advantage, which highlights specialization for efficiency; the OLI paradigm,
     which guides firms in leveraging unique assets through foreign direct investment; the Uppsala model, emphasizing gradual expansion
     to manage risk; and Porter's Diamond Model, which explains national industry competitiveness and requires a careful assessment of
     factors such as production resources, demand conditions, competitive dynamics, and supporting industries. Each element influences
                                                                                                            12. FORMULATE MULTINATIONAL STRATEGY | 329

     whether a company pursues cost leadership or differentiation strategy in foreign markets. High-quality labor and infrastructure often
     lead to differentiation strategies, while cost leadership may suit markets with low-cost labor. Demand conditions shape strategy based
     on local consumer preferences, and the presence of strong supporting industries can enhance efficiency and innovation. By aligning
     their business strategies with these factors, companies can tailor their competitive approaches to succeed in varied international envi-
     ronments. Together, these theories provide a strategic foundation for navigating the complexities of international markets, helping busi-
     nesses make informed decisions about where and how to compete effectively.

12.6 CAGE Distance Framework

The CAGE distance framework (Ghemawat, 2001) is a tool for companies evaluating international opportunities and understanding
the challenges involved in entering new global markets. Developed by Pankaj Ghemawat, it helps a company analyze the cultural,
administrative, geographic, and economic distances between its home country and target foreign markets. This requires a thor-
ough understanding of the home county as well the target countries, calling for extensive research.

These dimensions represent potential barriers to international expansion that can impact product acceptance, operational effi-
ciency, and overall market success. By assessing these factors, companies can make informed decisions about which markets to
enter, how to adapt their strategies, and what entry modes are most appropriate.

As you now know, the Porter's Diamond Model of National Competitive Advantage focuses on the industry. The CAGE distance
framework focuses on countries.
330 | 12. FORMULATE MULTINATIONAL STRATEGY

Cultural Distance

Cultural distance refers to differences in language, values, social norms, and consumer behavior between countries. Cultural dif-
ferences can impact how products and services are perceived, the effectiveness of marketing messages, and the way businesses
interact with customers and stakeholders. For instance, advertising campaigns that resonate in one country may not be suitable
in another due to differing values and traditions. A strong understanding of cultural preferences allows companies to tailor their
approaches to meet the expectations of each market, ensuring that their branding and customer interactions are culturally sensitive
and effective.

Administrative Distance

Administrative distance involves differences in laws, regulations, governance, and political institutions that can create challenges
for businesses entering foreign markets. This can include variations in legal systems, trade policies, tariffs, and regulatory require-
ments. Trade and tariff policies can both help and hinder the growth of MNCs. When there are changes in these policies, business
and financial markets are disrupted. Companies may consider onshoring businesses or business operations that have been off-
shored. Immigration policies and enforcement can also have an influence on businesses and the economy, potentially disrupting
labor markets.

Administrative differences significantly impact the ease of doing business, as firms must comply with distinct legal and bureau-
cratic procedures. For example, highly regulated markets may present barriers such as licensing requirements or ownership restric-
tions that complicate expansion plans. Companies must navigate these administrative differences effectively and adjust their
strategies to comply with local laws and regulations while fostering positive relationships with local authorities.

Geographic Distance

Geographic distance considers not only the physical distance between the home country and the target market but also factors such
as transportation infrastructure, time zones, and accessibility. Geographic distance can affect logistics, supply chain management,
and the overall cost of moving goods and services across borders. Companies expanding into distant markets often face increased
transportation costs, longer lead times, and challenges in managing the flow of goods and services. To succeed in geographically
distant markets, businesses need robust supply chain strategies that can handle the complexities associated with longer shipping
routes and potential logistical disruptions.

Economic Distance

Economic distance focuses on differences in income levels, consumer purchasing power, infrastructure, and overall economic devel-
opment between countries. Economic distance influences how companies price their products, determine market positioning, and
adapt their offerings to meet the needs of target markets. In countries with lower purchasing power, businesses may need to adjust
their offerings to include more affordable options or features tailored to better match local needs. Differences in economic infra-
structure, such as the availability of financial services or digital connectivity, can also impact a company's ability to operate effec-
tively. A deep understanding of economic distance helps companies identify which segments of the market to target and how to
position their products accordingly.

You now understand how portfolio planning and the BGC matrix can be used in corporate-level strategy. MNCs use portfolio plan-
ning to make investment and divestment decisions across their portfolios of operations. For example, an MNC may decide to rein-
vest profits from one country into another country.

     markets are most viable for entry. By analyzing cultural, administrative, geographic, and economic distances, companies can better
     understand the risks and challenges associated with each market, enabling them to make informed strategic decisions. This analysis is
     particularly useful in helping companies determine the level of adaptation required for their offerings and in selecting the most suitable
     entry modes for each market. The CAGE distance framework analysis instrument analyzes the cultural, administrative, geographical, and
     economic distance between the home country and target foreign markets.

12.7 Integration-Responsiveness Framework

Now that a firm has analyzed the opportunities and threats associated with
different global markets using a tool such as the CAGE distance framework,
it can use this analysis as it continues to formulate its multinational strategy.
Careful consideration is necessary, as companies face diverse and conflicting
environmental pressures when expanding into foreign markets.

Multinational corporations make two critical strategic decisions when for-
mulating a multinational strategy. The first decision concerns whether the
strategy is globally integrated. The second decision concerns whether the
strategy is locally responsive. These two strategic decisions are captured in
the integration-responsiveness framework shown in figure 12.1.

The first strategic decision addresses whether and to what degree the strat-       Figure 12.1: Integration-responsiveness framework
egy is responsive to global integration pressures. Global integration pres-
sures include the need to reduce costs through large-scale investments and
the presence of global competitors in the firm's target markets. Global inte-
gration pressures require firms to manage their business activities on a
global basis.

The second strategic decision is whether and to what extent the strategy is responsive to local pressures. Local pressures include
diverse governmental structures and differences in customer needs and preferences across countries. Local pressures compel firms
to conduct their business activities on a country-by-country basis.

Combining the decisions made along these two dimensions--responsiveness to global integration pressures and responsiveness to
local pressures--results in four multinational strategies: international, multidomestic, global, and transnational. An international
strategy combines a low responsiveness to global integration pressures with a low responsiveness to local preferences; a multido-
mestic strategy combines a low responsiveness to global integration pressures with a high responsiveness to local preferences; a
global strategy combines a high responsiveness to global integration pressures with a low responsiveness to local preferences; and
a transnational strategy combines a high responsiveness to global integration pressures with a high responsiveness to local pres-
sures.

International Strategy

An international strategy combines a low responsiveness to global integration pressures with a     Figure 12.2: Red Bull
low responsiveness to local preferences. An international strategy involves expanding into for-
eign markets with minimal adaptation, relying on products and resources, capabilities, and
core competencies developed in the home market to enter new regions with lower risk and
investment. An international strategy focuses on leveraging existing resources to reach similar
customer segments across borders. This approach is suited for industries where demand for
local variation is low, allowing companies to maintain centralized control and achieve cost effi-
ciencies. For example, luxury brands like Rolex use an international strategy by offering a con-
sistent product line and brand experience worldwide, appealing to a global audience with
uniform preferences. Red Bull is another brand that follows an international strategy. An Aus-
trian brand, Red Bull is the leading energy drink, with more than $2 billion in sales every year.
                        12. FORMULATE MULTINATIONAL STRATEGY | 333

Multidomestic Strategy

A multidomestic strategy combines a low responsiveness to global integration pressures with a high responsiveness to local pref-
erences. A multidomestic strategy focuses on high local responsiveness by tailoring products, services, and business operations to
meet the needs and preferences of each individual market. For example, food and beverage companies like Nestlé employ a mul-
tidomestic strategy to adapt their product offerings to local preferences, such as varying flavors and formulations based on regional
tastes. Companies that adopt a multidomestic strategy treat each country as a unique market, often allowing local subsidiaries a
great deal of autonomy to make decisions that align with the specific consumer expectations of that country. This strategy is partic-
ularly suitable for industries where local tastes, cultural preferences, and regulations vary significantly from one market to another.
A multidomestic approach allows companies to better serve local customers by adapting their offerings; however, it may lead to
higher costs due to the lack of standardized processes and economies of scale. A multidomestic strategy enables companies to
closely align with local preferences, though it typically results in higher operational costs due to extensive customization.

Global Strategy

A global strategy combines a high responsiveness to global integration pressures with a low responsiveness to local preferences. A
global strategy emphasizes high efficiency and the standardization of products and services across all markets. Companies employ-
ing this strategy produce and market their offerings in a highly uniform manner, seeking economies of scale and the benefits of a
consistent brand image across all countries. By centralizing key functions like research and development, marketing, and produc-
tion, companies can achieve cost advantages through efficiency and large-scale operations. A global strategy works best for indus-
tries where consumer needs and preferences are relatively homogeneous across different countries and where there is a significant
cost advantage to producing standardized products. A global strategy achieves cost efficiencies through standardization but may
overlook local consumer nuances. For example, technology companies like Apple use a global strategy by offering the same core
products worldwide with little variation, ensuring consistency in quality and design while benefiting from the cost efficiencies of
mass production.

Transnational Strategy

A transnational strategy combines a high responsiveness to global integration pressures with a high responsiveness to local pres-
sures. A transnational strategy focuses on achieving both high local responsiveness and high global integration, representing a
balance between the multidomestic and global strategies. Unlike purely multidomestic strategies that prioritize local adaptation
or purely global strategies that emphasize standardization, the transnational strategy seeks to combine the best of both. Compa-
nies using this approach aim to standardize core operations, such as production, supply chain management, and R&D, to achieve
cost efficiencies, while also allowing significant flexibility to adapt products, services, and marketing to local market needs. This
dual focus requires careful coordination across diverse locations, enabling the company to respond to specific cultural and con-
sumer preferences without sacrificing operational efficiencies. Although complex to implement, the transnational strategy can
offer a competitive advantage by leveraging economies of scale alongside tailored market engagement, as exemplified by Unilever,
which standardizes production but customizes product offerings and branding to suit regional tastes. Unfortunately for some, this
approach requires a complex organizational structure and substantial coordination to effectively manage both global and local
demands, making it challenging to implement successfully. For example, McDonald's has thirty-six thousand locations in more
than one hundred different countries, with menu items and prices that change based on the local market.

Each of these multinational strategies offers distinct advantages and challenges depending on the industry, market conditions, and
overall business goals. Ultimately, the choice of multinational strategy is influenced by factors such as the degree of variation in
consumer needs across markets, the intensity of competition, the nature of the industry, and the company's resources and abilities.
Successful multinational companies often align their chosen strategies with their overall competitive advantages, tailoring their
approaches to achieve the best balance between global integration and local responsiveness to meet their strategic goals.

     Key Takeaways

     Multinational corporations make two critical strategic decisions when formulating a multinational strategy. The first strategic decision
     concerns responsiveness to global integration pressures, like the need to reduce costs through large-scale investments and the presence
     of global competitors in the firm's target markets. Global integration pressures require firms to manage their business activities on a
     global basis. The second strategic decision concerns responsiveness to local pressures, like diverse government regulations and differ-
     ences in customer needs and preferences across countries. Local pressures compel firms to conduct their business activities on a country-
     by-country basis. Combining the decisions made along these two dimensions results in four multinational strategies: international (low
     global responsiveness, low local responsiveness), multidomestic (low global responsiveness, high local responsiveness), global (high
     global responsiveness, low local responsiveness), and transnational (high global responsiveness, high local responsiveness).

12.8 Choice of Entry Mode

Choosing the appropriate entry mode is a crucial decision for firms expanding internationally, as it directly influences the level of
control, risk, required investment, and overall potential for success. Entry modes vary in terms of risk and commitment, ranging
from low-risk, low-investment options to high-risk, high-commitment strategies. Firms with limited resources or a low tolerance
for risk may favor modes that require minimal capital and offer lower exposure, such as exporting, while those seeking greater
control and long-term presence may opt for more committed approaches, like wholly owned subsidiaries. Common international
entry modes, ordered from lowest to highest commitment, include exporting, licensing and franchising, joint ventures, strategic
alliances, wholly owned subsidiaries, and foreign direct investment, each offering unique benefits and challenges depending on a
firm's strategic goals and market characteristics.

Exporting

Exporting is often the first step for many companies seeking to enter international markets. It involves producing goods domesti-
cally and shipping them to foreign markets for sale, allowing companies to expand without investing heavily in foreign facilities.
Exporting offers a low-risk way to test the viability of foreign markets and allows companies to retain control over production
processes. However, exporting can also lead to increased logistics costs and may expose companies to tariff and nontariff barriers
in their target countries. Exporting is suitable for companies with limited international experience or for those wanting to test the
waters before making more substantial investments abroad.

Licensing and Franchising

Licensing and franchising are popular entry modes for companies that want to leverage the capabilities of local partners without
establishing a direct physical presence. Licensing involves granting a foreign entity the rights to use the company's intellectual
property, such as technology, patents, or trademarks, in exchange for a fee or royalty. This entry mode allows companies to expand
with minimal investment and risk, as the licensee bears the cost of setting up operations in the target market. Similarly, franchising
allows companies to license their business models, brands, and operational systems to foreign franchisees, who manage and oper-
ate the business locally. Franchising is commonly used by service-oriented firms, particularly in the hospitality and food service
industries, such as McDonald's and Marriott. While licensing and franchising help companies grow quickly, they often involve a loss
of control over the quality of products and services, which can affect brand consistency across different markets.
336 | 12. FORMULATE MULTINATIONAL STRATEGY

Joint Venture

A joint venture is an entry mode where a company partners with a local firm to establish a new entity in the foreign market. This
approach provides both parties with shared ownership, combining the local knowledge and market access of the domestic partner
with the foreign firm's expertise and technology. Joint ventures are particularly advantageous in countries with regulatory require-
ments that mandate local ownership or where navigating cultural and political environments is challenging for foreign firms. A
notable advantage of joint ventures is the ability to reduce risk by sharing costs and to benefit from the established relationships of
the local partner. However, managing joint ventures can be challenging due to potential conflicts of interest, differences in strategic
objectives, and challenges in decision-making.

Strategic Alliances

Strategic alliances represent another entry mode that involves partnering with a foreign firm without forming a separate legal
entity. Strategic alliances are often less formal than joint ventures and can include collaborations on specific projects, co-marketing
agreements, or joint product development. These alliances allow companies to gain quick access to new markets, share expertise,
and distribute costs and risks. For instance, tech companies often form alliances to collaborate on R&D initiatives, allowing both
parties to benefit from shared technological advancements. However, strategic alliances may suffer from a lack of clearly defined
control, and the success of the partnership often depends on the mutual trust and commitment of both parties.

Wholly Owned Subsidiaries

Wholly owned subsidiaries involve full ownership and control of foreign operations and can be established through either green-
field investments or acquisitions. In a greenfield investment, a company builds its operations from scratch in the foreign market,
allowing for complete customization and control of the new facility. Alternatively, a firm may acquire an existing local company
to gain immediate market access, existing customers, and operational capabilities. Wholly owned subsidiaries provide the highest
level of control over international operations, allowing companies to fully integrate their culture, processes, and standards across
borders. However, they are also the most resource-intensive and carry significant risk due to the large capital investment required.
This entry mode is suitable for firms that prioritize control over their foreign operations and are willing to invest heavily in expand-
ing their international footprints.

Foreign Direct Investment

Foreign direct investment (FDI) is a critical aspect of multinational business strategy, involving the establishment of significant
ownership in foreign markets. FDI allows companies to maintain a high level of control over their operations abroad, facilitating
deeper market integration and the ability to adapt business strategies to local environments effectively. Unlike other entry modes,
such as exporting or licensing, FDI requires a substantial commitment of resources and carries higher risks, including exposure to
political, economic, and operational uncertainties. The benefits of FDI include greater access to local knowledge, increased control
over production and distribution, and the potential for long-term growth in key international markets. FDI is an essential consider-
ation for companies seeking to establish a robust presence in foreign territories and to leverage local advantages while building a
sustainable competitive position.

  Application
       · Think of the companies you have studied in your business education. Feel free to conduct research if you need to.
                Discuss one example of a company that has used each of the entry modes to multinational business: exporting, licens-
                   ing and franchising, joint venture, strategic alliance, wholly owned subsidiaries, foreign direct investment.

Key Takeaways

The choice of entry mode depends on various factors, including the nature of the industry, market potential, risk tolerance, resource avail-
ability, and the level of control desired by the firm. Companies must carefully evaluate these factors to determine the entry mode that
aligns best with their strategic objectives while balancing risks and investment costs. Each entry mode offers distinct advantages and
drawbacks, and choosing the right approach is critical for successful international expansion and long-term growth.

12.9 Analyze Multinational Strategy

When you conduct a case analysis, you analyze a firm's multinational strategy. This is step six in the case analysis process.

       6. As appropriate to the case, analyze strategies: Corporate-level, business-level, innovation, sustainability and ethics, technol­
       ogy, and multinational strategies.

           a. Use strategic management analytical frameworks to analyze, interpret, and evaluate strategies.
           b. Ensure line of sight and congruence within analysis of each strategy.

12.10 Why Multinational Strategy Is Important to Business Graduates

For business graduates starting as business support unit managers in support business units in large multinational companies
(such as marketing managers), multinational strategy has a direct influence on the implementation of functional-level strategy.
How the company will decide to what degree the company is responsive to global integration pressures and whether and to what
extent the firm is responsive to local pressures has a direct impact on business support unit managers. Whether a company formu-
lates an international, multidomestic, global, or transnational strategy, business executives and divisional or strategic business unit
managers in large multinational businesses need data and data analysis the business support unit managers have direct access to.

Business graduates that enter either internal or external consulting roles require a high level of competence with multinational
strategy to communicate with business executives in multinational firms how their consulting projects fit into the overall multina-
tional strategy of the firm. When business graduates that serve as either internal or external consultants to companies that are cur-
rently not engaging in international business, competency with multinational strategy is important so they can work with company
executives that may be consider taking their firms global. Many large consulting firms are multinational. For business graduates
who are or will become entrepreneurs, fluency with multinational strategy is essential to establishing and growing a successful firm
if the goal is international expansion.

12.11 Conclusion

Expanding into international markets is a complex but rewarding endeavor that requires careful consideration of strategic moti-
vations, market conditions, and the potential barriers that could impact success. By employing a comprehensive approach that
includes evaluating motivations for expansion and by selecting the most appropriate entry modes, companies can maximize their
chances of thriving globally. Theories such as the OLI paradigm and frameworks like the CAGE distance framework and the integra-
tion responsiveness framework provide valuable insights to help firms assess which strategies and markets are best aligned with
their objectives. Ultimately, successful international expansion requires balancing the need for local responsiveness with the pur-
suit of global efficiencies, navigating risks effectively, and making informed choices about where and how to enter new markets.

PART VI: IMPLEMENT STRATEGY

As you are about to engage with the topics in the final part of this book, let's take a brief look at what you have learned about strate-
gic management.

In Part I, you learned what strategic management entails, both as a field of study and as an area of business practice. You also
learned how to conduct a case analysis. Part II detailed how to analyze a firm's organizational performance and its external and
internal environments. Then in Part III, you learned how to synthesize the analysis you have conducted and how to determine a
firm's strategic issue. Part IV focused on how strategic management leaders formulate corporate-level strategy and business-level
strategy. In this part, you also learned how to analyze corporate-level strategy and business-level strategy when you conduct a
case analysis. Then in Part V, you learned how strategic management leaders formulate four strategies that are embedded in busi-
ness-level strategy: innovation strategy, sustainability and ethics strategy, technology strategy, and multinational strategy. You also
learned how to analyze each of these when you conduct a case analysis.

Now in the final chapter, you learn how strategic management leaders implement strategy.

13.1 Introduction

In this chapter, you learn what implementing strategy entails. Then you analyze a strategy-implementation gap. Next you learn how
to formulate strategic goals. Then you learn the importance of allocating resources to strategy implementation and broadly com-
municating and cascading strategy. Next you learn how to implement strategy through organizational design and organizational
control systems. Then you learn how to combine soft and hard implementation factors and hardwire strategy. Next you learn how
to align strategy and corporate culture and how to implement strategy through systematic change management. Finally, you learn
why strategy implementation is important to business graduates.

By now, you know that there are three stages to the strategic management process: strategic analysis, strategy formulation, and
strategy implementation. You are deeply familiar with strategic analysis ("Where are we?") and strategy formulation ("Where are
we going?"). Strategy implementation is the process of executing every strategy a company has formulated, answering the question
"How are we going to get there?" Every strategy that a company has formulated needs to be successfully implemented and should
follow some common best practices.

                                            example, geopolitical environments can change quickly and impact strategy
                                            implementation, with wars, tariffs, and regional disputes greatly impacting
                                            strategy implementation.

"Strategy is important, but implementa­     Another reason why businesses may struggle with successful strategy imple-

--Bill Gates (co-founder of Microsoft)

                                                             Still another reason that strategies may not realize their hoped-for results
                                                             may be an underinvestment of sufficient resources to effectively implement a
                                                             well-formulated strategy. Once a strategy is formulated, it is essential to
invest in its implementation. As you are about to learn, strategy formulation requires a thought out implementation plan.

Imagine that company executives have invested significant resources into formulating a great strategy. Then the company execu-
tives communicate the strategy to employees with a PowerPoint presentation in a townhall meeting. Now imagine that these exec-
utives do not invest sufficiently in a robust strategy implementation plan. What do you think the likelihood of success is going to
be?

One study found that, on average, companies only realize around 63 percent of their planned performance improvements targeted
through their strategy (Makins & Steele, 2005). This is a concerning and sobering statistic considering that a strategy should be
the source of a sustainable competitive advantage that helps the company to win in its chosen markets. Seemingly, many compa-
nies fail to translate a great strategy into operative performance improvements. They strategize beautifully but inadequately imple-
ment.

On the surface, failed strategy implementation leads to subpar financial performance and a lot of work and money wasted. On a
deeper level, the failure leads to a negative learning effect in the organization, instilling the idea that new strategies announced
                                                                                                                                 13. IMPLEMENT STRATEGY | 345
with a big media fanfare do not really change the way the organization works. As a result, employees may just keep their heads
down instead of fully embracing new strategies. Change fatigue sets in, and the organization continues to operate in the old way
instead of making changes in support of the new strategy.
For example, one senior executive in the chemical industry stated that he prefers 80 percent of a strategy implemented 100 percent
rather than a perfect strategy only implemented 80 percent. So, what causes this implementation gap? What can be done to avoid
prevalent implementation issues? How can an organization drive true performance improvements via a new strategy and avoid the
strategy-to-performance gap?
The formulation of a new strategy does not happen in a vacuum. All companies, except brand-new startups, have an existing strat-
egy that needs to be factored into the formulation of the new strategy. The new strategy is often not entirely dissimilar to a firm's
business model and go-to market approach; rather, it is an adjustment, fine tuning, and course correction in light of things that
worked well or that do not work well with a firm's current strategy. Hence, understanding whether the current strategy is working
and how it is successfully implemented becomes important input in the formulation of a new strategy.
The decisive questions regarding the current strategy are whether it delivered the top-line growth, bottom-line growth, and the
market evaluation that the strategy promised. If the promises of the current strategy have been met, the success factors for driving
successful strategy implementation should be factored into the development of the new strategy.
However, current strategies often fail to fully deliver on the promises made in strategy formulation. Current performance is not at
the promised level, and there is a gap between where the firm should be according to the current strategy and where it is in terms
of sales, net profit, cash flow, market share, international presence, innovation success, share price, earnings per share, and other
metrics.
Consider figure 13.1. There are multiple gaps to analyze, including the strategic gap, implementation gap, and the performance gap.

Figure 13.1: Gap analysis
346 | 13. IMPLEMENT STRATEGY

The strategic gap is the difference between a firm's strategic objective, what it would like to accomplish, and its formulated strategy,
which is based on the improvements the firm expects to realize given the expected operating conditions. A strategic gap analysis
analyzes the strategic gap and its causes. What a firm would like to accomplish must be tempered with a realistic assessment of
what it may expect to accomplish given current conditions. This is important because a company needs to understand what may
constrain its desired results. The firm may be able to address the current conditions to maximize more of its strategic objective or at
the least monitor the constraining conditions for opportunities when those conditions change.

The implementation gap is the difference between the formulated strategy, which considers the improvements the firm expected
given the expected operating conditions when the strategy was formulated and the implemented strategy, which is based on pro-
jected improvements if the current operating conditions remain the same. Implementation gap analysis analyzes this gap and its
causes. It is useful to understand how the operating conditions have changed in the time between strategy formulation and strategy
implementation. It also is useful to understand the improvements that will likely continue from the current strategy if the current
operating conditions remain unchanged. This indicates the likelihood of the currently implemented strategy's continued success
under the current conditions and suggests whether it is time to consider revising the current strategy.

The performance gap is the difference between the implemented strategy, which considers projected improvements if the current
operating conditions remain the same, and organizational performance under the strategy. A firm needs to understand the differ-
ence between what it projected it would accomplish with its strategy and what it accomplished. Performance gap analysis looks at
the gap between where the firm should be according to the current strategy and where it is. Hence, the performance gap analysis
is the process that companies use to compare their current strategy performance with their desired, expected performance. A per-
formance gap analysis is used to determine whether a company is meeting expectations and using its resources effectively. After
understanding the gap in success-critical strategic metrics and KPIs, the firm conducts a thorough root cause analysis to understand
why the strategy was not as successful as it was intended. The lessons learned and the identification of specific root causes that
impeded full strategy implementation are then factored into the development of the new strategy to prevent similar challenges
from materializing again.

After the strategic, implementation, and performance gaps have been analyzed, root causes are analyzed and then an improvement
plan that addresses the root causes is formulated and implemented. For the root cause analysis, it is important that the firm ana-
lyzes more than the symptoms of the gap, such as a gap in revenue growth or market share growth. Instead, the company needs to
dig deeper into the real root causes that need to be addressed. The root cause analysis (RCA) is a structured process for identifying
the underlying causes of a problem and developing solutions to prevent it from happening again. RCA assumes that it is much more
effective to systematically prevent and solve underlying issues rather than just treating symptoms when necessary and putting out
fires or repeating the same mistakes in the formulation and implementation of the new strategy.

       Application

            · Consider the scenario above where company executives invested significant resources into formulating a strategy, which they
                then presented in a PowerPoint to the employees. Maybe you have already experienced a similar scenario, perhaps in a job,
                where an organization announces a big change and then does very little to ensure its successful implementation.

                     What was your experience in this situation? Was it successful? What would have made it more successful?
                     13. IMPLEMENT STRATEGY | 347

Analyze Root Causes

As a prerequisite for improving strategy delivery and bringing an organization closer to its stated vision, the formulated strategy
needs to be robust. It needs to be specific and state clear strategic objectives that are substantive and truly differentiating. The strat-
egy needs to address a specific and clear right to win for the organization. This means that the strategy needs to be unique, with a
specific source of winning in the market and a clear source of competitive differentiation. While this sounds obvious, many strate-
gies are rather broad or just state ambitious targets in the form of a wish list. If you can replace the logo on the strategy documents
with the logo of a competitor and the strategy still makes sense, the strategy is neither unique nor truly differentiating. Hence, some
strategy implementation processes are doomed to fail because of a subpar strategy that simply is not specific and unique enough
to drive superior performance.

Beyond this foundational flaw, there are various factors that lead to possible strategy-to-performance gap. As depicted in figure
13.2, there are a variety of issues that block the translation of a great strategy into improved operative performance (Makins &
Steele, 2005), including both hard factors like a lack of resources and soft factors like poor communication of the strategy. If the
strategy is not translated to specific and measurable objectives, there is a high risk that the organization does not commit appropri-
ately to necessary change, action, and performance improvements.

Figure 13.2: Reasons for failed strategy implementation

Clustering the different root causes into bigger blocks, there are six barriers to strategy implementation to avoid.

 1. Vision barrier: Only 5 percent of the workforce understands the strategy.
 2. Leadership barrier: Executive teams and leaders do not spend enough time discussing and implementing strategy.
 3. People barrier: Only 25 percent of managers have incentives linked to strategy.
 4. Resource barrier: 60 percent of organizations do not link budgets to strategy, leaving the strategy implementation under-

      funded.
 5. Skill barrier: Only 40 percent of organizations provide sufficient new skills and competencies to implement the new strategy.

      Insufficient development of employee skills and competencies hinders the ability to realize the strategic "where to play" and
      "how to win" directives.
 6. System barrier: 45 percent of organizations do not have a formal strategy implementation process in place. There are no appro-
      priate processes, structures, and rules in place to build organizational capabilities to implement the new strategy.
348 | 13. IMPLEMENT STRATEGY

       Application
            · Put yourself in the shoes of a leader whose strategy implementation failed.
                     What might have been the reasons for this?
                     Which roles do employees and middle managers play in the successful rollout of strategy?

     Key Takeaways

     Executives and managers in the corporate world have much more expertise in developing strategy than implementing strategy fully and
     effectively. This leads to significant performance gaps and shortfalls between what a new strategy promises and what it delivers. Improv-
     ing strategy implementation is success-critical in the whole strategy process.

13.3 Formulate Strategic Goals

Clear strategic goals are part of any good strategy. To achieve the firm's broader aspirations stated in its mission, purpose, vision,
and values and to successfully implement strategy, companies need to set specific, actionable objectives. These objectives guide
the firm's strategic action plans and employees in their day-to-day work and help align their efforts with the organization's overall
strategy. The organization needs to translate strategy into strategic goals. These strategic goals are usually:
                                                                                                                                 13. IMPLEMENT STRATEGY | 349

  · Financial goals like revenue, net profit, share price, cash flow, and net working capital.
  · Customer and market goals like market share, customer acquisition, customer retention, and strength of the firm's brand.
  · Internal goals like efficiency of operations, innovation processes, the value-adding use of technology, cost management, and

      the optimization of other success-critical processes.
  · Other goals like mergers & acquisitions, corporate culture, talent management, and globalization of business.

It is important to quantify these strategic goals using metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) that are linked to financial
success. Following the approach of "what you measure is what you manage," a clear set of metrics and KPIs guides strategy imple-
mentation. The most effective goals follow the SMART framework, which stands for specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and
time-bound. SMART goals make it easier for employees to stay focused and accountable, increasing the likelihood of success.
Robust and actionable strategic goals ideally meet the criteria of SMART goals.

  · Are the goals specific?
  · Are the goals measurable?
  · Are the goals attainable?
  · Are the goals realistic?
  · Are the goals time-bound?

The period following the achievement of a major goal is often overlooked, yet it is a critical moment for strategic decision-making.
This is when an organization must choose whether to maintain its current success or pursue new challenges.

An example can be seen in Apple's shift after successfully launching the iPhone. The iPhone revolutionized the tech industry and
brought Apple unparalleled success, but the company didn't rest on its laurels. After achieving dominance in the smartphone
market, Apple launched the Apple Watch and AirPods, both of which became key contributors to its revenue. The company also
expanded its services sector with offerings like Apple Music, iCloud, and Apple TV+, ensuring continued growth and innovation.

This approach highlights a key principle: organizations that continually set new goals remain competitive and dynamic. Apple's
move beyond its original success into new products and services allowed it to remain at the forefront of the tech industry. In con-
trast, companies that fail to embrace new goals risk stagnation, as demonstrated by industries that rest on past achievements
instead of looking to the future. To avoid getting lost in the complexity of too many goals and metrics, it is advisable that firms focus
on the few success-critical objectives that require management attention.

After a company-specific and strategy-specific set of meaningful and robust strategic goals have been formulated and communi-
cated, the firm defines specific plans to achieve its strategic goals over the time horizon of the new strategy. Since strategy imple-
mentation is always a multi-year process, companies usually define the final strategic objectives as the outcome of successful
strategy implementation and also the result of intermediate goals and milestones on the way to reaching the final goals. These
strategic milestones act as checkpoints that mark significant achievements or turning points in a firm's strategy implementation
process.

Strategic action plans (STRAPs) will drive the operative implementation of the strategy. Strategic action plans define specifically
what a company must do in all parts and at all levels of the organization to bring the strategy to life, reach defined milestones,
and eventually achieve the final strategic goals. STRAPs and strategic objectives provide a specific compass and guiding star for the
whole organization, and they define clear expectations in terms of actions and behaviors.

Ultimately, successful strategy needs to be reflected in tangible improvements in the organization's financial performance. Beyond
the quantitative financial metrics, it is also important to include qualitative measures. This balanced scorecard, detailed in Chapter
3, is an excellent way to measure and monitor strategy implementation.

13.4 Allocate Resources to Strategy Implementation

When the strategic direction is clear and after quantitative and qualitative objectives have been defined, the organization needs
to allocate sufficient resources to strategy implementation in support of the defined objectives. Usually, a strategy calls for doing
things differently, often with the target of profitable growth. Doing things differently and realizing top-line and bottom-line growth
requires dedicated budgetary resources.
Strategy implementation needs to be clearly linked to budget, specific resource plans, and a project management approach. Top
leadership needs to create a strategy-supporting structure, staff the organization with the needed expertise, and develop and
strengthen strategy-supporting resources and capabilities.
Doing things differently requires different skills and competencies for employees responsible for strategy implementation. It
is important that employees are supported in acquiring these skills through training and development programs that are fully
aligned with the new strategies.
For example, if a company's strategy states that the firm's right to win is their customer-centric innovation approach, then the com-
pany needs to strengthen employees' skills to identify business opportunities and unmet customer needs that drive innovation.
The organization needs to equip employees with customer interaction and relationship-building skills, possibly hire new employ-
ees with specific skill sets or use temporary external resources like consultants to drive successful strategy implementation. Addi-
tionally, the organization needs to develop a clear strategy implementation plan and may want to allocate appropriate resources to
project teams that drive and manage strategy implementation.

13.5 Broadly Communicate and Cascade Strategy

Only employees who fully understand their organization's strategy can embrace and implement the strategy. Organizations often
communicate new strategies in townhall meetings and emails from the desks of CEOs. However, a surprisingly high percentage of
employees do not know or understand their companies' strategies.

According to a Forbes study, up to 80 percent of employees have no clear line of sight between their tasks and corporate goals, up to
70 percent of employees could not correctly identify their corporate strategy, and 45 percent of middle managers could not name
one of their company's top five strategic priorities. Any organization that does not involve and does not take their employees with
them on the strategy implementation journey is not positioned to realize the promised performance improvements.

While leaders may communicate strategy, in many cases it is not heard or understood by employees. Consequently, employees are
not able to embrace the strategy, cannot connect their own work with the strategy, and are poorly equipped to support the strategy.
An effective communication approach for strategy includes the following success factors.

  · A good strategy and a good solution are not enough. Effective strategy communication needs to win employees' hearts and
      minds.

  · Strategy communication needs to include a clear reason and business case for the new strategy. It needs to unambiguously
      outline the reasons for change, and it needs to provide an emotionally compelling vision for a better future.

  · Employees do not get out of bed to improve the firm's net profit margin or other financial metrics. Strategy communication
      needs to make an emotional case for change and provide a "what's in it for me" connection to employees. Linking strategy to
      a compelling company purpose that instills employees with a sense of pride and with making a positive difference can be a
      powerful vehicle to successfully implementing a strategy.

  · Use storytelling and symbolic action, which makes strategy messages stick much better than just PowerPoint slides, data, and
      written communication.

  · Customize strategy messages to different employee audiences according to professions and reporting lines.
  · As much as possible, make communication two-way, personal, consistent, and inspirational.
  · Use a variety of managers to communicate the strategy. Including middle management, top talent, change agents, and infor-

      mal leaders helps to cascade the strategy throughout the whole organization. Involving key employees early and making them
      part of the strategy rollout increases their buy-in and support for the new strategy.

Leadership plays a key role in strategy communication and rollout. Leaders are very visible in an organization, and their behaviors
are closely observed by employees. Beyond verbal communication, leaders on all levels need to model the new behaviors they want
to see in the organization. They need to lead by example, and they need to link new behaviors to the new strategy. They must
become the ambassadors of the new strategy, showcasing new skills and competencies in support of the new strategy. They must
also publicly recognize and reward these behaviors in others and celebrate examples of successful strategy implementation.

13.6 Implement Strategy through Organizational Design

The guiding principle for organizational design is that structure follows strategy. There is not an inherently better or worse organi-
zational design. The best organizational design is the one that best supports the organization's mission, purpose, vision, values, and
strategy. Organizational designs can have a functional structure, a multidivisional structure, a matrix structure, or a boundaryless
structure.

Functional Structure

In a functional structure, the firm organizes its business activities according to functional areas of the business, such as accounting
and information systems, business information technology and cybersecurity, finance, insurance and business law, human resource
management, innovation and technology, marketing, and operations.

Organizing business activities by functional business areas, a functional structure offers advantages like reduced conflict and costs,
maximized efficiency, and expert creation. A disadvantage of a functional structure is that it is slow to respond to change.

Young and small businesses often organize business activities using a functional structure. Functional organizational structures are
best for stable environments and are often the choice of large firms operating with a cost leadership strategy as part of their focused
or broad cost leadership strategy.
                                                                                                                                 13. IMPLEMENT STRATEGY | 353

Figure 13.3: Functional organizational structure

Multidivisional Structure

In a multidivisional structure, the company organizes its business activities based on product areas and/or geographic regions. A
multidivisional structure has the advantage of being more responsive to customer needs and reacting more quickly to change in the
environment. A disadvantage of a multidivisional structure is that it is more costly to operate than a functional structure because
each unit that focuses on a product or region duplicate each functional activity, such as human resource management and market-
ing.
As a young, small company grows, it may change its organizational structure to a multidivisional structure. Large firms also may use
a multidivisional structure.

                              Figure 13.4: Multidivisional organizational structure
354 | 13. IMPLEMENT STRATEGY

Matrix Structure

A matrix structure is hybrid organizational structure that has features of both functional and multidivisional structures.

     Figure 13.5: Matrix organizational structure
Complex organizations or firms that engage in projects of limited duration may use a matrix structure in which employees can be
put on multiple teams based on their functional areas and current projects, maximizing creativity, idea flow, teamwork, and collab-
oration. A matrix structure also allows for some degree of standardized policies and procedures by maintaining functional areas,
such as finance.
Because a matrix organizational structure supports creativity and collaboration, it nurtures new leaders. Because employees report
to two managers, one in their functional area and one leading their current project, it is essential that these leaders communicate
well and offer congruent guidance to the employees. This can be a disadvantage of the matrix organizational structure if this con-
gruence of guidance is weak or falls apart.
A matrix structure is most common in large companies that engage in creative and collaborative project-based work.
                        13. IMPLEMENT STRATEGY | 355

Boundaryless Structure

A boundaryless organizational structure is flat, with decentralized decision-making and many cross-functional teams. This struc-
ture works well in knowledge industries such as IT, where responsiveness to changing environmental and competitive forces must
be quick.

Advantages of a boundaryless organizational structure include its quick responsiveness and its ability to share knowledge widely
and foster innovation. A disadvantage of a boundaryless organizational structure is the lack of clear lines of accountability.

                                  Figure 13.6: Boundaryless organizational structure

While mature organizations normally do not fundamentally change their organizational structures (except for a business restruc-
turing), the right choice of organizational design is critical for smaller and startup companies. As a smaller organization grows, it is
also possible that the company may change organizational structures, for example, from a functional to a multidivisional structure.

Other important organizational elements of strategy implementation include an overarching and unifying company purpose, the
definition of clear roles and responsibilities of organizational units, clearly defined interfaces between the units, an appropriate
span of control, and STRAPs that prevent silo thinking and a lack of cooperation in the different units.

Some organizations use the RASCI matrix to define clear roles and responsibilities and avoid a poor interface between different
strategic business units, business support functions, and other organizational units.

The RASCI matrix is a responsibility assignment matrix that describes the participation of various roles in completing tasks or
deliverables for a project or business process. The RASCI acronym stands for responsible, accountable, supportive, consulted, and
informed. The matrix assigns specific roles and responsibilities to stakeholders involved in the management process and strat-
egy implementation. It states in a transparent way who is ultimately responsible for a task, who is accountable, who needs to be
involved for support, who needs to be consulted, and who needs to be informed.

Determining the right span of control is another important element of organizational design. The term refers to the number of
direct reports for which a supervisor is responsible. A span of control that is too high creates management challenges because it is
hard to oversee too many direct reports in performance management and talent development. A span of control that is too narrow
creates too many supervisors with direct report relationships. This increases organizational complexity and is inefficient.

A trend in organizations is delayering, which is the reduction of hierarchical levels in a company. Removing layers of management
increases organizational efficiency and responsiveness because there are fewer levels between the organization's leadership and
the customers and other external stakeholders, which makes a business more flexible, responsive, and agile.

13.7 Implement Strategy through Organizational Control Systems

Part of strategy implementation is the effective design and use of organizational control systems, which are sets of processes and
mechanisms used to monitor and evaluate an organization's performance against set standards, allowing management to identify
deviations from strategy and take corrective actions. Organizational control systems play a critical role in successful strategy imple-
mentation by ensuring the organization stays on track to achieve its goals. Organizational control systems track performance and
identify adjustments that need to be made.

Output Control

Output control uses measurable results to track and monitor strategy implementation. This approach focuses on breaking down
strategy into strategic objectives that are formulated as SMART objectives. Output control starts with the definition of targets for
performance; it then measures the performance against these targets.
In the case of strategy implementation, these targets and objectives are the strategic targets formulated in the firm's strategy. The
primary aim is to ensure that the organization meets its goals, improves efficiency, and maximizes profitability. Establishing spe-
cific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound strategic objectives drives accountability and allows for transparent track-
ing of strategy implementation progress.
Typical strategic objectives include revenue, net profit, profit margins, market share, newly launched innovations, mergers and
acquisitions, entrance into new countries, improved brand recognition, and customer satisfaction, to name just a few. These SMART
strategic objectives are used to continuously evaluate strategy implementation performance. Performance data is compared
against set standards. This comparison helps in identifying gaps, understanding deviations, recognizing areas for improvement,
and initiating corrective action.
The benefits of output control include transparent goal alignment that ensures that all parts of the organization are aligned toward
common goals. It also drives accountability and creates a sense of responsibility for implementing strategy among employees and
management. Lastly, output control improves efficiency and resource allocation, and it enhances decision-making in the strategy
implementation process by using data-driven insights that aid in making informed business decisions.
                    13. IMPLEMENT STRATEGY | 357

Behavioral Control

As a system, behavioral control regulates activities rather than outcomes. It's about creating an environment where employees'
actions consistently reflect the company's values and objectives. The firm actively monitors and influences employee actions and
behaviors to achieve desired results through managerial oversight, detailed job descriptions, company policies, training and devel-
opment, guidelines, and performance expectations.

Supervisors and company leaders play important roles in directing employees. They lead by example, role-modeling behaviors they
want to see in the organizations and regulating how employees conduct themselves at work.

Another important element and driver of behavioral control is the corporate culture of an organization, which also has a significant
impact on employee behavior. Corporate culture is a set of shared values, expectations, and norms that guides employee behavior.
There needs to be strong alignment between corporate culture, strategic analysis, strategy formulation, and strategy implementa-
tion.

13.8 Hardwiring Strategy in the Organization and Combining Soft and Hard
Implementation Factors

Strategy implementation needs to be "hardwired" into an organization. To achieve this, key processes may need to be redesigned
and the organizational structure may need to be adjusted. Different measures of employee performance and reward structures may
need to be developed to drive new actions and behaviors on organizational and individual levels. The McKinsey 7-S model provides
a good overview of possible areas impacted by strategy implementation. The model, shown in figure 13.7, also highlights the impor-
tance of fully aligning the seven factors and their interconnectedness to achieve full success in strategy implementation.

The seven factors are structure, strategy, systems, skills, style, staff, and shared values. At the center of the model is shared value,
which considers the firm's core principles that support this strategy.

The remaining elements of the model are divided into hard Ss and soft Ss. Hard Ss are strategy, structure, and systems. As you are
familiar, strategy focuses on strategic analysis, strategy formulation, and implementation.
358 | 13. IMPLEMENT STRATEGY

Figure 13.7: McKinsey 7-S framework
Structure focuses on the organizational structure that best supports a firm's strategy implementation. For organizational structure,
the paradigm is that "structure follows strategy." For example, young and small businesses often use a functional structure. Because
functional organizational structures are best for stable environments, they are also a good choice of large firms operating with
a focused or broad cost leadership business-level strategy. For firms in knowledge industries that are based on intensive use
of technology and human capital, the organizational structure should emphasize cross-functional cooperation, and they should
avoid organizational silos that often impede successful strategy implementation due to specific interests of business units that put
their own interests above the holistic implementation of a new strategy. Thanks to shortening strategy cycles and more externally
induced change than in the past, organizational structures that allow for high levels of flexibility and agility and that are market
and customer-centric are more effective at implementing strategy than traditional structures that are rigid and siloed. Organiza-
tional silos often impede successful strategy implementation because business units may be incentivized to put their own interests
above the implementation of new strategy.
The third hard S, systems, refers to the systems a business needs to use or create for strategy implementation. Performance man-
agement is critical for successful strategy implementation, as are compensation and rewards systems. For example, knowing what
motivates employees is essential. Many employees are happy and motivated upon getting a salary increase, a positive perfor-
mance evaluation, a high bonus payment, praise, an opportunity to contribute to meaningful and high-impact work, and a sense of
belonging in an organization with similar values. Systems that offer these rewards have a high impact on shaping employee behav-
ior. It is important to reward employees for skills, competencies, and behaviors that support strategy implementation and to possi-
bly sanction behaviors that contradict the new strategy.
For example, a company with a customer-centric innovation model should reward employees who spend quality time with impor-
tant customers, who identify customers' unmet needs, and who have specific ideas for innovative solutions for these customers.
                                                                                                                                 13. IMPLEMENT STRATEGY | 359

Including skills and behaviors like this in performance reviews and rewarding successful employees drives strategy implementation
because it aligns organizational objectives with individual objectives.

The Soft Ss of the McKinsey framework are skills, staff, and style. Skills focuses on identifying the skills employees need in order
to implement strategy, some of which may need to be developed. Staff refers to supporting managers in their growth, and style
emphasizes leadership style and corporate culture that supports strategy implementation.

Successful strategy implementation is also dependent on the alignment of business support function strategies--for example,
human resource management, procurement, production, supply chain, finance--with the unit's business-level strategy. These
functions need to develop or adjust their functional strategies so that they are fully derived from and in support of the overall cor-
porate-level strategy, business-level strategy, and the strategies embedded into business-level strategies.

For the customer-centric, innovation-driven company, here are some ways that business-support functions can drive strategy imple-
mentation:

  · Human Resources: Hires, trains, and develops employees with specific skill sets to sell innovation to customers.
  · Procurement: Partners with strategic suppliers that can support the company's innovation strategy. Selection criteria for sup-

      pliers are focused on strategic alignment, inclusion in innovation process, and reliable supply rather than just focusing on low-
      est price.
  · Finance: Develops financial metrics and balanced scorecard that reflects the innovation-driven business model. Focus on ROI
      on R&D, such as percentage of sales with products newer than five years (percentage of sales of new launches), percentage of
      SG&A of sales to measure infrastructure investment in R&D, marketing, etc.

13.9 Aligning Strategy Implementation and Corporate Culture

According to management guru Peter Drucker, even the best strategy fails if it  "Culture eats strategy for breakfast."
contradicts the organization's culture. For example, if a highly hierarchical,  --Peter Drucker (management consultant)
bureaucratic, and internally focused company wanted to implement a cus-
tomer-centric innovation model, this strategy would most likely fail. To this
point, employees have adhered to long-standing values that do not support
agile, entrepreneurial, and customer-centric thinking. Being customer-centric
and agile is just not in the company DNA.
360 | 13. IMPLEMENT STRATEGY

Among other things, corporate culture focuses on "the way things are done around here." Corporate culture defines the rules of the
game and the values, beliefs, assumptions, and norms that govern how members behave. This has implications for both successful
and unsuccessful strategy implementation. If the strategy calls for new behaviors that are not supported by the corporate culture in
the organizational DNA, strategy implementation fails and the culture lives on.

There are some important points to keep in mind when embedding strategy implementation into organizational culture.

  · Strategy drives focus and direction, while culture is the emotional, organic habitat in which a company's strategy lives or dies.
  · Strategy is just the headline on the company's story. Culture needs a clearly understood common language to embrace and

      tell the story that includes mission, purpose, vision, values, and clear expectations.
  · Strategy is about intent and ingenuity, and culture determines desire, engagement, and implementation.
  · Strategy lays down the rules for playing the game, and culture fuels the spirit for how the game will be played.
  · Strategy is imperative for strategy differentiation, but a vibrant culture delivers the strategic advantage.
  · When culture embraces strategy, implementation is scalable, repeatable, and sustainable.

Before a strategy is even formulated, it is critical to understand the organization's culture as a starting point and the context in which
the strategy is brought to life. While culture can be changed over time, it is important to work with the current culture. Ignoring or
fighting the current culture leads to resistance and a high probability of failed strategy implementation. It is better to honor the
strengths of the existing culture and to change culture as appropriate over time.

There is no perfect culture, but the right culture is the one that supports an organization in reaching its specific vision and imple-
menting its strategy in a given organizational and market context. The right corporate culture supports the organization's strategy
and services the organization's mission, purpose, vision, and values. An organization needs to be intentional about its culture and
ensure it is aligned with strategy.

While there is no perfect culture, an adaptive culture provides a great context for successful strategy implementation. Harvard Busi-
ness School professor and author John Kotter identifies adaptive cultures as having these characteristics:

  · Ensures information flows are unobstructed from all areas and across silos
  · Encourages smart risks
  · Cares deeply about customers, shareholders, and employees
  · Strongly values people and processes that can create useful change
  · Encourages leadership from more people
  · Encourages culture through actions, such as rewarding testing and learning, including the voices of all stakeholders in evalu-

      ating success, and allowing for more dispersed decision-making.

Strategy and culture need to match. If they are not aligned, culture always trumps strategy.

13.10 Strategy Implementation through Systematic Change Management

New strategy normally calls for doing things differently, whether that entails a new business model, globalization, new markets
and/or new products, restructuring, strategic partnerships and M&A activities, or new ways to respond to new competitors and new
customer needs. In an increasingly global and dynamic market environment, strategy life cycles are shorter. This means that change
is the new normal and that strategy needs to respond swiftly to changed market conditions, regulation, and other drivers for a new
or adjusted strategy.

Living in the age of disruption, continuous and accelerated change is often met with employee resistance and change fatigue, which
becomes a serious barrier to successful strategy implementation. Employees may not see the value of all the change. They may have
the tendency to value the known and prefer their comfort zones, and they may not easily embrace change just because there is a
new strategy. Often strategy implementation is enthusiastically driven by top management but reaches a sudden halt when mid-
management does not buy in and when the new strategy meets passive or even active employee resistance.

Seventy percent of all change initiatives fail, which is an alarming statistic for anyone implementing new strategies. However, there
are several systematic approaches available that significantly increase the probability of successful change and strategy implemen-
tation. This is where strategy implementation meets systematic change management, which guides an organization in assessing
change readiness and implementing change.

Kotter's 8-step model for successful organizational change is a great approach for implementing strategy successfully. Different
employees travel at different speeds on their own individual change journeys, and there needs to be a clear answer to the employee
question of "What's in it for me?" Kotter's model has been updated over time but remains a widely used framework for effective
change management.
362 | 13. IMPLEMENT STRATEGY

Kotter's 8-step change model includes three phases and eight
steps.

· Phase 1: Create the climate for change
      Step 1 Create urgency
      Step 2 Form a powerful coalition
      Step 3 Create a vision for change

· Phase 2: Engage and enable the organization
      Step 4 Communicate the vision
      Step 5 Empower action
      Step 6 Create quick wins

· Phase 3: Implement and sustain the change
      Step 7 Build on the change
      Step 8 Make it stick

Following a systematic approach to change management like             Figure 13.8: Using Kotter's change management model to implement
Kotter's model significantly increases the probability of success-    strategy
ful strategy implementation. The model begins by creating a
sense of urgency for the new strategy. A powerful guiding coali-
tion in support of the new strategy is needed to gain the hierarchi-
cal momentum and critical mass needed to make the new
strategy a reality. Beyond communicating facts, it is important to
reach employees' hearts and minds. Leadership needs to develop
an emotionally compelling story that resonates with employees
from different hierarchical levels so that employees understand
why the strategy is good for the organization and employees.
Employees need to be convinced that the new strategy leads to
greener pastures on the other side of the strategy implementa-
tion process.

After that, the new strategy needs to be communicated and implemented. Planning and celebrating quick wins delivered by the
strategy convinces employees and stakeholders that the new strategy works, and this drives continued support for the implemen-
tation process.

Finally, it is important that new behaviors and new processes laid out in the new strategy become a habit and part of the new corpo-
rate culture. The change induced by the new strategy needs to be sustained, and leaders need to reinforce the new strategy to make
it stick in the organization.

Application

    · Put yourself in the shoes of an employee who is expected to implement a new strategy in your functional or business support
        unit.

             What information, communication, and support do you expect from your direct supervisor and your company lead-
                ership for you to be willing to fully embrace and implement the new strategy?

13.11 Why Strategy Implementation Is Important to Business Graduates

Sooner than you think, many of you will become part of a strategy formulation team. This could be on the level of corporate strategy
for a smaller firm, on the level of functional strategy (like IT, finance, procurement, HR, etc.), or on the level of a division or strategic
business unit. Companies are increasingly involving managers from all levels of the organization, which means that you can easily
be a member of a strategy formulation or strategy implementation team. Additionally, your career success depends on your ability
to understand and implement corporate-level strategy, business-level strategy (and its embedded strategies), and functional-level
strategy in your position on a daily basis. You need to embrace strategy, implement strategy, and bring it to life through its imple-
mentation. You need to translate strategy to operative actions that add value to the company to drive superior performance. Know-
ing best practices of strategy formulation and implementation guides your ability to stand out as a manager who links strategy to
specific action in your organizational unit, which is a core competency valued and rewarded by the business leaders to which you
report.

13.12 Conclusion

It is easy to dedicate a lot of time and energy to strategy formulation while underestimating the barriers to successful strategy
implementation. The real work of strategy implementation starts after a meaningful, differentiating, and robust strategy has been
formulated. To avoid becoming one of the companies that do not fully reap the benefits of a new strategy, the good practices shown
in the table below should be implemented.

APPENDIX 2: PESTEL ANALYSIS INSTRUMENT

Identify the industry, market, and market segment.

 1. Identify the industry, market, and market segment under analysis.
 2. Place this in the instrument.

Analyze data about the general environment.

Analysis is the process and result of examining all the data available for the case and identifying and classifying all the data for each
category in a strategic management tool.

 1. Methodically and thoroughly examine all the data available from the case about the general environment in relation to each
      PESTEL factor: political, economic, sociocultural, technological, environmental, and legal.

 2. Identify and classify all the data for the general environment that relates to each PESTEL factor.
       a. The data needs to be specific to the case. (For example: "Governmental regulation of the [industry name] between [date 1
            and date 2] results in [the specific impact].")
       b. The data cannot be too broad. (For example: "Governmental regulation impacts profit" is too broad.)

 3. Place the analysis in the instrument below in the section titled "Analysis."

Interpret the analysis.

Interpretation is the process and result of examining the analysis to identify and explain relationships in the analysis and underly-
ing root causes of the situation. Interpretation is not found in the case or company research. Interpretation applies critical thinking
to the analysis conducted so far. Answer only those questions that add value to the overall process of working with the PESTEL to
analyze the general environment. Interpretation begins to narrow the focus.

Analyze data about the industry environment.

Analysis is the process and result of examining all the data available for the firm and identifying and classifying all the data for each
category in a strategic management framework.

 1. Identify data in the case or from company research that corresponds to each force in the Porter's Five Forces analysis: bargain-
      ing power of suppliers, bargaining power of buyers, threat of substitute products, threat of new entrants, and rivalry among
      existing competitors.
       a. The data needs to be specific to the case.
              i. For example: "The threat of [specific supplier] is high because [specific reason it is high]."
       b. The data needs to avoid being too broad.
              i. At this stage, avoid "The threat of suppliers is high." You will analyze the strength of each force next.

Analysis is the process and result of examining all the data available for the case and identifying and classifying all the data for each
category in a strategic management framework.

Create a strategic map.

 1. Identify the most important dimensions that characterize the strategic groups. These are company commitments that are
      both difficult and costly to reverse, including but not limited to research and development investment, the use of technology
      and technology innovation, product differentiation, distribution channels, and even customer service. This varies by industry.

 2. From this list of the most important dimensions that characterize the strategic groups, choose two dimensions.
 3. Map these two dimensions. Use the x-axis (horizontal) for one dimension, with low on the left and high on the right. Use the

      y-axis (vertical) for the other dimension, with low at the bottom and high at the top. Price and product line are dimensions that
      are commonly paired on x- and y-axes.
 4. Graph the firms in the strategic group considering these two dimensions using bubbles.

Analyze data about the internal environment of the firm.

Analysis is the process and result of examining all the data available for the case and identifying and classifying all the data for each
category in a strategic management framework.

 1. Methodically and thoroughly examine all the data available from the case about the internal environment.
 2. Identify firm-specific primary and support activities that make the firm unique and that have the potential to provide a com-

      petitive advantage or competitive disadvantage.
 3. Place them in the instrument below in the lefthand column titled "Value chain activities."
 4. Analyze whether each firm-specific activity is a strength that may provide a competitive advantage or a weakness that may

      lead to a competitive disadvantage.
 5. For each activity, analyze and state the reasons why it is a strength or weakness for the firm. Please note that it is possible that

      there are different specific activities within one area of a primary or support activity that can be a strength and a weakness. For
      example, within the procurement activity, a strong buying power can be a strength for a firm, whereas the use of technology in
      procurement or partnerships with key suppliers may be a weakness. An example for the human resource management activ-
      ity could be that the firm is great at attracting new talent, which is a key strength; however, the firm may perform poorly at
      retaining diverse talent, which would be a weakness. Hence, it is important to analyze specific elements of the business func-
      tion/activity to come to a value-adding assessment of the firm's strengths and weaknesses.
